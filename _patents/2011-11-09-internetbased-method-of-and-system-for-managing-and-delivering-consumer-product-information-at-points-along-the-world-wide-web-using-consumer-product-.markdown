title: Internet-based method of and system for managing and delivering consumer product information at points along the world wide web using consumer product information (CPI) requesting and graphical user interface (GUI) displaying subsystems driven by server-side objects and managed by consumer product manufacturers and/or authorized parties
abstract: Method of and system for delivering consumer product related information to consumers over the Internet. The system and method involves creating a Consumer Product Information (CPIR) enabling object for each consumer service registered within a service-provider managed database management system. The HTML tag associated with each CPIR-enabling object is encapsulated within an executable file and then stored in the database management system. Each CPIR-enabling object is searchable and its HTML tag downloadable and then embedded within an HTML-encoded document. Upon encountering the HTML document, the underlying CPIR-enabling object is automatically executed on an object-oriented server, causing a service-directed search to be performed against the database management system, and the results thereof, from one or more Web-based product information servers, displayed in an independent GUI, without disturbing the consumer's point of presence on the WWW.

Field of Invention","The present invention generally relates to a novel system and method for collecting consumer-product related information and transmitting and delivering the same along the consumer-product supply and demand chain using the International Information Infrastructure (e.g. the Internet), and more particularly to a novel system and method for delivering consumer product related information to consumers within retail environments using Internet-based information servers and sales agents.","2. Brief Description of the Prior Art","Dissemination of consumer-product information between manufacturers and their retail trading partners must be accurate and timely. The traditional methods of phone calls and faxes are time consuming and resource intensive. An electronic Universal Product Code (UPC) Catalog (i.e. database system), accessible 24 hours a day, is a solution. In 1988, QuickResponse Services (QRS), Inc. Of Richmond, Calif., introduced the first independent product information database, using the retail industry standard UPC numbering system. Today the QRSolutions\u2122 Catalog contains information on over 52 million products from over 1500 manufacturers. The QRSolutions Catalog is a Windows-based application providing a critical information flow link between the retailers and the manufacturers along the supply and demand chain.","After assigning a UPC number to each item, the manufacturer organizes and sends the data via an electronic data interchange (i.e. EDI) transmission, or a tape, to QRS, Inc. to be loaded into the UPC Catalog database. Changes to the data can be made on a daily basis. Retailers with access to a manufacturer's data can view and download the data once it has been added or updated. Automatic update capabilities ensure the most recent UPC data will be in the EDI mailbox of each retail customer quickly.","The effect of a centralized database such as QRS's UPC Catalog improves the flow of merchandise from the manufacturer to the retailer's selling floor and ultimately to the consumer. With the UPC Catalog, accurate, up-to-date product information is available when the retailer needs it, eliminating weeks from the order cycle time.","In addition to the electronic UPC-based product information subsystem (i.e. UPC Catalog) described above, a number of other information subsystems have been developed for the purpose of providing solutions to problems relating to electronic commerce (EC) merchandising and logistics within the global supply chain. Such ancillary information subsystems include, for example: (i) Sales, Analysis and Forecasting Subsystems for producing and providing retailers with information about what products consumers are buying; (ii) Collaborative Replenishment Subsystems for determining what products retailers can buy in order to satisfy consumer demand at any given point of time; and (iii) Transportation and Logistics Information Subsystems for producing and providing retailers with information about when products purchased by them (at wholesale) will be delivered to their stores. Typically, such information subsystems are connected to various value added information networks in order to efficiently offer such information services to retailers on a global basis.","While the above-described information systems collectively cooperate to optimize the process of moving raw materials into finished products and into the hands of consumers, such information systems fail to address the information needs of the consumers of retail products who require and desire product-related information prior to, as well as after, the purchase of consumer-products. Moreover, prior art demand chain management systems operate in an open-loop mode with a \u201cbreak\u201d in information flow cycle, disabling the manufacturers from communicating with the consumers in an efficient manner to satisfy consumer needs.","Presently, an enormous amount of time, money and effort is being expended by companies in order to advertise and sell their products and services, and to provide product related information, product warranty service and the like after product purchase has taken place. Various types of media for decades have been used to realize such fundamental business functions.","In recent times, there have been a number of significant developments in connection with the global information network called the \u201cInternet\u201d, which has greatly influenced many companies to create multi-media Internet Web-sites in order to advertise, sell and maintain their products and services. Examples of such developments include, for example: the World Wide Web (WWW) based on the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the Hypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) by Tim Berners-Lee, et al. (See \u201cWorld-Wide Web: The Information Universe\u201d by Tim Berners-Lee, et al; easy to use Java GUI-based Internet navigation tools, such as the Netscape\u00ae browser from Netscape Communications, Inc., the Internet Explorer\u2122 browser from MicroSoft Corporation and the Mosaic\u2122 browser from Spyglass Corporation; and the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) by Mark Pecse. Such developments in recent times have made it very easy for businesses to create 2-D Hypermedia-based Home Pages and 3-D VR Worlds (i.e. 3-D Web-sites) for the purpose of projecting a desired \u201ccorporate image\u201d and providing a backdrop for financial investment solicitation, as well as product advertising, sales and maintenance operations.","Presently, a person desiring to acquire information about any particular product has a number of available search options. In particular, he or she may attempt to directly contact the manufacturer, wholesaler or reseller by telephone, US mail, e-mail, or through the company's World Wide Web (WWW) site, if they have one. In the event one decides to acquire product information through the seller's WWW site, he or she must first determine the location of its WWW site (i.e. Internet address) which oftentimes can involve using Internet Search engines such as Yahoo\u00ae, AltaVista\u2122, WebCrawler\u2122, Lycos\u2122, Excite\u2122, or the like. This can be a very time consuming process and can sometimes lead to a dead end. Once the Internet address is obtained, one must then review the home page of the company's Web-site in order to find where information about a particular product resides on the Website, if it so exists. This search process can be both time consuming and expensive (in terms of Internet time) and may not turn up desired information on the product of interest.","In some instances, product brochures bear a preprinted Internet address designed to direct or point prospective customers to a particular Web-site where more detailed product information can be found. A recent example of this \u201cpreprinted Web Address\u201d pointing technique is the 1996 product brochure published by the Sony Corporation for its Sony\u00ae PCV-70 Personal Computer, which refers prospective customers to the Sony Web Address \u201chttp:\/\/www.sony.com\/pc\u201d. While this approach provides a direct way of finding product related information on the Internet, it is not without its shortcomings and drawbacks.","In particular, when a company improves, changes or modifies an existing Web-site which publishes product and\/or service advertisements and related information, it is difficult (if not impossible) not to change the Internet locations (e.g. Web addresses) at which such product and\/or service advertisements and related information appear. Whenever a company decides or is forced to change any of its advertising, marketing and\/or public relations firms, there is a substantial likelihood that new Web-sites will be created and launched for particular products and services, and that the Web addresses of such new Web-sites will no longer correspond with the Web addresses on preprinted product brochures currently in circulation at the time. This can result in pointing a consumer to erroneous or vacant Web-sites, that present either old or otherwise outdated product and\/or service information, possibly adversely influencing the consumer's purchasing decision.","Moreover, when a company launches a new Web-site as part of a new advertising and marketing campaign for a particular product, any preprinted advertising or marketing material relating to such products will not reflect the new Web-site addresses which the campaign is promoting. This fact about preprinted advertising media renders it difficult to unify new and old advertising media currently in circulation into an advertising and marketing campaign having a coherent theme. In short, the inherently static nature of the \u201cpreprinted Web address\u201d pointing technique described above is wholly incapable of adjusting to the dynamic needs of advertising, marketing and public relations firms alike.","Recently, two different methods have been proposed for providing product information to consumers over the Internet.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,640,193 to Wellner discloses a system and method for accessing and displaying Web-based consumer product related information to consumers using an Internet-enabled computer system, whereby in response to reading a URL-encoded bar code symbol on, or associated with a product, the information resource specified by the URL is automatically accessed and displayed on the Internet-enabled computer system. While this system and method enables access of consumer product information related information resources on the WWW by reading URL-encoded bar code symbols, it requires that custom URL-encoded bar code symbols be created and applied to each and every consumer product in the stream of commerce.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,773 to Hudetz, et al discloses a solution to the problem presented by the system and method of U.S. Pat. No. 5,640,193, by proposing the use of a UPC\/URL database in order to translate UPC numbers read from consumer products by a bar code scanner, into the URLs of published information resources on the WWW relating to the UPC-labeled consumer product.","While U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,773 provides an effective solution to the problem presented by U.S. Pat. No. 5,640,193, it completely fails to recognize or otherwise address the myriad of problems relating to UPC\/URL-link collection, management, delivery, access and display along the retail supply and demand chain, which the system and method of U.S. Pat. No. 5,978,773 presents and must be first solved in order to deliver a technically feasible, globally-extensive, UPC-driven consumer product information system for the benefit of consumers worldwide.","Thus, it is clear that there is great need in the art for an improved Internet-based method of and system for delivering product related information to the consumers along the entire retail supply and demand chain, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art systems and methodologies.","Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a novel method and apparatus for collecting product-related information and transmitting and delivering the same between the manufacturers and retailers of products to the consumers thereof in retail shopping environments as well as at home, work and on the road, while overcoming the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art systems and methodologies.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such an apparatus in the form of a novel consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system with an Internet-based product information database subsystem which, for each commercially available consumer-product, stores a number of information elements including: the name of the manufacturer; the Universal Product Code (UPC) assigned to the product by the manufacturer; one or more URLs specifying the location of information resources (e.g. Web-pages) on the Internet relating to the UPC-labeled consumer-product; and the like.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system, in which the URLs stored in the Internet-based product information database are categorically arranged and displayed according to specific types of product information (e.g., product specifications and operation manuals; product wholesalers and retailers; product advertisements and promotions; product endorsements; product updates and reviews; product warranty\/servicing; related or complementary products; product incentives including rebates, discounts and\/or coupons; etc.) that relate to the kind of information required, desired or otherwise sought by consumers, wholesalers, retailers and\/or trading partners; product prices at which the products are being offered for sale by a particular retailer; and the like.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system, wherein the information maintained within the Internet-based product information database management subsystem provides a manufacturer-defined consumer-product directory that can be used by various persons along the retail supply and demand chain.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system, wherein the manufacturers of consumer-products are linked to the retailers thereof in the middle of the supply and demand chain by allowing either trading partner access to consumer-product information from the Internet-based product information database virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system, wherein consumer-product manufacturers, their advertisers, distributors and retailers are linked to the consumers of such products at the end of the supply and demand chain, by allowing such parties access to consumer-product information from the Internet-based product information database subsystem virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel system and method for finding and serving consumer-product related information on the Internet.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel method of carrying out electronic-type commercial transactions involving the purchase of products which are advertised on the Internet at uniform resource locations (URLs) that are registered with the IPI system of the

user interfaces (GUIs) for the convenience of consumers shopping at electronic-commerce (EC) enabled stores, considering the placement of bids at on-line auction sites, or browsing product advertisements appearing on the World Wide Web.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an Internet-based consumer product information collection, management and delivery system and method, wherein for each consumer product registered within the UPN\/URL database of the system, an interactive consumer product information request (CPIR) enabling Applet (e.g. based on Java\u2122 component principles or MicroSoft's Active-X technology) is created and stored which, when executed upon the initiation of the consumer through a mouse-clicking operation, automatically causes a preassigned CPID-enabling Java GUI to be displayed at the consumer's point of presence in Cyberspace, revealing the results of a consumer product information display conducted upon the product identified by the UPN encoded within the executed Applet.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such an Internet-based consumer product information collection, management and delivery system and method, wherein (1) the UPN assigned to a particular consumer product by the manufacturer and (2) the URL of the Java script running on the IPD server of the system are encoded

Collaborative Replenishment Information Subsystem  for determining what products retailers can be buying in order to satisfy consumer demand at any given point in time; a Transportation and Logistics Information Subsystem  for providing retailers with information about when ordered products (purchased by retailers at wholesale) will be delivered to the retailer's stores; and Input\/Output Port Connecting Subsystems  for interconnecting the input and output ports of the above-identified subsystems through the infrastructure of the Internet and various value-added EDI networks of global extent. Notably, unlike prior art supply chain management systems, the consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system of the present invention embraces the manufacturers, retailers, and consumers of UPC-encoded products, and not simply the manufacturers and retailers thereof. As will become apparent hereinafter, this important feature of the present invention allows manufacturers and retailers to deliver valuable product related information to the consumers of their products, thereby increasing consumer purchases, consumer satisfaction and consumer loyalty. Prior art supply chain management systems have no way or means of providing such information services to the consumers of UPC-encoded products along the consumer-product supply and demand chain.","As shown in  and -, the consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system of  is realized as an arrangement of system components, namely: a central UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  for storing and serving various types of consumer-product information to retailers, manufacturers and consumers alike (e.g., the name of the product's manufacturer; the Universal Product Code (UPC) or European Article Number (EAN) assigned to the product by the manufacturer; one or more URLs specifying the location of information resources on the Internet at which particular kinds of information relating to the consumer-product can be found; merchandise classification; style number; tradename; information specifying the size, color and other relevant characteristics of the consumer-product, where applicable; ordering criteria; availability and booking dates, etc.); a globally-based (packet-switched) digital telecommunications network (such as the Internet)  having an infrastructure including Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Network Service Providers (NSPs), routers, telecommunication lines, channels, etc., for supporting packet-switched type digital data telecommunications using the TCP\/IP networking protocol well known in the art; one or more Internet Product Finding Directory (IPD) Servers, each indicated by reference numeral  and being connected to the Internet at strategically different locations via the Internet infrastructure  and data-synchronized with each other in order that each such Server maintains a mirrored relational-type database structure as represented in ; a plurality of Internet Product-Information (IPI) Servers, each indicated by reference numeral  and being connected to the Internet via the Internet infrastructure; a plurality of retailer-related electronic-commerce (EC) information servers A, each operably connected to the infrastructure of the Internet, and enabling the hosting of one or more EC-enabled stores or EC-enabled on-line catalogues (i.e. EC-enabled WWW sites) owned, operated, managed and\/or leased by one or more retailers along the retail supply and demand chain; a plurality of manufacturer-related electronic-commerce (EC) information servers B, each operably connected to the infrastructure of the Internet, and enabling the hosting of one or more EC-enabled stores or EC-enabled on-line catalogues (i.e. EC-enabled WWW sites) owned, operated, managed and\/or leased by one or more manufacturers along the retail supply and demand chain; a plurality of User (or Client) Computers, each indicated by reference numeral , being connected to the Internet via the Internet infrastructure and available to consumers (C, C, C, . . . , C); one or more data communication (i.e. EDI) networks , comprising data collection nodes  and communication links , operably connected to the centralized UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , each Client Computer  available to a Manufacturer (M, M, M, . . . , M) and Retailer (R, R, R, . . . , R) within the retail supply and demand chain; a Web-based Document Server  connected to at least one of the IPD Servers  and the Internet infrastructure, for transferring documents and messages to remote Client Computer Systems during the registration of manufacturers and consumer products with the system hereof and periodically updating product-related information with the IPD Servers  in an automatic manner; and a Web-based Document Administration Computer  connected to the Web-based Document Server  by way of a TCP\/IP connection , for administrating the registration of manufacturers and products with the system, initiating the transfer of consumer product related information (e.g. menu of URLs) between the remote Client Computer Systems and Web-Based Document Server , transferring such information to the IPD Servers , and maintaining local records of such information transfers and the like. As will become apparent hereinafter, Web-based Document Server  and Web-based Document Administration Computer  provide a subsystem for (i) managing the process of registering qualified manufacturers and their consumer products and related Web pages (e.g. UPC numbers and URLs), and (ii) updating the product-related information with the IPD Servers  in an automatic manner to ensure accurate links between UPNs and URLs within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem. The subsystem comprising the Web-based Document Server  and Web-based Document Administration Computer  shall be referred to as the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem of the consumer product information finding and delivery subsystem  and indicated by reference numeral  throughout the figure drawings hereof.","Preferably, the centralized UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  and at least one of the IPD Servers  are located at a secured information storage\/processing center , along with a multiprocessor (or mainframe) computer system, information servers, routers, data communication lines, disk storage devices (e.g. RAIDs), tape drives and tape-library system, uninterrupted power supplies (UPS), and other peripheral technology to provide on-line, batch and back-up operations. However, the IPI Servers, the Client Computers and the other IPD Servers (if provided for database mirroring purposes), typically will be located throughout the world, as the distribution of manufacturers, retailers and consumers who are encouraged to use the system is scattered across the Planet.","In the illustrative embodiment, the Web-based Document Server  is a Windows NT Server running WebDox\u2122 Server software from Premenos Corporation of Concord, Calif. The Windows NT Server can be realized using a suitable computer system having a Pentium\u00ae or higher CPU, 64 MB of RAM or higher, running (i) Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or higher Operating System software from Microsoft Corporation, (ii) Microsoft Internet Information Server 2.0 or higher from Microsoft Corporation, and (iii) Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or higher software from Microsoft Corporation. Also, the WebDox\u2122 Server is provided with a dedicated Internet connection (i.e. ISDN or better) to the Internet infrastructure .","The EDI administration computer  is either a Windows 95 or Windows NT Computer system running WebDox Admin\u2122 software from Premenos Corporation of Concord, Calif. The Windows 95 or Windows NT computer system  can be realized using a suitable computer system having an Intel 486 or higher CPU, 12 MB of RAM or higher, running Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 or higher, and having a TCP\/IP connection  to the WebDox\u2122 Server .","In order to use the WebDox\u2122 system, each remote Client Computer System  includes either a Windows 95 or Windows NT Computer system running WebDox Remote\u2122 software from Premenos Corporation of Concord, Calif.

The function of the Web-based Document Server , Web-based Administration System  and remote client subsystems  running the Premenos\u00ae WebDox Remote\u2122 software is to provide a Web-based Document Transport System for automatically transferring information (e.g. UPN\/URLs) from manufacturers to the IPD Servers of the system in order to periodically update the same. While the illustrative embodiment of this Web-based Document Transport System has been described in terms of its implementation using the WebDox\u2122 system from Premenos, it is understood that other commercially available electronic document transport systems (e.g. COMMERCE:FORMS\u2122 Electronic Business Forms Package from Sterling Commerce, Inc., http:\/\/www.stercomm.com) can be used to carry out this subsystem. The operation of this Web-Based Document Transport System will be described in detail hereinafter with respect to the collection and delivery of consumer product-related information to the IPDs hereof.","The major subsystem components comprising the consumer-product information collection, transmission and delivery system of the present invention will be described in greater detail below.","In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the UPC Product-Information Subsystem  is realized using the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  and data communication networks  shown in  and -.

Hereinafter, UPN-driven CPI GUIs provided within physical retail shopping environments will be referred to as \u201cphysical\u201d or \u201cphysically-based\u201d UPN-driven CPI kiosks, whereas UPN-driven CPI GUIs provided within \u201cE-commerce\u201d enabled retail shopping environments will be referred to as \u201ccyber\u201d UPN-driven CPI kiosks, despite the fact that these devices may provide substantially the same type of consumer product information services to consumers, retailers and manufacturers along the retail supply and demand chain.","Physically-based UPN-driven CPI consumer product information kiosks will have great utility in physical retail shopping environments. However, such subsystems will be of little value to consumers browsing the Internet and shopping at EC-enabled WWW sites, unless the consumers are located in \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d type retail stores wherein consumers are provided with the option of shopping and conducting e-commerce transactions therein for all or selected items of merchandise offered for sale by the retailer. Moreover, when shopping in any particular retailer's EC-oriented store, however realized, it is also understood that great efforts must be undertaken to ensure that the shopper does not leave the EC-oriented store prior to making a purchase at the checkout page of the EC-oriented WWW site. Requiring, prompting or otherwise encouraging a shopper to link over to the IPD WWW site hereof (e.g. hosted on the IPD information server) for desired consumer product related information oftentimes presents a great risk that the shopper will not return to the EC-oriented store, at which he or she was once visiting, but rather will visit another EC-oriented store to make the product purchase.","The above limitations of physically-based consumer product information kiosks and the risks associated with consumer behavior while shopping on the Internet are overcome by the UPN-based cyber kiosks of the present invention. The primary function of UPN-based cyber CPI kiosks is to provide consumers with a simple and effective way of, and means for, producing UPN-driven CPI graphical user interfaces (GUIs) at the consumer's point of presence (POP) which may exist, for example, when: (i) shopping at EC-enabled stores, product catalogs and other types of EC-oriented WWW sites; (ii) reviewing and responding to Internet-based product advertisements (including Web-based discount coupons and the like) published at selected sections of Web-documents served from diverse types of WWW sites hosted on the millions of Internet information servers connected to the infrastructure of the Internet; and\/or (iii) encountering a Web-document addressing a particular consumer product under review, analysis or other form of observation where accurate consumer product related information is desired or required by the consumer, whomever they might be. The details of producing UPN-enabled CPI GUIs in both physical and cyber retail environments will be described hereinafter.","As shown in , each synchronized IPD Server  is interfaced with an ISP A in a conventional manner. The actual number of IPD Servers  used in any particular application will depend on various factors including, for example, user demand, Internet traffic conditions, network router capacity and performance, etc. Each such IPD Server  is assigned a static IP address and a common domain name on the Internet according to the Domain Name System (DNS) well known in the art. Data synchronization among such databases can be achieved using conventional data synchronization techniques well known in the art. In addition, a backup and mirroring program can be used to maintain data security. Preferably, the synchronized IPD Servers are maintained by a team of network managers under the supervision of one or more webmasters.","Using presently known technology available for use on the WWW, there are different ways of configuring IPD Server  and back-end UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  of the illustrative embodiment. A preferred subsystem architecture is schematically depicted in FIG. B.","While client-side Applets (\u201cApplets\u201d) have their <APPLET> HMTL tags embedded within HTML documents (e.g. using the HTML 3.2 Specification), and are executed with Java-enabled browsers on the client-side of the information network, the server-side Applets (\u201cServlets\u201d) employed in the system architecture set forth in FIG. B have their <SERVLET> HMTL tags embedded within HTML documents (e.g. the HTML 3.2 Specification), and are executed within Java-enabled Web servers on the server-side of the information network. Collectively, client-side Applets and server-side Applets shall be referred to as \u201cApplets\u201d, wherein the major distinction between these two types is based on where the Applet is executed on the network (i.e. client-side or server side).","The IPD Server  performs a number of basic functions, for example: (1) serving HTML-encoded documents associated with IPD Web-sites to client subsystems  on the Internet so as to enable the six primary modes of operation of the consumer product information finding and delivery subsystem hereof including, but not limited to, access to consumer product related information stored within the IPI and Non-IPI Registrant Databases on the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem ; as well as (2) serving Libraries of executable files containing \u201cUPN-enabled Java Applet tags\u201d for client-side Applets as well as server-side Applets a\/k\/a \u201cServlets\u201d, so as to enable retailers, manufacturers, advertisers, et al to download the executable \u201cApplet tag containing\u201d file to client subsystems.","According the system architecture shown in FIG. B, the UPN\/URL Database management Subsystem  is realized by a SQL-based RDBMS server , whereas the IPD server  is realized by a Java Web Server \u2032, provided with Java servlet support, and operably connected to the RDBMS server  by way of a high-speed digital transmission link known in the art. During system operation, the Java Web Server \u2032 serves to a Java-enabled client subsystem , an HTML-encoded document containing a servlet HMTL tag <SERVLET> which, upon selection by a single mouse-clicking operation by the consumer, sends an http request to the Java Web Server \u2032, invoking a prespecified UPN-encoded servlet stored therewithin, causing the CPIR-enabling servlet to execute on the server-side of the network. This causes the servlet to call and run certain predefined Java methods which carry out a UPN-specified CPI search on the RDBMS server  and return the search results to the client subsystem  for display within a predetermined GUI generated therewithin. Using this system architecture, each UPN-encoded servlet executed within the Java Web Server \u2032 will contain information relating to (1) the UPN-specified consumer product on which product information is to be searched for within the RDBMS server , (2) licensing information relating to whom the CPIR-enabling servlet has been licensed (although this architecture does not enable easy enforcement of the granted license as the servlet is executed on the server side of the network).","In the illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. B, the Java (enabled) Web Server \u2032 can be realized by, for example, the Origin 200 Server or the ODesktop Workstation from Silicon Graphics, Inc, a high-end SUN information server from Sun Microsystems, Inc., or any other suitable computing machine, running: (1) JDBC Interface software for providing a uniform access to a wide range of relational databases on RDBMS server  (if necessary in a particular application of the system hereof) and providing a common base on which higher level tools and interfaces can be built; and (2) a servlet-enabled Web (http) server software program such as the Java Web Server (JWS) 1.0 or later from JavaSoft, division of Sun Microsystems, Inc., or the JigSaw Web Server from the World Wide Web Consortium, each proving native Java support, or alternatively, the Fastrak\u2122 Web (http) server from Netscape Communications, Inc., the Internet Information Server (IIS) from the MicroSoft Corporation, the Apache HTTP Server from The Apache Software Foundation Web-site, or any other http server capable of transporting HTML-encoded documents, in conjunction with the Java Servlet Developer's Kit from JavaSoft, or the Servlet Express Tool from IBM Research Labs in Haifa, Israel, for managing servlets on Web servers lacking native Java support. In order to develop servlets, the Java Web Server \u2032 should also be equipped with the following software tools: the Sun Java Developers Kit 1.1.x from Sun Microsystems, Inc.; and the Java Servlets Development Kit (JDSK) from Sun Microsystems, Inc., or a Java Development Environment that supports JDK 1.1.x, such as VisualAge for Java by IBM, MicroSoft's Visual J++, or the like. Optionally, the Java Web Server \u2032 may also include Web-site development software (e.g. based on the HTML 3.2 or 4.0 Specification) for creating and maintaining the IPI Web-sites of the present invention, although such tools will be typically run on client subsystem  for practical reasons.","In the illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. B, each SQL-based RDBMS Server  can be realized by, for example, the Origin 200 Server from Silicon Graphics, Inc., the ODesktop Workstation from Silicon Graphics, Inc., a ULTRA\u2122 information server from Sun Microsystems, Inc., or any other suitable computing machine, running a RDBMS software program such as ORACLE 8.0 from Oracle Corporation, Sybase SQL from Sybase, Inc., Access 98 from Microsoft, or other database development programs based on a database programming language such as the SQL Language, the Sybase language, or any other suitable database language enabling database programming and connectivity over the Internet.","In principle, there can be millions of IPI Servers  within the system hereof, each enabled to serve Web-based documents containing consumer product related information.

Notably, each information item contained within the information field shown along the same horizontal line of FIG. A is related or linked.","In general, the URL stored in the URL Information Field specifies the address of an information resource on the Internet (e.g. Web), and thus may point to any one of the following types of information resources: an HTML document or file on the World Wide Web (expressed in the HyperText Markup Language); a single record in a database; the front-end of an Internet program such as Gopher; or the results of a query made using another program. In accordance with convention, the syntactic structure of each URL generally comprises: a Protocol Specifier, such as \u201chttp\u201d, \u201cftp\u201d, \u201cgopher\u201d, \u201cnews\u201d, or \u201cmail to\u201d, and specifies the type of resource that the URL is pointing (i.e. connecting) to; a Host Indicator, represented by double slashes \u201c\/\/\u201d if the URL is requesting information from a Web Server; Server Name comprising an Internet Domain Name (e.g. \u201cwww.\u201d), the address of the Web Server (e.g. \u201cibm.\u201d), and a designator (e.g. \u201ccom\u201d, \u201cedu\u201d, \u201cint\u201d, \u201cmil\u201d, \u201cnet\u201d, \u201corg\u201d, etc.) identifying who owns the server or where it is located; a Path Name, such as \u201cProducts\/Computers\/\u201d, indicating a path to the destination information file on the identified Server; and a Resource Name (including file extension, e.g. \u201c.html\u201d), such as \u201captiva.html\u201d, identifying the actual named information file that contains actual information resource specified by the URL.","As used herein as well as in the Claims to Invention, the term \u201cregistered\u201d and the variants thereof shall be understood to mean listed or having an entry within a database. Such listing or entry can be achieved in a variety of ways including, but not limited to: (i) by specific request of the associated company or business; or (ii) by the system administrator without a request and\/or authorization of the corresponding company or business linked to the product.","Notably, each information item contained within the information field shown along the same horizontal line of FIG. A is symbolically related or linked. Different products of the same registrant or related registrant may also be linked together so that a user looking for information about a particular product is automatically provided with URLs which are assigned to related products of the registrant which may satisfy the goals or objectives of a particular advertising and\/or marketing campaign or product promotion program of the registrant company. As it may be desired to relate particular products at particular points in time, the relationships therebetween can be dynamically changed within the IPI Registrant Database by a straightforward database updating operation carried out by a system administrator (or manager) who, in theory, can be located virtually anywhere in the world. Expectedly, such database updating operations would be carried out using appropriate system access and security procedures well known in the art.","Inasmuch as the UPC data structure is presently employed as a universal product identifier (i.e. a primary data structure) in a majority of industries throughout the world, its twelve-digit numeric string (for UPC Version A) or eight-digit numeric string (for UPC Version E) will be a preferred UPN (in many applications) for purposes of carrying out the principles of the present invention. This twelve (12) digit human-readable number, printed on the bottom of each UPC label (and encoded within the bars and spaces of the UPC label itself), comprises: (i) a six digit manufacturer number assigned to the manufacturer by the Uniform Code Council, Inc. (UCC) of Dayton, Ohio, and consisting of a one digit \u201cnumber system\u201d number and a five digit manufacturer code; (ii) a five digit \u201cproduct\u201d number assigned to the product by the manufacturer; and (iii) a one digit modulo check digit (mathematically calculated) and added to each UPC number to check that the code has been read correctly by the bar code symbol reader.","In order to provide the requester greater control over what information is actually displayed on its client subsystem, the URL Information Field of the IPI Database shown in FIG. A contains a number of information subfields. As shown in FIG. A, these information subfields comprise: a Product Advertisement Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to advertising and\/or promotion of the product; a Product Specification (i.e. Description) Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet, relating to specifications on the product; a Product Update Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to product updates, recalls, notices, etc; a Product Distributor (e.g. Wholesaler and\/or Resaler) Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to distribution, sale and\/or ordering of the product; a Product Warranty\/Servicing Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to warranty, extended warranty offerings, servicing and maintenance of the product; a Product Incentive Information Field (e.g. rebates, discounts and\/or coupons) for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to rebates, discounts and sales on the product; a Product Review Information Field for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to reviews, analysis, testing, inspection and\/or comparison of the product; and Miscellaneous Information Field(s) for storing information representative of URLs pointing to information on the Internet relating to miscellaneous aspects of the product (e.g., direct product sales on the WWW, product installation\/set-up and operating manuals, company reports (10Ks, annual reports, etc.), and the like. Each URL symbolically linked to a UPC-labeled product registered in the Registered IPI Database is categorized within one or more of these URL categories.","The list of URLs recordable in the IPI Registrant Database for each registered UPC-labeled product is virtually unlimited. Below are just a few examples of how the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof can be used as a virtual sales agent that provides value-added services to consumers, retailers and the like.","For each CD sound recording, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a promotional QuickTime\u00ae video recording or MP3-formatted sound recording published on the WWW for review and evaluation by the consumer. The promotional song can be by a commissioned or endorsing artist, as is typically done in conventional advertising programs. The same can be done for video recordings on tape and digital video discs (DVDs). The URL may also provide the consumer with a down-loadable trial version of the product for a limited time period.","For each computer software product, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides a demonstration of the solutions that the software product provides, as well as the functions and development tools that it enables. It may also provide the consumer with a down-loadable version of the software product for a time-limited trial period.","For electronic consumer products, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides an audio-visual demonstration of the product in various user environments. Also, the URL can contain a URL that points to a Web-based Specification Sheet that can be printed out in a retail environment, at home, at work or on the road.","For groceries and like articles, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides a QuickTime\u00ae video recording, or the like, of the product, illustrating various cooking recipes and uses for the product. Also, the URL list can contain a URL that points to a Web-based Discount Coupon that can be printed out in the store, at home or at work.","For toys, the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides an audio-visual demonstration of the toy along with promotional endorsements by the various characters used in its advertising campaign.","For clothing, garments, or accessories (e.g. wearing apparel), the URL list may contain a URL that points to a multi-media clip on the WWW that provides a QuickTime\u00ae video recording, or the like, of the clothing, garments, and\/or accessories being modeled by stunning fashion models. Ideally, such video recordings, linked to particular articles of wearing apparel by their UPC number, can be used to extend and augment the advertising campaign being carried out in other forms of media (e.g. television, radio, print, billboards, etc.).","Preferably, the manufacturer, its marketing personnel and advertising agents will actively participate in the creation of the product related information resources, as well as the placement of their URLs into the above-defined (or like) URL categories maintained within the Database of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof. Also, using the Manufacturer\/Product Registration Subsystem hereof, manufacturers and\/or their agents can easily link their UPNs (e.g. UPC and\/or EANs) with such URLs and manage the same in a dynamic manner to ensure that product related information on the Internet is accurately linked to the UPNs of the manufacturer's products. Through such active participation, the business objectives of any particular manufacturer or retailer can be promoted by way of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem of the present invention. In this way, the information requesting consumer is provided with only the kinds of product-related information which he or she seeks.","As shown in , the Non-IPI Registrant Database maintained by each IPD Server comprises a plurality of labeled information fields for each product that is not currently registered with the IPD Server, namely: an IPSN (i.e. IPN) information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the Universal Product Number (e.g. a UPC number from a UPC numbering system, or an EAN numbering system) assigned to the non-registered product; a Company Name Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the name of the company making, selling or distributing the corresponding non-registered product; a Trademark Information Field for storing information (e.g. text and\/or alphanumeric strings) representative of each trademark used in connection with the promotion, sale, distribution and\/or use of the corresponding product, and preferably registered with the USPTO or other governmental agency; a Product Description Information Field for storing information (e.g. text strings) descriptive of the corresponding product; and an E-mail Address Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of the e-mail address of the corresponding company (e.g. manufacturer) on the Internet; a Status Information Field for storing information (e.g. numeric or alphanumeric string) representative of whether the company associated non-registered product has been solicited by the IPD Server, and on what dates registration solicitation has occurred. Notably, each information item contained with the information field shown along the same horizontal line of FIG. A is related or linked. The information required to construct the Non-IPI Registrant Database shown in  can be readily obtained from a number of commercially or publicly available information sources (e.g., the Universal Code Council, Inc., Dayton, Ohio; QRS, Inc. of Richmond. Calif.; General Electric Information Services (GEIS) of Delaware, Md.; etc.).","Constructing the IPI Registrant Database within the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem Hereof","The utility of the product finding functionalities of the IPI Finding and Serving Subsystem hereof depends in large part on the number of consumer-products registered with the IPI and Non-IPI Registrant Databases supported within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof, as illustrated in FIG. B. In principle, numerous techniques may be employed separately or in combination with each other in order to construct the IPI and Non-IPI Registrant Databases of the present invention. A number of techniques will be detailed below.","According to a first database construction technique, the administrator of the IPI Registrant Database would transmit Product Registration Requests (PRRs) in the form of electronic documents to each and every manufacturer having been issued, for example, a six digit UPC Manufacturer Identification Number (MIN) by the UCC, Inc. Such electronic documents can be transmitted using conventional MIME protocols such as, for example, STMP. The Product Registration Request document would seek to ascertain from the manufacturers the various information items (including the menu of URLs) identified in the IPI Registrant Database of FIG. A. In response to the Product Registration Request, each solicited manufacturer would send back to the administrator of the IPI Registrant Database (for each of its consumer products) its UPC number and a menu of categorized URLs indicating the location of the information resources identified in the Product Registration Request document. This information can then be used to readily construct the IPI Registrant Database of the illustrative embodiment.","According to a second database construction technique, a global advertising campaign would be launched (over various media) in order to solicit the various information elements identified in the IPI Registrant Database of FIG. A and thus register the products of the manufacturers selling UPC-labeled products. Preferably, such information would be collected by way of an electronic data transfer subsystem(s) set-up to cooperate with the system of the present invention in order to facilitate database construction operations.","According to a third database construction technique, the IPI system itself would continuously solicit consumer product registrations over time in order to collect information from companies responding favorably to the solicitations. While such solicitation efforts can involve the issuance of product registration requests using various types of media, it is preferred that the information collection operations are carried out using electronic data transfer techniques (e.g. ftp, EDI or XML\/ICE) described hereinabove.","Method of Constructing UPN-Encoded Server-Side Applets and Distributing the HMTL Tags Associated therewith to Remote Client Subsystems for Embedding within HTML-Encoded Documents to be Published Over the Internet in Connection with UPN-Labeled Consumer Products","In general, for the system architecture shown in FIG. B, a server-side driven method is used to access consumer product related information (e.g. UPN\/URL links) from the RDBMS server  and display the search results within a Java-based GUI at the point of presence of the consumer using a Java-enabled client machine . In order to practice this method, it will be necessary to construct server-side UPN-encoded CPIR-enabling Applets for registered consumer products, distribute the HTML tags associated therewith to remote client subsystems, and thereafter embed these CPIR-enabling Applet tags within HTML-encoded documents for publishing over the Internet. This CPIR-enabling Applet (i.e. Servlet) construction, distribution and embedding method will now be described in detail hereinbelow.","The Servlet-Driven Method of Accessing and Displaying Categorized UPN\/URL Link Menus from the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem of the Present Invention","After providing a brief overview on the system architecture of FIG. B and the nature of the server-side CPIR-enabling Applets (i.e. Servlets) deployed therewithin. The steps associated with the Applet-driven CPI-acquisition method of the first illustrative embodiment will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. E, E, F and F.","In general, the method of FIGS. E and E involves using a server-side CPIR-enabling Applet (i.e. Servlet) to automatically conduct a UPN-directed search on the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof (i.e. RDBMS server ) in response to a single mouse-clicking operation by the consumer on the HTML tag associated with the server-side Applet. In the illustrative embodiment, the CPIR-enabling servlet of the present invention is a program written in the Java\u2122 programming language and has an HTML tag (indicated by <SERVLET>) which is designed to be included in an HTML page, much in the same way an image can be included therewithin (according to the HTML 3.2 Specification).","CPIR-enabling servlets of the present invention are designed to work within a request\/response processing model, as shown in FIG. B. In this request\/response model, a client subsystem  sends a request message to the Java Web Server \u2032 and the Server \u2032 responds by sending back a reply message. In the illustrative embodiment, requests come in the form of http, although is understood that the use of other protocols such as ftp, EDI or a custom protocol, may be possible in particular embodiments. The request and the corresponding response reflect the state of the client and the server at the time of the request.","When using a Java-enabled browser to view a Web page containing a server-side CPIR-enabling Applet tag <SERVLET>, the servlet's compiled class code is automatically accessed from the Java Web Server \u2032 and executed on the server-side of the network connection illustrated in FIG. B. Thus, as shown in FIG. B, the Java Web Server \u2032 must provide a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for running\/executing Java servlets on the server-side of the network in much the same way that a client browser must provide a JVM for running Java Applets on the client side thereof. Additionally, the Java Web browser \u2032 must also support the Java Servlet API, developed by JavaSoft, and define how and when the servlet communicates with the Java Web Server. Essentially, the Servlet API is a well-defined set of function calls (i.e. set of Java classes) to get information to and from the Java Web Server. The servlet needs to be able to access server-defined variables, issue redirects, send error messages and the like. Sun's Java Web Server supports the Servlet API and, of course, includes their JVM.","As shown in FIG. B, the Java Web Server \u2032 includes a number of software components including the Java Servlet API which comprises several Java interfaces and fully defines the link between the hosting server (e.g. Java Web Server) and the servlets located at the middle tier. The Servlet API is defined as an extension to the standard JDK. This means that there is an explicit definition of servlet interfaces, but it is not part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.1 or the Java 2 platform. Instead, the servlet classes are delivered with the Java Servlet Development Kit (JSDK) version 2.0 from Sun (http:\/\/java.sun.com\/products\/servlet\/). This JSDK version is intended for use with both JDK 1.1 and the Java 2 platform. There are a few significant differences between JSDK 2.0 and JSDK 1.0.","JDK extensions are packaged under javax\u2014the root of the Java extension library tree. The Java Servlet API contains the following packages: Package javax.servlet; and Package javax.servlet.http dedicated to supporting HTTP protocol and HTML generation. The Servlet API provides a tight link between a server and servlets, allowing servlets to add new protocol support to a server. Essentially, any protocol (e.g. SMTP, POP, FTP, etc.) that follows a request\/response computing model can be implemented by a servlet.","General servlet support is provided by the package \u201cjavax.servlet\u201d which comprises the following components:\n\n","Support for HTTP Servlets is provided by the package \u201cjavax.servlet.http\u201d which comprises the following components:\n\n","Having provided an overview on server-side CPIR-enabling Java Applets (i.e. Servlets) of the present invention and the support framework required thereby in a distributed-computing object oriented programming environment shown in FIG. B, it is appropriate to now describe the method of creating, loading, distributing, embedding and executing server-side CPIR-enabling Java Applets in accordance with the principles of the present invention schematically illustrated in FIGS. E, E, F and F.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. E, the first step of the method involves using the Java Servlet API to write or otherwise author the source code for a server-side CPIR-enabling Java Applet for each UPN-specified consumer product registered in the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem . In general, the source code for each server-side CPIR-enabling Java Applet (i.e. Servlet) will embody one or more of following items of information, namely: (i) the UPN of the particular product on which the CPI search is to be carried out and the search results thereof displayed; (ii) Java classes required for performing a UPN-directed search on the RDBMS Server  using one or more Java methods running natively on the Java Web Server \u2032, and producing a particular Java GUI for displaying the results obtained from the UPN-directed search; and (iii) license-related information specifying the terms and conditions of the CPIR-enabling Servlet license and the conditions under which the CPIR-enabling servlet shall operate.","Notably, such license-related information may specify: (1) one or more specific host domains from which a Web document containing the corresponding servlet tag may launch the CPIR-enabling servlet under a licensing program; (2) one or more general Internet domains (e.g. .com, .org, .gov, .int, .mil, .uk, etc.) from which a Web document containing the corresponding servlet tag may launch the CPIR-enabling servlet under a licensing program; (3) the time duration of the licensing period associated with the CPIR-enabling servlet; and (4) any other restrictions set by the associated manufacturer and\/or retailer, and\/or administrator of the consumer product information system hereof, that must be observed for a registered CPIR-enabled servlet to operate within a Web-document served from the registered Internet domain.","Notably, the Java source code for each CPIR-enabling Servlet will vary depending upon implementation. However, regardless of the particular implementation, it can be expected that each JDBC-supporting CPIR-enabling servlet when, for example, designed to search a (Oracle JDBC-supported) UPN\/URL Database Server A for the UPC\/URL list currently symbolically linked to a specified UPN and display the search results on the requesting client machine , will typically include Java source code specifying:\n\n","In the embodiment depicted in FIG. B, a UPN-encoded Servlet is used to replace a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script and provide a way of searching the UPN\/URL Database on RDBMS Server \u2032, with the advantage of increased speed and stability. In this instance, CPIR-enabling Servlets are accessed by the user as an HTML tag <SERVLET> embedded in an HTML document served to the client subsystem . For example, when the consumer selects the servlet tag (graphically encoded by an icon or image) in an HTML-encoded document, the linked servlet residing on the server-side of the network, is automatically executed, causing a UPN-directed search to be carried on the RDBMS server .","After writing\/authoring the source code for the Applet, the CPIR-enabling Java servlet is ascribed a unique name such as, for example, \u201cUPNXXXXXXYYYYYZ\u201d for a 12 digit Uniform Product Code.","Reference can be made to the following technical publication for additional details on writing Java servlets, designing Java GUIs and the like: \u201cJava Servlets and Serialization With RMI\u201d (1999) by Scott McPherson, published by Sun Microsystems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.; \u201cThe Java\u2122 Tutorial Second Edition Object Oriented Programming For The Internet\u201d (1999), by Mary Campione and Kathy Walrath, published by Sun Microsystems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.; and \u201cThe JFC Swing Tutorial: A Java Guide To Constructing JAVA GUIs\u201d (1999), by Mary Campione and Kathy Walrath, published by Sun Microsystems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif.; \u201cJAVA\u201d (1997) by Ed Tittel and Bill Brogden, published by IDG Books Worldwide, Inc.; \u201cWilde's WWW: Technical Foundations of the World Wide Web\u201d (1999) by Erik Wilde, published by Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg; each said publication being incorporated herein by reference.","As indicated at Block A in FIG. E, the source code for the authored servlet is compiled into Java bytecode, and java bytecode for the servlet classfiles are placed in the server_root\/servlets directory on the Java Web Server \u2032. When compiling, the javax.servlet.* package should be placed in the classpath. The easiest way to do this is to include server_root\/lib\/classes.zip in the classpath, but it is understood that one must look to the compiler's documentation for specific details in this regard.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. E, the second step of the method involves using the Java Server Administration Applet to configure the Java Web Server so as to extend the functionalities thereof and embody (or install) the CPIR-enabling Java servlet within the Java Web Server \u2032. This process of extending the functionalities of the Java Web Server \u2032 involves specifying the default parameters and arguments thereof. This configuration step is carried out when using the Servlet Loading facility of the Administration Applet in order. The loading process is achieved by clicking on the Servlets button, and then selecting \u201cAdd\u201d from the list of choices on the left GUI of the Servlet Loading Facility. Thereafter, to add a new servlet, the following procedure is performed: enter in the Servlet Name field, the unique name for the CPIR-enabling Java servlet one is loading onto the Java Web Server (e.g. \u201cUPNXXXXXXYYYYYZ\u201d); enter in the Servlet Class field, a valid class name for the Java class of the CPIR-enabling servlet, i.e., the full package name, e.g. \u201csun.server.http.FileServlet\u201d; and thereafter click on the \u201cAdd\u201d button.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. E, the fourth step of the method involves invoking the CPIR-enabling Java servlet by creating a URL having the path section \u201c\/servlet\/\u201d prepended to the assigned Servlet Name, so that the URL can be thereafter embodied within the servlet HMTL tag <SERVLET>, prior to its insertion within the HTML code of a Web document. To invoke a servlet, the webmaster\/administrator calls the servlet by creating a URL with \u201c\/servlet\/\u201d prepended to the servlet name. One can confirm that the servlet is correctly invoked by entering this URL into ones Web browser and analyzing the output of the created servlet.","As indicated at Block B in FIG. E, the fifth step of the method involves (1) embodying the unique URL, created for each consumer product, within a CPIR-enabling servlet HTML tag <SERVLET>, (2) containing each such servlet HMTL tag within an executable file, and (3) storing each such servlet tag containing file in the Central CPIR-Enabling Applet Library on the RDBMS Server .","As indicated at Block C in FIG. E, the sixth step of the method involves distributing the CPIR-enabling servlet HMTL tags (within the Central CPIR-enabling Applet Library) to retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, and others who desire to deliver UPN-directed CPI search results to their customers, clients and the like. This distribution process can be carried out by downloading servlet tag containing files to a remote computer system connected to the Internet using, for example, ftp or other electronic data or document interchange protocols (e.g. XML\/ICE) to carry out the servlet tag transport process. These downloaded CPIR-enabling servlet tags can then be stored in a local CPIR-Enabling Applet\/Servlet Library maintained on a client computer , as shown in FIG. F, until it is time to embed the same into a particular HTML-encoded document.","As indicated at Block D in FIG. E, the seventh step of the method involves enabling retailers, wholesalers, advertisers, and others to (1) open the downloaded servlet tag containing files, (2) extract the CPIR-enabling servlet tags contained therewithin, and (3) embed (i.e. insert) one or more distributed CPIR-enabled servlets HMTL tags into acceptable HTML-encoded documents associated with EC-enabled WWW sites, EC-enabled storefronts and catalogs, Internet product advertisements, on-line auction-based WWW sites, or other types of Web-documents.","In general, this step of the method involves first creating or otherwise procuring a suitable HTML-encoded document which may, understandably, include other types of codes (e.g. XML) therein, other than HTML code. While such HTML documents can be created using any HTML-editing program, such as BBD-Edit, it is expected that in most applications the underlying HTML-encoded document will be generated using tools such as, for example: GO-LIVE\u00ae WWW-Site Development and Management solution software from Adobe Systems, Inc. to create the HTML pages associated with a particular WWW site; CatalogMaker\u2122 and CatalogManager electronic commerce solution software programs from RealEDI, Inc; Intershop 4 Enfinity\u2122 Electronic Commerce Solution software from Intershop Communications, Inc; and\/or any other commercially available HTML-authoring tools which enable quick and easy creation of HTML-encoded documents, and easy insertion of any downloaded CPIR-enabling servlet tag <SERVLET> using, for example, simple commands or drag-and-drop procedures.","As indicated at Block E in FIG. E, the eighth step of the method involves serving \u201cservlet-tag\u201d encoded HTML documents from Internet information servers to Java-enabled client computer subsystems  operated by consumers at home, in the office, in EC-enabled or \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail stores, or on the road, as the case may be. As shown in , such Internet information servers can include, for example, IPI servers , retailer-related EC-enabled information servers A, manufacturer-related EC-enabled information servers B, and\/or any other Internet (http or ftp) information servers operating on the Internet from which HTML-encoded document are served for any informational, educational, and\/or entertainment purpose.","As indicated at Block F in FIG. E, the ninth step of the method hereof involves using a Java-enabled client computer subsystem  to display served HTML-encoded documents having one or more of CPIR-enabling servlet tags embedded therewithin. This step is carried out by the consumer pointing his or her Java-enabled browser program (e.g. Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Explorer, or Sun Microsystems' HotJava program) to an HMTL-encoded document within which a CPIR-enabling Java servlet tag is embedded, at a particular point of presence on the WWW.","In practice, the HTML tags of CPIR-enabling Servlets can be graphically-encoded in a variety of different ways to provide the consumer with a visual indication that, clicking on the graphical object however manifested, will automatically result in a consumer product information search on a particular product identified by the UPN encoded within the associated servlet. In view of the fact the CPIR-enabling servlet tags are distributed over the Internet and inserted within HTML documents by others than the servlet author, at some future date, graphical encoding of CPIR-enabling servlets will typically occur at the time of writing the servlet.","With the above point in mind, it will be helpful to adopt a standardized icon for graphically indicating the presence of a CPIR-enabling servlet tag within an HTML document. In the illustrative embodiments shown in , B, A and B, small predefined images of servicemarks such as \u201cGO: UPC Request Cyber-Service\u2122 URL Search\u201d are served to inform the consumer that the Java object, if selected from the displayed Web page, will automatically cause a product-specific URL search to be performed with respect to the particular consumer product and the results thereof displayed at the \u201cpoint of presence\u201d of the consumer who may be residing at a particular point in an EC-enabled store (e.g. at the check-out display screen or POS), at an on-line auction site, at a Web-based product advertisement, or anywhere else on the WWW. Notably, an important advantage provided by this information search technique of the present invention is that it does not disturb the consumer at his or her point of presence (or sale), where ever that may be. Instead, the CPI search and display method hereof enables the delivery of accurate product-specific manufacturer-defined information at precise points in Cyberspace by performing a single mouse-clicking operation. This enables consumers to make informed decisions thereat based on the information displayed in the corresponding Java GUI generated upon launching a CPIR-enabling servlet at the consumer's point of presence on the WWW.","It is understood, however, that other techniques may be used to create a visual indication to the consumer that a CPIR-enabling Applet is located at a particular point on the WWW and that if this Applet is executed (e.g. by a single mouse-clicking operation), then a UPN-directed consumer product information search will be automatically executed and the results therefrom will be displayed within a Java GUI at the consumer's point of presence.","One alternative technique would be to embed within the CPIR-enabling Applet, a thumb-nail or large size photo-image of the consumer product being offered for sale, lease, auction, or other purpose on the WWW. Notably, this product image may reside on the RDBMS server , or on the http server from which the HTML encoded document is served. Using this technique, the consumer need only click on the image to initiate a UPN-directed consumer product information search against the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof.","Notably, the person or persons responsible for delivering product advertisements to particular locations on one or more WWW sites can use the OPEN ADSTREAM\u2122 (OAS) 5.0 Internet Advertisement Management Solution software from Real Media, Inc., of New York, N.Y., and any other suitable software solution, running on the Internet (http) information server (, \u2032, A or B), and managed using a Web-enabled client subsystem , as shown in FIG. F. Using the OAS 5.0 advertisement management solution, and the CPI search and display method of the present invention described above, a webmaster or advertising manager assigned to a particular Internet information server (, \u2032, A or B) can: (1) access the Web-based product advertisement for a particular product (i.e. HTML code, image files, and any other rich media content associated therewith); (2) access previously downloaded CPIR-enabling Java servlet(s) for the consumer product, stored in a locally-maintained \u201cLibrary (i.e. Catalog) of CPIR-Enabling Applets\u201d on a client machine or server on the network, or directly access CPIR-enabling Java servlets from the centrally-maintained \u201cLibrary (i.e. Catalog) of CPIR-Enabling Applets\u201d illustrated in FIG. F, via the Java Web Server \u2032; and (3) use Real Media's OAS 5.0 solution software deliver both the Web-based product advertisement (i.e. its HTML code and other media-rich content) and the corresponding CPIR-enabling Applet tag (and possibly any image files associated therewith) to a designated section on a particular Web page of a specific WWW site.","It is understood that there are different ways of inserting\/embedding both of these objects within a particular section of an HTML-encoded document using the highly-advanced HTML-editing functionalities of the OAS 5.0 software system. For example, the Web-based product advertisement can be inserted within a first spatially-defined portion of the target HTML document (occupying the largest portion of the purchased Internet advertising space), while the CPIR-enabling server-side Applet (i.e. servlet) is inserted within a second spatially-defined portion of the target HTML document occupying the balance of the purchased Internet advertising space. Alternatively, both the CPIR-enabling Applet and the Web-based product advertisement can be inserted within substantially the same spatially-defined portion of the target HTML document so as to achieve spatial overlap therebetween. This way when the consumer clicks on the advertisement image, or some preselected portion thereof, the underlying CPIR-enabling servlet will be automatically executed and the corresponding Java GUI generated for displaying the results of the UPN-directed database search.","In situations where the Internet product advertisement (e.g. banner advertisement) embodies a servlet HMTL tag which, when executed, produces a new Java GUI (i.e. new browser interface), then a CPIR-enabling servlet can be embedded within the HTML-encoded document displayed in the new Java GUI. This servlet tag embedding technique will be useful in many applications where the display space allocated for the Web advertisement in the target HTML-encoded document is limited, and there is a need to generate a new Java GUI for presenting the content of the advertisement.","Other ways of embedding the Web-based advertisement and the related CPIR-enabling servlet tags will become apparent hereinafter to those skilled in the art, having had the benefit of reading the present disclosure.","As indicated at Block G in FIG. E, the tenth step in the method involves the consumer recognizing that a CPIR-enabling servlet tag is embedded within a Web-document displayed on a Java-enabled client computer subsystem, and thereafter launching\/executing the associated servlet to initiate a UPN-directed consumer product information search within the RDBMS server .","Notably, the above illustrative embodiment has been described with particular focus given to CPIR-enabling servlets encoded with the UPN of a particular consumer product. It is understood, however, that the CPIR-enabling servlets of the present invention can be encoded with the trademark(s) used in connection with a particular consumer product, thus providing Trademark-encoded CPIR-enabling servlets, in contrast with UPN-encoded CPIR-enabling servlets. In such alternative embodiments, the encoded trademark would be used to direct a search through the RDBMS server , and display the results thereof in a new (independent) Java GUI generated at the point of servlet tag embodiment. Alternatively, a product descriptor associated with a particular product can be encoded within the corresponding CPIR-enabling servlet, used to direct a search through the RDBMS server , and display the results thereof in an independent Java GUI generated at the point of servlet tag embodiment.","In situations where the advertisement itself embodies a Java-Applet, as in the case of most banner-type advertisements, it would be desirable to embed the CPIR-enabling Applet within the HTML-encoded document displayed within the new Java GUI generated when the Java-Applet is executed by the consumer upon his or her initial encounter of the advertisement. Upon the display of the menu-formatted list of categorized URLs within the CPID-enabling Java GUI, the consumer can easily access different Web-documents containing information related to the advertised consumer product by simply selecting the URL and linking to the information resource to which it points on the WWW. Notably, the displayed URL menu would include (i) one or more URLs pointing to EC-enabled stores and on-line catalogs at which the advertised product can be purchased over the Internet, as well as (ii) one or more URLs pointing to \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d type retail stores at which the advertised product can be purchased in the stream of commerce.","Thus, the CPI-based search and display method of the present invention gives rise to a new method of and system for purchasing a consumer product over the Internet (e.g. WWW) comprising the steps of: embedding a UPN-encoded CPIR-enabling Applet within the HTML-code of a consumer product advertisement, wherein the CPIR-enabling Applet when executed displays a categorized URL menu containing one or more URLs pointing to one or more EC-enabled stores or on-line catalogs on the WWW at which the consumer product identified by the encoded UPN can be purchased and delivered to a particular address in physical space.","CPIR-Enabling Applet Download\/Distribution","As illustrated in FIGS. F and F, a centralized Library of CPIR-enabling Servlets is created, management and stored within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof in accordance with the above-described methods. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, these CPIR-enabling Applets (i.e. Servlets) must be widely distributed to retailers, manufacturers, advertisers and others about the globe and thereafter widely embedded within HTML-encoded documents, as taught in detail hereinabove, to practice this aspect of the present invention in a commercially successful manner. The function of the CPIR-enabling Applet Download\/Distribution mode of operation of the system is to enable the world-wide distribution of this centralized Library of CPIR-enabling Applets\/Servlets, in accordance with the licensing program associated with each such CPIR-enabling Applet.","A CPIR-enabling Applet Download\/Distribution can be automatically initiated by the user depressing mode control button displayed on a control panel. The user can be anyone with the requisite authority to use the Applets in accordance with the terms of the licensing program to be enforced in connection therewith. Understandably, the terms of such licensing programs will be based on prevailing business conditions and will vary from embodiment to embodiment of the present invention.","As best illustrated in FIG. F, upon entering the CPIR-enabling Applet Download\/Distribution mode, the IPD server  of the illustrative embodiment will serve a custom Java GUI as shown in , for carrying out Applet tag downloading and licensing procedures. The GUI will provide (1) links to the centralized Library of CPIR-Enabling Applet maintained within the UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem , as well as (2) launchable GUIs for downloading selected UPN-identifiable CPIR-enabling Applets to specified Internet-enabled client computer subsystems  or Internet information\/application servers operated by the user interfacing with this mode of system operation. Notably, electronic data interchange\/exchange processes (e.g. based on EDI, XML\/ICE or other protocols) can be used to carry out the downloading of CPIR-enabling Applets and other files between client computers and the IPD server  during this and other modes of operation.","For licensing purposes, it may be desirable or necessary to have the user supply \u201cend-use\u201d types of information to the IPD server  during this mode of operation in order to identify on which information servers or domains particular CPIR-enabling Applets are to be used (i.e. embedded within HTML-documents and launched therefrom by the end-user which will typically be the consumer). In some instances, licenses for CPIR-enabling Applets will carry a fee to be paid by the downloader; in other instances, there will be no fee requirements. Such details will depend on prevailing business conditions along the retail supply and demand chain.","Once a user has downloaded CPIR-enabling Applets onto a designated (target) client machine or server, the user will have built a local Library (or Catalog) of CPIR-enabling Applets for use during Applet embedding operations which will typically be carried out alongside of other HTML-code authoring and management operations involving, for example, the design, construction, management and maintenance of Web-pages, EC-stores, on-line (retail and wholesale) product catalogs, on-line auction site pages, Web advertisements, and the like.","As shown in FIG. F, during Step D of the Applet embedding process, CPIR-enabling requests are accessed from the local Library of CPIR-enabling Applets typically over an IP-type local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Then during Step D, the accessed CPIR-enabling Applet is inserted within the HTML code of the target document. This step of the process will typically involve use of HTML-editing tools of one sort or another, as discussed herein above.","Once the CPIR-enabling Applet has been embedded within the target HTML-encoded documents, the HTML-encoded document can then be published in its intended publishing environment so that consumers can instantly initiate UPN-directed searches within the centralized UPN\/URL Database Management Subsystem  hereof by clicking on the CPIR-enabling Applet, and thereafter display the search results within an independent Java GUI which performs the function of a \u201ccyber-kiosk\u201d provided at the consumer's point of presence on the WWW.","Modifications of the Illustrative Embodiments of the Invention","The present invention has been described in great detail with reference to the above illustrative embodiments. It is understood, however, that numerous modifications will readily occur to those with ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of reading the present disclosure.","For example, in the illustrative embodiments described hereinabove, separate databases are maintained by each data-synchronized IPD Server for (i) registered products within the system, and (ii) non-registered products within the system. Notably, the reasons for using a dual database design of this sort would be based largely on economics, namely: only those companies who have paid the required maintenance (or registration) fees get their products and linked-URLs \u201cregistered\u201d with the system, whereas non-paying companies and organizations do not get their products and linked-URLs registered with the system, regardless of how such product-URL information is ascertained (e.g. by solicitation versus data-mining).","Thus it is contemplated that in some embodiments of the present invention, each IPD Server will be designed to maintain only a single database for maintaining product-URL information currently available on the Internet. In such embodiments of the present invention, the concept of \u201cnon-registered\u201d products will be altogether avoided, since the system implementation and administration may be designed not to require companies to pay maintenance (or registration) fees in order that their products and linked URLs are registered with the IPI system. Instead, some alternative income producing scheme will be used in such embodiments of the present invention (e.g. user fees, subscription fees, Internet browser-licensing fees, etc.) for system maintenance and administration.","When practicing the system and method of the present invention, it is preferred that the UPC label (with its human-readable UPC number) assigned to the particular product be attached, embossed or otherwise embodied on an accessible surface thereof. In addition to applying the UPC label to the external packaging of the product, it is preferred that the UPC label also be printed on any and all product instructions and manuals provided with the product. In this way, the UPC number can be easily read by a human being and then used to access a desired type of product information using the system and method of the present invention.","In order that the system hereof can be used to find information pertaining to large products such as automobiles, motorcycles, skidoos, farm machinery, boats, etc., the present invention also contemplates assigning UPNs (e.g. UPC or EAN numbers) to such products and attaching, embossing or otherwise embodying the same on an accessible surface thereof. Also, the UPN label can be printed on all instruction booklets and\/or operating manuals normally provided with the product. In this way, information related to any particular product that is posted anywhere on the Internet and linked to URLs registered with the IPD Servers  of the system hereof can be readily found using the uniquely assigned UPC number assigned thereto by the manufacturer at the time of sale. Notably, multimedia information about such products can be most helpful in regard to the operation, repair and servicing of such products.","The system and method of the present invention has been shown to combine the use of UPNs, trademarks and company names when making a product information request of the system. It is understood, however, that the present invention can be practiced using any one of these items of information, alone or in combination with each other, in order to place a product information request with the system hereof.","Also, while the system of the illustrative embodiment has been shown used to collect, transport and serve information related to consumer products, it is understood that the system can be used to link the URLs of HTML (and other Internet) documents with consumer services assigned uniform service numbers (USN) which may be based on the UPC or EAN numbering system, or some other suitable system. In such alternative embodiments, the IPI Database would contain information pertaining to uniform service numbers (USN) that have been linked to the URLs of HTML or like documents on the Internet by the manufacturer or its agents, in essentially the same manner conducted for consumer products. Such USN\/URL management operations can be carried out in a manner similar to that described in connection with UPN\/URL management along the retail supply and demand chain.","In connection with the consumer service information embodiment of the present invention, it is understood that at present, few (if any) services have been assigned a UPC (or EAN) number in the manner that nearly all consumer products have been assigned in the contemporary period. In spite of this fact, however, the present invention contemplates the need and utility of widespread assignment of UPC, EAN or similar numbers by service providers to particular services (as well as the imprinting of UPC, EAN or similar symbols on printed service brochures and advertisements. Notably, assigning uniform service numbers (USNs) to particular services, and labeling printed and graphical brochures and advertisements with such universal numbers, will provide a number of new opportunities hitherto unavailable.","In particular, service-related information could be easily found (i.e. located and accessed) on Web-sites using the system and method of the present invention, and thereafter the service easily procured through an electronic data transaction. In accordance with the present invention, this can be achieved by uniquely identifying and assigning \u201cparticular\u201d services by a Universal Service Code (USC) which has many if not all of the attributes of a conventional UPC. While not necessary, a single digit may be optionally added to the USC in order to demark that services, rather than products, are being identified. An example of such USC labeling would be printing an assigned UPC label (number) on: admission tickets to a theatrical, dramatic or musical performance and\/or its playbill; admission tickets to a movie; admission tickets to a concert and\/or its concert program; admission tickets to a sporting event and\/or its sports program; admission tickets to an art, science or history museum; admission tickets to the zoo or botanical gardens; and the like. The UPC label would be encoded to identify a particular event at which an entertainment, educational or professional service is provided. The UPC label printed on the tangible medium associated with the promotion of or access to the particular service would then be registered with the IPSI Registrant Database of the system hereof, along with the name of the provider of the service, and a list of URLs that identify the Web locations at which particular kinds of information related to the particular service can be found (in accordance with the categories of FIG. A).","These and all other such modifications and variations are deemed to be within the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the accompanying Claims to Invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of how to practice the Objects of the Present Invention, the following Detailed Description of the Illustrative Embodiments can be read in conjunction with the accompanying Drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-1","b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":"9"},"FIG.
