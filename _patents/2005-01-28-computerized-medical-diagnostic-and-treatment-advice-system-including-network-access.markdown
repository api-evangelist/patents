title: Computerized medical diagnostic and treatment advice system including network access
abstract: A system and method for providing computerized, knowledge-based medical diagnostic and treatment advice. The medical advice is provided to the general public over networks, such as a telephone network or a computer network. The invention also includes a stand-alone embodiment that may utilize occasional connectivity to a central computer by use of a network, such as the Internet. New authoring languages, interactive voice response and speech recognition are used to enable expert and general practitioner knowledge to be encoded for access by the public. “Meta” functions for time-density analysis of a number of factors regarding the number of medical complaints per unit of time are an integral part of the system. A re-enter feature monitors the user's changing condition over time. A symptom severity analysis helps to respond to the changing conditions. System sensitivity factors may be changed at a global level or other levels to adjust the system advice as necessary.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to medical knowledge systems and, more particularly, to systems for giving medical advice to the general public over networks.","2. Description of the Related Technology","Health care costs currently represent 14% of the United States Gross National Product and are rising faster than any other component of the Consumer Price Index. Moreover, usually because of an inability to pay for medical services, many people are deprived of access to even the most basic medical care and information.","Many people delay in obtaining, or are prevented from seeking, medical attention because of cost, time constraints, or inconvenience. If the public had universal, unrestricted and easy access to medical information, many diseases could be prevented. Likewise, the early detection and treatment of numerous diseases could keep many patients from reaching the advanced stages of illness, the treatment of which is a significant part of the financial burden attributed to our nation's health care system. It is obvious that the United States is facing health-related issues of enormous proportions and that present solutions are not robust.","One prior attempt at a solution to the health care problem is called Ask-A-Nurse, wherein a group of nurses provide health information by telephone around-the-clock. A person with a medical problem calls an 800 number and describes the problem to the nurse. The nurse uses a computer for general or diagnostic information on the ailment or complaint mentioned by the caller. The nurse may then refer the caller to a doctor from a computerized referral list for a contracting hospital or group of hospitals. Client hospitals contract with Ask-A-Nurse to provide patient referrals. A managed care option called Personal Health Advisor is similar and adds the capability for the caller to hear prerecorded messages on health topics 24 hours a day. Several problems exist with these prior medical advice systems. First, these systems have high costs associated with having a nurse answer each telephone call. Second, the caller may have to belong to a participating health plan to utilize the service. Third, if for some reason all nurses on a particular shift happen to be busy and the caller has an emergency condition (that is not known by the caller to be an emergency), precious time in getting emergency services may be lost during the delay.","Another prior health system was developed by InterPractice Systems which provides a computerized service that answers health care questions and advises people in their homes. A health maintenance organization (HMO) may provide this service to its members in a particular geographic area. To get advice at home, an HMO member connects a toaster-sized box to a telephone and calls a toll-free 800 number. Using a keyboard that is part of the box, the user answers questions displayed on a screen of the box relating to the user's symptoms. Depending on the answers, the user might be told to try a home remedy, be called by a nurse or doctor, or be given an appointment to be examined. A limitation of this system is the additional expense of the electronics box, which could either be purchased by the user for approximately $300 or purchased by the health organization with the expense to be passed on to the users. Another limitation is that this service is directed to members of a particular contracting health organization, such as an HMO. What is desired is a system that does not require additional hardware for the basic service, but that utilizes the existing communication network. The desired system should be available for use by any person, not just members of a certain organization.","A prior attempt at a health care solution for a limited set of conditions is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,712,562. A patient's blood pressure and heart rate are measured and the measurements are sent via telephone to a remote central computer for storage and analysis. Reports are generated for submission to a physician or the patient. U.S. Pat. No. 4,531,527 describes a similar system, wherein the receiving office unit automatically communicates with the physician under predetermined emergency circumstances.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,838,275 discloses a device for a patient to lay on or sit in having electronics to measure multiple parameters related to a patient's health. These parameters are electronically transmitted to a central surveillance and control office where a highly trained observer interacts with the patient. The observer conducts routine diagnostic sessions except when an emergency is noted or from a patient-initiated communication. The observer determines if a nonroutine therapeutic response is required, and if so facilitates such a response. As previously mentioned, highly trained people are needed by this system along with the special measurement apparatus (embedded in a bed or chair).","Other prior attempts at a health care solution are typified by U.S. Pat. No. 5,012,411 which describes a portable self-contained apparatus for measuring, storing and transmitting detected physiological information to a remote location over a communication system. The information is evaluated by a physician or other health professional. As before, highly trained people are necessary to utilize such an apparatus.","Several services to provide medical or pharmaceutical advice are now available via \u201c1-900\u201d telephone numbers, e.g., \u201cDoctors by Phone.\u201d These services are available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. A group of doctors, including some specialties, is available to answer questions about health care or medical conditions for people anywhere in the United States who call the \u201c1-900\u201d telephone of one of the services. A group of registered pharmacists answers questions about medications for the \u201c1-900\u201d pharmaceutical service.","The present solution to the health care problem is a computerized medical diagnostic and treatment advice (MDATA) system that is a medical knowledge-based system designed to give medical advice to the general public over the telephone network. The goal of the MDATA system is to provide everyone with equal access to high quality, 100%-consistent medical advice at a reasonable cost. The MDATA system provides callers with extremely fast and virtually unlimited access to health care information, twenty-four hours a day, from any location around the world. Health care advice is made available to an entire spectrum of users, from elderly patients confined to their homes to travelers in a foreign country with telephones in their cars.","The central ideas leading to the development of the MDATA system are based on the following assumptions:\n\n","These central ideas are utilized in the implementation of the MDATA system.","A goal of the MDATA system is to give better medical advice than a family practitioner who is unfamiliar with a patient, e.g., an on-call physician. A person seeking medical advice frequently will not be able to see or speak with his or her personal physician in a timely manner. The MDATA system provides medical advice whenever desired by the caller\u2014seven days a week\/24 hours a day.","All previous medical algorithms, including those used in the military, are designed for face-to-face interactions. Self-help books generally do not consider age and sex in their algorithms. Furthermore, a book cannot take into account how many times a person has consulted the same algorithm within a short period of time for the same problem. The medical algorithms used by the MDATA system are designed for use in a telecommunications setting and overcome the deficiencies of self-help books.","Previous medical advice systems do not do a time-density analysis for a number of factors with regard to the number of complaints per unit of time. The MDATA system uses \u201cmeta\u201d functions to perform these analyses.","Previous medical advice algorithms do not have a way of detecting the consciousness level of the person seeking consultation. The MDATA system invokes a \u201cmental status examination\u201d whenever a complaint or problem has the possibility of an altered level of consciousness. In addition, the MDATA system uses \u201csemantic discrepancy evaluator loops\u201d which allow the system to invoke the mental status exam if there are differences in answers to the parallel threads of thought that are woven or embedded into the system.","Other medical advice systems do not have a \u201cre-enter\u201d feature to monitor a patient's progress or worsening over time. The MDATA system checks for and responds to changing conditions over time.","Prior medical advice systems suffer from the inability to be nearly instantly up-dated as new medical information is made available. The MDATA system regularly and frequently updates the treatment aspect of the system.","The computerized medical diagnostic and treatment advice (MDATA) system is a medical knowledge-based system designed to give medical advice to the general public over the telephone network. Using a new authoring language, interactive voice response and speech recognition technology, the MDATA system encodes a highly useful core of expert and general practitioner diagnostic and treatment knowledge into a computerized system for access by non-medically trained personnel.","The MDATA system does not provide advice for every medical problem, nor does it make an exhaustive study of one vertical cross-section of medicine. Instead, the MDATA system provides up-to-date medical advice for approximately one hundred of the most commonly encountered problems in general practice and emergency medicine. It also provides valuable information to the public on any number of other medical topics.","As another embodiment of the MDATA system, a person desiring medical advice and having access to a personal computer (PC) loads a program into the PC to produce a stand-alone medical diagnostic and treatment advice (SA-MDATA) system. Rather than listening to questions and responding via touch tone keypresses or via voice, the user responds to questions and directions displayed on the computer screen via a computer input device, such as a keyboard or mouse. The diagnosis and\/or treatment recommendations provided by the MDATA system are the same as that provided by the SA-MDATA system. The user of the SA-MDATA system can procure updates by contacting the MDATA system sponsor\/administrator to obtain the most current treatment table information for a particular diagnosis.","Yet another embodiment of the MDATA system utilizes communication networks, such as the Internet, to connect a user or patient with the MDATA computer. The user utilizes a network access processor or computer to access the network. This embodiment utilizes medical diagnostic scripts executed on a script engine to generate medical advice or a diagnosis. The scripts and script engine may be executed on the MDATA computer in a manner similar to the telephonic embodiment above. Alternatively, selected portions of the MDATA software and one or more scripts may be downloaded to the user's computer for execution. The MDATA computer may download additional or newer scripts to the user's computer over the network as necessary.","One aspect of the invention is a medical diagnostic system comprising a computing environment arranged to receive patient information, comprising a server computer connected to a communications network; a client processor connected to the network and in data communication with the server computer via the network; an input device, connected to the client, to receive patient information; an output device, connected to the client, to provide information indicative of a diagnosed medical condition, wherein the environment executes a program for diagnosing by scoring a medical condition based on the patient information and communicating the diagnosed medical condition via the output device, and wherein the program comprises at least one medical diagnostic code portion selectively executed based on at least a portion of the received information, wherein the medical diagnostic code portion scores at least a portion of the received information and diagnoses a medical condition associated with the executed medical diagnostic code portion if the score reaches or passes a threshold; and wherein the program is arranged to read data from, and write data to, a medical history file stored in association with the client processor or the server computer, and wherein the scoring by the medical diagnostic code portion is affected by the data read from the medical history file.","The system may also have information transferred between the client processor and the server computer being securely transmitted.","The system may also have data communication between the server computer and the client processor being intermittent.","Another aspect of the invention is a computerized system for providing information to any one of a plurality of patients by communicating information over a computer network, the system comprising means for selectively executing at least one medical software code portion; means for accessing a patient medical history during an evaluation process, wherein each patient is associated with at least one record containing medical information unique to the medical condition of the patient, and wherein the patient medical history is persistently stored in the at least one record; means for determining medical advice particular to a medical condition associated with the medical software code portion through communication over the computer network with a selected one of the patients and with information stored in the patient medical history; and means for providing the medical advice to the selected patient, wherein the medical advice is stored in a patient consultation summary.","The system may also be such that a physician accesses and uses the patient consultation summary to make a diagnosis.","Yet another aspect of the invention is a computerized system for determining medical advice for any one of a plurality of patients by communicating information over a computer network, the system comprising: means for selectively executing at least one medical software code portion; means for accessing a patient medical history during an evaluation process, wherein each patient is associated with at least one record containing medical information unique to the medical condition of the patient, and wherein the patient medical history is persistently stored in the at least one record; and means for determining medical advice particular to a medical condition associated with the medical software code portion through communication over the computer network with a selected one of the patients and with information stored in the patient medical history, wherein the medical advice is stored in a patient consultation summary.","The system may also be such that a physician accesses and uses the patient consultation summary to make a diagnosis.","The system may additionally have means for providing the medical advice to the selected patient.","The following detailed description of the preferred embodiments presents a description of certain specific embodiments to assist in understanding the claims. However, the present invention can be embodied in a multitude of different ways as defined and covered by the claims.","For convenience, the following description will be outlined into the following principal sections: Introduction, System Overview, Operating Features of the MDATA System, Authoring Language, Run-Time Operation, Software Structure, Top-Level Flow, Login Process, Registration Process, Evaluation Process, The Meta Function, Mental Status Examination, Semantic Discrepancy Evaluator Routine, Past Medical History Routine, Physical Self Examination, Symptom Severity Analysis, Treatment Table, The MDATA System Paradigm, Video Imaging, Benefits of the MDATA System, First Optional System Configuration, Summary of Advantages of the Present Invention, and Second Optional System Configuration.","A consultation for a person seeking medical advice begins with a telephone call to the medical diagnostic and treatment advice (MDATA) system of the present invention. The MDATA system asks the caller specific questions and then analyzes each response.","Voice recognition and interactive voice response technology allow callers to respond to yes\/no and multiple choice questions either by speaking directly into the telephone or by using the touch tone pad of their telephone.","Easy access to the information in the MDATA system is made possible by a natural user interface. The computer-driven dialogue consists of simple yes\/no and multiple choice questions. The questions and treatment recommendations are very simply worded yet skillfully designed to reflect the accumulated experience of many physicians in conducting patient interviews.","Although all the MDATA system's questions are designed to be easily understood, unforeseen situations will inevitably arise. For this reason, hierarchical staffing is implemented. As an example, for every 10 telephone lines, one operator fully trained in triage and the MDATA system will be available. For every 10 operators there will be one registered nurse in attendance; and for every 10 registered nurses, there will be one physician in attendance. Staffing requirements are adjusted as the system is refined toward optimal efficiency. The MDATA system does not require the operator or the registered nurse to make any medical decisions.","Referring to , the components of a presently preferred embodiment of the computerized medical diagnostic and treatment advice (MDATA) system  of the present invention are shown. A personal computer (PC)  includes a plurality of components within an enclosure . A plurality of telephone lines  interface the public telephone network  to the computer . As an example, one of telephone lines  is shown to be switched via network  to connect with a telephone  that is used by a person desiring medical advice (user) . Throughout this document, the words user, caller and patient are used interchangeably. However, it will be understood that the caller may be acting as a proxy for the patient. If this is the case, the caller will be registered as an assistant for the patient.","The hardware and system software were assembled with two basic concepts in mind: portability to other operating systems and the use of industry standard components. In this way, the system can be more flexible and will allow free market competition to continuously improve the product, while, at the same time, decrease costs. While specific hardware and software will be referenced, it will be understood that a panoply of different components could be used in the present system.","The system currently runs on the PC  with an Intel 80486 microprocessor. \u201cTelephony\u201d functions use Dialogic Corporation's D\/41D voice processing board  based on a digital signal processor (DSP). The voice processing (VP) board  performs several functions including interfacing the telephone lines, decoding touch tone signals, speech recording and speech playback. Touch tone signals are also known as \u201cdual tone multiple frequency\u201d (DTMF) signals. A group of one to four telephone lines  connect to the VP board . The computer  may include a plurality of VP boards  based on how many phone line connections are desired for the system . Speech recognition is achieved using Voice Processing Corporation's speech recognition VPRO-4 board  (also DSP based). The voice recognition (VR) board  performs several functions including recognizing utterances and returning an index number of a recognition confidence level. The VR board  and the VP board  both connect to an industry standard architecture (ISA) bus . The ISA bus  interconnects the microprocessor  with a plurality of peripherals through controller circuits (chips or boards).","The VP board  also connects to a VPRO-Adapt board  via an analog audio bus  that is called Analog Extension Bus. Four simultaneous channels provide a 96 kbit\/second data transfer rate. Each channel corresponds to a telephone line connected to the VP board  and is associated with a current patient consultation. The Adapt board  further connects to a digital audio bus . The VR board  also connects to the digital audio bus . The Adapt board  performs analog to digital signal conversion to a VPC-proprietary digital pulse code modulation (PCM) format. The digital bus  can accommodate 32 channels and has a data transfer rate of 2.048 Mbits\/second.","The computer ISA bus  has a plurality of peripherals connected to it through adapters or controllers. A video adapter board , preferably at VGA or better resolution, interconnects to a video monitor . A serial communication circuit  interfaces a pointing device, such as a mouse . A parallel communication circuit may be used in place of circuit  in another embodiment. A keyboard controller circuit  interfaces a keyboard . A small computer systems interface (SCSI) adapter, such as model 1542C made by Adaptec, provides a SCSI bus  to which a 500 Mb or greater hard disk drive  and dual Bernoulli 150 Mb disk drives are preferably attached. The hard drive  stores database files such as the patient files, speech files, and binary support files.","A main memory  connects to the microprocessor . In the presently preferred embodiment, the MDATA system  operates under DOS version 5.0 operating system . The system software is written in Microsoft C\\C++ version 7.0 using structured programming techniques. An algorithm processor  includes a parser and supporting functions that manipulate a memory variable symbol table and a run time stack, which will be described hereinbelow. Sequiter Software Inc. Codebase 5.0 allows access to X-base compatible database records stored on the hard drive . The MDATA system  also includes two new authoring languages (one each is used in two embodiments of the system), which will be discussed hereinbelow.","The system software includes the following code modules for which source code is included in the attached Microfiche Appendix:\n\n","The application is compiled with the Microsoft graphics, Dialogic board, VPC board and CodeBase database libraries.","The Voice Processing Corporation (VPC) VPro-4 VR board has eight voice recognition channels, which by default are associated one-to-one with the Dialogic D\/41D channels. VPC's pioneering work in the voice processing field is in the area of continuous speech. This allows a person to speak a multiple digit number in a natural manner, without pausing after each digit. VPC supplies two continuous speech vocabularies: one vocabulary contains the digits 1 through 9, plus \u201czero\u201d and \u201coh\u201d, and the other contains just the two words \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d. The vendor-supplied digits continuous speech vocabulary is used by the system . In the presently preferred embodiment, if the score is 75% or better, the response is unconditionally accepted. If the score is between 20% and 74%, the digits recognized are read back, and the caller is asked to accept or reject the digits. In another embodiment of the system , the above score thresholds are implemented as tunable parameters. The scoring parameters are stored in a configuration file that is manipulated off-line by a utility program and is read by the run-time system at initialization.","VPC also provides a few discrete vocabularies. Discrete vocabularies contain one or two word utterances. The vendor-supplied discrete speech vocabulary of the months of the year is used in the on-line patient registration process. A speaker-independent discrete speech vocabulary consisting of the words \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201cbackup\u201d, \u201ccontinue\u201d, \u201chelp\u201d, \u201coperator\u201d, \u201cpause\u201d, \u201cquit\u201d and \u201crepeat\u201d has been developed using a very powerful set of utilities supplied by VPC, Scripter and Trainer. These utilities are for collecting samples and training the vocabulary.","The VR board  has the minimum of two MB memory installed. The default memory configuration has a partition for both continuous vocabularies and a partition for one discrete vocabulary. Additional discrete vocabularies may be downloaded if the on-board memory is reconfigured.","The VR board  has four digital signal processors (DSP's) from which VPC derived eight voice recognition channels. Each of these eight recognition resources is referred to as a VPro Speech Processor (VSP). Discrete vocabulary recognition requires one VSP; continuous vocabulary recognition requires two adjacent VSP's. The MDATA system  has a VSP resource manager in the resp.c software module. This resource manager allocates VSP's in a dynamic manner to VP board  channels on a demand basis. As soon as the system receives a response, voice or DTMF, it releases the VSP's associated with the caller's VP board  channel.","The MDATA system  uses VPC's application programming interface (API) for the C programming language. This makes the application vendor specific to VPC, but also allows the system  to utilize all the powerful API features, e.g., on-line creation of discrete speaker dependent vocabularies used for voice pattern matching or voice printing.","The VPC API supports both continuous speech vocabulary (CSV) and discrete speech vocabulary (DSV) recognition.","The voice processing (VP) board  supports speech recording and playback, as well as touch tone (DTMF) signal detection and decoding. A device driver, associated with the VP board , is loaded into system memory during load operations. The device driver supports communications between the VP board  and the application code at run time (e.g., when a person is seeking medical advice). Through a shared memory segment, the device driver sends event and status data to the application code in real-time as events occur on the associated telephone line. These events include the ring of an incoming call, touch tone key pressed by the caller, and the hang-up signal. The VP board  plays back speech messages that are stored on the hard drive . The algorithm processor  sends a selected speech file having an encoded speech message that is retrieved from the hard drive  to the VP board  at the appropriate time for speech message playback. A speech message can be of variable length with a typical message about one to two minutes in length. Several speech messages may be chained together to produce an extended spoken message, e.g., giving instructions to the patient. During speech file playback, the VP board  is monitoring touch tone response from the caller. The VP board  may be configured to interrupt speech file playback when a touch tone signal is detected.","System Operating Contexts The system has an activity flag in the port status block for each patient currently using the system to keep track of which state the associated VP board channel is in:\n\n","Voice Keywords and DTMF Command Keys The system is responsive to the following voice keywords and DTMF keys when it is in a prompting state, i.e., not in response to a menu message:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0116"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Voice","DTMF"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"yes","1","Useful for answering yes\/no questions."]},{"entry":[{},"no","2"]},{"entry":[{},"backup","#","Causes the system to back up to the"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"\u201cpredecessor\u201d message (see below),"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"then resume playback."]},{"entry":[{},"help","*","Plays helpful information: either the node's"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"help message list, or the DTMF command"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"explanation message."]},{"entry":[{},"operator","0","Causes the system to transfer the caller to"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"a live person."]},{"entry":[{},"pause","7","Transitions to pause mode.

A new and unique authoring language is used by the MDATA system to help accomplish this objective.","Each day, specialists perform the same tasks over and over. They enact the same diagnostic ritual of solving a familiar problem. At the same time, however, primary care physicians attempt to find the best path through the diagnostic maze of an unfamiliar problem. This process is inefficient and fraught with error.","In medicine, there is generally one best way to do things. Instead of physicians spending valuable time duplicating tasks, the MDATA system utilizes medical experts from each medical specialty who write detailed algorithms for the treatment of the 100 or so most commonly encountered complaints in family practice and emergency medicine. These algorithms are carefully and specifically designed to elicit historical data and physical findings over the telephone, rather than in face-to-face interactions.","Several experts could work together to thoroughly research one particular complaint as well as to anticipate the full spectrum of possible problems and patient responses. These experts could also provide and maintain the MDATA system treatment table as well as the imaging modality of choice and laboratory test of choice tables. These concepts will be described hereinbelow.","Carefully crafted questions, used in the taking of a medical history, are the main tools that the MDATA system uses to assess the problems of patients. The key to getting a good history is to ask the right questions. In a sense, in the diagnostic process questions are like tests. It is important to note that the right questions are basically always right; they don't change. Although they may be refined over time, in general, once excellent and well-crafted questions are developed they are good for a very long time. Of course, as new diseases are discovered, e.g., toxic shock syndrome and AIDS, new sets of diagnostic questions are developed that are disease specific.","The questions used by an earlier generation of physicians, who did not have any of the latest imaging modalities (types or methods), are far more sensitive and precise in diagnosing a patient's problem than the questions used by doctors today. The MDATA system makes use of fine nuances of language to diagnose patients as well as to determine when certain tests or imaging studies are necessary.","The MDATA system's statistic generating capabilities enable the system to analyze the effectiveness of the questions used in the diagnostic process. As a result, physicians benefit from the immense amount of statistical information that is gathered regarding the wording of questions asked in taking medical histories. For example, exactly what percentage of patients who answer \u201cyes\u201d to the question, \u201cIs this the worst headache of your life?\u201d actually have a subarachnoid hemorrhage? Although this is a classic description of this problem, the exact probability of having this kind of brain hemorrhage after answering \u201cyes\u201d to this question is not presently known.","Currently, doctors can only estimate the probability of certain conditions based on history. By applying the statistical information that is generated, the MDATA system not only provides the patient with advice that is continually improving, but it will also be able to pass along these probabilities to the entire medical community.","To function optimally, the MDATA system tries to gain as much medical information about its patients as possible. Although a first-time caller is given excellent advice, more specific advice can be given if the system has more information. Therefore, the MDATA system asks patients for their complete medical history. The MDATA system can either obtain the patient's medical record over the telephone or it can mail or fax a detailed questionnaire to each patient. The patient can then gather the necessary information at their convenience. The MDATA system will always be available by telephone to clarify any questions the patient may have.","The MDATA system uses the \u201cInternational Classification of Diseases\u201d (ICD-9-CM) codes to help summarize the information it has about a patient. This world standard is a comprehensive numerical system used to classify the entire spectrum of medical diseases. ICD-9-CM codes are also used to classify specific procedures performed (e.g., appendectomy) as well as the morphology of neoplasm (i.e., tissue diagnosis of a cancer).","In addition, the MDATA system  uses ICD-9-CM \u201cE-Codes\u201d to classify environmental events, circumstances, and conditions as the cause of injury, poisoning, and other adverse effects. These codes are particularly helpful for storing information about what drugs the patient has taken or is currently taking, as well as the context (e.g., therapeutic use, accident, poisoning, suicide attempt) in which they were or are being taken. For example, E942.1 is the code for the therapeutic use of digoxin. Medications are also cross-categorized according to the classification done by the American Hospital Formulary Service List (AHFS) Numbers. The MDATA system  also uses \u201cV-Codes\u201d to classify other types of circumstances or events such as vaccinations, potential health hazards related to personal and family history, and exposure to toxic chemicals.","It is estimated that the alphanumeric component of a patient's medical history will not exceed 1,000 atoms or pieces of information. An atom is considered herein to be a separate identifiable data item or point. With this assumption, the medical records of every person on the planet could currently be stored on approximately 1,000 optical disks.","While a patient interacts with the MDATA system, the system is constantly determining what questions to ask, based upon the information it has about the patient. Just as a physician gathers relevant pieces of information from his or her dialogue with a patient, the MDATA system flags and later stores all pertinent pieces of information that it learns from each interaction with its patient. Therefore, certain questions, because their answers remain the same, need not be repeated. For example, if the MDATA system learns that a patient's mother has suffered from migraine headaches, it will never have to ask for this information again.","Again, the more information the MDATA system has about a patient, the more specific is its advice. It is not uncommon for the MDATA system to give different advice to different patients calling for the same complaint. In other words, the advice given is patient-specific. Not only can the MDATA system's advice be different for different patients, but there are times when the advice given to the same patient (calling for the same complaint but at different times) is different. For example, one of a group of functions called \u201cmeta\u201d keeps track of the number of times the MDATA system has been consulted for the same problem. Once a threshold is reached, the MDATA system advises the patient that the number of consultations alone, for the same complaint, may signify a problem. The system then makes an appropriate recommendation.","Before the MDATA system stores any information, the system verifies its accuracy. To accomplish this task, \u201cconfirmation loops\u201d are used. Any piece of information that will become a part of the patient's medical record is sent through a confirmation loop where the system asks the patient to verify the accuracy of the information that the system has collected. The confirmation loop enables the system to verify new patient information and make corrections before it enters this information into the patient's medical record.","The MDATA system uses a new authoring language that is specifically designed to allow medical knowledge to be encoded into a usable computer program. The presently preferred voice response or telephony version of the MDATA system is written in object-oriented Microsoft C\\C++ version 7.0. This allows the MDATA system to easily interface with industry-standard database programs, including those that are SQL-based, as well as to be portable to other operating systems. The operating system is transparent to the user.","Before the development of the MDATA system's authoring language, there was no practical way for medical experts to encode their knowledge into a meaningful, useful, and accessible structure. Although other computer languages have been used to build medical expert systems, they have almost always required a knowledge engineer and a programmer to be involved. Quite often, the knowledge encoded in these systems could only be accessed and fully understood by physicians. Typically, the programmer would try to translate the doctor's diagnostic skills and treatment rules into computer code. This separation of the physician's knowledge from the encoded treatment recommendations often engendered anxiety in the physician and has, at times, led to inaccurate treatment recommendations.","The MDATA system's authoring language, however, is designed to allow physicians to transfer their knowledge into a computer program that can be directly accessed by non-medically trained personnel. Recursive and iterative techniques are used to acquire the knowledge from the expert and assemble it in a way that allows it to be immediately transposed into the MDATA system's algorithms. Because of the simple interface of the language, and because a formula for writing the algorithms has already been developed, physicians who are not computer literate can encode their knowledge as well as understand exactly how that process takes place.","The MDATA system's authoring language allows flat information to be restructured into a hierarchical or layered format in which the arrangement of the knowledge conveys meaning. Thus, a textbook description of a disease can be transposed into a form that allows useful treatment recommendations to be made.","The new language also allows the formation of a structure in which multiple overlays of screening questions, combined with the application of recursive techniques, sequentially exclude some diagnoses while at the same time reaching treatment recommendations. The MDATA system's simplicity and elegance would not be possible without the new language.","The MDATA system's authoring language allows an algorithm programmer to retrieve information from a patient's medical record, request additional information from the patient, and guide the flow of algorithm execution based on medical history and the patient's responses. The language allows the programmer to implement an algorithm in a natural scripted style.","The course of an algorithm is determined by caller responses to questions that the MDATA system asks. For simple \u201cyes\/no\u201d questions, the flow of interaction can be described by a binary tree. Multiple-choice questions (e.g., menus) provide multiple branches in the tree. Each question can be considered a node, and the acceptable responses to this question are branches leading to the next question (node). Using this abstraction of an algorithm, one can draw a directed graph (also known as a node map) of the nodes and branches of an algorithm, beginning with the initial question, and ending with all possible terminal points.","The node table is built in this manner:\n\n","Referring to , a process for translating a medical algorithm written in the authoring language will be described.  illustrates an ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) format text file  as an input to a translation utility . An ASCII file can be created by use of a text editor or a word processing program (may need to export to the ASCII format). The ASCII file  contains node definitions conforming to the syntax briefly described hereinbelow.","The purpose of the ASCII node definition translator utility  (xlat.exe, along with functions in pars.c and util.c) is to convert a human-readable document into a machine readable format that the MDATA system reads at run time to process an algorithm. This utility  may be considered to be a preprocessor; the translation must be accomplished prior to run time.","The output of the utility  is a set of binary (NOD_BLK) records written to a node table  (filename of node.fos), and a set of binary list files  (in a subdirectory \\list\\listxx\\xxyy, where xx is the first two digits of the node number, and yy are the last two digits). Four list files -are shown as an example. Each \u201clist\u201d file, e.g., , contains a \u201cnext\u201d table (i.e., the \u2018next node after this one\u2019), a message play list for this node, and a \u201cwork\u201d list (i.e., one or more \u201cthings to do\u201d at this node before beginning speech playback). The binary record written to the node table  (node.fos) has fields containing the node number (which is redundant; the record's position in this file also indicates the node number), the node's \u201ctype\u201d attribute (Menu, Link, Prompt, Yes\/No, Return, Hangup) and a parent node number.","The node table  is a table of 10,000 NOD_BLK records. This table  is indexed by a node number, e.g., the fiftieth record corresponds to node . The contents of the individual node records may be viewed by selecting \u201cDisplay Node\u201d while running the ednode utility. The node records are modified by either using the ednode utility, or when translating node definitions from ASCII to the node file with the xlat utility.","One of the following keywords is necessary as the first item on each line, but only one keyword is accepted per line; any excess information will be discarded.\n\n","A select set of math functions, relational operators, and nested if-then-else statements are supported. A pound sign (\u2018#\u2019) or a hyphen (\u2018-\u2019) in the first position on a new line will cause the translator to skip over the rest of the line. This is useful for inserting comments, or delimiting between individual node definitions. The translator also disregards blank lines.","In order for a node to be properly defined, a minimum number of keywords must be present for each node, and other keywords must be included depending on the node type. The minimum keyword set for a properly defined node is:","Node, Parent, Type, and Play.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014","list-style":"none"},"li":["Dependency rules:","(1) The Menu type requires at least an @ 1 line and an @ 2 line.","(2) The YesNo type requires an @ 1 and an @ 2 line (@ 3, etc. are ignored).","(3) The Link type requires a Next line.","(4) The Prompt type requires a Digits line and a Next line."]}}}},"The first keyword in a node definition must be Node. The other keywords may be given in any order. The next occurrence of the Node keyword will invoke a completeness test. If the completeness test is successful, then the node definition is saved in machine readable (binary) format, and translation continues with the new Node line.

As previously mentioned, algorithm processor  includes the parser and supporting functions that manipulate the memory variable symbol table and the run time stack. For a selected medical algorithm, a node record is read from the node table  and a list file is read from the plurality of list files . The algorithm processor also interacts with the Vpro voice recognition (VR) board  for speech recognition and with the Dialogic voice processing (VP) board  for speech playback and DTMF detection. The VP board  further is interconnected with a set of speech files  that are stored on a portion of hard disk  and with one of the telephone lines  that connects via the telephone network  () to the patient's telephone . The VR board  further connects with the voice print vocabularies , previously described, also stored on a portion of hard disk . The algorithm processor  utilizes the speech recognition, speech playback, and DTMF detection resources as directed by the medical algorithm that is retrieved from the node table  and the list files .","Referring to , and , several data structures are utilized at run time. These data structures are described as follows:\n\n","The work list has the non-playback tasks that are performed at each node. There is one work list for each node, and it is identified with the work keyword in the ASCII node definition file. The work list may be empty. Each time the system transits to a new node, it will execute the work list. If the patient repeats a node, the system will not execute the work list again; it will simply replay the message(s). If the patient requests the system  to back up the node map, the system will execute the work list of the node it backs up to. Typical tasks in the work list involve manipulating objects on the run time stack or in the symbol table, testing for the presence of memory variables, configuring past medical history or current medical condition objects, or writing database records. An example of a complex work list follows:\n\n\u201cTest OBJECT2; Phone=DIGBUF; Push Age\u201d\n\n","Each node has the \u201cnext\u201d table or list. The next list indices range from 1 to 9, inclusive. The next list contains either a single node number, or an if expression. For all node types, except the Hangup node, there will be at least one next list:\n\n","Following is an example of a next list:\n\n","Speech files  may be of an arbitrary length. A message may be informational, a list of menu options, or a yes\/no question. A \u201ctwo paragraph\u201d or \u201cunder one minute\u201d limit has been adopted as a style convention for the presently preferred embodiment. Typically, a node is programmed as a sequence of Yes\/No nodes, with \u201cinformational\u201d Link nodes interspersed as needed. When there is a lengthy discussion, the speech is recorded in multiple files. To simplify algorithm programming and enhance readability (viz., eliminate long chains of link nodes), the Link node's play list may contain up to ten message numbers.","Upon arrival at a Link node, the system positions a \u201ccurrent message\u201d pointer at the beginning of the play list (trivial case: single message play list; interesting case: multiple message play list). As playback proceeds, the current message pointer moves down the play list. After the system plays the last message on the list, it moves on to the next node.","If the caller issues a \u201cbackup\u201d command, the system will move the current message pointer back one message, and resume playback. If the pointer was at the beginning of the list (e.g., trivial case), the system backs up to the previous node and places the current message pointer at the beginning of the play list. If there is more than one message in the list, the system cues the pointer to the last message in the list. The system then resumes playback. In the \u201cpause\u201d mode, when the caller issues the \u201ccontinue\u201d command, the system will resume playback at the current message.","The MDATA system  uses three basic operating modes:\n\n","One of the drawbacks of the traditional doctor-patient relationship is the short amount of time that physicians are able to spend with patients. The MDATA system , however, allows patients as much time as they wish to learn about their problem as well as to obtain information on any number of other medical topics.","Through the \u201cInformation mode\u201d feature of the MDATA system , callers can learn about a disease process, an illness or the latest treatment for any disease, without adding any information to their personal medical record. Although the system  keeps track of the interaction, it is labeled as an \u201cInformation mode session.\u201d The record of the caller's path through the system is not used as the basis for any future advice, nor is it considered in generating system statistics.","The Information mode is not limited to complaints for which the MDATA system  offers medical advice. Information about early detection and treatment of many other diseases as well as the latest advances in medicine can be made available through the Information mode.","Referring to through , as an example, a run time sequence of steps of how a patient may traverse a main menu node map several steps into a chest pain algorithm node map will be described. A portion of the main menu node map with associated script, and of the chest pain algorithm node map with associated script is included in the Microfiche Appendix. Six nodes with a portion of an associated symbol table will be discussed.","At , the algorithm processor  loads the first node #, represented by node block . The variables for Age, Sex, and Real mode were loaded into the symbol table  during the login process (which will be described hereinbelow). Throughout this example, the help list is empty, i.e., no help information is played for the patient. The work list sets the Problem variable of the symbol table  to be Menu. Then the system  begins playback of message#. This message gives the patient a menu of choices to choose from. The Digits entry equal to one means that a one digit response is expected from the patient. The patient may respond by pressing a touch tone (DTMF) key on the telephone or speak the choice response into the telephone handset microphone. In this example, the patient selects menu option \u201c1\u201d. The parser evaluates the Next list based on the patient selection and branches to node #.","At , the algorithm processor  loads node #, represented by node block . The work list is empty, so the system  goes right to playing back message# which presents another menu of choices to the user. The Next list has four nodes for possible branch points. In this example, the patient selects menu option \u201c1\u201d for a chest pain complaint. The parser evaluates the Next list based on the patient selection and branches to node #.","At , the algorithm processor  loads node #, represented by node block . The work list command is to update the value of Problem in symbol table  to CCHP (chest pain). Then the system  begins playback of message#. No response is required from the patient for a Link type node. The Next list has two nodes for possible branch points depending on the value of symbol table variable Real. The parser evaluates the If expression in the Next list for the value of Real and, in this example, branches to node #.","At , the algorithm processor  loads node #, represented by node block . The work list command is to write a Meta consultation record for future use by a Meta function. The play list is empty so no message is played. No response is required from the patient for a Link type node. The main purpose of this node is to write the Meta consultation record (because the system is currently in Real mode for this patient). The Next list has only one node so no decisions are necessary by the parser which, in this example, branches to node #.","At , the algorithm processor  loads node #, represented by node block . The work list is empty in this node so the system  goes right to playing back message# which presents a yes\/no type of question to the user. The Next list has two nodes for possible branch points depending on the response of the patient.

A patient login process  is used by the system  to identify a patient who has previously registered into the system by prompting for a patient identification number (PIN). An assistant login process  is used by the system  to identify an assistant who has previously registered into the system by prompting for an assistant identification number (AIN). An assisted patient login process  is used by the system  to identify a patient who has previously registered into the system by prompting for the patient identification number. If the caller is the patient, a patient registration process  is used by the system to register new or first-time patients. If the caller is not the patient, an assistant registration process  is used by the system to register new or first-time assistants. Then, if the patient is not already registered, an assisted patient registration process  is used by the system to register the patient. These processes will be further described hereinbelow.","Once a caller has logged in or registered, the system provides a choice of two other processes in the current embodiment.

The telephone number used to access the MDATA system  may vary in various embodiments of the system. If the sponsoring agency or hospital wishes to provide access to the MDATA system  at no cost to the caller, then a toll-free 800 service number can be used. If the sponsoring agency or hospital wishes to recover the costs of running the MDATA system  from the caller, it may use a pay-per-call or premium charge number (e.g., 900 service). \u201cCurrent Procedural Terminology\u201d (CPT-4) codes are available to describe and bill third party payers for telephone consultations. They are a listing of the descriptive terms and identifying codes for reporting medical services and procedures. CPT-4 codes are the most widely accepted nomenclature for reporting physician services to insurance companies.","Beginning at a start state , a person  () desiring medical advice calls the telephone number for the MDATA system  on a telephone line . The caller may be the patient or may be an \u201cassistant\u201d, e.g., parent, relative, or friend, that is helping the patient. Moving to state , the system  answers the call automatically and greets the caller  with an introductory greeting message by playing back a speech file stored on the hard drive  by use of the VP board . Proceeding at state , the MDATA system  asks each patient who calls the system a series of \u201cinitial screening questions.\u201d These questions are designed to identify patients who are critically ill; they are not designed to identify the patient's problem. The initial screening questions enable the system to filter out patients who require immediate medical attention.","Moving to decision state , any patient found to be critically ill is instructed to dial the emergency response telephone number \u201c911\u201d at state  or will be automatically connected to the nearest emergency medical services system in the patient's area. The telephone call is terminated by the computer  at state . The following are examples of initial screening questions:\n\n","If the system determines that the patient is experiencing a medical emergency, it may provide the patient with a menu of emergency medical procedures at state . In situations where the patient or the caller for the patient is far from the nearest emergency help, e.g., a rural setting, the caller may need to initiate emergency procedures immediately. The menu of emergency medical procedures provides several choices to the caller. If the caller presses touch tone key \u201c1\u201d or speaks the word \u201cone\u201d into the telephone mouthpiece, the computer  branches to state  wherein well known CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) information is recited. If the caller has a speakerphone capability associated with the telephone  being used, the caller may be able to listen to and perform the instructions given by the system  in a hands-free manner away from the telephone. If the caller presses touch tone key \u201c2\u201d or speaks the word \u201ctwo\u201d into the telephone mouthpiece, the computer  branches to state  wherein well known Heimlich Hug information for choking is recited. At the completion of either state  or state , the telephone call ends at state .","If the patient is determined at state  not to have a medical emergency, i.e., the MDATA system  is satisfied that no immediately life threatening condition is present, the computer  moves to a decision state  to determine if the caller is the actual patient. If so, the computer  proceeds to a decision state  to determine if the patient has previously registered or ever consulted with the system , i.e., is not a new or first-time caller. If so, the system  verifies the patient's identification and retrieves their medical record at the patient login process , which will be further described hereinbelow. At the completion of process , the computer  proceeds through off-page connector C  to state  (). If the patient is not registered, the MDATA system  proceeds to the patient registration process  for a new patient, which will be described hereinbelow. At the completion of process , the computer  proceeds through off-page connector C  to state  on ","If the caller is not the patient, as determined at state , the computer  proceeds through off-page connector A  to state  on . There will be times when the patient may not be able to use the MDATA system  directly, e.g., due to injury, weakness or altered level of consciousness. In these cases, an \u201cassistant\u201d may interact with the system on behalf of the patient.","An assistant registers with the system through the assistant registration process  which will be described hereinbelow. The assistant registration record is identical to the patient registration record in structure, but three fields have special significance for an assistant: ASST_PERM, ASST_EXP, and RELATIONS. The ASST_PERM field is a Boolean flag that can only be set true off-line by the system administrator who has verified, through separate means, that a relationship exists between a patient and an assistant. The relationships are one-to-many, i.e., a patient may have one or more assistants, and an assistant may be related to more than one patient. The ASST_PERM flag may also be constrained by the ASST_EXP field, which contains a timestamp for the expiration of the ASST_PERM attribute. If the ASST_PERM flag is true, then the RELATIONS pointers will point to one or more patient records for whom this assistant is a \u201cpermanent assistant;\u201d otherwise the RELATIONS field will be empty.","The medical information gathered during an assisted consultation is written to the patient's medical record only if the following three conditions are met:\n\n","If any of these conditions are not met, then any new medical information gathered on this patient will be saved to the Pending file  for off-line verification by the system administrator.","The system  establishes at state  whether the caller is the patient, or an assistant. If the caller is not the patient, then the system asserts that the caller is an assistant and, at a decision state , determines if the assistant is registered. If the assistant is not already registered with the system, the system enrolls the new assistant at the assistant registration process . If the assistant is already registered with the system , the computer  performs the assistant login process . At the completion of either process  or process , the computer  advances to a decision state .","If the patient is not already registered with the system , as determined at decision state , then the system allows the assistant to register a new patient at the assisted patient registration process . However, if the patient is already registered with the system , as determined at state , the computer  performs the assisted patient login process . At the completion of process  or process , the computer  proceeds through off-page connector B  to a decision state  on ","At decision state , the computer  determines if the patient's date of birth is in the patient's medical record. If so, the computer proceeds through off-page connector C  to state  on . If not, the system  attempts to get the patient's date of birth. Moving to state , the system  asks the assistant if the patient's date of birth is known. If so, the computer  advances to state  to request the patient's date of birth. At state , the system  recites the patient's date of birth obtained at state . At a decision state , the assistant determines if the date of birth is correct as recited by the system . If not, the computer  loops back to state  to request the patient's date of birth again. If the patient's date of birth is correct, as determined at state , the computer  flags the date of birth for saving in the patient's medical record at state , and proceeds to state  on ","If the patient's date of birth is not known, as determined at state , the computer  proceeds to state  wherein the system requests the assistant to provide an approximate age of the patient. The age is an important parameter used in the evaluation process  and treatment table . At state , the system  recites the patient's approximate age obtained at state . At a decision state , the assistant determines if the age is correct as recited by the system . If not, the computer  loops back to state  to request the patient's approximate age again. If the patient's approximate age is correct, as determined at state , the system  advises the assistant at state  to get the patient's actual date of birth before the next consultation, and proceeds to state  on . The system  uses the approximate age in the consultation during the evaluation process  and the treatment table .","At state  on , the system  presents the caller with a system selection menu. Here, the caller is asked to select from among four choices: diagnostic system, treatment table, a future process\/function, or end call as described below:\n\n","In either process  or , the computer  functions as an interpreter as performed by algorithm processor  in following the node map created by the algorithm programmer. At the exit point of the evaluation process , the system  gives the patient the option of selecting another complaint. At the end of the treatment table process , the system gives the patient the option of selecting another treatment.","At the completion of the evaluation process , treatment table process , or future process , the system  loops back to state  and recites the system selection menu to the caller. If the caller chooses the End Call selection at state , the MDATA system  moves to a decision state . At decision state , the system  determines if process , process , or process  did not occur in Information mode, i.e., did occur in either Real mode or Pending Mode, and examines the patient's symbol table to determine if any of the configured memory variables are past medical history conditions that need to be saved to the patient's medical history file. If both conditions are true at state , the system  advances to a decision state  to determine if the consultation is being performed in Real mode. If not, the consultation is being performed in Pending mode, and the system  then writes any new patient information obtained during the consultation to the Pending file . If state  proves to be true, i.e., Real mode, for each past medical condition that needs to be saved, the MDATA system  asks the patient at state  to grant permission to save the datum to the patient's medical history file and to confirm that the datum is correct. For example, during a consultation for cough, the MDATA system  learned that the patient has been diagnosed as being HIV positive. The system  will ask, \u201cMay I record the information about your HIV diagnosis in your medical record?\u201d If the patient responds \u201cyes\u201d, then the system  will ask, \u201cPlease verify that your diagnosis for HIV was positive, is this correct?\u201d If the patient responds \u201cyes\u201d, then the system  writes this fact to the patient's medical history file. After confirmation, each data item is stored in the patient's file in the patient medical history database  ().","At the completion of either updating the history database  at state , state  proves to be false, or at the completion of state , the system  moves to a decision state . Before the MDATA system  ends the consultation with the patient, it presents a summary of all the advice it has given. The patient is asked to write down and repeat back the key points. The MDATA system  then gives the patient the option of receiving a summary of the consultation session and specific recommendations provided by the system by facsimile, electronic mail (E-mail) or a mail service, such as first-class mail. If a fax or E-mail is desired, the system  moves to a decision state  to determine if information to send the summary and recommendations is available in the system. If not, the system  asks the patient for the information, e.g., a fax number, E-mail address or mail address, at state . The patient also has the option to send a summary of the consultation to his or her health care provider or specialist. Proceeding to state , the computer  adds the transcript of the current telephone session to a fax queue or an E-mail queue, as desired, for subsequent transmission. At the completion of state  or if the system  determined at state  that the session transcript was not to be sent, the telephone call is terminated at state .","Referring now to and , the patient login process  defined in will be described. This process  is called if the patient has previously called and registered with the system . Beginning at a start state , the computer  moves to state  and initializes a match flag to true. The match flag is checked later in this process  in conjunction with setting the mode of the consultation. Proceeding to state , the computer  prompts the patient for the patient ID (identification) number (PIN) that is assigned during the registration process. The patient registration process  will be described in conjunction with and . Proceeding to a decision state , the computer  determines whether the PIN is valid. If not, the computer  determines, at a decision state , if less than three tries at entering the PIN have been attempted. If so, the computer  loops back to state  to repeat the request for the PIN. However, if three attempts at entering the PIN have been made, as determined at state , the computer  plays a polite message that advises the patient that the login attempt failed and terminates the call at state . The computer  reports the failed login attempt to the system administrator at the sponsoring agency, hospital or other organization. The patient is allowed to reregister as a new patient, however, to permit access to the needed medical information. The system administrator resolves this type of situation off-line.","If the patient has correctly entered a valid PIN, as determined at state , the computer  moves to a decision state  to determine if the patient identified by the PIN has a voice print or sample voice waveform on file in the system . If not, the computer  proceeds to state  to record the voice print of the patient, e.g. the patient's pronunciation of his or her full name. The patient's voice print may not be on file, for example, if the patient could not provide a voice print during the assisted patient registration process  in a prior consultation. At the completion of recording the voice print at state , the computer  advances to state  wherein the match flag is set to false to indicate that the patient's voice print was recorded during the current login.","If the patient identified by the PIN has a voice print on file in the system , as determined at state , the computer  proceeds to state  and prompts the patient to pronounce his or her full name. Moving to a decision state , the computer  determines whether the voice sample obtained at state  passes the matching criteria. If not, the computer proceeds to state  and recites a message that the current voice sample does not pass the matching criteria. In the presently preferred embodiment, the current voice sample is compared to the reference voice sample recorded during the patient registration process  or the assisted patient registration process . Because the voice samples did not match, as determined at state , the computer  sets the match flag to false at state . In this case, the match flag is set to false to indicate that one of the security checking methods has failed. However, the process  continues at state  after the match flag is set to false at either state  or .","If the voice sample passed the matching criteria at state , the computer  advances to state  and recites a message that the current voice sample passed the matching criteria. This security check condition is now satisfied, and the match flag remains set to true. At the completion of state  the computer  moves to state . At state , the computer  verifies the sex and age of the patient by reciting the sex and age, as stored in the enrollment database  (obtained during the patient registration process ), to the patient. At a decision state , the patient responds to the correctness of the recited information. If the sex or birth date information is not correct, the computer  moves to state  to request the correct information. The computer  then proceeds back to state  to verify the information received at state . If the result of the decision state  is true, i.e., the sex and age are correct, the computer moves through off-page connector A  to a decision state  on to determine if the patient desires to conduct the telephone session in Real mode or Information mode. If Information mode is desired, the computer  moves to a decision state  to determine if the patient's sex and age are to be used during the Information mode consultation. If not, the computer  moves to state  to request an age and sex to use in a hypothetical situation during the Information mode session. Moving to a decision state , the computer  recites the sex and age obtained at state , and asks the patient to confirm that this information is correct. If not, the computer  moves back to state  to request the age and sex again. When decision state  is true or the patient's age and sex are to be used during this consultation, as determined at state , the computer  moves to state  and sets the operating mode to be Information mode.","If decision state  is determined to be Real mode, the computer  moves to a decision state  to check if the match flag is true. If not, the system  advises the patient, at state , that the current consultation is to be performed in Pending mode. The operating mode is set to be Pending mode at state . If the match flag is true, as determined at state , the computer  sets the operating mode to be Real mode at state .","At the completion of setting the operating mode at either state , state , or state , the computer moves to a decision state . At decision state , the computer  determines if the patient desires to review the touch tone commands described during the registration process. If so, the computer  advances to state  and recites the touch tone commands. At the completion of state  or if the patient did not wish to review the touch tone commands, the computer  proceeds to a decision state  wherein the computer  determines if the patient desires to review the voice keywords described during the registration process. If so, the computer  advances to state  and recites the voice keywords. At the completion of state  or if the patient did not wish to review the voice keywords, the computer  proceeds to a decision state  wherein the computer  determines if the patient desires to enable prompting. If so, the computer  advances to state  and enables prompting. If not, prompting is disabled at state . To \u201cenable prompting\u201d means that the patient would like to be prompted for responses. This is referred to as \u201chard\u201d prompting, since this will remain in effect for the duration of the call. If hard prompting is off, and the system  has difficulty recognizing patient responses, the computer  turns on \u201csoft\u201d prompting. After the next successful recognition, the computer  turns off soft prompting.

This process  is called if the patient has selected the Diagnostic System choice in the system selection menu (, state ). Beginning at a start state , the computer moves to state  and recites a identification method menu to request complaint identification. After the initial screening questions (state , ) are completed and a medical record (registration function ) has been opened, the MDATA system  asks the patient to describe the complaint. The identification of the patient's problem is one of the most important steps in the evaluation process. The system  has built-in safeguards to ensure that the patient understands the questions and that the MDATA system  understands the patient's complaint. For example, the system keeps tables of synonyms so that any problem regarding the semantics of a question or a response can be quickly resolved. The complaint may be identified in one of four ways: by anatomic system , by cause , by alphabetic groups  or by catalog number .","The easiest and most frequently used way to identify the complaint is by anatomic system, i.e., \u201cwhat system is your problem in?\u201d. Anatomic system  refers to basic body systems such as cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous system, digestive, ear\/nose\/throat, ophthalmology, gynecology\/obstetrics, urology, blood\/hematology, skin, and endocrine. After the patient has identified the anatomic system of their complaint, they are asked a series of \u201cSystem Screening Questions\u201d at state . For each anatomic system, there are some symptoms or combinations of symptoms that, if present, would mandate immediate intervention, such that any delay, even to go any further through the menuing process, could cause harm. For example, if the patient has identified the cardiovascular system as the anatomic system in which his or her complaint lies (i.e., chest pain), the MDATA system  will ask the cardiovascular system screening questions. For example, the patient would be asked, \u201cDo you have both pressure in your chest and shortness of breath? If these symptoms are present together, immediate intervention is necessary. With the thrombolytic agents that are available today, time is critical in order to save myocardial cells. Just a few minutes can mean the difference between being able to resuscitate a patient or not.","Therefore, at state , the system  determines if a serious medical condition exists. If so, the system  moves to state , plays a message that advises the patient to seek immediate medical attention and ends the evaluation process  at a terminal state . If it is determined at state  that a serious medical condition does not exist, the system  proceeds to a complaint menu at state  and recites a list of algorithms dealing with the problem that corresponds to the anatomic system selected. The patient then selects an algorithm from the list.","If the patient is not sure of the anatomic system, the system  attempts to identify the problem by requesting the cause. Cause  refers to a cause for an illness or disease such as trauma, infection, allergy\/immune, poisoning, environmental, vascular, mental, genetic, endocrine\/metabolic, and tumor. Once the patient has identified what they think is the cause of their problem (e.g., trauma, infection), the MDATA system  asks the \u201cCause Screening Questions\u201d at state . These questions are asked to make sure that the patient is not suffering from an immediate life-threatening problem. For example, if infection were chosen as the cause, the system would first rule out the possibility of epiglottitis or meningitis before proceeding. Therefore, at state , the system  determines if a serious medical condition exists. If so, the system  moves to state , plays a message that advises the patient to seek immediate medical attention and ends the evaluation process  at a terminal state . If it is determined at state  that a serious medical condition does not exist, the system  proceeds to a complaint menu at state  and recites a list of algorithms dealing with the problem that corresponds to the cause selected. The patient then selects an algorithm from the list.","Alphabetic groups  lists the items in the anatomic system group and the cause group together in alphabetic order. Moving to state , the system determines if the selected item is from the cause subgroup of the combined alphabetic groups. If so, the system  proceeds to the \u201cCause Screening Questions\u201d at state . If not, the system moves to the \u201cSystem Screening Questions\u201d at state .","Enter Catalog number state  refers to the ability of the patient to select and enter an individual medical algorithm from a catalog of medical algorithms listed in the patient guide distributed to all patients. At the completion of state , , or , the complaint has been identified, and the computer  proceeds to state  wherein a series of \u201cinitial\u201d problem screening questions are presented to the patient. There is a different set of problem screening questions for every complaint for which advice is offered.","For the purpose of this discussion, \u201cHeadache\u201d will be used as an example to describe how the system approaches the diagnosis of a problem and provides treatment recommendations. As with many problems, there are some causes of headache that require immediate medical attention. Quite often, when a problem is very serious, any delay, even to discuss it further, can adversely affect the patient's outcome. The problem screening questions identify, at a decision state , the subset of patients whose headaches may require immediate medical care. If a serious medical condition exists, the patient is advised to seek immediate medical attention at state . The computer  then ends the evaluation process at state  and returns to state  in ","The following is an example of a problem screening question for headache:\n\n","By asking a question about the patient's level of consciousness, a dilemma has been confronted. What does the MDATA system  do about the patient whose problem itself prevents them from appropriately responding to questions or following advice?","There are some conditions that, by their very nature, may prevent patients from answering questions correctly. For this reason, the MDATA system  utilizes a \u201cmental status examination\u201d function . The mental status examination is a series of questions used to assess the patient's orientation. This function  allows the MDATA system  to assess the patent's ability to respond to questions and to follow advice. Although only shown in , the mental status examination function  is incorporated into the dialogue of any problem whose presentation could include an altered level of consciousness. Function  will be further described in conjunction with .","The MDATA system  will, of course, be accessed by patients in whom an altered level of consciousness is not expected based on the problem that the patient has. The system  does anticipate the possibility of the patient having an altered level of consciousness in some problems, e.g., when a patient consults the system for striking his or her head, and invokes the mental status exam function . However, an intoxicated patient, calling for some other complaint, e.g., a sprained ankle, is one example where the patient may not be able to understand instructions from the system . For this reason, the MDATA system also utilizes a \u201csemantic discrepancy evaluator routine\u201d (SDER) function . The SDER function provides information to the patient and then, after a predetermined period of time, asks the patient to repeat or select the information. The patient's answer is then evaluated within system . If discrepancies are determined, the system automatically invokes the mental status examination function . In another embodiment, the system  asks the patient for some information in different ways at different times, and then compares the patient's responses to determine if they are consistent. If not, the system automatically invokes the mental status examination function . Although only shown in , the SDER function  is embedded throughout system , and is randomly evoked by the computer . Function  will be further described in conjunction with .","Continuing with the headache example at state , the MDATA system  asks the next problem screening question in order to help exclude the possibility of meningitis, a very serious infection of the central nervous system.\n\n","If the answer to this question is \u201cyes\u201d, a serious medical condition exists at state  and the system  instructs the patient to seek immediate medical attention at state .","The initial screening questions (state , ) and the problem screening questions (state ) can usually be completed within a minute or so. Once the MDATA system  has excluded the causes of headache that require immediate medical attention, the system becomes a little less formal and more conversational in the subsequent states. The examples given, of course, do not represent all the initial or problem screening questions.","If no serious medical condition exists, as determined at state , the computer  proceeds to a decision state  wherein the system  identifies those patients who are \u201cre-entering\u201d the system from an earlier consultation. This occurs most frequently when the system  needs to monitor a patient's symptom over time, or if the system is initially unable to make a specific diagnosis and would like the patient to re-enter the system again, typically within a few hours. The system sets an internal re-enter flag to identify the situation where a patient is calling again for the same complaint. If the flag is set at state , the computer  proceeds to state  and branches to a re-enter point in the evaluation process depending on which medical algorithm has been evoked. The computer  moves via off-page connector A  to state  () to the appropriate re-enter point.","If the re-enter flag is not set, as determined at state , the computer  moves via off-page connector B  to a decision state  to determine if the consultation is being performed in Real mode or Pending mode. If not (i.e., the consultation is in Information mode), the computer proceeds to state  to continue the evaluation process. If the consultation is in Real or Pending mode, the computer  calls a \u201cmeta\u201d function  wherein patients are subjected to several \u201cmeta\u201d analyses. This concept will be explained in conjunction with , but, in general, it refers to the system's ability to evaluate the patient's present problem in the context of their past use of the system. The Meta function  matches various parameters against a predetermined meta threshold. When the MDATA system  opens a patient's consultation history file in database  (), it calculates how many times the patient has consulted the system for the same complaint. For each problem, the MDATA system  allows a specified number of system consultations, per unit of time, before it takes action. If the meta threshold is reached, as determined at a decision state , the MDATA system  makes a recommendation based on this fact alone at state . For example, let us assume that the threshold was set at five headaches in two months. If the patient consulted the MDATA system  for headache more than four times in two months, the threshold would be reached and the system would make an appropriate recommendation. The threshold, of course, is different for each complaint, and may be modified by a set of sensitivity factors that will be described hereinbelow. Alternately, the system  uses a time density ratio (TDR) calculated by the meta function  to determine if a recommendation should be given to the patient.","At the completion of state , or if the meta threshold was not reached at state , the computer  proceeds to state  to continue the evaluation process. State  includes a medical algorithm as selected by the patient in states , , or . As a representative example, the Microfiche Appendix contains an algorithm for Headache and includes a Headache node map with the script or description of each node having a play list. A second example node map and associated script for Convulsion or Seizure, including meta and past medical history aspects, is also included in the Microfiche Appendix. Although not necessarily a complete list, other types of medical algorithms include: Chest Pain, Heatstroke, Altered Level of Consciousness, Tremor, Dizziness, Irregular Heartbeat, Fainting, Shortness of Breath, Chest Injury, Depression, Head Injury, Cough, Croup, High Blood Pressure, Hyperventilation, Numbness, Wheezing, Inhalation Injury, and Strokes. In addition to meta and past medical history functionality, at least some of the listed medical algorithms rely upon knowledge of age and\/or sex of the patient as provided in the presently described system  at time of registration (see and ).","Depending on the medical algorithm and the exact patient condition, one or more auxiliary functions may be called by state  as follows: the mental status examination function , the SDER function , a past medical history function , a physical self examination function , a patient medical condition function , and a symptom severity analysis function . These functions will be described hereinbelow.","Returning to the headache example, after the meta analyses (function ) are completed, the MDATA system  assesses the severity of the patient's headache on a one-to-ten scale. The importance of this purely subjective quantization of the symptom's severity will become apparent later in this description.","Although the MDATA system's paradigm is fundamentally an algorithmic one, the underlying logic of the diagnostic process for headache will be described. The MDATA system  begins the diagnostic process for headache by referring to three lists stored internally in the computer .","The first list is a ranking of the most common causes of headache in the general population. The most common cause is ranked first, the second most common is ranked second, and so on. In other words, the first list ranks all the causes of headache in the general population in decreasing frequency of occurrence.","The second list is a ranking of the various causes of headache according to the seriousness of the underlying cause. The more serious causes are positioned toward the top of the list, the less serious toward the bottom. For example, meningitis, brain tumor, and subarachnoid hemorrhage would be the top three causes on the second list.","The third list is quite similar to the second list. It ranks the causes of headache according to the rapidity with which intervention is necessary. The causes of headache that require immediate intervention, such as meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage, are toward the top. The problem screening questions (state ) were developed from this list.","During the evaluation process , the MDATA system  asks the patient a series of \u201cdiagnostic screening questions.\u201d From the answers to these questions, along with any physical signs elicited from the patient (from function ), under the direction of the MDATA system , the system establishes the most likely cause of the patient's headache.","The following are examples of diagnostic screening questions for headache:\n\n","Based upon the answers to the diagnostic screening questions, the MDATA system  reorders the first list. The first list then becomes a list of the possible causes of headache in decreasing levels of probability in the patient seeking consultation. The first list is now patient specific. If the MDATA system  concludes that migraine is the most likely cause of the patient's headache, then migraine will now be ranked at the top of the first list.","The MDATA system  is knowledgeable about the difference between classic, common, and all other variants of migraine, but for this discussion the general term \u201cmigraine\u201d will be used. After reordering the first list and placing migraine at the top, the MDATA system  then asks several questions related specifically to migraine headaches. These are called the \u201cmigraine screening questions.\u201d The probability that the patient actually has a migraine headache is calculated from the answers to these questions. Each cause of headache has its own set of screening questions, physical examination signs, and, if the patient has the MDATA system's Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit, appropriate laboratory tests.","The following are examples of migraine screening questions:\n\n","After obtaining the answers to the migraine screening questions, if the probability that the patient is suffering from a migraine headache does not reach an established threshold, the next cause of headache on the reordered first list is considered and pursued as a diagnosis.","If the probability of having a migraine headache does reach the threshold, the MDATA system  asks the patient several more questions designed to confirm the presence of migraine, given the fact that the system has already determined that it is the most likely diagnosis. These are called the \u201cmigraine confirmation questions.\u201d Just as each cause of headache has a set of screening questions, each cause of headache also has a set of confirmation questions.","The following are examples of migraine confirmation questions:\n\n","From the answers to the migraine confirmation questions, the MDATA system  calculates the probability of confirmation of migraine. In Bayes' terms (which refer to the probability of certainty of a diagnosis) this is called a \u201cconditional probability.\u201d","If the probability of migraine headaches reaches threshold, but the probability of confirmation of migraine does not reach threshold, then, as mentioned, the system pursues the next diagnostic cause of headache on the patient specific list.","If the probability of the second cause of headache (say cluster) reaches threshold, then the \u201ccluster confirmation questions\u201d are asked. If they reach threshold, then again the serious causes of headache are excluded as a diagnosis.","The MDATA system  stores the scores of all the screening and confirmation questions in what are called \u201csession memory variables\u201d that are installed in the symbol table. It is, in part, these scores that are then used to determine the probability of one diagnosis versus another.","For example, if the answers to the cluster confirmation questions do not reach threshold, then the scores of the screening and confirmation questions of migraine and cluster are compared to see which cause is the more probable.","Whichever has the higher score, or exceeds the other by a predetermined threshold, is then assumed to be the more probable cause. The list is, if necessary, again reordered. This time it becomes the final diagnostic list which is a list of differential diagnoses in decreasing levels of probability for this patient.","All of the headache scoring thresholds are modified or modulated by a series of sensitivity factors as are all aspects of the system in which scalar thresholds are used. The sensitivity factors are discussed hereinbelow in section XVIII. For example, if it was found that a subset of patients in which the diagnosis of meningitis was not being made as early as it should be, then the sensitivity factor modifying the temperature threshold could be decreased so that now, a patient with a lower temperature would be instructed to seek an immediate evaluation.","Before discussing the results with the patient, however, the MDATA system  must again rule out the serious causes of headache. The problem screening questions have already filtered out those patients who have a serious cause of headache, such as meningitis, that requires immediate medical intervention.","The MDATA system  now proceeds to eliminate those causes of headache that, although serious, do not require immediate medical attention. For example, although a brain tumor is a serious cause of headache, it is not as immediately life threatening as meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage. To accomplish this task, the MDATA system  sequentially analyzes the serious causes of headache that are located at the top of the second list. The MDATA system  again asks the patient the set of screening questions associated with each of the serious causes of headache. This time, however, the MDATA system  makes sure that the probability of having any of the serious causes of headache is sufficiently low in order to exclude them from diagnostic consideration. Only after this is accomplished will the system discuss its conclusion and recommendations with the patient.","The discussion that the MDATA system would have with the migraine headache patient would include the following:\n\n","Even if the MDATA system  cannot determine with sufficient certainty what is causing the headache, it can still provide patients with valuable information and advice. For example, the patient may be told the following:\n\n","A full set of instructions will be provided.","The MDATA system is able to customize the information given to patients to accommodate the individual needs of a sponsoring agency or group such as a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or a Managed Care Plan. For example, if the system finds that the patient should see a physician, the MDATA system can determine from a patient's medical record whether they have an established relationship with an appropriate specialist. If they do, the specialist's name and phone number, or a list of participating specialists for their HMO or Managed Care Plan and any specific instructions, will be given to the patient with the recommendation to make an appointment within a specific time frame.","At the conclusion of state , the system may or may not have a reasonably certain diagnosis available. For example, the headache algorithm provides a diagnosis of migraine in response to a particular set of patient symptoms. In situations where the MDATA system  cannot determine with sufficient certainty what is causing a particular problem (no diagnosis) or in a situation where a diagnosis is available but additional information is desirable, e.g., to determine a trend, a re-enter flag may be set by the system .

For example, infection would be broken down (or subdivided) into bacterial and viral, and bacterial would be further broken down into gram positive and gram negative, and gram positive would be further yet broken down into streptococcus, and so on. The anatomic systems could be broken down in a similar way.","As a patient uses the system , and as the meta analyses for cause and for anatomic system attribute causes to disease processes and record the anatomic systems involved, a three-dimensional cube (a \u201cmeta cube\u201d) is produced composed of these stacked two-dimensional arrays. The \u201cZ\u201d axis coordinate of each layer is the time of the patient's consultation obtained from the system clock (i.e., the moment that the actual intersection of the cause and anatomic system occurs indicating the diagnosis).","The \u201cmeta cube\u201d then represents a summation of the patient's interaction with the system  through time. Although much of the patient's past history is stored using ICD-9-CM codes as well as conventional text strings in fields of the patient's medical record, the \u201cmeta cube\u201d technique allows very useful analyses to be done.","Using the same modeling metaphor, the \u201cZ\u201d axis coordinate can be used to represent the practice of medicine. Here the \u201cZ\u201d coordinate is again time, but in this representation, time refers to a spectrum of ages from pediatrics to geriatrics. Thus, each coronal plane represents specialties by time, e.g., pediatrics, adolescent medicine, adult, geriatric. A vertical plane describes a specialty by anatomic site, such as neurology or cardiology, while a horizontal plane describes a specialty which practice is bounded (subsumed) by (on) cause, such as oncology or infectious disease. To further this metaphor, the rapidity with which intervention is necessary could be a fourth dimension of the model, and the frequency of an occurrence of a disease is the fifth dimension. Ethical and moral responsibility could be a sixth dimension of the model.","Node Map Traverse Analysis","The MDATA system  uses a \u201cneural net emulator\u201d program to determine if patterns produced by patients, as they traverse down the nodes (creating \u201cnode tracks\u201d of the algorithms in the course of a consultation, may be early predictors of disease. Somewhat like the \u201cmeta cube,\u201d the \u201cnode tracks\u201d can be superimposed, rather than stacked, upon one another to create a two-dimensional array. This time, however, the pattern produced represents the sum of the patient's previous consultations. In the MDATA system , this is called a \u201cnode track traverse analysis.\u201d","For example, the MDATA system  may discover that the pattern that is produced when a patient consults the system, at different times, for episodes of diarrhea, cough, and oral candidiasis may be predictive of AIDS.

At the end of the evaluation process , any new information gathered during the session will be written to the patient's past medical history file at state  or to pending file  at state  on , depending on whether the session continued in real or pending mode. In the presently preferred embodiment, the value of Score could be zero, one, two, or three. Of course, in other embodiments, different questions to be asked of the patient may be utilized in the mental status exam function .","Referring to , the semantic discrepancy evaluator routine (SDER)  defined in will be described. The SDER  uses one or more questions that ask for the same information at different times, and in other embodiments, in different ways. The answers given by the patient are then compared within the system  to help determine the mental status of the patient.","Beginning at a start state , the computer  moves to state  and recites a message to the patient. In the presently preferred embodiment, the message is \u201cremember this three digit number. . . NUMBER\u201d, where the computer generates a random three digit number (i.e., in the range 100 to 999 inclusive) as NUMBER which is kept in a session memory variable.","Then, after a predetermined time interval at state , the computer  moves to state  and recites a request of the patient. In the presently preferred embodiment, the request is \u201cplease tell me the three digit number.\u201d The computer  then compares the number given by the patient in response to state  against the NUMBER kept in the memory variable at a decision state . If the numbers match, the computer  returns at state  with a status of pass to the evaluation process (). If the numbers do not match, the computer  returns at state  with a status of fail to the evaluation process. In the presently preferred embodiment, if the return status of the SDER  is \u201cfail\u201d, the evaluation process  automatically invokes the mental status examination function .","Referring to , the Past Medical History Routine (PMHR)  defined in will be described. The contents of a patient's past medical history file, which is part of the PMH database , are loaded to the symbol table when the patient logs in to the system . During the evaluation process , a TEST is performed by the computer  before a particular medical algorithm is initiated to verify that necessary items are present in the symbol table. The effect of a negative TEST result is that the system  prompts the patient to provide the missing past medical history information via the PMHR .","The PMHR  uses an input parameter \u201ccondition label\u201d (L) as indicated at State . The \u201cCondition label\u201d is unique, e.g., PMHRLTB corresponds to the first PMH object tested in the croup (RLTB) algorithm: diagnosis for croup in children. The label is passed so that PMHR  knows what questions to ask. The ability of the system  to ask a past medical history question in the middle of the evaluation process  is a feature that saves the patient from having to answer the entire PMH questionnaire during the registration process. The Boolean result, or scalar value, is stored in the symbol table under this label (PMHRLTB), and the algorithm can use it in decision making, e.g., If PMHRLTB=True Then  Else .","Beginning at a start state , the computer  moves to state  and prompts the patient for the missing medical condition data. Moving to state , the computer  repeats the information provided at state  and asks the patient if the repeated information is correct. Moving to a decision state , the patient responds by indicating whether the repeated information is correct. If the data is not correct, the computer  proceeds to state  to determine if the patient would like to attempt the data entry step again. If so, the computer  loops back to state  and prompts the patient for the data again. If not, the computer  returns at state  to the evaluation process ().","If the newly-entered data is correct, as determined at state , the computer  advances to state  and installs the condition label (L) and the data value in the symbol table for the patient. The computer  then returns at state  to the evaluation process .","Referring to , the Physical Self Examination function  defined in will be described. A physical examination can actually be done by the patient under the direction of the MDATA system . The MDATA system  is designed to function primarily based upon responses to carefully crafted questions, i.e., history, and physical findings elicited from the patient. There are times, however, when the addition of certain laboratory tests can increase the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as help determine the appropriate treatment recommendations. For this reason, a MDATA system Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit is available for use by patients. If the patient has the Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit, including visual field cards, Snelling chart, and possibly the MDATA system's \u201ctele-stethoscope\u201d to assess intracranial or carotid bruits, this information will be used in the diagnostic process as well.","The MDATA system  is also able to play tones of different frequencies and intensities to emulate audiometric testing for hearing acuity. This allows, for example, the MDATA system  to detect the unilateral decrease in hearing caused by an acoustic neuroma.","Beginning at a start state , the computer  branches to one or more physical self examination procedures depending on the current problem and what equipment if any is available for use by the patient. These procedures include: home diagnostic tests , vital signs , observable physical signs , clinical sound recording , and tele-stethoscope .","A variety of home diagnostic tests  are available for use by the patient. New advances in biotechnology, including a new generation of urine dipsticks such as a \u201cMultistix 8 SG\u201d produced by Ames and monoclonal antibody tests such as \u201cICON\u00ae STREP B\u201d produced by Hybritech\u00ae, allow an entire spectrum of laboratory tests to be performed at home by the patient under the direction of the MDATA system. For example, urine dipsticks can be used to check for blood, nitrites, leukocytes, or leukocyte esterase indicating cystitis or a bladder infection.","In order to use much of the monoclonal antibody technology, however, a small amount of blood must be obtained by using a fingertip lancet. This is already successfully being done by diabetics at home who use a glucometer to measure their blood sugar after pricking their finger to get a small sample of blood.","The MDATA system Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit also contains equipment to allow the patient, or someone else, to measure the patient's vital signs . A blood pressure cuff and thermometer are included with instructions for their use as well as instructions to measure pulse and respiratory rate.","The patient may be directed by the system  to observe various physical signs . For example, a headache patient will be asked to palpate their temporal artery area, and to look at themselves in the mirror to identify the ptosis and tearing of a cluster headache or to identify the steamy cornea that may occur with acute narrow angle glaucoma.","As an example of how the MDATA system Home diagnostic and Treatment Kit could be helpful, consider a woman who (using the MDATA system's urine pregnancy test based on ICON\u00ae II HCG ImmunoConcentration\u2122 Assay, produced by Hybritech\u00ae) finds out that she is pregnant. This is her first pregnancy. Later, when consulting the system for headache, a urine dipstick indicates protein in her urine and the measurement of her vital signs shows a significant rise in her blood pressure. This is a classic presentation of preeclampsia.","Instead of going to a doctor's office, patients could also use the MDATA system's Home Diagnostic and Treatment Kit to collect samples at home and then send them to a designated lab for analysis as needed. This saves time for the patient and is especially useful if the patient has difficulty in traveling. Costs should also be minimized in this type of laboratory analysis.","The MDATA system  records clinically relevant sounds  of a patient such as the cough of bronchitis, the seal bark cough of croup or the inspiratory stridor of epiglottitis. These sounds are digitized and stored in the patient's medical record. Then, using the re-enter feature of the system , the system can monitor, for example, a patient's cough over time to be sure that the cough is resolving as it should.","The general concept of recording and analyzing a cough is disclosed in the article -, C. William Thorpe, et al., published in , 1991. The cough sound analysis system describes the filtering, amplification, recording, and software processing of a cough sound. The MDATA system  uses the telephone handset microphone in conjunction with an amplifier to procure the clinical sounds. These sounds are then transmitted to the system  where they are filtered, digitized using VP board  and recorded to a file in the patient medical history database  on the hard drive  ().","The MDATA system  is building a library of clinical sounds that allows patterns or profiles to be developed that relate the wave form of the clinical sound to the probability of a particular diagnosis. For example, the MDATA system  could compare the cough of a patient to the sound library to see if the cough of the patient is similar to those that eventually have been diagnosed as lung cancer.","In addition, the patient's record of the pronunciation of his or her name may be periodically recorded and compared to previous recordings. This allows the MDATA system  to potentially detect and evaluate the hoarseness that could be produced by a nodule on the patient's vocal cords.","A \u201ctele-stethoscope\u201d  is a device that allows the sounds a physician would hear through a stethoscope to be transmitted over the telephone. The tele-stethoscope  is functionally similar to that described in the 1992 Arthur D. Little report entitled \u201cTelecommunications: Can It Help Solve America's Health Care Problems?\u201d. The tele-stethoscope  permits the MDATA system  to greatly expand the spectrum of its sound analyses to include heart murmurs, the bruits of intracranial aneurysms, breathing sounds like the wheezes of asthma and the rales of congestive heart failure, or even the bowel sounds of an intestinal obstruction.","There is more information in clinical sounds than can be represented by a two-dimensional pattern matching model. Transforms, e.g., Fourier, are used to shift different aspects of sounds into domains that can be quantified. The sounds are then pattern matched using an n-dimensional array. Consider a simple two dimensional array where time is represented on the X coordinate and amplitude is measured on the Y coordinate. For example, a cough may be recorded at two times several days apart. In this example, the computer  superimposes the waveform from one cough upon the other cough. The non-overlapping parts of the pattern both above and below represent the difference in the domain being measured between the two sounds. The area under these two curves is integrated to obtain the area. The sum of the areas of the two curves represents the difference between the two sounds in the domain being measured. The resultant area is then subjected to one or more sensitivity factors which are discussed hereinbelow. Hence, the more sensitive the system, the sooner it makes a match.","In a similar way, a sound pattern may be considered with time on the X coordinate and frequency on the Y coordinate. The same methodology is used to quantify the differences between the two curves. Thus, in a similar way, all aspects of sound can be measured.","In this pattern matching scheme, different weights are given to the different aspects of the sound depending upon which clinical sound is measured. In most sounds, the amplitude and frequency are the most important aspects. The weight or the relative importance of an aspect is different for each of various clinical sounds, such as heart murmurs, bruits, wheezes, coughs, stridor and so forth.","When value(s) from any of the procedures - are procured by the system , the computer  moves to state , recites the value and requests the patient to confirm the value. If the patient indicates that the value is correct, as determined at a decision state , the computer  proceeds to state  and installs the value into the symbol table associated with the current patient. If the value is not correct, as determined at decision state , the computer  proceeds to state  to determine if the patient would like to try providing the value again. If so, the computer  loops back to the beginning of the function . If the patient does not wish to try again, as determined at state , or if state  is completed, the computer  returns at state  to the evaluation process ().","Referring to , the Patient Medical Condition Routine  defined in will be described. In the course of executing a particular medical algorithm in the evaluation process  (as shown at state ), the computer  may request additional medical condition information of the patient. This information reflects the current condition of the patient, which is in contrast to the information requested by the past medical history routine  () for past history information. The states  through  of the routine  are essentially the same as states  through  of routine , except that in routine  the condition label (L) denotes a value for which a past medical history question is to be asked during the evaluation process, while in routine  the condition label denotes a new value desired by the algorithm. Therefore, states - are not further described herein.","Referring now to , , and , the symptom severity analysis function  defined in will be described. A review and further description of the re-enter feature, which is associated with symptom severity analysis, is also provided here.","An important feature of the MDATA system  is its ability to follow or monitor a patient over time. If the MDATA system  is in the process of diagnosing a patient's complaint but is not certain what action should be taken (states - of ), system  may ask the patient to re-enter the system at a designated time, usually within a few hours.","When the patient calls the MDATA system at the designated time, the system takes the patient through the initial problem screening questions (state  of ) in order to exclude those problems that require immediate medical attention. The system detects that the patient is a re-enter case (state  of ), and then determines the re-entry point in the evaluation process based upon the patient's previous interaction with the system (state  of ). For example, if the MDATA system established a diagnosis of migraine, that is, if both the probability of migraine and the probability of confirmation of migraine reached threshold values, the patient would not repeat the diagnostic process, which is the usual case.","Occasionally, however, a patient for whom a diagnosis has not been established will be asked to re-enter the system . This patient is again asked the diagnostic screening questions, in addition to the initial screening questions (state  of ) and problem screening questions (state  of ). If the MDATA system  is not able to establish a diagnosis for a re-enter patient, he or she is referred to a physician for further evaluation.","In addition to the re-enter feature, the MDATA system  has the capability to call patients back in order to monitor their progress. The same trending methodologies are used regardless of who initiates the call, i.e., the system or the patient. Using this capability, the MDATA system  can provide regular or periodic monitoring of elderly patients in their homes as well as inform patients when a new therapy becomes available.","Many problems for which the MDATA system  offers advice have absolute thresholds for the initial quantization of the severity of a symptom. For example, chest pain that is described by a patient as being 10 on a 10-scale of severity, would reach the problem-specific initial symptom-severity threshold and would mandate a consultation with a physician.","Interestingly, with headache, an initial severity characterized by the patient as 10 on a 10-scale would not, in itself, necessarily require an immediate consultation with a physician. If, in addition, the headache came on suddenly and, as was mentioned earlier, was described as the worst headache of the patient's life, the MDATA system  would consider this to be suggestive enough of a subarachnoid hemorrhage to advise an immediate consultation with a physician.","Continuing in the headache example, after a re-enter patient with an established diagnosis is asked the initial and problem screening questions, the MDATA system  again assesses the severity of the patient's headache. Reassessing the severity of the headache, by having the patient re-enter the system, establishes two points of reference. The system  is now able to analyze any changes in the level of severity as well as calculate the rate of change in severity over time.","The symptom severity analysis function  has a Number of Points (N) as an input parameter as indicated at state . Number of Points refers to the points of reference established during the initial consultation for a particular problem and during subsequent re-enter consultation(s). Beginning at a start state , the computer determines the value of (N), i.e., the number of reference points, at a decision state . If it is determined that N=2, the computer  moves to state  to compute the slope of a line connecting the two reference points using standard mathematical techniques. Proceeding to state , a variable named Power is set to be one because only two reference points are used at state . The computer  returns at state , with output parameters Slope and Power as determined by function , to the evaluation process ().","Using the returned Slope and Power parameters in the evaluation process , if the MDATA system  determines that the severity of the headache, for example, is increasing too rapidly, that is, if a slope of the line connecting two points on a graph of the severity reaches a set threshold, system  will make an appropriate recommendation.","If the MDATA system  finds that the severity of the headache is staying the same or is getting worse but is doing so at a relatively slow rate, it may ask the patient to re-enter the system a second time (i.e., for a third consultation), usually within a shorter period of time. The third consultation gives the MDATA system  three points of reference from which to trend the severity of the headache. Thus, when the function  is called by the evaluation process, the value of (N) is three, as determined at state , and the computer  branches to state . At state , the computer  determines the slope and power of a line connecting the three reference points. The presently preferred embodiment uses the well-known Runge-Kutta method, which is a numerical approximation technique for solving differential equations. Other embodiments may use other well-known, standard curve fitting functions at state .","If the system  determines that yet one or more additional consultations, i.e., beyond three consultations, are desired, e.g., to establish a trend with certainty, it will again request the patient to re-enter the system at a later time. In this situation, the three most recent reference points are used in the calculation at state .","The system  then performs a \u201csequential symptom-severity slope analysis\u201d to determine if the symptom is getting worse too rapidly as follows. The slopes of the lines connecting the first and second point, the second and third point, and then the first and third point are calculated. If any of these reach a problem-specific threshold, the appropriate recommendation is given.","If the sequential symptom-severity slope analysis does not reveal the need to seek medical attention, then the MDATA system , in addition to calculating the rate of change in the severity of the symptom with respect to time (the slope analysis), now calculates the rate of change of the rapidity with which the headache is getting worse. This is the first derivative.","Table 4 illustrates this relationship below. Time maps onto the \u201cX\u201d axis and the symptom's severity maps onto the \u201cY\u201d axis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0337","num":"0463"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00018","num":"00018"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 4"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"35.05mm","wi":"50.29mm","file":"US07306560-20071211-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Note that a line connecting these three points forms a gently sloping straight line.

In the MDATA system , this analysis is termed an \u201cexponential symptom-severity filter.\u201d All patients who re-enter the system a second time are subjected to this analysis.","It is important to note that the severity of a problem, e.g., a headache, is not necessarily related to the seriousness of the underlying cause. The MDATA system  is programmed such that when any symptom gets rapidly worse, medical intervention is frequently advised as necessary. This concept is valid for many symptoms.","Returning to the symptom severity analysis function  (), if the function  is called with N=0, or N=1, the computer branches to state . At state , the Slope and Power parameters are set to zero, and the computer  returns these parameters at state  to the evaluation process (). The values set at state  essentially flag an error condition that is acted on by the evaluation process .","Referring to , the Treatment Table process  defined in will be described. The MDATA system  is modularized in its approach to diagnosis and treatment. In medicine, diagnosis simply means figuring out what is causing the problem, and treatment refers to what action should be taken once the cause of the problem is known.","Diagnosis is composed of history, physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. Again, history is by far the most important factor in making the diagnosis. In fact, in medical school, students are taught that if they don't have a good idea of the diagnosis by the end of the history, they are doing something wrong.","The treatment side of medicine is conceptually different from diagnosis in that, while the basic principles of making the diagnosis remain the same, treatment is continually changing. Treatment is fundamentally a \u201clook-up\u201d table with the diagnosis, age and sex on the left and the most current treatment on the right as shown in Table 6. Or, treatment can be thought of like the cubbyholes or boxes of a post office. Each individual box holds the treatment for a given disease. The information given is age and sex specific. The contents of the box are constantly changing, but the location of the box does not. For example, what is thought to be the best antibiotic to treat meningitis in a two-year-old child could literally change from week to week as more antibiotics are developed and approved or more controlled studies are published.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0347","num":"0473"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00020","num":"00020"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Simplified TREATMENT TABLE Example"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Diagnosis","Treatment"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"meningitis in a two-year old child","antibiotic of choice"]},{"entry":[{},{},"as of current date"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The MDATA system  maintains a treatment table that can be updated instantaneously to provide the most current treatment recommendations.","The treatment table can be directly accessed by patients who already know their diagnosis. For example, asthma patients can consult the system as often as they wish to see what the absolute latest treatment is for their condition. In fact, links are maintained between the treatment table and the patient medical history files . In this way, when a new treatment is introduced for any of the ICD\u25a1\u25a1CM codes listed in the MDATA system , patients can be contacted and asked to either call the system  back at their convenience or have the MDATA system  fax or mail the information to them. The MDATA system  can also notify patients' doctors when a new treatment is identified.","The concept of using a table is also helpful with regard to two aspects of the diagnostic process that often do change: the imaging modality of choice (like X-ray, Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)), and the laboratory test(s) of choice. Therefore, the MDATA system  also maintains a table for imaging modality of choice as well as laboratory test(s) of choice in the work-up or diagnosis of a particular complaint. By modularizing these aspects of the diagnosis, as new imaging techniques, like Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning, and new laboratory tests, like recombinant DNA technology, are discovered, only the tables have to be altered, not the medical algorithms themselves.","The treatment table will be further described in a general way as process  in .

The menu-driven treatment selection process  begins with start state  and proceeds to state  wherein the computer  recites an area menu to the patient and requests selection of one area. The complete menu is not shown in state . The areas are arranged by anatomic system. For example, if a patient has epilepsy, the patient can simply select this from the anatomic system menu for the neurological system.","Based on the patient's selection, the computer  branches to a selection area menu state, such as neurological area menu state , wherein the computer  recites a list of diagnoses to the patient and requests selection of a diagnosis. In some cases the diagnosis is further subdivided by gender, age or both gender and age. At state , for example, for a diagnosis of meningitis, the computer  would prompt the patient to select from a secondary menu between a treatment for a child two years old or younger and a treatment for somebody over two years old. Then, based on the patient's selection, the computer  sets a memory variable \u2018M\u2019 to the value of the selected diagnosis message number at state  or . State  is another example secondary level menu which has four choices based on gender and age. These four choices are associated with four states, , , , , wherein the computer  sets the memory variable \u2018M\u2019 to the value of the diagnosis message number that was selected at state . After the catalog number has been stored in memory variable \u2018M\u2019, the computer  moves to return state  wherein the menu-driven treatment selection process terminates and returns control to the treatment table process .","Area menu  and AreaN menu  are indicative of menus similar to menu  but for different anatomic systems. Menu  and  may have secondary menus, similar to menus  and  under menu . Then, states  and  are indicative of the computer  setting memory variable \u2018M\u2019 to the value of the diagnosis message number selected from the parent menu  or , respectively.","The MDATA system paradigm is based on several fundamental principles. They are as follows:\n\n","As mentioned earlier, one of the purposes of the MDATA system  is to bring together highly qualified medical experts, encode their knowledge in a central location, and make this information available to everyone.","Although the issue of accessibility has been discussed several times, it is important to understand its significance. Accessibility in the MDATA system  refers both to the way in which the medical information can be retrieved from the system  by non-medically trained personnel as well as to the need for people everywhere to easily and promptly obtain medical information. By using the already established worldwide telecommunications network, the MDATA system  can provide universal and nearly instantaneous access to high quality, 100%-consistent medical advice.","In the MDATA system , the concepts of modularity and modifiability are inextricably intertwined. Modularity is the key to the MDATA system's ability to provide patients with the most current medical information available. The MDATA system's modular design and object oriented techniques allow the individual components of the system to be modified or updated without generating a ripple effect on other information in the system .","In contrast, the print media suffers from an inability to quickly adapt to changing information. Once a book or journal is published, it cannot be modified until its next publishing date. The MDATA system , however, can be modified within hours of a new discovery in medicine. Easy modifiability is another way in which the MDATA system  is qualitatively different from previously published algorithms.","Once the medical algorithms for the MDATA system  are written and programmed, they can then be continuously updated and refined as advances in medicine are made. Unfortunately, physicians today are simply not able to keep up with the explosion of new medical information and technology. This ability to nearly instantaneously modify the MDATA system  is a powerful feature of the system.","It is presently possible for a computer to search the world's medical literature daily. Any articles pertaining to a particular topic can automatically be requested and the information used to update the system.","In addition, the MDATA system  is currently using optical character recognition technology to digitize its medical database. Then, using indexing techniques, the MDATA system  is able to search for and retrieve any information desired. For example, the system can search for the character string \u201cheadache\u201d and retrieve any amount of surrounding text or graphic information. This information is then collected, collated, printed and referred to the physician(s) maintaining the headache algorithm. This process will become easier as more of the world's medical literature is digitized.","Global Factors\u2014Sensitivity and Selectivity","Another way in which the MDATA system is modifiable is in its use of global sensitivity\/selectivity factors. As with every decision, there is always a balance to be achieved between risk and benefit, and so with the MDATA system . One of the questions the MDATA system  tries to answer is whether the patient needs to be seen immediately by a physician. This leads to this discussion about sensitivity and selectivity.","Sensitivity and selectivity are statistical terms that refer to how accurately a decision can be made. In this case, sensitivity refers to the number of patients which the MDATA system  did not think needed to be seen by a physician but that actually did.","If the program were to be so sensitive that no disease process that eventually required meaningful physician intervention would be treated at home (no false negatives), then every single complaint would necessitate a visit to the doctor, which is a useless system. On the other hand, too selective a system (no false positives) i.e., no unnecessary visits to the doctor's office, would necessitate that an attempt be made at home treatment for every complaint, which is a useless and dangerous system.","So again, a balance must be reached between these two ends of the spectrum. To achieve this, the sensitivity\/selectivity ratio of the entire MDATA system  can be changed by setting or tuning a plurality of sensitivity factors. These sensitivity factors affect the following functions: meta thresholds, re-enter horizon threshold, frequency of call back, symptom-severity filters, sequential slope filters, exponential symptom-severity filters, and probabilities of diagnoses in the treatment table. In addition, as in the headache example, the scoring of the screening questions already weighted is modulated or modified by the sensitivity factors.","Experience from the regionalization of trauma centers in this country shows an interesting trend over time with respect to sensitivity and selectivity. It has been shown that the inverse relationship between sensitivity and selectivity, when plotted over time, yields a sinusoidal wave form in which the amplitude of the wave form gradually decreases with time as the system is \u201cfined tuned\u201d as shown below in Table 9.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0376","num":"0508"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00023","num":"00023"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 9"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"43.26mm","wi":"71.54mm","file":"US07306560-20071211-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The MDATA system's sensitivity factors are designed to do just that, i.e., fine tune the system over time to find the right balance between sensitivity and selectivity.","In addition to the use of global factors, the MDATA system  maintains what are termed \u201cemergency filter response sets.\u201d When a patient replies \u201cyes\u201d to any of the problem screening questions, the recommendation or message that follows is called an emergency filter response or \u201cEFR.\u201d The EFR sets are modularized so that the system can customize the message that the patient hears. This allows the system  to match the EFR sets to the desired level of sensitivity or selectivity as well as provide information specific to an HMO or Managed Care Plan.","System Sensitivity Factors","There are ten sensitivity factors that affect threshold determination in the MDATA system :\n\n","Initially, the sensitivity factors have a value of 1.0. The sensitivity factor's value is usually inversely proportional to sensitivity; i.e., if the value is decreased, sensitivity increases.","The sensitivity factors are applied to the threshold constant value in the relational expression component of an IF-Then or If-Then-Else statement of a medical algorithm. For example, let's assume that the system  is in the meningitis algorithm and that a temperature greater than 102 degrees will trigger a recommendation to go to a hospital. An example of a threshold calculation without sensitivity factors follows:\n\n","The use of the sensitivity factors permits anticipation of change. Tuning the initial product of the sensitivity factors from \u201c1.00\u201d to \u201c0.95\u201d would decrease the temperature at which the system recommends a trip to the hospital. Each threshold calculation or other use of the sensitivity factors may use any number of (e.g., two factors) and any combination of the factors. Additionally, any combination of factors may be modified from the initial 1.0 value in any particular threshold calculation.","Age criteria is also modified by use of the sensitivity factors. For example: If Age >45*S*S then X else Y.","Examples of areas the system  could be tuned follow:\n\n","The sensitivity factors affect the following system  functions:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0386","num":"0538"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00024","num":"00024"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Meta(\u201cNHDA\u201d, \u201c****\u201d, \u201c**********\u201d, 06\/01\/93, 12\/31\/93)"]},{"entry":[{},"If MC > = 3 then 100 else 101"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0387","num":"0539"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00025","num":"00025"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Meta(\u201cNHDA\u201d, \u201c****\u201d, \u201c**********\u201d, 06\/01\/93, 12\/31\/93)"]},{"entry":[{},"If MC > = (3 * S1 * S4) then 100 else 101"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0388","num":"0540"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00026","num":"00026"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Meta(\u201c****\u201d, \u201c****\u201d, \u201cI*********\u201d, 06\/01\/93, 12\/31\/93)"]},{"entry":[{},"If TDR > = 2.0 then 200 else 201"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0389","num":"0541"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00027","num":"00027"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Meta(\u201c****\u201d, \u201c****\u201d, \u201cI*********\u201d, 06\/01\/93, 12\/31\/93)"]},{"entry":[{},"If TDR > = (2.0 * S1 * S4) then 200 else 201"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Thus, there is no necessity to change the algorithms themselves. In other words, the factors can be modified rather than changing the algorithms.\n\n","There are four main types of video imaging: static black and white, static color, video black and white and video color. Each of these main types is now discussed.","Images as basic as static black and white images can provide useful information to the system . Static black and white imaging is used with neural net pattern matching. This process permits analyzing for example, facial features to aid in the detection of certain diseases, such as the characteristic facies of Cushing's syndrome or the exophthalmos of Graves disease.","Color static imaging allows color frequency analysis to detect diseases that are not as readily detected with static black and white imaging, such as cyanosis of respiratory failure or the scleral icterus of hepatitis. Color thus provides an incremental benefit in the level of disease detection.","Real time black and white video imaging allows for the evaluation of physical signs such as pupillary responses, extra ocular muscle function, lid lag, and nystagmus. Cranial nerve function can be remotely evaluated, along with, for example, the distinction between central and peripheral VII nerve function.","Color video imaging, especially using fiber optics, adds much more capability in the evaluation of a patient's condition. For example, color video imaging is very useful in evaluating capillary refill or monitoring the response of a patient with cyanosis to supplemental oxygen. Another embodiment of the system  may employ inexpensive laser sources to perform real time holographic imaging.","It is rare when the humanitarian and entrepreneurial interests of a venture overlap. The confluence of purpose that exists in the MDATA system is striking. It is a \u201cwin-win\u201d proposition from every perspective.","Not only will the MDATA system  substantially reduce the overwhelming costs of our current health care system, but for the first time in history, every person can have access to high quality, 100%-consistent and affordable medical advice and information. No matter from what perspective one views the MDATA system , its benefits are substantial.","The health care consumer obviously gains the most. Now, whenever he or she has a medical problem, or any member of their family, an immediate consultation can be obtained. The knowledge that the best health care information and medical advice is only a telephone call away can assuage the anxiety of everyone from new mothers to elderly patients confined to their homes.","By endorsing the MDATA system , federal, state and local governments could discharge their obligation to provide a universal and affordable level of health care for all of their citizens. In addition, the MDATA system  helps care for patients who cannot pay, thus relieving primary care physicians of the necessity to provide care without reimbursement. For the first time, Health Maintenance Organizations and Managed Care Plans will be able to effectively screen patients by telephone in order to ensure that patients are best matched with the services they need.","Specialists can use their talents, not on the repetition of familiar rituals, but will be free to concentrate on those more challenging problems that cannot easily be resolved by the MDATA system . They will also benefit from an increased number of patient referrals as well as having a well-constructed patient history when a consultation is sought.","Physicians themselves can access the MDATA system  in order to stay informed about new information and technological advances in the medical field. This is particularly true with the treatment, imaging, and laboratory test databases.","Medical information is a continually renewable resource because it is not consumed in its dissemination. The opportunity exists, through the MDATA system , for the United States to provide much needed medical information to the world and, at the same time, bring capital into this country. In the process, this country could maintain its leadership in innovation, technology, and software development.","The United States and the world are facing a health care crisis so monumental that it is difficult to comprehend. There are diseases that threaten our very survival as a species. All of us know the apprehension and bewilderment we feel when an illness strikes. When this occurs, we need answers to specific medical questions, answers that are absolutely up-to-date, instantly available, and affordable.","The key is information: information about prevention, early detection of disease, and about its most efficient treatment. The MDATA system  can provide this information through the simple use of the telephone, to nearly every inhabitant of the planet. In addition, the MDATA system  converts and explains complicated medical terminology and concepts into language easily understood by everyone.","People do not have to be ill to consult the MDATA system , just curious. Patients do not have to schedule appointments, they can simply pick up the telephone. Although many patients will later be seen by a physician, the MDATA system  can provide immediate help for everyone. The MDATA system  at once establishes egalitarian access to health care information. Although many patients in this country receive state-of-the art medical care, there is a large segment of the population that is deprived of one the most basic health care and medical information. The MDATA system  begins to close this enormous gap.","The MDATA system  begins to effect a restructuring of the health care delivery system in which both health care consumers and providers participate in the improvement of the system itself. The MDATA system  and its patients will be in partnership to provide the most current, economical, and concise treatment available. The upside potential is unlimited. Whether one believes health care is a right or a privilege, there can be no doubt that it is fundamentally necessary. Whether one believes we have a civic responsibility or a moral obligation to care for one another, it must be done. The fundamental simplicity of the structure of the MDATA system  belies its power as a highly useful tool in the delivery of health care.","A second embodiment of the MDATA system entails a major shift of how the questions and responses are delivered to the patient. Rather than the use of a telephone, the voice processing and voice response technology, the system software is published via media such as floppy disks, CD ROM, or PCMCIA cards for use on a patient's personal computer. This second embodiment is referred to as the screen version or the (Stand-Alone) SA-MDATA system. The computer could be, for example, a desktop computer, a laptop or notebook computer, or a handheld, pen-driven computer. The system questions are displayed on a display screen that is part of the computer or is connected to the computer. The patient uses a keyboard or a pointing\/writing device connected to the computer to respond to the questions. The patient files are maintained and updated within the computer or on removable storage devices. The diagnosis, advice, and treatments can be displayed on the screen and also printed in hardcopy form on a printer (if available). New versions of the SA-MDATA system are either mailed to subscribers are available via modem. These new versions may include updates of the treatment table for new treatments. Another embodiment of the SA-MDATA system may include using specialized receiver devices that receive encoded FM signals on a demand basis when an event (a new treatment) triggers the device, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,030,948.","A unique and separate authoring language (called File Output or FO) was used to develop the medical algorithms used in the screen version embodiment of the system . Through the use of FO, the contents of text files are presented online to users, and then the users respond to questions and directions issued by the text files.","FO is designed as a typical, generalized authoring language, in which commands are embedded into text files (herein called FO files) to perform specific screen and keyboard functions. FO files are in effect programs written in the FO \u201clanguage\u201d that communicate (via FO) with the user online.","FO adds no text of its own. In fact, FO does not need to know what text file content it is executing. The programmer or author of a FO file is in complete control of the text content and the sequence in which it is presented. Using the various commands described in the Authoring Language Syntax document listed in the Microfiche Appendix, the author can display text, format the screen, ask the user questions, input responses from the user, select different text files for execution, and generally control and direct the entire session.","This version of FO is intended as a development version that gives the user much freedom at the keyboard. The user can interrupt a presentation and edit the FO file being presented. The assumption here is that the user is in fact the author or an alpha tester charged with verifying and correcting file content.","A FO file is any standard sequential ASCII text file with variable-length lines terminating with a Carriage Return (ASCII 13). Any line with a period in column one is treated as a command. A line without a leading period is treated as a print command.","The FO program processes a FO file by reading it one line at a time into memory. If the line is a text line, it is printed and the next line is loaded. If the line is a command line, the command is executed. If the command involves a wait on the user (such as a .M command), FO continues loading the FO file behind the scenes until it has been completely loaded. In this manner, FO executes the FO file as it is loading it. Once loaded, the FO file remains entirely in memory.","The system software for the screen version embodiment is written in Borland Turbo Pascal version 3.0. A second version of the system software for the screen version embodiment of the system  is written in Microsoft G.W. Basic and is run in interpretive mode. The Microfiche Appendix contains the following for the screen version:\n\n","In yet other embodiments, other databases\/files or algorithms can be used. The general system, method and procedures would remain the same. For example, a specialty field such as sports medicine could be added to the system.","The MDATA system  described herein finds application in many environments, and is readily adaptable for use therein. For example, the system finds use in any application that is step-oriented and can be algorithmically described. For example, the system could give car diagnostic services over the phone to a caller. Then, when the car is brought to a service facility for repairs (treatment), the caller will be informed and have a good idea of what the problem is and probable repairs will be. Accordingly, the claims are to be interpreted to encompass these and other applications of the invention within their scope and are not to be limited to the embodiments described herein.","One of the main problems of the health care crisis is the limited access to health care information when it is needed. The MDATA system provides up-to-date medical information and advice that is instantly available twenty-four hours a day. The advice that is given is 100% consistent.","The quality of the advice is much better if a physician can stop, research, and anticipate all possible causes of a problem and then systematically go about dealing with all of these possible causes. In medical practice, a physician just does this from memory.","No humans are necessary to actually give the medical advice. The MDATA system is automated which helps to bring down the cost of health care.","An exact record of the questions asked and the answers given is stored in the patient's database. The MDATA system time-and-date stamps the responses to the questions (as transaction records) so that an exact reconstruction of the patient's interview(s) can be generated for use by a physician or other health care professional. The system also keeps a record of what version of an algorithm has been consulted as well as the sensitivity factor set for that consultation. At the conclusion of the interaction, the MDATA system can tell the patient how long the consultation has taken and what charges have been incurred, if any.","When possible, the MDATA system  takes into account the past medical history of the patient, especially those pieces of information learned from past consultations with the MDATA system , before advice is given. In addition, the advice given is different depending upon the age and sex of the patient. The \u201cmeta\u201d functions provide another advantage by allowing the MDATA system  to evaluate a problem in the context of the patient's prior consultations with the system.","Background","The Medical Diagnostic and Treatment Advice (MDATA) system is a computer system that conducts automated interviews of patients for the purpose of establishing a medical diagnosis. The MDATA system consists of a number of databases of medical information and programs (e.g. diseases, symptoms, treatments, medications, scripts) as well as supporting software to provide services to its user community (patients, doctors, nurses, laboratories, health management organizations (HMOs)).","To conduct the interviews, MDATA uses \u201cscripts\u201d, which are, essentially, program modules that know how to interview a patient about a given complaint, access patient medical records, and use the supporting databases to diagnose and advise patients.","The MDATA system has been previously described as using the telephone network to connect patients to a MDATA computer on which the MDATA system runs. Referring to , this portion of the patent application describes a networked embodiment  of the MDATA system that uses communications networks , such as the Internet to connect the MDATA computer(s) \/ to an on-line patient  using a network access processor or patient computer .","The MDATA Computer","The MDATA computer (on which the MDATA system resides and runs) can be a single computer such as a server  () or the MDATA computer  of . However, it can also be configured as several servers  () connected by a Local Area Network (LAN) or a Wide-Area Network (WAN), in several LANs or WANs that are distributed around the country, or as some combination of these methods, such as shown at  (). Whichever configuration is used, the MDATA computer is the central corporate tool to:\n\n","The MDATA software, previously described above, is modified or extended to accommodate the Internet's communication protocols and the patient computer's storage, processing, and display capabilities. These changes to the MDATA system consist of changes in its input\/output subsystem, which is modified to communicate with the Internet and (via the Internet) with the computer of the on-line patient. These changes are described in this document in a section that describes how the MDATA system uses networks, such as the Internet, to perform its functions, and in a section that describes the impact of having a computer available at the patient's location.","The Internet","The Internet connects about 50,000 computer networks, which in turn connect about 5 million computers, which serve an estimated 50 million users. The Internet connects many diverse networks of many different computer hardware\/software makes, versions, formats, codes, and protocols. There is no single \u201coperating system\u201d for the Internet, but there are various widely used file formatting, site locating, message routing, and display encoding standards. To participate on the Internet, a host computer's operating system must acquire and uses such Internet-smart software, which is widely available commercially.","The Internet solves the problem of incompatible hardware and software mix by extending the file name with prefixes that identify the protocol (and other things) that apply to the file. For example, many Internet filenames begin with \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d, which indicates that this file should be handled by software that understands the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a program that knows how to follow embedded pointers or \u201clinks\u201d to files on other Internet computers.","The Remote Login Concept","One way to use the Internet is as an access mechanism for running programs on a remote host computer. Instead of dialing in from a telephone, the user dials in via the Internet. All of the application data and processes are stored and manipulated on the host computer. The Internet serves only to transmit the user keystrokes and mouse clicks to the host, and to return the host computer output to the user computer. On the Internet, remote login is supported by Telnet and rlogin protocols. These use a simple command line protocol familiar to those who have ever used DOS on a PC. They are available in UNIX versions as well as for GUI-oriented systems like Windows.","Remote login represents a way for the MDATA system to use the Internet as an I\/O device for patients, doctors, laboratories, HMOs, and so on to gain access to the central MDATA computer. That is, patients log in to and are diagnosed by MDATA software running on the MDATA computer.","The HTML Concept","To transmit text in readable form, the Internet software begins with ASCII code and \u201cmarks it up\u201d with special codes to indicate special text handling such as bold, underlining, colors and fonts, and so on. The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code assigns a unique number to every letter, digit, punctuation mark, as well as some control actions such as new-line, tab, and end-of-text. The HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) adds text treatment instructions. For example, to display a word in some emphasized manner, HTML may encode it as follows:\n\n","The local display software detects the <EM> tags and substitutes some emphasizing action so that on the local screen the text may appears as\n\n","After a sending computer transmits a page over the Internet to a receiving computer, no further interaction is normally required or expected between the two computers. After loading the page, the sending software can go on to handle other requests.","However, to engage in a two-way conversation with the remote user, the user's response must be handled. This is done by Internet software using a special protocol called CGI (Common Gateway Interface). Using CGI, when the user clicks a hypertext field in an HTML file, or fills in a HTML \u201cform\u201d, the Internet software sends a \u201creply\u201d back to the original sender, where it is intercepted and handled by a CGI program. The CGI concept is to insert a software step that \u201ccatches\u201d user responses and processes them. The CGI protocol supports two-way communication between the remote computers via the Internet, and supports the storing of session-specific data between sessions. This preserves the \u201cstate\u201d of the communication, so that a continuous dialog can be generated.","The features and advantages that CGI-invoked programs offer to the MDATA system are that they:\n\n","The Java concept is an example of a software mechanism for attaching executable processes to the HTML page, transmitting them, and then running them on the receiving computer. Whereas CGI-invoked programs run on the sender's computer and are \u201cblind\u201d to the capabilities of the remote receiver's machine, the Java approach essentially permits both data and programs to be transmitted across the Internet. The HTML programmer basically writes application source code in Java and appends it to the HTML page. When the user's browser displays the HTML page on the user's computer, it executes (actually \u201cinterprets\u201d) the Java code and handles the input\/output to the user. Since the browser is written for the user's computer, it \u201cknows\u201d the user's system, and can take full advantage of this fact.","The Java concept is merely an illustration of the concept of transmitting programs to the receiver. In fact, any executable software can be appended to the HTML page, provided the receiver knows how to read and interpret or execute it. Any number of other codes and languages can be used to do this for the MDATA system. Ultimately, the MDATA system can transmit the necessary MDATA support software to its subscribers.","Advantages of MDATA on a Network","Using the Internet and its software mechanisms such as HTML, CGI, and Java permits the MDATA system to:\n\n","Referring to , the user\/patient  communicates with a computing environment. The computing environment may include a single computer utilizing MDATA software or the computing environment may include multiple computers in a client\/server relationship on a computer network. In a client\/server environment, the server includes the MDATA system which communicates with a client that may include a network terminal equipped with a video display, keyboard and pointing device. The network terminal is connected to a wide area network via a network connection, which may be either a dial-up connection using a modem and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or via a dedicated data circuit. The wide area network can be a public network, like the Internet, or a closed, private data network, like a corporate network or an intranet. There is an array of servers which host the medical advice and treatment applications and the patient databases at a central MDATA location. These servers are connected via a local area network to a network gateway, which provides access to the wide area network via a high-speed, dedicated data circuit. Alternatively, a single server may host the medical advice and treatment applications and the patient databases.","The Patient's Computer","A significant advantage of using the Internet to run the MDATA system is the fact that, at the patient's location, there is now a computer  () or other network access device instead of just a telephone (as in ). This means that the MDATA system can use the patient computer's processing and storage capabilities to handle at least some part of the MDATA storage and processing load. The patient's computer can be used to:\n\n","A \u201cgraphic user interface\u201d (GUI) is low-level computer software that exploits the display properties of a CRT as an output device for human users and combines it with a pointing device such as a mouse or joystick to handle graphical input. Color monitors and operating systems that support GUI software have been in use for some 15 years now and are well-documented. Three good examples are: Apple's Macintosh System, Microsoft's Windows, and IBM's OS\/2.","Given that there is a computer to handle graphic input\/output at the patient's end, the MDATA system encodes the medical script operations into some Internet-compatible protocol, such as HTML. That is, to move the MDATA system from a telephone-based system to the Internet, the MDATA software responsible for input\/output is swapped out for a module that handles the Internet protocol.","In addition to redirecting the input\/output traffic, given the flexibility of a GUI-based operating system, the MDATA system can be enhanced in numerous ways. For example, using a GUI, MDATA diagnostic scripts can:\n\n","Referring again to , the networked MDATA system  includes a network \u201ccloud\u201d , which may represent a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or another connection service.","The MDATA programs and databases preferably reside on a group of servers  that are preferably interconnected by a LAN  and a gateway  to the network . Alternatively, the MDATA programs and databases reside on a single server  that utilizes network interface hardware and software . The MDATA servers \/ store the diagnostic scripts used by the script engine, described hereinbelow.","The network  may connect to a user computer , for example, by use of a modem or by use of a network interface card. The user  at computer  may utilize a browser  to remotely access the MDATA programs using a keyboard and\/or pointing device and a visual display, such as monitor . Alternatively, the browser  is not utilized when the MDATA programs are executed in a local mode on computer . A video camera  may be optionally connected to the computer  to provide visual input, such as visual symptoms.","Various other devices may be used to communicate with the MDATA servers \/. If the servers are equipped with voice recognition or DTMF hardware, the user can communicate with the MDATA program by use of a telephone , as described in the telephonic embodiment above. Other connection devices for communicating with the MDATA servers \/ include a portable personal computer  with a modem or wireless connection interface, a cable interface device  connected to a visual display , or a satellite dish  connected to a satellite receiver  and a television . Other ways of allowing communication between the user  and the MDATA servers \/ are envisioned.","Referring to , a diagram of a presently preferred user\/patient computer shows several possible interconnections to the network. ,  and  show the major software used to \u201cplay\u201d a script, a special program called a Script Engine is used, which reads a MDS file and uses its codes to perform interview actions, such as outputting a question to a patient and inputting an answer. The script engine also collect the answers from the patient, evaluate the answers, issue a diagnosis, and update the patient's medical record. The script engine preferably resides in the user computer. The script engine may be stored on the hard drive or CD-ROM, and is loaded into the main memory for execution.","The components of a presently preferred computer , utilized by a user  of the computerized MDATA system  of the present invention, are shown in . Alternatively, other devices for conducting a medical interview, such as those shown in , can be utilized in place of the computer .","The computer  includes a plurality of components within an enclosure . A telephone line  interfaces the public telephone network  to the computer  via a modem . The telephone network  may connect to the network , which has connections with the MDATA system server(s) \/. Alternatively, the user may connect to the network  by use of a network interface card .","Throughout this document, the words user and patient are used interchangeably. However, it will be understood that the user may be acting as a proxy for the patient. If this is the case, the user is registered as an assistant for the patient.","The hardware and system software are assembled with two basic concepts in mind: portability to other operating systems and the use of industry standard components. In this way, the system can be more flexible and will allow free market competition to continually improve the product, while, at the same time, decreasing costs. While specific hardware and software may be referenced, it will be understood that a panoply of different components could be used in the present system.","The computer  preferably is a personal computer with an Intel Pentium microprocessor . Other computers, such as an Apple Macintosh, an Amiga, a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX, or an IBM mainframe, could also be utilized. The modem  or the network interface card  connect to an industry standard architecture (ISA) or a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus . The bus  interconnects the microprocessor  with a plurality of peripherals through controller circuits (chips or boards).","The computer bus  has a plurality of peripherals connected to it through adapters or controllers. A video adapter board , preferably at SVGA or better resolution, interconnects to a video monitor . A serial communication circuit  interfaces with a pointing device, such as a mouse . A parallel communication circuit may be used in place of circuit  in another embodiment. A keyboard controller circuit  interfaces with a keyboard . A 500 Mb or greater hard disk drive  and an optional CD-ROM drive  are preferably attached to the bus . The hard disk  stores database files such as the patient files, other MDATA files, and binary support files. The CD-ROM drive  also stores database files, such as files for the patients using the computer , and binary support files.","A main memory  connects to the microprocessor . In the presently preferred embodiment, the computer  preferably operates under the Windows 95 operating system . The memory  contains a diagnostic script engine  that preferably utilizes a disease\/symptom\/question (DSQ) list script engine . In one embodiment, the script engine software is written in Borland Delphi Pascal, version II. Of course, any other computer language could be used.","Referring to both and , the user interface includes a graphical network browser client, such as Netscape or Mosaic, which interacts with the MDATA server. An enhanced user interface may incorporate small graphical applications, e.g., Java applets, downloaded from the server and executed on the user's network terminal. Java is a new language developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. for programming applications on the Internet.","As the user proceeds through a diagnostic process, information on the user's medical condition is communicated to the MDATA system by completing or answering screen-displayed forms or by pointing at an item on the display and clicking with a mouse. The diagnostic process retrieves data from the patient and other MDATA databases and stores the users responses via common gateway interface (CGI) script language utilities or by use of a Web server application programming interface (API), such as a Netscape Applications Programming Interface (NSAPI) or the Microsoft Internet Server Applications Programming Interface (ISAPI).","If the user's network terminal is equipped with a camera, such as a digital still camera or a video camera, then the MDATA system is capable of capturing imagery of the patient over time. For medical conditions that require treatment by a health care provider, a chronological sequence of images allows the health care professional to make an assessment of the patient's condition by analyzing visual manifestations of an infection or disease.","Likewise, if the user's network terminal is equipped with a microphone, then the MDATA system is capable of capturing clinical sounds provided by the patient (e.g., a cough or the wheezing of asthma). The MDATA system can assist a health care professional in the assessment of a patient's medial condition by playing back the clinical sounds it captured.","MDATA System Structures","Referring to , a set of processes, files, and databases utilized by the networked MDATA system  will be described. Except for the script engine process, the MDS database, the Imaging Modality database, and the Laboratory Test database, which are described hereinbelow, these processes, files, and databases were previously described above.","The MDATA system  utilizes several principal processes and related databases. A set of patient login processes  is used by the system  to identify a patient who has previously registered into the system in one of three ways: 1) by prompting for a patient identification number (PIN); 2) identify an assistant who has previously registered into the system by prompting for an assistant identification number (AIN); 3) identify a patient, having an assistant, who has previously registered into the system by prompting for the patient identification number. A set of processes  are used to register a patient or assistant. If the user is the patient, a patient registration process is used by the system to register new or first-time patients. If the user is not the patient, an assistant registration process is used by the system to register new or first-time assistants. Then, if the patient is not already registered, an assisted patient registration process is used by the system to register the patient.","Once a user has logged in or registered, the system provides a choice of processes. The primary process of concern in the current embodiment is the Diagnostic process  that performs a patient diagnosis. The evaluation process  accesses a laboratory test of choice and imaging modality of choice database to recommend the appropriate tests in this patient at this point in time and a treatment table  to obtain current treatment information for a particular disease or diagnosis. In another embodiment, other choices are added to access other medical information processes.","Associated with these processes are a patient and assistant enrollment database , a consultation history database , a patient response database , a medical history objects database , a patient medication database , a pending database , a patient medical history database , a medical diagnostic scripts (MDS) database , an imaging modality database , and a laboratory test database .","Script Generation","Referring to , an off-line process  for generating a DSQ script will now be described. Beginning at a process , medical knowledge is collected and organized into list files. The data for the list files is collected for one or more medical authors . Process  has two portions. A first portion typically performed by a script coordinator or supervising author for assigning diseases and a second portion for capturing the disease knowledge for each disease in the script. The portion for capturing the disease knowledge is typically performed by a plurality of medical experts in their respective fields. The output of process  is electronic text, such as an ASCII file. This electronic text is in the form of DSQ lists such as disease, symptom, and question lists .","Process  moves to state  which takes the DSQ lists in electronic text format and processes them by use of a script data development tool. A script compiler  works closely with the script data development tool to generate an MDS file. The process  may utilize the script data development tool and the script compiler in an iterative fashion to generate a final MDS file. At state , the MDS file is written to an MDS database  by an MDS database manager utility . The MDS file  is preferably in a binary format. In an exemplary representation of the MDS file shown in  at \u2032, the MDS preferably includes a header data section, a master disease list section, a master symptom list section, a master flows section, a master question list section and a master text list section. In another embodiment, the medical authors may write the scripts in a medical authoring language or as nodes and branches as shown at state . Other script tools, which may include compilers, are shown at state  to generate an MDS .","Run-Time Structures","Referring to , some of the files and components of , , , and  that are utilized at run-time will now be described. The MDATA databases symbol  shown in  represents the databases and files of  other than the MDS database . If the script engine  executes the script  at the patient\/user access processor , the network-based MDATA system  passes the script  to the gateway process , that is part of the MDATA network server \/, for transfer to the user processor . The gateway process is also known as a CGI program, which was previously described above, and is more fully explained in conjunction with  below. Alternatively, a script engine  at the MDATA system  may utilize the script to provide questions to the user, respond to user input, and generate results across the network .","The patient\/user access processor  may utilize, in one embodiment, a Java virtual machine, licensed by Sun Microsystems, which may or may not execute within the context of a browser . Another embodiment may utilize a plug-in script engine for the browser . The user access processor  may be a Network PC (NetPC) such as defined by a collaboration of Intel, Microsoft, Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, or a Net Computer (NC), such as available from Oracle Corporation or Sun Microsystems Inc. The input devices utilized in conjunction with computer  may be also with the user access processor .","Initial Script and Evaluation Process","See , , and for a flow diagram of a process similar to a process of an Initial script used by the MDATA system  of . and are a flow diagram of the Evaluation process  defined in , which is also called the Diagnostic process  shown in .  is a flow diagram of the physical self examination function  defined in . This function, for example, may request that a clinical sound recording be performed, or a still or video image be captured.","On-line Interaction with the Patient","Referring to , a process  of how the MDATA system  () interacts on-line with the patient's computer  via the network  will now be described. One major variant of process  is the ability for (Java-enabled) pages to perform some calculations on the patient computer , instead of having to send the page to the MDATA computer \/.","Beginning at a start state , process  moves to state  wherein the patient's computer  contacts the central MDATA computer \/. Proceeding to state , the central MDATA computer \/ electronically sends a \u201cpage\u201d or screen of electronic information to the patient computer  for display on the visual display  to the user . Continuing at state , the patient  fills in form fields, check boxes, buttons, or other similar response mechanisms that are on the page. Advancing to state , the patient's computer  sends the responses on the page back to the MDATA computer \/. Moving to state , the MDATA computer \/ analyzes the received responses and selects the next page to send to the patient computer  or determines, at state , if the user or the MDATA software desires to terminate the communication between the patient computer and the MDATA computer \/. If so, the process  completes at an end state . However, if process  determines not to terminate, execution continues back at state  wherein the MDATA computer \/ sends the next selected page to the patient's computer .","Referring to , a preferred high-level interaction between the MDATA computer \/ and the patient's computer  or access processor  via the Internet  will be described. A MDS  is passed from the MDS database  by the MDATA software  to a MDS player (script) engine  at the patient computer \/. The player or script engine  executes the script  and updates the local patient database . Periodically, if desired by the MDATA system , the script result data is transferred to the central MDATA databases  (). Alternatively, the local patient database  is either not used at all, or is only used for certain data items, such that all or most of the medical data is sent across the network  for storage in the MDATA databases .","Network Program and Data Transfer","Referring to , a network program and data transfer process  that is used during execution of the Initial script and the Evaluation process will now be described. The transfer process  shows portions of the Initial script (similar to the process of -) and the Diagnostic process  () as functions. This process can be executed on the system  shown in . A decision block  in the process  determines if there is to be local storage of patient data and results at the patient\/user computer . Even if there is local storage of the patient data, the process may optionally send the data to the MDATA server at state  in a parallel operation. Processing continues at the user computer  until either a diagnosis or a terminal node is reached in the current script or help is needed from the MDATA server. Some of the actions performed by the MDATA server include sending a different script to the user computer for further diagnostic processing or performing analysis, such as meta analysis, determining if re-enter criteria are matched, checking for symptom severity patterns and so forth, as previously described in conjunction with the telephonic embodiment above.","In one embodiment of the on-line network system , the user computer  may have MDATA code segments, which are portions of code of the overall MDATA software in addition to the downloaded script to use in diagnosis of the problem. In this embodiment, if a diagnosis or terminus has not been reached, the process determines if the local code segments can continue in the diagnostic process. If not, the user computer sends the results back to the central MDATA server for further help. However, if the local code segments are sufficient to carry on the process, the local user computer uses the MDATA code segments for further action, such as setting an indicator and asking the patient to consult the system at a later time or other actions that are performed by the MDATA software.","Beginning at a start state , process  moves to a function  to execute an emergency response script. The emergency response script determines if the patient has a life-threatening emergency that needs immediate response. If an emergency does exist, the patient is referred to an emergency medical provider, such as an ambulance service or they are requested to call \u201c911\u201d. If there is no medical emergency, process  proceeds to state  and sends a script for patient registration or log-on. If the user has previously registered, the log-on process will be executed, but if the user has not registered previously, the registration process will be executed. Assuming the user has previously registered, process  proceeds to state  wherein the user views a log-on form using a script. Advancing to state , the user enters any requested data or answers to questions on the log-on form. Moving to state , the response data from the form is sent to the gateway program  () on the MDATA server \/ via the network . Continuing at state , the gateway program extracts the response data from the form and provides it for the MDATA software. Continuing at a decision state , process  determines if the log-on is successful. If not, process  proceeds to an error handling function  to determine why the log-on was not successful and to deal with the log-on problem accordingly.","If the log-on is successful, as determined at decision state , as determined at decision state , process  proceeds to a function  to elicit the chief complaint from user. Proceeding to state , the MDATA software selects a script for downloading to the user based on the chief complaint from the user, the amount of time since the beginning of the symptoms for the patient, any previous script results, the patient's past medical history, and so forth. After the script has been selected, process  proceeds to a function  wherein the script is transferred to the user machine over the network . Continuing to a function , the script engine  at the user machine  executes the script received over the network. Script processing is described in Applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 5,935,060, filed Jul. 11, 1997, for \u201cCOMPUTERIZED MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM UTILIZING LIST-BASED PROCESSING,\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","After execution of the script, process  moves to a decision state  to determine if there will be local user storage of the script results. If not, process  moves to state  to send the script results to the central MDATA server \/ for storage and\/or analysis of the script results. The script results may be sent over the internet in an encrypted state to protect the medical data. Proceeding to a decision state , process  determines if a further script needs to be sent to the user machine to further help diagnose the chief complaint of the user. If so, process  moves back to state  wherein the next script for downloading to the user is selected. However, if no further scripts need to be sent to the user machine, as determined at decision state , process  moves to a function . At function , the central MDATA computer takes some action, such as performing a meta analysis, determining if re-enter criteria are matched, checking for system severity patterns or other similar actions. The MDATA computer may provide a diagnosis to the patient or may provide medical advice, such as requesting that the patient contact the system at a predetermined future time. At the completion of the actions by the MDATA computer, process  completes at an end state .","Returning to decision state , if process  determines that local user storage of results is desired, processing continues at state  wherein the local user medical files are updated at database  (). The decision of where to store script results may be made by various entities. For example, the laws of the country where the program is executed may determine if medical results can be stored locally or not, the MDATA system administrator may determine where the results may be stored, a medical health organization may make that decision, or the patient may be allowed to choose where the script results are to be stored. Moving to an optional state , the MDATA administrator may require that the script results be sent to the central MDATA server for storage concurrently with the local storage of the medical data. The script results may be sent in an encrypted format to the central MDATA server.","Proceeding to a decision state , process  determines if the script reached a diagnosis or terminus point in the script. If a diagnosis was reached by the script, process  proceeds to state  to provide the diagnosis or medical advice to the user. Process  then completes at the end state . However, if a diagnosis was not reached, as determined at decision state , process  proceeds to a decision state . At decision state , process  determines if any local MDATA software code segments are available on the user machine, and if so, whether they are sufficient to take further action based on the script results. If not, process  moves to a decision state  to send the script results to the MDATA server, if not already done, such that the MDATA server can take additional steps or further analyze the patient's problem. However, if local MDATA segments on the user machine are sufficient to take further action, process  proceeds to function  to take further local action based on the software code segments. After the local MDATA action is performed, which may include requesting the patient to consult the system at a later time, process  completes at the end state .","Network Data Transfer","Referring to , an excerpt of a network data transfer process  performed during execution of the Initial script and the Evaluation process will now be described. This process  uses a CGI form that is viewed by the user  at state  and is completed by the user at state  for responding with data and\/or answers to MDATA questions or prompts. Advancing to state , the responses are sent to a gateway program  () on the MDATA server \/ via the network  to extract the responses at state  and forward the responses to the MDATA software. Moving to state , the MDATA system  continues execution of the script and\/or performs a database update using the newly received data. Proceeding to state , the script execution may cause a subsequent form to be sent to the user for further responses, and so forth. The username and security information, such as a password, for the user are passed back on the form as a \u201chidden element\u201d to preserve the state of the client\/server transaction.","Typical Script Window",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0480","num":"0713"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["2612","2614","2616","2618"]},"Summary of the Second Optional System Configuration","Running the MDATA system on a network such as the Internet is a significant extension of the previously described telephony-based MDATA system as well as the Stand-Alone (SA-MDATA) system. By replacing the telephone network with the Internet, the MDATA system extends its power to communicate with the patient as well as with other persons and agencies involved in the medical care of the patient. By replacing a purely sound-based system with a GUI, the MDATA system has a richer set of input\/output choices to perform its diagnostic functions. By inserting the patient's computer into the communications path, the MDATA system has many more options of storing data running programs on the patient's computer.
