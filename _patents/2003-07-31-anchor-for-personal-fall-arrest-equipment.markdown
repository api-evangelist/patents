title: Anchor for personal fall arrest equipment
abstract: An anchor for positioning in an opening of a surface includes a first generally flat portion having a slot formed therein, the slot having a longitudinal centerline; a second generally flat portion having a slot formed therein, the slot having a longitudinal centerline coincident on a line with the longitudinal centerline of the slot of the first flat portion, the second generally flat portion including at least one opening formed therein that defines an attachment ring; a hinge that connects the first and second flat portions at ends opposite open ends of the slots; a latch rotatably connected to the first flat portion; and a pin for releasably connecting the latch to the second flat portion to thereby secure the anchor in an unfolded position.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties therefor.","The invention relates in general to anchors for personal fall arrest equipment and in particular to an anchor for persons working on vertical surfaces.","Personal fall arrest equipment is used by those working at heights wherein a fall would most likely cause injury or death. Typically, the fall arrest equipment must be anchored in some manner. Various types of anchors are known. Exemplary anchors are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2002\/0014370; U.S. Pat. No. 6,354,399; U.S. Pat. No. 5,845,452; U.S. Pat. No. 5,603,389; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,287,944. However, the anchors disclosed in the above documents are not suitable for persons working on vertical baffles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","12","12","10"]},"A known method for securing personal fall arrest equipment to the baffle  is to wrap nylon sling material through two of the openings  and then secure the personal fall arrest equipment to the nylon sling. The nylon sling method requires two hands and exposes the worker to an extended time period working on the vertical baffle without fall protection. Additionally, the openings  do not have smooth edges and, therefore, abrade the nylon sling material.","The present invention is an anchor for personal fall arrest equipment that can be quickly and easily operated. The inventive anchor is not subject to abrasion from the rough edges of the openings . The invention can also be installed by one man using one hand.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","10","12","14","16","12","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["18","18","20","22","24","26","22","26","24","28","32","24","30","34","36","20","24","20","24","22","26","38","20"]},"Both latch  and first flat portion  have a hole formed therein for receiving a fastener  used to rotatably connect latch  to first flat portion . The fastener  may be, for example, a screw and nut. The fastener  is tightened enough to hold latch  and flat portion  together, while still allowing latch  to rotate with respect to flat portion . A pin , such as a quick release pin, releasably connects the latch  to the second flat portion . The pin  passes through holes formed in the second flat portion  and the latch . A piece of wire  may be attached to pin  and fastener  to prevent loss of pin  when pin  is removed from flat portion  and latch . In , latch  is mostly hidden by the flat portions  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["38","46","38","20","40","48","42","18","38","50","52","38","6","6","24","38","18","52","50","24","42","48","24","38","20","40","24","42","18","38","54","38"]},"In use, initially latch  is rotatably connected only to flat portion  by fastener . Latch  is not initially connected to flat portion . The user folds anchor  along hinge  such that the letter A in  is folded over to the letter B in . In this folded position, the longitudinal centerlines A and B of slots ,  are coincident. The folded anchor  is then placed in an opening  () with the slots ,  engaging one side of the half circle or arc . Anchor  is then unfolded to a flat position by rotating flat portion  up and away from flat portion  while keeping slots  and  engaged with arc . In the flat or unfolded position, slot  will engage one side of arc  and slot  will engage the opposite side of arc . Latch  is then rotated so that opening  in latch  lines up with the opening for pin  in second flat portion . Pin  is then inserted through opening  in latch portion , through the opening in flat portion  and the opening  in body portion . Latch  now locks anchor  in the unfolded, flat position and the anchor is ready for use. Personal fall equipment (not shown) is attached to one of the attachment rings ,  in flat portion . In the method just described, attachment ring  would be used because attachment ring  would be partially obscured behind baffle .","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
