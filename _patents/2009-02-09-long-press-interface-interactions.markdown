{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/027,386, filed Feb. 8, 2008 which is incorporated by reference in entirety hereto.","This document relates to systems and techniques for generating graphical display elements and controls.","People spend hours at a time with their electronic devices\u2014computers, telephones, music players, and the like. They like best those devices that are intuitive to use and whose interactions best meet their expectations regarding how machines should work. They interact with electronics through inputs and outputs from the devices, where the outputs generally are provided audibly and\/or on a flat graphical display screen, and the inputs may occur via touch screens, joysticks, mice, 4-directional keypads, and other such input mechanisms.","Fine distinctions in user interfaces can make a world of difference in a user's experience with a device. User interface options may be reduced for mobile devices, where full-sized keyboards or no keyboards at all are available. In such situations, intuitive interaction may be at a premium. The importance of such interaction may be even more pronounced with mobile devices, where the user needs to interact with a device using a single hand.","This document describes systems and techniques that may be used to interact with a user of a computing device like a mobile telephone having a touch screen user interface. In general, the techniques may react in particular ways to a long press of an input mechanism such as a touch screen display or a clickable trackball. A long press is a selection that is maintained by a user for a time that is noticeably longer than a simple single press or click selection, and that, in appropriate circumstances, produces an interaction with the user that differs from that of a corresponding simple, or short, press or click.","In certain situations, it may be helpful to signal to a user when a particular selectable element that is part of a user interface is an element that will exhibit such long press activity. For example, a user may not be willing to read a user's manual or otherwise wander about a system trying to determine which elements exhibit long press behavior\u2014finding some that respond and some that do not. To help a user may more readily understand the operation of a device, the techniques discussed here highlight an element that exhibits long press behavior, when it is first selected. In this manner, a user may quickly see that the element has additional functionality.","After the element has been selected for a long press period, the additional functionality is revealed\u2014generally by a pop up control that a user may then interact with, and that is directed to the current context of the display. For example, the long press behavior may be activity that produces a pop up contextual menu that relates to an element in the display. As one example, a display may show a list of messages, such as voice mail, text, and e-mail messages, and long pressing on an element representing one message in the list of messages may cause a contextual menu to pop up that itself contains elements for handling the messages (e.g., reply, reply to all, forward, delete, etc.).","In certain implementations, such systems and technique may provide one or more advantages. For example, as mentioned above, a user of a device that displays, almost immediately upon a selection of an on-screen control, that the control exhibits long press behavior, may permit a person to have a quick and intuitive understanding of actions they can take with the control. Without the fast feedback, the user would not know about the additional capabilities of the element until the actual contextual menu or other item was displayed, and the user would then need to remove the displayed item before continuing.","In one implementation, a computer-implemented user interface method is disclosed. The method comprises displaying one or more display elements in a graphical user interface, including elements that correspond to pop up controls, receiving a selection of one of the one or more display elements, determining whether the selected element corresponds to a pop up control, and displaying the selected element in a highlighted format upon receiving the selection if the element corresponds to a pop up control, and displaying a pop up control after displaying the element in a highlighted format if the selection persists for a long press period. The pop up control can comprise a contextual menu. Also, the display element may be displayed in a highlighted format that comprises: (1) changing a color of one or more features of the display element; (2) thickening one or more features of the display element; and\/or (3) increasing the size of the display element.","In certain aspects, the one or more display elements comprise selectable textual elements in a displayed list. Also, the selection can be received by a touch screen or selectable track ball.","In another implementation, computer-implemented user interface method is disclosed that comprises displaying a zoomable feature in a graphical user interface, receiving a selection on the zoomable feature, determining whether the selection is a long press selection, and if the selection is a long press selection, displaying a zooming control on the graphical user interface, and redisplaying the zoomable feature in response to user interaction with the zooming control. The zoomable feature can comprise a geographic map. Also, the zooming control can comprise a graphical slider that is responsive to user inputs, and the control can not be visible on the graphical user interface.","In certain aspects, redisplaying the zoomable feature comprises zooming the feature according to user interaction with the zooming control, and panning the feature according to user interaction with a second control. Also, the second control can be located outside the graphical user interface. In some aspects, the zooming control comprises a graphical slider and the second control comprises finger dragging on the zoomable feature. Moreover, redisplaying the zoomable feature can comprise centering the graphical user interface on a location of the zoomable feature corresponding to the location of the selection.","In yet another implementation, an article comprising a computer-readable data storage medium storing program code operable to cause one or more machines to perform operations is disclosed. Such operations can include displaying one or more display elements in a graphical user interface, including elements that correspond to pop up controls, receiving a selection of one of the one or more display elements, determining whether the selected element corresponds to a pop up control, and displaying the selected element in a highlighted format upon receiving the selection if the element corresponds to a pop up control, and displaying a pop up control after displaying the element in a highlighted format if the selection persists for a long press period. The pop up control can comprise a contextual menu, and displaying the display element in a highlighted format can comprise changing a color of one or more features of the display element.","In some aspects, displaying the display element in a highlighted format comprises thickening one or more features of the display element; and\/or increasing the size of the display element. Also, the one or more display elements can comprise selectable textual elements in a displayed list.","In different implementation, another article having a computer-readable data storage medium is disclosed. The operations performed by code on the article includes displaying a zoomable feature in a graphical user interface, receiving a selection on the zoomable feature, determining whether the selection is a long press selection, and if the selection is a long press selection, displaying a zooming control on the graphical user interface, and redisplaying the zoomable feature in response to user interaction with the zooming control.","In another implementation, a computer-implemented user interface system is disclosed. The system comprises a graphical user interface module to display user selectable elements, including elements that correspond to pop up controls, a user input mechanism to receive user selections in coordination with the display of user selectable elements, and a long touch interface processor to determine when a user selection is a selection of an element that corresponds to a pop up control, to cause the element to be highlighted upon its selection, and to cause the pop up control to be displayed after a long touch period. The pop up control can comprise a contextual menu. The system may also comprise a mapping application, wherein the pop up control comprises a zoom control for the mapping application. In addition, the long touch processor can be programmed to cause the element to be highlighted by thickening one or more features of the display element. Also, the user input mechanism can comprise a touch screen or trackball.","Another disclosed computer-implemented user interface system includes a graphical user interface module to display user selectable zoomable content, a user input mechanism to receive user selections in coordination with the user selectable zoomable content, and a long touch interface processor to determine when a user selection is a long press selection, to display a zooming control on the graphical interface in response to the long press selection, and to cause a redisplay of the zoomable content in response to user interaction with the coming control. The system can also comprise a mapping application, and the pop up control can comprise a zoom control for the mapping application. Also, the zooming control can comprise a graphical slider that is responsive to user inputs. In some aspects, the zooming control receives input on the graphical user interface but is not visible on the graphical user interface. In yet other aspects, redisplaying the zoomable feature comprises zooming the feature according to user interaction with the zooming control, and panning the feature occurs according to user interaction with a second control.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","This document describes systems and techniques by which mobile devices may interact with a user of such devices. For example, a user may be able to select items that are part of a graphical user interface in a manner that quickly provides the user with information about the selected item. As one example, certain on-screen elements may have particular, hidden functionality, such as the ability to raise a context-sensitive menu associated with the elements. Such elements may react nearly immediately when pressed, whereas elements that do not have associated menus may react differently or not at all when first pressed, so that a user can understand that he or she has selected an element having such additional functionality immediately (or nearly immediately) upon selecting the element, but before the additional functionality presents itself.","The additional activity associated with some elements may be the ability to generate additional graphics elements when selected, using, for example, a long press selection technique. In one example, controls for a mapping application may be generated when a user long presses on a displayed map. Such controls may include a zoom control, which may be a traditional zoom slider control that is graphically displayed after a long press on a map. Other similar zooming techniques are also discussed here.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"The user may then have dragged his or her finger down from the status bar, and across the display, or selected a particular button or other form of control, to pull more details about each of the recent events onto the display, and to move any prior information about ongoing applications out of the way and to the ongoing activities area. In such a manner, the user may have generated the display shown here.","The latest events area  shows such recently-received message information (and may show information about non-message related events). In this example, the latest events area  lists four events sorted in reverse chronological order\u2014an e-mail, a chat message, a notice about a missed call, and a voice mail.","A user selection (e.g., by pressing on a touch screen interface) of any of the messages may open the selected message. A user selection of an application icon next to one of the messages may open the full application, such as with the associated message opened in the application. Such actions may occur upon an up press event on the item when the user selects the item quickly.","The second display of the device  in  shows an example that may occur when the user selects an item\u2014here, item . Specifically, the item, because it has associated additional functionality that will be described in more detail below, may be made to change its appearance soon after being pressed by the user. Such a change in appearance is shown here, by way of example, using a white lit-up box around the selected item. The change in appearance may also occur in a number of different manners, such as by increasing the size of the item slightly, changing the brightness or color(s) of the item (e.g., to make it temporarily brighter), by making the item jiggle slightly (e.g., so as to make it appear that the additional functionality is about to explode out of the item, like a chick hatching from an egg), and by other such visual mechanisms. The device  may also be made to vibrate in such a situation to indicate that additional functionality is coming if the user holds the selection.","The third, and right-most, display shows the functionality generated by a long press by the user. In this example, the functionality involves the generation of a contextual pop up menu  associated with the first message in the latest events area  that was long-pressed by the user. The menu is contextual because its content depends on the thing that was long pressed\u2014here, the context involves basic operations that can be performed on the e-mail message that was selected (e.g., reply, forward, etc.). If a different event were selected, the contextual menu might have different values (e.g., it may not be possible to forward a missed telephone call).","The user may then select an item on the contextual pop up menu  in a familiar manner. For example, the user can select the \u201creply\u201d item on the menu , and a copy of the e-mail, addressed to the original sender, may be instantiated, so that the user may add some text to the message and send it back.","It is also possible that certain items, such as a notification of a missed call, would have so few actions associated with them that a contextual menu would be overkill. In such a situation, a user selection of those items would not result in a white box being drawn around the item as the selection continues, as was shown in the middle display in . Rather, the display of the item might remain static, to indicate to the user that there is nothing additional to be gleaned from holding, or pressing, the item for a long time.","Thus, by these mechanisms, a user of a mobile device may navigate more quickly and seamlessly through the applications on their mobile device. They may quickly see if a selection is associated with further information that will be displayed after a long press, but without having to wait for the long press period. As a result, when they are first learning a new system, they will not need to move slowly around, holding down on items for long periods of time just to determine whether they exhibit long press behaviors. Also, after the user has had the device for a time, they will become trained to recognize immediate visual changes in items they select, and will know to expect a contextual menu or other such long press activity from the appearance of such initial activity. As a result, the presentation of such quick feedback to the user may make the graphical user interface of a device much more intuitive and easier to use.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":"200"},"In this example, the user has selected a spot on the map and continued pressing for a long press period of time, such as by leaving their finger on the map for more than several hundred milliseconds. Such a long press period, however, may vary. For example, a user may selecting how long they would like their long press period to be on a global basis for any operations in a particular operating system\u2014much like the ability of users to select how fast a double-click will operate with a computer mouse. In any event, the long press period is substantially longer than is required for a basic clicking selection operation like those just discussed. Also, the long press may be achieved through other mechanisms, such as by pressing down on a clickable trackball .","In the illustrated image, the user has already provided a long press selection, which has resulted in the generation of a zoom control  over the map . Such a selection may have initially (before the long press period had run) provided an indication that such a selection would result in the provision of additional functionality. For example, the zoom control  may have initially been displayed in a \u201cghost\u201d or outline form until the long press period was met.","The second display, on the right, shows subsequent manipulation of the zoom control , via a slider  on the control . The manipulation is by a familiar technique (e.g., as used with GOOGLE MAPS) of dragging the slider upward toward a \u201c+\u201d sign to zoom in, and downward toward a \u201c\u2212\u201d sign to zoom out.","A zoom center point  is shown schematically over the display to illustrate where the display will zoom into. This center point  is set in the example to be the location at which the user previously long-pressed. (The graphic shown here to represent the zoom center point  need not be displayed on the device .)","In this manner, a user can select a point of interest easily on a map and then can have the map zoom in on that point of interest automatically. Additional interaction may be provided after the zooming. For example, the user may place a finger on the display and drag it in a circular motion to rotate the map, much like they would to spin a piece of paper (e.g., a real map) on a flat surface such as a desk or table. Such an operation may also occur after the user has switched to a different view of a location, such as a street view, satellite view, or airplane view (e.g., an aerial view of a geography taken at a slight angle so that buildings can be rotated around by the viewer).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["230","230","230","234","234","232","232"]},"The device  in the right display demonstrates what happens after the user selects the zoom control . In particular, another zoom control having a slider control  has been displayed, and the user is beginning to manipulate the slider control  to cause zooming of the map . A zoom point  shows the point into which the zooming will occur. As just described, that point  may be a point that was selected by the user before they selected the zoom control . Alternatively, where the zoom control  is always displayed when a map is displayed, so that the user did not need to identify a zoom point, the zoom point may default to the center of the display or another appropriate point.","In the various implementations shown here, the zooming itself may be discrete or analog. Discrete zooming occurs by jumping from one zoom level to a separate zoom level, whereas analog zooming occurs by zooming smoothly along a continuum. Discrete zooming may be used, in particular, where a map is generated using tiles that have been previously generated to show a geography at particular zoom levels, so that zooming in or out causes a new set of tiles (at a closer zoom level) to replace a prior set of tiles. Certain zoom levels might simply show the initial tiles in a larger manner, whereas new tiles may be substituted when the level of zoom is such that the initial tiles cannot provide the needed detail. Thus, for example, the tiles may be replaced only at every third discrete level, or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","302","304","306","302","304"]},"One such component is a display manager , which may be responsible for rendering content for presentation on display . The display manager  may receive graphic-related content from a number of sources and may determine how the content is to be provided to a user. For example, a number of different windows for various applications  on the device  may need to be displayed, and the display manager  may determine which to display, which to hide, and what to display or hide when there is overlap between various graphical objects.","An input manager  may be responsible for translating commands provided by a user of device . For example, such commands may come from a keyboard, from touch screen display , from trackball , or from other such sources, including dedicated buttons or soft buttons (e.g., buttons whose functions may change over time, and whose functions may be displayed on areas of display  that are adjacent to the particular buttons). The input manager  may determine, for example, in what area of the display commands are being received, and thus in what application being shown on the display the commands are intended. In addition, it may interpret input motions on the touch screen  into a common format and pass those interpreted motions (e.g., short press, long press, multiple press, and straight-line drags, and other motions) to the appropriate application. The input manager  may also report such inputs to an event manager (not shown) that in turn reports them to the appropriate modules or applications.","A variety of applications  may operate, generally on a common microprocessor, on the device . The applications  may take a variety of forms, such as mapping applications, e-mail and other messaging applications, web browser applications, and various applications running within a web browser or running extensions of a web browser.","A wireless interface  manages communication with a wireless network, which may be a data network that also carries voice communications. The wireless interface may operate in a familiar manner, such as according to the examples discussed below, and may provide for communication by the device  with messaging services such as text messaging, e-mail, and telephone voice mail messaging services. In addition, the wireless interface  may support downloads and uploads of content and computer code over a wireless network.","Various forms of persistent storage may be provided, such as using fixed disk drives and\/or solid state memory devices. Two examples are shown here. First, maps storage  includes data representing one or more geographic maps that may be displayed on device . The maps storage  may include a limited number of maps, such as a single map, in memory shared with many other components of the system  where the device  uses a web browser or similar system to access on-line maps. Alternatively, a number of maps for an entire geographic area may be loaded into map storage  and used by device  to reduce the need to download map content while the device  is being used. Such map content may be manipulated in manners like those discussed above.","Other storage includes a user profile , which may be stored on the same media as maps storage . The user profile  includes various parameters about a user of the device . In the example relevant here, the user profile may include data defining the length of a long press period for the user, among other things, such as the speed for a double press by the user, the speed with which trackball  movements are to result in on-screen movements of a pointer, particular actions that are to be achieved by multi-touch input, and other such factors.","Using the pictured components, and others that are omitted here for clarity, the device  may provide particular actions in response to user inputs. Specifically, the device  may respond to long press inputs in particular ways, including by initially displaying a selected on-screen item in a highlighted manner upon a user selection of the item, but before the expiration of a long touch period. The device  may then display particular long touch activity after the long touch period has expired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4C","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","400","402","404","400","400","405","400","406"]},"Once the long press period has expired (box ), the process  may cause a contextual menu to be displayed on the device. Such a menu may include a pop up menu that appears over or near the selected item or at the point where the selection occurred, for example (box ). Other forms of contextual selections may also be provided. In a typical situation, the contextual menu will include selectable elements, and at box , a user provides a selection of one of the elements. In response to such a selection, the process  carries out the selected function at box , and the contextual menu may then disappear. The user may then continue operating the device in a typical fashion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["416","416","418","420","422","424"]},"At box , the process then zooms the map, in response to the user manipulation, around the location on the map at which the selection was recorded. For example, if the user initially selected a point in an upper right corner of a map with a long press, and then lifted their finger and used it to manipulate the zoom control, the application may zoom into the area of the map that was initially in the upper right corner of the display. At some point, the user may determine that they are done zooming and may wish to have the zoom control removed so that they can see more of the map. At such a point, the zoom control may be hidden so that the user needs to long press again to bring it back (box ). A user indication of a desire to have the zoom control removed may occur, for example, by a sufficient delay in the user selecting the zoom control, or by the user providing a fast touch on the map without moving (where pressing and moving or dragging would indicate an intent to pan the map, and not to remove the zoom control).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["430","432","434","430","430","436","438","440"]},"Upon the completion of any movement action by the user, the map centerpoint and\/or zoom level may be determined (box ) so that the system can confirm what is currently being shown to the user. The centerpoint and zoom level may then be transmitted to a remote server as a local search query, which may be used to identify points of interest in the area in which the viewer is looking. For example, local restaurants in the area may wish to provide local-based advertising, and icons representing those restaurants may be retrieved and provided for display on the mobile device (boxes  and ).","In these manners, convenient user manipulation of graphical elements in a GUI, such as for a mapping application or various messaging applications, may be provided. Where long press interaction is desired, users may be given near-immediate feedback regarding the long press interaction of an element in a very intuitive manner without having to wait for the long press behavior to exhibit itself, and then having to cancel out of the long press behavior if that is not what they wanted. Also, various additional graphical element interaction has been shown and described.","Referring now to , the exterior appearance of an exemplary device  that implements the user interface features described here is illustrated. Briefly, and among other things, the device  includes a processor configured to display notifications regarding events on the device , and to permit a user to conveniently \u201cpull down\u201d detail about the events relating to the notifications into an extended view of the events.","In more detail, the hardware environment of the device  includes a display  for displaying text, images, and video to a user; a keyboard  for entering text data and user commands into the device ; a pointing device  for pointing, selecting, and adjusting objects displayed on the display ; an antenna ; a network connection ; a camera ; a microphone ; and a speaker . Although the device  shows an external antenna , the device  can include an internal antenna, which is not visible to the user.","The display  can display video, graphics, images, and text that make up the user interface for the software applications used by the device , and the operating system programs used to operate the device . Among the possible elements that may be displayed on the display  are a new mail indicator  that alerts a user to the presence of a new message; an active call indicator  that indicates that a telephone call is being received, placed, or is occurring; a data standard indicator  that indicates the data standard currently being used by the device  to transmit and receive data; a signal strength indicator  that indicates a measurement of the strength of a signal received by via the antenna , such as by using signal strength bars; a battery life indicator  that indicates a measurement of the remaining battery life; or a clock  that outputs the current time.","The display  may also show application icons representing various applications available to the user, such as a web browser application icon , a phone application icon , a search application icon , a contacts application icon , a mapping application icon , an email application icon , or other application icons. In one example implementation, the display  is a quarter video graphics array (QVGA) thin film transistor (TFT) liquid crystal display (LCD), capable of 16-bit or better color.","A user uses the keyboard (or \u201ckeypad\u201d)  to enter commands and data to operate and control the operating system and applications that provide for responding to notification of alerts and responding to messages and the like (and also to a touch screen). The keyboard  includes standard keyboard buttons or keys associated with alphanumeric characters, such as keys  and  that are associated with the alphanumeric characters \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cW\u201d when selected alone, or are associated with the characters \u201c*\u201d and \u201c1\u201d when pressed in combination with key . A single key may also be associated with special characters or functions, including unlabeled functions, based upon the state of the operating system or applications invoked by the operating system. For example, when an application calls for the input of a numeric character, a selection of the key  alone may cause a \u201c1\u201d to be input.","In addition to keys traditionally associated with an alphanumeric keypad, the keyboard  also includes other special function keys, such as an establish call key  that causes a received call to be answered or a new call to be originated; a terminate call key  that causes the termination of an active call; a drop down menu key  that causes a menu to appear within the display ; a backward navigation key  that causes a previously accessed network address to be accessed again; a favorites key  that causes an active web page to be placed in a bookmarks folder of favorite sites, or causes a bookmarks folder to appear; a home page key  that causes an application invoked on the device  to navigate to a predetermined network address; or other keys that provide for multiple-way navigation, application selection, and power and volume control.","The user uses the pointing device  to select and adjust graphics and text objects displayed on the display  as part of the interaction with and control of the device  and the applications invoked on the device . The pointing device  is any appropriate type of pointing device, and may be a joystick, a trackball, a touch-pad, a camera, a voice input device, a touch screen device implemented in combination with the display , or any other input device.","The antenna , which can be an external antenna or an internal antenna, is a directional or omni-directional antenna used for the transmission and reception of radiofrequency (RF) signals that implement point-to-point radio communication, wireless local area network (LAN) communication, or location determination. The antenna  may facilitate point-to-point radio communication using the Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR), cellular, or Personal Communication Service (PCS) frequency bands, and may implement the transmission of data using any number or data standards. For example, the antenna  may allow data to be transmitted between the device  and a base station using technologies such as Wireless Broadband (WiBro), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave ACCess (WiMAX), 5GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), High Performance Radio Metropolitan Network (HIPERMAN), iBurst or High Capacity Spatial Division Multiple Access (HC-SDMA), High Speed OFDM Packet Access (HSOPA), High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA), HSPA Evolution, HSPA+, High Speed Upload Packet Access (HSUPA), High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), Generic Access Network (GAN), Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA), Evolution-Data Optimized (or Evolution-Data Only)(EVDO), Time Division-Code Division Multiple Access (TD-CDMA), Freedom Of Mobile Multimedia Access (FOMA), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS), Code Division Multiple Access-2000 (CDMA2000), Wideband Integrated Dispatch Enhanced Network (WiDEN), High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Personal Handy-Phone System (PHS), Circuit Switched Data (CSD), Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), CDMAone, Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System (D-AMPS), Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (IDEN), Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), DataTAC, Mobitex, Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD), Hicap, Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), Nordic Mobile Phone (NMP), Autoradiopuhelin (ARP), Autotel or Public Automated Land Mobile (PALM), Mobiltelefonisystem D (MTD), Offentlig Landmobil Telefoni (OLT), Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMTS), Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS), Mobile Telephone System (MTS), Push-To-Talk (PTT), or other technologies. Communication via W-CDMA, HSUPA, GSM, GPRS, and EDGE networks may occur, for example, using a QUALCOMM MSM7200A chipset with an QUALCOMM RTR6285 transceiver and PM7540power management circuit.","The wireless or wired computer network connection  may be a modem connection, a local-area network (LAN) connection including the Ethernet, or a broadband wide-area network (WAN) connection such as a digital subscriber line (DSL), cable high-speed internet connection, dial-up connection, T-1 line, T-3 line, fiber optic connection, or satellite connection. The network connection  may connect to a LAN network, a corporate or government WAN network, the Internet, a telephone network, or other network.
