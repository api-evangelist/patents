Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method, system, and program for determining system information from a computer system.","2. Description of the Related Art","In certain instances, a software distributor or technical support agent may want to determine the configuration of a customer computer system. In the prior art, tailor made utilities are provided to determine system configuration information for particular uses. For instance, in the Unix** operating system, the \u201cprtconf\u201d command is used to print system configuration information, whose output includes the total amount of memory and the configuration of system peripherals formatted as a device tree.","Further, software vendors will sometimes query a customer's computer over a network to determine the system configuration for purposes of whether any upgrades or fixes for that system are available. For instance, Microsoft Corporation provides a Windows\u00ae update utility that is downloaded to the user's computer to scan the computer to determine whether any new version of installed components are available. The utility displays a list of recent versions of the determined components on the user's computer that the user can select to install.","Such prior art utility programs for determining system configuration information are designed for specific uses and not intended for general purpose queries of system information. For this reason, there is a need in the art for improved techniques for providing utilities to determine system information and to allow software vendors and others to configure such utilities for different purposes.","Provided are a method, system, and program for determining system information from a computer system having at least one attached device. Resource information indicating at least one program and at least one device is processed. The computer system is queried to determine whether the at least one device indicated in the resource information is coupled to the computer system and the computer system is searched to determine whether at least one program indicated in the resource information is installed in the computer system. System information is generated that indicates determined devices and programs in the computer system. The system information is then rendered, such that the rendered system information on the determined devices and programs is capable of being presented in a human observable format.","In further implementations, the resource information is edited to modify the at least one program or at least one device indicated in the resource information.","In yet further implementations, the resource information further indicates files. The computer system is searched to determine whether the computer system includes at least one file indicated in the resource information. Information is included in the system information indicating any determined files in the computer system.","Still further, the resource information may be coded in a program that performs the steps of processing the resource information, querying and searching the computer system, and generating the system information. In such implementations, the resource information is capable of being configured to modify at least one of the devices and programs indicated in the resource information.","Further provided are a method, system, and program for determining system information. Resource information in a utility program is edited to indicate at least one program and at least one device. The utility program is deployed to determine system information for a computer system The utility program is invoked to perform the operations of querying the computer system to determine whether the at least one device indicated in the resource information is coupled to the computer system; searching the computer system to determine whether at least one program indicated in the resource information is installed in the computer system; and generating system information indicating determined devices and programs in the computer system, wherein the system information is capable of being rendered a human observable format to present information on the determine devices and programs.","In further implementations, the system information to a remote computer over a network. In such further implementations, the remote computer may be operated by a technical support agent providing technical support to a user of the computer system. The technical support agent would use the system information when providing technical support on the computer system to the user.","The described implementations provide techniques to search for devices and programs installed on a host system using a program that may be configured to alter the resources that are subject to searching on the host system.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and which illustrate several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","4","4","2","2","6","2","8","8","8","2","8","8","8","2","8","8","8","2","2","2","10","10","10","2","8","8","8"],"i":["a, ","b","n ","a, ","b","n ","a, ","b","n ","a, ","b","n ","a, ","b","n, "]},"The computer  further includes system Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) , which may be provided with an operating system of the computer , that are used to make calls to access information on attached devices. For instance, in a Microsoft Windows\u00ae environment, the system APIs may comprise functions calls to programs that are capable of accessing information on attached devices and installed programs, such as the Windows device manager program. Additionally, the system APIs  may comprise functions used to discover device information, such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) discovery commands, IOCTLs, etc. Still further, the APIs  that are used may involve searches of a system registry or other similar type file for information.","The configuration detection utility  includes a program and file list  indicating files and programs and a device list  indicating devices . . . that the configuration detection utility  will search for on the computer system . The devices in the device list  may include the operating system, central processing unit (CPU), memory, attached storage devices (e.g., tape drives, hard disk drives, disk arrays, optical disk drives, etc.) In certain implementations, the program and file list  and device list  may be edited by a user to modify the resources that are searched. For instance, a software development tool , such as Microsoft\u00ae Visual Studio\u00ae, may be used to edit the program and file list  and\/or device list resources  in the executable configuration detector  program to add, remove or modify the devices, files, and\/or programs the configuration detector  will seek to detect on the system .

The determined device driver files may be indicated in the device list  with the devices, in the program and file list  or may be determined when querying the device . . . or a system registry file. The version of the determined device driver files . . . is determined (at block ) and the information on the determined version for the added devices is added (at block ) to the system information .","Control then proceeds to block , from the no branch of block  or , to query the file system  to determine whether the file system  includes any of the programs and\/or files indicated in the program and files list . If (at block ) the file system  includes one or more files or programs matching those indicated on the program and files list , then the configuration detector  adds (at block ) the name of each determined program and\/or file to the system information . The configuration detector  would further query (at block ) each determined program and\/or file to determine the version information and add (at block ) such determined version information for the determined program and\/or files to the system information . In alternative implementations, listed files and programs may be determined by scanning a system registry or repository of system information. The system information  may then be rendered (at block ) by displaying the determined system information  on the attached monitor  or other output device capable of rendering information in a human observable format. Alternatively, the system information  may be rendered in a file that may be stored on a storage device or transmitted to a remote location over a network, wherein the system information  may later be generated as output from the stored or transmitted file.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["150","18","20","150","150","18","20","18"]},"In described implementations, the configuration detector  gathers various types of system information, including information on attached hardware devices and installed programs and available files and may render such information in various formats.","Further, with the described implementations, a software or hardware vendor may use a software development tool to customize the files and\/or devices, indicated in the lists  and\/or , that are searched during the operation of the configuration detector . In this way, the vendor may tailor the search of components to those that are of interest to the vendor and that may assist while providing technical support or other services. As mentioned, a vendor could deploy the configuration detector  on a user system to determine installed components and then have the configuration detector  transmit the system information  to the vendor agent over a network, such as the Internet, to review when providing support. In this way, the configuration detector comprises a utility that may be readily configured for deployment to obtain information on specific types of devices and transmit such information to remote systems over networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["150","154","154","154","156","156","156","150","154","154","154","14","16","156","156","156","154","154","154","156","156","156","156","156","156","156","156","156","14","16","154","154","154","156","156","156"],"i":["a, ","b","n ","a, ","b","n ","b","n ","a, ","b","n.
