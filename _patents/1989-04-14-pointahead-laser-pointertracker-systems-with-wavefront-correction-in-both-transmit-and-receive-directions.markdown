title: Point-ahead laser pointer-tracker systems with wavefront correction in both transmit and receive directions
abstract: Point-ahead laser pointer-tracker systems with stabilization and wavefront correction in both transmit and receive directions provide arrangements for sensing the wavefront correction required in two different directions, one in the received target image direction for good image quality in the tracker and the other in the point-ahead direction for good beam quality on the target. In the several embodiments, a marker beam is aligned with the target image. Wavefront aberration correction signals are produced by an output wave sensor that senses the wavefront of the marker beam in the received target image direction and the wavefront of the source laser beam in the point-ahead transmit direction. The alignment is maintained by use of the output wave sensor signals together with signals from the tracker of the target and current aimpoint positions. These signals, compared in selected pairs, control mirrors in various legs of the optical system to put the current aimpoint on the desired aimpoint and to align the marker beam along the received target image direction.

The government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to laser pointer-tracker systems and particularly to point-ahead laser pointer-tracker systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","Presently known prior art systems employing shared apertures do not provide any way to sense the wavefront corrections needed in both the transmit and receive directions. There is no local beam in the direction of the received target image, so any wavefront correction on the target image either has to use the dim target image itself to sense the needed corrections, or else it is assumed that the target image direction corrections are the same as those in the transmitted, point-ahead, directions.","In direct (non-point-ahead) systems, the transmit and receive directions are the same, so that a local beam aligned in the transmit direction is also aligned with the received target image and can be used for sensing the wavefront corrections needed in the received direction.","Presently known prior art systems employing a stable platform use only a single marker beam aligned in the transmit direction. When applied to a point-ahead system in which this marker beam is driven in the point-ahead direction to point the transmitter laser, the single stable beam will only stabilize the transmitted laser beam and the common path. It does not stabilize the tracker image against jitters in the tracker-marker leg or against what the shared aperture component may do to the tracker-marker leg that it does not do to the common path.","There is no presently known prior art directed to separate aperture, stable platform, point-ahead laser transmitters. Presently known prior art systems of the separate aperture type have been direct pointing (not point-ahead), and, as noted above, point-ahead prior art has been of the shared aperture type.","Improved point-ahead laser pointer-tracker systems are provided by this invention.","In a first embodiment of this invention employing a shared aperture, energy returned from the current aimpoint on the target is used in computing the point-ahead angle. The transmitted beam direction is driven by a servo loop in response to the angular difference between the locations of the images of the current aimpoint and the desired aimpoint on the target. The pointing servo loop performing this computation steers the transmitted laser beam to the correct point-ahead angle without any loop corrections or offsets in the loop. One implementation of this first embodiment uses the reflected energy of the transmitted laser beam to sense the current aimpoint. The second implementation of this first embodiment uses the reflected energy of a designator laser beam aligned to the transmitted laser beam to compute the point-ahead angle.","Both versions provide a marker laser beam along the received target image direction to enable wavefront correction of the target image path without relying on the dim target image itself for the correction information.","In a second embodiment of this invention employing a shared aperture, an inertially stabilized platform with two beams is used, rather than the usual single beam. One stable platform laser beam is driven by the image of the target in the tracker; this beam in turn drives the marker laser beam in the direction of the received target wavefront. The second stable platform laser beam is driven by the image of the current aimpoint; this beam in turn drives the transmitted laser beam to seek the correct point-ahead angle.","In a third embodiment of this invention, separate apertures are employed for the receiver and transmitter telescopes. Each uses its own inertially stabilized platform reference projecting a stabilized beam, but the transmitter stabilized beam is driven by a signal from the tracker based upon the difference between the locations of the images in the tracker of the current aimpoint and a marker reference. The receiver stabilized beam is driven by the difference between the locations of the marker reference image and the image of the desired aimpoint in the tracker.","All three embodiments employ full-aperture, high signal level, wavefront aberration sensing beams in both the transmit and receive directions to enable wavefront correction independently and simultaneously in both the transmit and receive directions without relying on the dim target signal for wavefront control.","The main problem all three embodiments of this invention solve is how to sense the wavefront correction needed in two different directions, one in the received target image direction for good image quality in the tracker and the other in the point-ahead transmit direction for providing good beam quality on the target.","These inventions have the following important properties:\n\n","In a first embodiment of this invention, employing a shared or common aperture, a first implementation, System 1-1, , introduces a marker laser beam M and aligns it with the beam of the target image. The output wave sensor at its focal plane then senses the wavefront Wof the marker laser beam in the target direction and the wavefront Wof the source laser beam in the transmit direction for providing wavefront correction. A second implementation of the first embodiment of this invention, System 1-2,  adds an aimpoint designator laser beam D in the transmit direction, which can also be wavefront corrected, ","The second embodiment of this invention, also employing a shared aperture, does the same things in a system employing an inertially stabilized platform reference system. There are at least two ways of implementing a stabilized platform reference system. One comprises a stable flat mirror reflecting the laser beam and an autocollimator receiving the reflected beam for correcting beam direction. Another, and the one used in all the examples shown here, provides a directionally stable laser beam as a reference for correcting beam directions. A novel feature of the stable platform embodiments of this invention is the provision of a stable platform ( of , , and ) with two stable beams\u2014one, P, in the target image direction and one, Q, in the transmit direction. As presently known, stable platform systems have always had a single stable beam, and it was aligned in the transmit direction. When applied to point-ahead systems, the single stable beam will only stabilize the transmitted source laser beam H and the common path . It does not stabilize the tracker image against jitters in the tracker\/marker leg  or against what the shared aperture component  may do to the tracker\/marker leg  that it does not do to the common path ","The third embodiment of this invention shows how to do the same things using a separate aperture system and shows that a periscope transfer, , , as used in the prior art, is not required for the point-ahead mode.","Selected terms as used herein are defined below.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","3","3","1","7","5","7","7","9","11","5","11","5","13","7","5","5","15","13","11","7","7","5","13","1","3","17","2","3","3","19","3","9","11","7","9","5","2"],"i":["a","a","a ","a ","b ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","b ","a ","c "]},"The source laser beam and the marker laser beam travel together in the common leg out of the shared aperture component  to a beam expander or telescope, generally designated . As shown here, the beam expander is an on-axis, three mirror telescope with tertiary, secondary, and primary mirrors , and . The primary mirror is provided with a conventional holographic diffraction grating to sample both beams and propagating through the common leg and form focused spots or wavefront images and , respectively, on a focal plane of an output wave sensor  located behind a hole  in the center of the secondary mirror . The location of the marker laser beam spot on the focal plane of the output wave sensor  represents a direction of the marker laser beam , which was made parallel to the direction to the target. The location of the source laser beam spot on the focal plane of the output wave sensor  represents the direction of the source laser beam . By means of a servo loop, having a gain \u2212\u03b2, that moves or steers the beam steering mirror  to put the marker beam spot on the source laser beam spot , the marker laser beam and the source laser beam are made to point in the same direction. This steering of the beam steering mirror  moves the desired aimpoint  off of the marker reference spot  on the tracker focal plane . By means of a servo loop having a gain \u2212\u03b1, the beam steering mirror  in the common path is now turned to bring the desired aimpoint  and the marker reference  back together. Now the desired aimpoint  on the target and the marker reference spot  in the focal plane of the tracker are aligned, and the marker laser beam and the laser source beam are also aligned, so the target beam and the laser source beam are aligned.","Continuing with the discussion of prior art ,  contains all the essential features of the system of  and forms the basis for a mathematical analysis of . The numbers adjacent to the individual elements of  relate these elements to the elements of . The letters associated with these elements are used as terms in the equations that follow below. These terms are defined as the description develops.","In , H relates to the source laser beam and represents the angular direction of the laser source beam and any angular disturbances or jitters thereof by the optical train or path that brings the source laser beam to the shared aperture component , here having its characteristics or function represented by S. H also includes any effects the shared aperture component  has on the laser source beam that the shared aperture component  does not have on the other two legs, the other two legs being the tracker\/marker leg  and the common path leg . As a beam propagates through the system, any angular deviations are algebraically additive (actually vectorially, since deviations can be in both cross-propagation directions). H therefore also includes any deviations that the common path puts into the source laser beam that it does not put onto the tracker\/marker beam , for example, wavelength dependent effects caused by errors in the high reflectivity coatings on the optics, or relative deviations caused by the irradiance profiles not being the same for both the source laser beam and the laser marker beam, so distortions that are not uniform across an optic may cause different effective tilts in the two beams.","Continuing with  and the prior art, M relates to the marker laser beam and represents tilt in the marker laser beam and its optics before the tracker beam splitter . N represents tilts after the beam splitter , including anything the shared aperture component  does uniquely to the marker path  and any effects in the common path that are unique to the marker laser . C represents the deviations in the common path or leg . B represents the beam expander or telescope . The effects of the beam expander  are included in C. T represents the characteristics of the tracker . Therefore characters Tand Tdenote the marker reference spot or image  and the target image desired aimpoint , respectively, in the focal plane of the tracker . The difference in position in the tracker focal plane between these images or spots, which represents the angular error, is multiplied by the servo loop gain \u2212\u03b1 and applied to the beam steering mirror  in the common path or leg , here represented as R. The laser marker beam and the laser source beam are transmitted to the telescope, and the reference characters Wand Wrepresent their wavefronts as sampled by the output wave sensor . The difference between their directions (W\u2212W) is multiplied by the servo loop gain \u2212\u03b2 and applied to the beam steering mirror  in the marker path or leg , the characteristics of which are here represented as R. The reference character Wdenotes the wavefront of the image of the target, seen as reflected beam of .","Continuing further with a discussion of the prior art of ,  shows the images in the focal plane of the output wave sensor  and the focal plane of the tracker .  also shows what is happening in target space as the pointing servo loops operate. For the purposes of explanation, the operations of the pointing servo loops a and A are described as though they operate in sequence. The pointing loops actually operate simultaneously in the system. In the focal plane of the output wave sensor , the cross represents the marker laser beam image or spot and the circle represents the source laser beam image or spot in the output wave sensor focal plane of . In the tracker focal plane , the cone represents the target  (T), the cross represents the marker reference spot  (T), and the black dot in the last tracker focal plane frame is the actual current aimpoint Tof the source laser beam on the target. In the last target space frame, if the target velocity were zero, so that the point-ahead angle were zero, the current aimpoint circle H would fall on the cross M, and the circle and cross would be centered on the desired aimpoint on the target T.","Equations 1-7 and Tables I, II and III are useful in describing this

simple mathematical analysis can quantify how well the system works. The equations use the designations of . First are the pointing equations, Eqn. 1 and Eqn. 2, for the servo-driven mirrors: the mirror  (REqn. 1) in the marker leg  is driven in the pointing loop \u2212\u03b2 by the difference between the directions of the marker laser beam and the source laser beam as measured by the difference in locations of the wavefront images Wand Win the focal plane of the output wave sensor , and the mirror  (REqn. 2) in the common leg is driven in the pointing servo loop \u2212\u03b1 by the difference between the locations of the marker reference spot Tand the target image desired aimpoint Tin the tracker focal plane . Equation 3 states that the location of the marker reference spot Tis just the direction of the marker laser beam (M), including the accumulated deviations up to the beam splitter . Equation 4 follows the marker laser beam from its source M to its focal plane spot Wat the output wave sensor , adding up all tilts in the optical path. Equation 5 follows the target beam from the target image Tin the tracker back to the target wavefront Was it enters the telescope, adding up all tilts in the optical path. Finally, all tilts on the source laser beam are accumulated to find its image Wat the focal plane of the output wave sensor , Eqn. 6. These six equations can then be solved for the angle W\u2212Wbetween the source laser beam and target wavefronts in target space at the entrance to the beam expander or telescope . This difference is the pointing error W\u2212Win Eqn. 7.","It is noted at this point that the optical diagrams of  do not represent the only way to connect the servo loops. There are three legs into which the two steering mirrors may be put and two control lines (servo loops), for six possible combinations. These six possible combinations are not shown here in the interest of simplicity. The three legs that are involved are the legs , and .","The coefficients of the terms of the pointing error equation, Eqn. 7, above, are given in Table I. The best way to interpret these terms is that they represent the effect on each Fourier component; i.e., each term is the amount of jitter at a particular frequency, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the loop gains at that frequency. To include phase shifts in the gains and relative phases in the jitter of different components, each term is a complex number with both real and imaginary parts. With respect to the low frequency components, the loop gains are large and the coefficients of the terms can be simplified, as shown in Table II. The servo loops attenuate the disturbances from all sources to give accurate pointing.","At higher frequencies, the gain, a, of the tracker loop must roll off because the target image  is a low level signal and the bandwidth of the tracker  must be made narrow to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The output wave sensor  has high-level signals and can have a wide bandwidth. Therefore at higher frequencies, the value of a will become very small while the value of \u03b2 remains large. The coefficients of the terms can be simplified again under these conditions to give the high frequency results seen in Table III. High frequency real motions of the target show up as pointing errors, but any high frequency jitter in the common path also becomes a pointing error. An inertially stabilized platform reference, which is employed in the second and third embodiments of this invention, minimizes high frequency jitter disturbances.","The details of the prior art system above are useful in describing and in understanding this invention and are relied upon in the descriptions of the three embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["a ","b ","c ","d ","e "]},"The point-ahead angle is the angle between the received and transmitted directions, and can be calculated from the figure. If the target is moving at velocity v and is at range R, the time from when light leaves the target to when the transmitted light arrives at the target is the round trip time t=2R\/c, where c is the speed of light. The point-ahead angle, \u03b8, from is \u03b8=vt\/R (for small values of \u03b8). Substituting the value of t into the equation for \u03b8 gives \u03b8=2v\/c.","The receive direction can be called the \u201capparent target direction.\u201d It is not the \u201ctarget direction\u201d because the target is not there when the light is received.","Note there is no processing time in the equation between the reception of the target light and the transmission of the laser light. This is because it is assumed that the target is being continuously tracked, and therefore the received direction represents the direction of the received light at the instant the transmitted beam is launched. If the target is not being tracked continuously, such as if it is being tracked with light from a pulsed laser, then processing time must be included in the time equation to get the \u201capparent point-ahead angle,\u201d which is the angle between where the receiver last saw the target when it received the pulsed tracking light and where the transmitter must point the laser to hit the target. All of the point-ahead inventions here will work with either situation.","The first embodiment of this invention comprises a shared aperture, laser transmitter pointing and tracking system with independent wavefront correction for the transmitter laser and received target image. Two implementations of this pointing and tracking system that solve the point-ahead problem are described. The first system, System 1-1, , uses the energy of the transmitted source laser beam reflected from the target in conjunction with the target image to solve the point-ahead problem and place the transmitted source laser beam on the desired aimpoint on the target. The second system, System 1-2, , uses a shared aperture designator laser beam coaligned with the transmitted source laser beam to designate the current aimpoint on the target. The reflected designator energy is used in conjunction with the target image to solve the point-ahead problem and place the transmitted beam on the desired aimpoint on the target. The designator also has independent wavefront correction. All control loops are closed with no offsets or open loop corrections; they drive their discriminants to zero.","The choice of one of these two systems depends on the wavelengths of the transmitter source laser beam and the target image and the available tracker detectors. If the tracker  is sensitive to the wavelengths of the target image and the reflected transmitted source laser beam, then the first system, System 1-1, can be used. If the tracker  is not sensitive to both of these wavelengths, then the second system, System 1-2, must be used, with the designator laser beam wavelength chosen to be within the tracker's spectral range.","The advantage provided by both implementations of this first embodiment of this invention is that independent wavefront correction is provided for both the transmitted source laser beam and the received or reflected target image beam. Wavefront correction for the received target image beam is sensed by the local marker laser beam without reliance on the dim target image itself for the correction information. System 1-2, with an aimpoint designator laser beam, allows independent wavefront correction of the designator laser beam also. (The target image and the designator laser beam image require different wavefront corrections because they are looking in different directions in the field of view of the beam expander .)","It is assumed that the system must deal with dim targets, so that the target image cannot be used to generate wavefront correction for its own path. Also, the target is an extended object, which is more difficult to use for correction information than a point source. A shared aperture marker laser beam exactly aligned with the received target beam is provided for this purpose. This marker laser beam can be sampled by a holographic diffraction grating on the telescope primary as referenced in  to drive a wavefront correction system to obtain perfect target image quality. The outgoing transmitted source laser beam can also be sampled to drive a second wavefront correction system to obtain perfect beam quality in the transmitted beam. System 1-2, with an aimpoint designator laser beam D coaligned with the transmitter source laser beam, can implement a third output wavefront correction system to obtain perfect beam quality on the designator. Note that the sampled beams are aligned in two different directions, one in the received target image direction and the second in the point-ahead direction, so that they correctly sample the optical errors in the different directions in the field-of-view of the beam expander. (Beam expanders generally have significantly different aberrations for the two directions.)","If the wavefronts of the outgoing beams (marker and source or marker and designator) are sampled, the angle between them, which is the point-ahead angle, can be measured to obtain the target cross-range velocity: the point-ahead angle is 2v\/c, where v is the target cross-range velocity and c is the speed of light. In addition, since the target is being tracked, its angular velocity is also known, and the ratio of angular to cross-range velocity gives the target range.","Since the point-ahead solution depends on seeing the current aimpoint on the target, it is first necessary to get the current aimpoint on the target.  showed the current aimpoint behind the desired aimpoint on the target. If the point-ahead angle were larger, the source laser beam would have missed the target. Since the target is still being tracked, its angular velocity is known, but the linear velocity cannot be calculated from this without range information. However the direction of the target movement is known and the point-ahead angle is in that direction. An offset can be temporarily injected into either point-ahead servo loop (preferably the point-ahead servo loop \u2212\u03b2 of the output wave sensor) to point the source laser beam ahead until the current aimpoint shows up on the target. Here, an estimate of the range can be used to speed up the search.

There are two new equations, Eqn. 14 for following the returned current aimpoint wavefront image Wthrough the system, and Eqn. 15 expressing the (point-ahead) difference in directions between the wavefront Wof the transmitted source laser beam and the wavefront Wof the returned current aimpoint beam, from the latter of which the image of the current aimpoint Tin the tracker is developed. The pointing error to be calculated here is the difference between the direction of the transmitted source laser beam represented by Wand the current point-ahead direction, which latter is expressed as the received desired aimpoint direction, wavefront W, plus the point-ahead angle \u03b8, (W+\u03b8), Eqn. 17. In controlling the steering mirrors, the output wave sensor signals are not used (but they can be used to calculate the range), and both of the mirror controls Rand Rare from the tracker, Eqns. 8 and 9; however, the \u03b1 loop is only used to align the marker laser beam with the received target image and so has no direct effect on the pointing error. (It does affect the accuracy of wavefront correction, which will affect the pointing error.) The \u03b2 loop signal is partly derived from the dim received target image Tand so is signal limited and will have a low bandwidth. In addition, the speed of the \u03b2 loop is limited by the round trip transit time of the light to the target and back (and even longer if the tracker is looking at the thermal hotspot instead of the reflected laser source beam light). How low and high frequency jitter components become pointing errors is also evident from Eqn. 17. Table IV gives the coefficients for the terms of Eqn. 17 for both the low frequency and high frequency components.","Just as tracking in the prior art, , could be done by any of six system configurations,  does not represent the only way to implement the point-ahead function. Again, there are three legs available for steering and two control lines for the servo loops, but now there are three images in the tracker to drive the two servo loops, which gives three drive combinations, for a total of eighteen system configurations. Of all of these systems, System 1-1 is the presently preferred system.","It also might seem that since the three tracker images are being driven to coincidence, it would not matter which two of the three pairs was used. It matters for two reasons: first, the form of the equations is changed slightly and the resulting coefficients are different; second, the target image is of low bandwidth because of a low signal level, but the current aimpoint image is of low bandwidth because of the round trip transit time, so the bandwidths of the signals are different.","Finally, the wavefront correctors. The output wave sensor  senses the source laser beam wavefront Wand can feed back in a wavefront correction loop to a deformable mirror on the telescope primary (or in the common path ). The output wave sensor also senses the marker laser beam wavefront Win the target image direction and can feed back in a wavefront correction loop to a deformable mirror in the marker leg . The wavefront correction loops are denoted by the curved dotted lines. Again, with two deformable mirrors to be put into three legs and with two control lines, there are six arrangements of the deformable mirrors. All of these work, but the one illustrated here is the most desirable from the view-point of optical considerations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6","1","6","6","2","6","6","5","21","6","5","23","17","19","20"],"i":["a ","a ","b ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a","a ","a ","a "],"sub":"R "},"Equations 18-28 below, define the system of  which is System 1-2.\n\n=\u2212\u03b1()\u2003\u200318\n\n=\u2212\u03b2()\u2003\u200319\n\n\u2032()\u2003\u200320\n\n\u2003\u200321\n\n\u2003\u200322\n\n\u2003\u200323\n\n\u2003\u200324\n\n\u2003\u200325\n\n\u2212\u03b2\u2003\u200326\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0080"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00017","num":"00017"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["v","c"]}}}},{"mn":"27"}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0081"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00018","num":"00018"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["W","H"]},"mo":"-","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["W","T"]},"mo":"+","mi":"\u03b8"}}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"H","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"1","mo":["+","+"],"mi":"\u03b2","msup":{"mi":["\u03b3","\u2032"]}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mi":"\u03b2"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msup":{"mi":["\u03b3","\u2032"]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}]}},{"mi":"C","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mi":"\u03b2"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["D","N"],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":"\u03b2","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mi":"\u03b2"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msup":{"mi":["\u03b3","\u2032"]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}},{"msub":{"mi":["W","T"]},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mi":"\u03b2"}}},{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mi":"\u03b2"}}}],"mo":["+","+","-","-"]}],"mo":"="}},{"mn":"28"}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0082"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE V"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["W\u2212 (W+ \u03b8)","H","D, N","C","W","\u03b8"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["LOW FREQ. \u03b2, >> 1",{"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00019","num":"00019"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","mi":"\u03b2"},{"mn":"1","msup":{"mi":["\u03b3","\u2032"]}}],"mo":"+"}}}},{"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00020","num":"00020"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msup":{"mi":["\u03b3","\u2032"]}}}}},{"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00021","num":"00021"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"\u03b2"}}}},{"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00022","num":"00022"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"\u03b2"}}}}},{"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00023","num":"00023"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"\u03b2"}}}}}]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["HIGH FREQ.  \u2009>>1 \u03b2 << 1","1",{"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00024","num":"00024"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03b2","msup":{"mi":["\u03b3","\u2032"]}}}}},"1","\u22121","\u22121"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In this group of equations, Eqn. 28 provides the solution for the pointing error W\u2212(W+\u03b8).

changes reflected in the mathematical analysis from prior art system , above, include first, the addition of mirror  on the stable platform , designated by Rin  and driven by the tracker signal as described above; second, changing the common path mirror  (R) to be driven by the difference between the directions of the stable beam Wand the marker beam Was measured by the output wave sensor; and third, showing the stable beam spot Win the output wave sensor , as the direction of the stable platform P plus the deviation of the steered platform mirror, R. This provides a new independent physical parameter, P, which represents the instabilities in the stable platform itself. These eight equations are then solved for the pointing error angle, (W\u2212W), defined in detail in Eqn. 37.","Just as for non-stabilized systems, the optical diagrams of  do not disclose the only way to connect the servo loops. Here again, there are six possible configurations and all involve stable platforms. The coefficients of the terms of the pointing error equation for , Eqn. 37, are given in Table VI. Examination of the low frequency components, Table VII, shows that the loop gains are all large and the coefficients of the terms can be simplified, as shown in Table VII. The servo loops attenuate the disturbances from all sources to give accurate pointing.","At higher frequencies, only the gain of the tracker loop falls off. The other signals are high-level, local loops and can have wide bandwidths. At these higher frequencies, the value of \u03b1 will become very small while the values of both \u03b2 and  remain large. The coefficients of the terms can be simplified under these conditions to give the high frequency results in Table VIII. High frequency real motions of the target show up as pointing errors, but compared to non-stable platform systems, jitters in the laser source beam, the marker beam, and the common paths no longer cause pointing errors. In exchange for this improvement, the pointing error becomes sensitive to high frequency jitters of the stable platform itself. That is the advantage of the stable platform system: The question is not how good can we build a stable platform, but which can we build more stable, a small stable platform or the whole optical system.","Additional and very important advantages of the stable platform system are that since the target image is stabilized on the tracker against all internal system jitters, the target image signal-to-noise ratio will be larger, dimmer or more distant targets can be detected, and the features of the image can be more readily discerned and the desired aimpoint more accurately determined.","In the second embodiment of this invention to be described, two shared aperture, inertially stabilized platform reference, laser transmitter pointing and tracking systems, with independent wavefront correction for the transmitted laser and received target image, and that solve the point-ahead problem, are presented. The stable platform provides the same advantages for these point-ahead systems as it provides for non-point-ahead prior art systems: all system jitters are fully compensated without relying on the tracker to detect them; they are detected by local alignment loops and removed; the tracker only has to follow true target motion; the target image is stabilized on the tracker focal plane for an increased signal-to-noise ratio in the tracker.","The methods of solving the point-ahead problem, the choice between the two versions in any particular system, and the advantages of this second embodiment of the invention are the same as those of the first embodiment. Additionally, this embodiment of the invention provides reduced pointing errors resulting from the use of the inertially stabilized reference.","Just as for the improved non-stable-platform systems, System 1-1 and System 1-2, the point-ahead solution described here depends on seeing the current aimpoint on the target, and just as for the non-stable systems, the aimpoint is positioned on the target by adding a temporary offset into one of the pointing servo loops until the current aimpoint shows up on the target. This is described in connection with , above. Once the current aimpoint is available, the point-ahead tracking of System 2-1 will close on the desired aimpoint, with no offsets in the loops.","System 2-1 shown in  is a stable platform, point-ahead system. Equations 38-50 for this system together with Table IX are presented below. What has been added for the point-ahead function, compared to the prior art , is the returned image of the current aimpoint Tin the tracker and a second stable laser beam source, Q, and beam steering mirror,  (R), on the stable platform. The locations in the focal plane of the tracker  of the desired aimpoint  (T) and marker reference  (T), drive the steering mirror  (R) to point the beam of the stabilized platform  (P) in the direction of the received target image W, Eqn. 39, and the locations in the focal plane of the tracker of the current aimpoint Tand the desired aimpoint  (T) drive the stabilized beam Q to point in the point-ahead direction, Eqn. 40. The \u2009servo, controlled by the signal (W\u2212W) of the output wave sensor , then drives the marker beam (M) in the direction of the stabilized platform beam P, Eqn. 41, and the \u03b2 servo, controlled by the signal (W\u2212W) of the output wave sensor , drives the source laser beam (H) in the direction of the stabilized beam Q, Eqn. 38.

for the directions of the beams P and Q reflected from their mirrors, Eqns. 46 and 47; for following the returned current aimpoint image Tin the focal plane of the tracker through the system, Eqn. 45; and for expressing the point-ahead difference in directions between the transmitted source laser beam and the returned current aimpoint beam, Eqn. 48. The solution of these equations for the pointing error W\u2212(W+\u03b8), defined by Eqn. 50, has contributions from not only disturbances in the laser source beam H, the marker laser beam M, the common paths  and , target location, and stable platform beam P, but now also from the stabilized beam Q and the point-ahead angle .","The \u03b1 loop is of low bandwidth because the target image Tin the tracker is dim and the \u03b4 loop is limited by the round trip transit time, so these two gains roll off in frequency before the high-level, local loop, \u03b2 and  gains. How low and high frequency jitter components become pointing errors is seen in Table IX. By comparing this system, System 2-1, with System 1-1, it is clear that this stable platform point-ahead system retains all the advantages of the stable platform: all internal system jitters are removed by the stable platform loops and do not rely on the track loop, and the target image is stabilized on the tracker against all internal system jitters.","As noted above, there are six possible configurations of the stable platform prior art system of . All six of these non-point-ahead, stable platform systems can be converted to point-ahead systems in the same manner by adding a stable platform beam Q driven by the returned current aimpoint image. Also, there are three tracker images being driven into coincidence. These are the target image desired aimpoint T, the reference marker laser beam image T, and the returned current aimpoint image T. Any two of the three pairwise comparisons can be used to drive the \u03b1 and \u03b4 servo loops for a total of eighteen systems. These are not developed here in the interest of simplicity, however the combinations are easily realized.","Attention is directed to the fact that the current aimpoint image Tin the tracker focal plane is directly compared to the desired aimpoint image Trather than to the marker reference image T. Then the pointing error becomes independent of those elements that follow the target image. These elements are the elements involving the characteristics M, N, P, and the servo loop gains \u03b1 and . In exchange, the \u03b4 servo loop, driven by the difference in location of the desired and current aimpoints Tand T, is further limited in bandwidth because both of its sources Tand Tare of low bandwidth. Whether or not this choice among the eighteen combinations available to form System 2-1 is optimal depends on the particular circumstances.","Since the stabilized beam P now has no direct effect on the pointing accuracy, consideration might be given to eliminating it and driving the mirror Rdirectly with the signal in the \u03b1 loop, thereby converting the \u03b1 servo loop into an unstabilized tracker. But the stabilized beam P does more than just stabilize the marker beam M that senses the wavefront correction needed in the target image path; it also stabilizes the target image Tin the tracker, not only against jitters in the beams M and N, but also against jitters in the laser source beam H that are taken out in the common leg by the \u03b2 servo loop, Eqn. 38, and thereby added to target image jitter. Without the stabilized beam P to stabilize the tracker image, this spreads out the target and the information in the returned beam T, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and the image quality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0106"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"i":["a ","a ","a.

Equation 90 defines the pointing error, and Table XII provides the high and low frequency coefficients for the terms of Eqn. 90. In Equations 89 and 90, item G represents bending of the periscope. The performance of the system against low and high frequency disturbances is apparent from the above. Except for the periscope errors, this system works just as well as a shared aperture system. The critical item is the transfer periscope . Any low frequency non-rigid-body motions of the periscope are directly reflected as pointing errors. At high frequencies, periscope errors are attenuated because they cause the  servo loop, Eqn. 81, to move the image of the target in the tracker . The \u03b1 servo loop of the tracker , Eqn. 83, then tries to drive the optics  of the stable platform , but these target image motions are beyond the tracker's bandwidth and the tracker gain rolls off, attenuating the effect on the stable platform. The stable platform  could have been put on the receiver telescope and coupled by a periscope  over to the transmitter telescope , but then there would be no attenuation of periscope errors because they would be directly injected into the transmitter by the \u03b2 servo loop.","Two separate implementations of this third embodiment, System 3-1, , and System 3-2, , are presented. These are separate aperture, inertially stabilized platform reference, laser transmitter, pointing and tracking systems with independent wavefront corrections for the transmitted laser beam and received target image. They also solve the point-ahead problem. All of the stable platform advantages are preserved in these implementations.","Separate transmitter and receiver telescopes and provide separate apertures. These remove the need for a high power shared aperture component  as employed in the embodiments of this invention described above. The shared aperture component, which is conceptually a beam splitter, allows the receiver and the transmitter to share the same telescope. Hence the term, shared aperture system. However, shared aperture systems require a shared aperture component that can operate in a high power range. Such a component has many requirements: high power operation, low backscatter of the designator (if one is used) and marker beams into the tracker, low backscatter of the source laser energy into the tracker (for those systems that sense the source laser energy to locate the current aimpoint), high efficiency for the source laser beam, high efficiency for the marker laser and designator laser beams, high efficiency for the returning target image beam, and high efficiency for the returning current aimpoint image beam.","For the highest powers, a diffraction grating is usually the only shared aperture component that can survive. A grating can be made that is efficient in transmitting a multi-wavelength high energy laser beam and in either transmitting a shorter wavelength marker or in receiving shorter wavelength target and current aimpoint images. But gratings that are presently available are not efficient in both transmitting and receiving the same wavelength. For a shared aperture system, it is desirable that the gratings be made to be efficient in transmitting the high energy laser beam and in receiving the target image and the current aimpoint image if it is from a separate designator beam, while accepting a lesser efficiency in transmitting the designator (if used) and marker laser beams and for receiving the current aimpoint image if it is from the high energy laser.","This third embodiment of this invention offers improvements in the methods of solving the point-ahead problem. It enjoys all the advantages of Systems 1-1 and 1-2. A further advantage is that there are fewer signals to be distinguished in the focal plane of the output wave sensor  of the transmitter telescope.","The point-ahead solution offered by this first implementation of the third embodiment of this invention depends upon seeing the current aimpoint on the target, so it is placed on the target by adding a temporary offset to one of the pointing servo loops until the current aimpoint shows up on the target. This is described above in connection with the systems of the first embodiment of this invention. Once the current aimpoint is available, the point-ahead tracking will close on the desired aimpoint, with no offsets in the servo loops.","The point-ahead system, System 3-1, is shown in  and the Eqns. 91-103 defining the system are below. Attention is directed to the fact that no periscope is needed for its operation. The receiver's stable platform beam P is driven by the Q loop, which controls the beam steering mirror , by the comparison of the location (direction) of the target desired aimpoint Twith the location (direction) of the marker reference Tin the tracker focal plane, Eqn. 94. The tracker image is stabilized by signals derived from the locations. (directions) of the stable beam wavefront Wand the marker beam wavefront Win the focal plane of the receiver's output wave sensor, Eqn. 91. The transmitter's stable platform beam Q is driven by the difference in locations (directions) of the current aimpoint Tand the marker reference T(or with the desired aimpoint T) in the tracker focal plane, Eqn. 93.

103 defines the pointing error. Table XIII provides the low frequency and high frequency coefficients for the terms of the Eqn. 103. The \u03b1 loop is of low bandwidth because the target is dim, and the \u03b4 loop will be limited by the round trip transit time, so these two gains will roll off in frequency before the high-level local loop B and gains. How the low and high frequency jitter components become pointing errors is seen in the Table. Just as for the shared aperture systems, all local jitters, even those beyond the bandwidth of the tracker, are removed by the local loops. The performance is just as good as for a shared aperture system.","Since there are three tracker images T, T, and T, being driven into coincidence by two control loops, there are three pairwise comparisons that may be made. This gives three different pointer-trackers, with slightly different properties because of the different bandwidths of the tracker image signals and the slightly different forms of the coefficients in the equations.","For wavefront correction, the marker beam wavefront Win the output wave sensor of the receiver and the source laser beam wavefront Win the output wave sensor of the transmitter are sampled by their respective output wave sensors to drive deformable mirrors and , respectively, in wavefront correction servo loops. Each mirror corrects independently of the other for its own telescope and its own direction of view.","This second implementation of the third embodiment of this invention deals with the situation where the tracker is not sensitive to the source laser beam wavelength and a current aimpoint designator must be supplied. System 3-2 is shown in  and Eqns. 104 to 119 defining this implementation of the third embodiment of this invention together with Table XIV are presented below. The difference in this system with respect to that of  resides in the addition of a designator laser beam source  for the purpose of introducing a designator laser beam D in the transmitter and serving the designator laser beam into alignment with the source laser beam H by comparing the direction of the designator beam D with that of the stable beam Q (or the laser source sample beam H) in the transmitter output wave sensor, Eqn. 108.","The source laser beam H and the designator laser beam D are directed into a common path by an element  that functions to transmit the source laser beam and to reflect the designator laser beam. In this respect the element  has the characteristics of a shared aperture component, but the severe requirements of a shared aperture component are not necessary here. Element  need be efficient only in transmitting the source laser beam, be reasonably efficient in transmitting the designator laser beam, and that's all.

118 defines the pointing error. Table XIV provides the low frequency and high frequency coefficients for the terms of Eqn. 118. It is evident from this how low and high frequency disturbances propagate into pointing errors. Again, all the stable platform advantages are preserved.","For wavefront correction, the receiver samples the wavefront of its marker beam Win the focal plane of its output wave sensor and uses the information in a wavefront correction loop to control a deformable mirror . The transmitter samples the wavefronts Wand Wof both the source laser beam H and the designator laser beam D in the focal plane of its output wave sensor and uses the information in wavefront correction loops to control deformable mirrors and , respectively, in the appropriate legs. By these expedients, the wavefronts of the transmitted and received laser beams are corrected. In the transmitter, there are two corrections with three legs available, but the most desirable arrangement from the viewpoint of optical considerations is to put the source laser beam wavefront correction in the primary leg and the designator wavefront correction in the designator leg, as shown.","The several embodiments of this invention are not limited to the use of one specific type of output wave sensor. There are a number of ways of building output wave sensors. Some output wave sensors split the wavefront, bring one portion to a focus to get the direction, and analyze the phase profile or phase and amplitude profile of the other portion. Some output wave sensors measure only the phase and amplitude profiles and calculate the pointing direction from that without ever bringing the beam to a focus. Some output wave sensors bring the beam to a focus and carefully analyze the spread of the focused spot. Thus, while a specific output wave sensor is illustrated and described herein, other types are employable, the essential function being the measurement of the \u201cdirection\u201d of the beam and the \u201cwavefront\u201d of the beam, however the output wave sensor does it.","Other types of servos may be used. Servos and servo methods are well known and are textbook subject matter. The servo design requires no experimentation and depends only upon a detailed design of a system.","The invention is not limited to the use of deformable mirrors, but can use any wavefront compensating technique, such as phase and amplitude control or phase conjugate mirrors.","The examples employed herein refer to \u201ctransmitting,\u201d \u201creflecting,\u201d or \u201cdiffracting\u201d the beams. These are descriptive of specific examples and are not intended to be restrictive. In most places a \u201ctransmitting,\u201d \u201creflecting,\u201d or \u201cdiffracting\u201d element can be replaced with one of the other types without the need for experimentation and with no change in the overall concept.","The use of the term \u201cstable laser beam\u201d or \u201cstabilized laser beam\u201d is intended to imply an inertially stabilized platform reference such as a stable platform beam or a beam in a system comprising a stable flat mirror and an autocollimator."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":["a ","e "],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
