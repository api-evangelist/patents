title: System and method for extending a visualization platform
abstract: Systems and methods for extending a visualization platform are disclosed. A user may create a visualization project created. One or more properties for a non-native widget established by a developer of the non-native widget may be received from the project. Such properties may designate a name or a type of data that the non-native widget is capable of processing. Responsive to an instruction received from the user of the visualization authoring environment, a source of data to be processed by the non-native widget or a destination of data produced by the non-native widget to be processed by other widgets may be established. The appearance or behavior of the non-native widget may be rendered based at least in part on a value available from the source of the data or the appearance or behavior of one or more other widgets may be rendered based at least in part on data produced by the non-native widget.

Description of the Related Art","With the increasing complexity involved in the development of computer programs, it has become increasingly expensive, time consuming, and risky to develop software applications. Often, after a given software application has been coded and deployed, actual use by the intended users reveals many defects in the application. Correction of such defects after the application is deployed results in customer dissatisfaction and further significant costs.","While software tools have been developed to simulate software applications, such tools tend to have limited extensibility. For example, it may not be possible to utilize widgets that are not included in the tools to develop visualizations of a proposed software application using conventional methods.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects.

Further, embodiments may include several novel features, no single one of which is solely responsible for the embodiment's desirable attributes or which is essential to practicing the systems, devices, methods, and techniques described herein.","Descriptions and examples herein may refer to utilization of certain embodiments with example commercially available products, such as: iRise Studio (or just Studio or client)\u2014a visualization authoring environment that enables users to create and define (e.g., via a drag and drop interface and other interfaces) appearance, workflow and behavior of proposed applications, and which can import simulated data from production systems to make the final result realistic; iRise Definition Center (or just DC or server)\u2014a visualization rendering environment and visualization repository and which provides an electronic meeting place where users, such as business analysts, usability professionals and project managers, may collaborate to visually define applications, and when used in combination with a visualization authoring environment, such as iRise Studio, provides a secure, shared workspace for members on a project team; and iRise Reader (or Reader or iDoc Reader) a visualization rendering environment which enables a user to access and view interactive visualizations (such as those created using iRise Studio) that users can use to interact with to experience proposed software before coding of the software, and via which users can comment on the interactive visualizations, where the comments can then be transmitted to and\/or accessed by an author of the interactive visualizations; and iDoc which refers to a visualization repository and\/or a visualization project. However, it is understood that embodiments described herein may be used with other such tools and applications, and are not limited to use with the example products described herein. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the phrase \u201cvisualization\u201d corresponds to \u201csimulation,\u201d and vice versa. Either term, unless context indicates otherwise, may also refer to a visualization project. Similarly, unless the context indicates otherwise, the phrase \u201csimulation platform\u201d corresponds to \u201cvisualization platform,\u201d and vice versa, and the phrase \u201csimulator\u201d corresponds to \u201cvisualization rendering environment,\u201d and vice versa.","As used herein, terms that are further qualified with adjectives but also used without qualification are intended to encompass, separately and collectively, the qualified terms unless the context indicates otherwise. For example, the term \u201cwidget\u201d may be further qualified with the adjectives \u201cnative\u201d and \u201ccustom\u201d. The use of the term \u201cwidget\u201d, when used without qualification is intended to refer to both \u201cnative widgets\u201d and \u201ccustom widgets\u201d or either \u201cnative widgets\u201d or \u201ccustom widgets\u201d unless the context indicates otherwise.","As used herein \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d are intended to refer to a user of visualization platform unless the context indicates otherwise.","The state of the art of software development has evolved to include processes and systems for visualization (sometimes referred to as simulation) of such software prior to its assembly, testing and deployment using traditional methods. Unlike systems and methods used to assemble actual working software, visualization processes and systems produce a facsimile of actual working software with greatly reduced investment of time and resources and these processes and systems can be operated by individuals not skilled in actual software application development.","These visualization processes and systems are typically utilized to provide an interactive representation of a prospective software application and such interactive representation is used to support diverse activities in the software development lifecycle, including optionally validation of designs and requirements for the prospective software application, testing of design concepts with eventual end users of the prospective software application, assessing the feasibility of the prospective software application and communicating the desired behavior and appearance of the prospective application to individuals participating in the software development lifecycle. Such a prospective software application might include a web-site, a smart-phone application, a standalone application, an application accessible by a browser or one or more of many other types of applications that involve receiving inputs from an individual using the application. In addition, these visualization processes and systems may be used to provide an interactive representation of prospective modifications to an existing software application.","These visualization processes and systems typically employ authoring environments for creation of visualizations (sometimes referred to as visualization authoring environments), in which the users of such systems assemble such visualizations, at least in part by adding instances of various user interface elements (sometimes referred to as widgets) and behavioral elements (sometimes referred to as events or actions) to a data file that can be transferred to other installations of a visualization authoring environment or visualization rendering environment (sometimes referred to as a visualization project or iDoc). These visualization processes and systems may also employ visualization repositories which provide for storage or distribution of visualization projects and other data relevant to the visualization processes and systems in a computer readable medium. These visualization processes and systems may also employ visualization rendering environments which, based at least in part on utilizing a visualization authoring environment or a visualization repository, produce an interactive representation of a prospective software application. The combination of one or more of a visualization authoring environment, visualization repository and visualization rendering environment is sometimes referred to as a visualization platform.","Visualization authoring environments and visualization rendering environments typically contain computer readable instructions that govern the appearance and behavior of a limited set of user interface elements and behavioral elements, while the data files contain information that modifies the appearance or behavior of the user interface elements and behavioral elements. For example, a visualization rendering environment may contain computer readable instructions on how to play a video file, the visualization project would contain the actual video content to be played and specify the size of the window in the user interface in which the video would be played.","Because visualization authoring environments utilize a limited set of user interface elements and behavioral elements encoded into a visualization authoring environment by the developer of such environment the visualizations that can be produced from them are similarly limited. are The user interface elements and behavioral elements available encoded by the developer of a visualization platform into that platform are sometimes referred to as \u201cnative\u201d elements (for example \u201cnative widgets\u201d or \u201cnative actions\u201d).","For example, a visualization author may be creating a visualization of a prospective software application in which a movie player window is desired to appear. If the visualization authoring environment does not offer a user interface element corresponding to a movie player window as a native widget, or does not offer behavioral elements corresponding to those common in the context of a movie player window (for example, pause, play or fast forward) as a native action, the visualization author may not be able to include these elements in the visualization of a prospective software application.","As software applications become more complex and sophisticated with respect to the variety of user interface elements and behavioral elements, requirements for prospective software applications become similarly more complex and sophisticated. Developers of visualization platforms have therefore incorporated new native widgets and actions into their platforms to permit the end users of such applications to simulate an ever-growing universe of user interface elements and behaviors, further necessitating the end users of visualization platform to acquire and install new versions of these platforms that contain the new native widgets and actions. Because there are significantly more companies and individuals developing new user interface and behavioral elements in software applications and relatively fewer companies and individuals developing analogous native widgets and actions for visualization platforms, visualization platforms frequently do not contain the native widgets and actions desired by end users of visualization platforms. Furthermore, since some developers of new user interface and behavioral elements for software applications consider such elements to be of a proprietary nature, visualization platform developers may not have sufficient information to incorporate analogous native widgets and actions into their visualization platforms.","Systems and methods are described herein that reduce these restrictions by providing a process by which visualization authoring environments can be easily extended to encompass additional user interface elements and behavioral elements sometimes referred to as \u201cnon-native\u201d elements, widgets or actions. Such additional user interface elements are also referred to herein as custom widgets (or simply widgets) and such additional behavioral elements are referred to herein as custom actions (or simply actions), and in some cases custom events (or simply events). For convenience custom widgets, custom actions and custom events may be referred to simply as custom widgets or iBlocs. In certain embodiments, such non-native elements or widgets may be non-integral to the visualization authoring environment while native widgets may be integral to the visualization authoring environment.","Additionally and optionally, the systems and methods described herein provide a process by which altering the appearance and behavior of a visualization platform can be accomplished (in addition to the introduction of additional user interface elements and behavioral elements). For example, a visualization rendering environment could be altered to provide a palette of annotation tools for collecting feedback on a prospective software application. As another example, a visualization platform could be altered to collect and analyze user interactions (for example, usability metrics) based on users interacting with the visualization rendering environment.","A benefit of the systems and methods described herein is that a wide variety of software developers can create new widgets and actions for a visualization platform, rather than relying on the developer of the visualization platform. These new widgets and actions can then be used by still wider group of end users of a visualization platform without necessitating acquisition or installation of new versions of such platforms. Furthermore, since the systems and methods herein provide for inclusion of all of the necessary information required by a visualization platform utilize new widgets and actions within visualization projects, end users of a visualization platform do not need to independently incorporate such elements into their visualization platform or take additional related steps, for example validating that their visualization platform has all of the elements necessary to process a particular visualization project.","Another benefit of the systems and methods described herein is that developers of custom widgets do not need to have access to or learn the structure of the source code for a visualization platform. Such source code is typically considered proprietary information of the developer of the visualization platform and not widely distributed, and is frequently very complex and difficult for a developer to modify or extend.","With reference to , the process begins by creation of a new user interface element or new behavioral element (1) by way of activities that will be described in more detail herein. The new element may then be temporarily stored locally in computer readable media (2) or optionally, may be stored in one or more facilities provided by public or private web-sites. Optionally, since more than one new element may be temporarily stored in such media or facilities, these media or facilities may be searched or sorted to further enable selection of an appropriate element (2a). The new element is then added to an instance (or several instances) of a visualization authoring environment (3), permitting the operator of such an environment to incorporate the new element into a visualization of a prospective software application (4). Optionally, the process may continue with an additional step wherein the operator of the visualization authoring environment may adjust one or more of the placement, orientation, configuration, properties or connections to (or from) the new element (5). Further, the process may optionally continue with an additional step wherein the visualization of the prospective software application that includes the new element is rendered or interacted with (6). Further, since more than one new element may be created at (1) and incorporated into the visualization authoring environment (3), an additional step may be included in the process by which the operator of the visualization authoring environment selects one or more additional previously added user interface elements or behavioral elements by searching or sorting through the previously added user interface elements and behavioral elements (3a).","(1) Creation of a New User Interface Element or New Behavioral Element.","Depending on the needs of the person creating such an element, the new element may be intended to appear or behave similarly to a known element or behavior present in an existing software program or may be intended to appear or behave in a way not previously realized in an existing software program. In yet another case, such an element may be based on a previously created element, with one or more modifications or improvements.","One of several embodiments of the process of creating a new user interface element or new behavioral element includes at least a subset of the following activities which are depicted in the : (1a) define a custom widget, (1b) define custom widget properties, (1c) define custom actions, (1d) define custom widget events, (1e) define custom widget visual style, (1f) define custom widget images, (1g) define use of a javascript library, (1h) constrain custom widget property values, (1i) specify custom widget descriptor, and (1j) define custom widget package specification. Each of these optional activities may occur in a sequence different than discussed herein in a different embodiment.","Each of these optional activities are described by way of illustration below using the example of a new custom widget called \u201ccolorbox\u201d or in some cases \u201cmycolorbox\u201d, however the same activities would generally apply regardless of the name or nature of the new custom widget (e.g., a new custom widget corresponding to a movie player window named \u201cmovieplayer\u201d.)","The present embodiment of activities related to the process of creating new user interface element or new behavioral element are described further below. By way of example, computer readable declarations and instructions may be presented below utilizing Extensible Markup Language (sometimes referred to as XML), JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (sometimes referred to as CSS), jQuery and JSON. In different embodiments, one or more other languages, libraries, conventions or technologies could be employed to the same effect.","(1a) Define Custom Widget.","The first step in defining a custom widget is defining an identifier (ID) that is unique to the widget. In the present embodiment, a component of a computer system is employed to acquire this identifier by way of a graphical user interface; however different embodiments may utilize other approaches common in the software industry (e.g., via a textural command line) or not typically used in the software industry. A widget can be uniquely identifiable by a compound ID that consists of three pieces of information: group, name and version, although other optional information may be included. This information may be used by other processes and components of the present embodiment that are described further herein and may or may not be presented in the visualization authoring environment. The group component of the compound ID provides name spacing, and as would be understood by an individual skilled in the art, name spacing helps avoid naming conflicts (e.g. if two companies have a widget with the same name). This is typically a representation of a company name, usually proceeded by \u2018com.\u2019 (e.g. if your company name is My Company Inc., you might choose com.mycompany). The name component of the compound ID may be a representation for the name of this widget (e.g. colorbox, movieplayer, imagebutton, box, map, etc.). The version component of the compound ID may be a designation used to delineate different variants of the custom widget, as would be understood by an individual skilled in the art. In addition other optional data elements may be part of the definition of a custom widget, for example display name, which may be presented in the context of a graphical user interface to the operator of the visualization authoring environment and the name of the author of the custom widget.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"]},"In the present embodiment, operation of the graphical user interface elements depicted in  and  cause a component of a computer system to persist the information to computer readable storage media, in this case the file system, using common techniques that would be apparent to an individual skilled in the art.

the present embodiment, a facility is available to assist in several of the activities described above. This facility, referred to as the iBloc creator utility packages a custom widget into a file or series of files as described herein. In the present embodiment, the iBloc creator utility takes the form of a computer module configured to take the following user input from the console: (a) location of the source directory where the iBloc data resides and (b) destination location where the iBloc will be extracted. If the destination is omitted, the current directory is used. If the iBloc name is not provided in the destination, an iBloc with name <namespace>-<name>-<version>.ibloc is used where namespace, name, and version correspond to the namespace, name and version as defined in the iBloc schema. Further, the iBloc creator utility functions to validate against the ibloc schema using a standard xml SAX parser that handles schema validation. If the validation fails, an informative message is presented to the user (including the line number(s) that are the cause of the error). Further, the iBloc creator utility continues processing with one or more of the following activities:\n\n","An operator of the iBloc creator utility may interact with it through one or more of the following optional activities:","To use the tool: 1. Launch the command prompt. 2. Navigate to the directory where the tool has been extracted (e.g., if the extracted folder is in C:\\work\\irise-ibloc-generator, type \u201ccd C:\\work\\irise-ibloc-generator\u201d). 3. Then type: ibloc-generator.bat [working directory] [iBloc destination folder\\file name] to generate the iBloc.","By way of example, an operator of the iBloc utility may replace [working directory] with the path of the folder that contains the ibloc.xml file, e.g. C:\\myWidgets\\com.irise\\ColorBox\\1 and replace [iBloc destination folder\\file name] with your iBloc folder and file name, e.g. C:\\Users\\[username]\\Documents\\iRise\\myColorBox.ibloc.","The foregoing examples of activities involved in the creation of a new element could, in a different embodiment, be partially accomplished with the aid of a computer system component or components, in addition to the iBloc creator utility, each optionally configured to present the information through a graphical user interface and optionally configured to accept input information through the monitoring of keyboard, mouse, touch screen or other user interface technology.","It should be reiterated that the foregoing examples pertain to a relatively simple custom widget named Colorbox or myColorBox, but the activities described herein can be utilized to create a wide variety of more complicated and practical custom widgets, for example, calendar pickers that commonly occur on airline reservation web sites, contact lists that commonly occur on smartphone applications, or credit card information collection forms that commonly appear in ecommerce applications.","(2) Optionally Store New Element.","In the present embodiment, a new element is stored on computer readable media and may be transferred between computer systems using common methods, including email, File Transfer Protocol (sometimes referred to as FTP) or other appropriate means. In different embodiments, the new element could also be stored in a database, including a relational database or RDBMS, an object oriented database or other electronic repository. To facilitate transfer of new user interface element or new behavioral element between creators of such elements and authors of visualizations (as well as, optionally, consumers of such visualizations), the present embodiment also optionally includes a public or private web-site depicted in  that stores one or more such elements.","In the present embodiment, a custom widget, custom action, or custom event may also be referred to as an \u201ciBloc\u201d. In different embodiments, the web-site or other facility for temporary storage and transfer of new element might include additional capabilities to permit searching and sorting of new elements (2a).","(3) Adding a New Custom Widget","In the present embodiment, a custom widget is represented by one or more of a group of files (previously discussed in the descriptions of activities 1a through 1j) that are used to support the new element being incorporated into a visualization authoring environment. After acquiring the files representing a custom widget, the operator of a visualization authoring environment saves the files on their hard drive or other computer readable media. Advantageously, in the present embodiment, a visualization authoring environment computer software component is configured to monitor the computer readable media for the presence of a new custom widget and perform one or more of several activities when a new custom widget is detected. This monitoring permits the adding of a new custom widget without further user inputs. The activities performed when a new custom widget is detected optionally include the following, and may occur in any order.","a) Validate that the contents of the files representing the custom widget conform to an iBloc schema. An iBloc schema is a computer readable declaration of the structure and valid contents of the files representing a custom widget. In the present embodiment the iBloc schema is expressed in XML or an XML Schema Document, sometimes referred to as an XSD, although in different embodiments the an iBloc schema may be expressed using other conventions or standards. The iBloc schema of the present embodiment is reproduced in text form.","b) Store the contents of the files representing the custom widget in format more readily accessible by a visualization authoring environment, for example in the computer memory allocated to the visualization authoring environment. In the present example, this information may be stored in a directory structure in the form of \u201cnamespace\/name\/version\u201d and, optionally, in sub-directories relative to the version directory.","c) Validate that the visualization authoring environment has a valid license to use the custom widget. As custom widgets may represent something of value to their creators and users, the creator of the custom widget may optionally utilize the techniques and facilities described in activities 1a through 1j to cause the representation or behavior of the custom widget in the visualization authoring environment or the visualization produced from it to not operate or to operate in a limited fashion, with a reduction in functionality, in the absence of a valid license key or other token. In different embodiments, this could be accomplished using public or commercially available licensing technology that would be apparent to an individual skilled in the art. Further, in a different embodiment the evaluation of the license validity could be performed upon the first attempted use of the custom widget, rather than at the time of incorporation into a visualization authoring environment.","d) Update repository of incorporated custom widgets. Optionally, a visualization authoring environment may maintain a repository or other persisted inventory of custom widgets that have been incorporated and this activity involves updating that persisted inventory for later retrieval.","Advantageously with respect to native widgets, the files representing the custom widget remain editable even after the process above, permitting them to be further modified without requiring re-execution of the this process or other processes described in (1).","The overall process described herein may optionally include an activity in which an operator of a visualization authoring environment searches or sorts custom widgets (3a) added to the visualization authoring environment as described under (2). An example graphical user interface of a visualization authoring environment is depicted in  showing the representation of several custom widgets (in this example labeled \u201cGoogle Map\u201d, \u201cImage Flow\u201d, \u201cSlider (horizontal)\u201d and \u201cSlider (vertical)\u201d that have been added to a visualization authoring environment, as well as graphical user interface controls for sorting and searching custom widgets. In the present embodiment, custom widgets and custom actions are segregated (but available using the graphical user interface controls labeled \u201cWidgets\u201d and \u201cActions\u201d), but in different embodiments custom widgets and actions could be presented in a non-segregated fashion. Referring to , immediately following the example graphical user interface is a table that further describes optional features available in the present embodiment.","Advantageously, the present embodiment permits adding a new custom widget without requiring one or more of the following activities: acquiring a new version of the visualization authoring environment, installing a new version of the visualization authoring environment, stopping the execution of the visualization authoring environment, restarting the execution of the visualization authoring environment, writing or modifying computer readable instructions for the visualization authoring environment.","(4) Optionally Incorporate New Element into Visualization Project.","Once one or more new elements have been added to a visualization authoring environment or instance of a visualization authoring environment, the operator thereof may optionally incorporate one or more of such new elements into a visualization project. A visualization project refers to the information stored in computer readable media or computer memory that contains information specific to the prospective application being visualized using the visualization authoring environment and optionally a corresponding visualization rendering environment, as well as optionally additional information. Visualization project also refers to the graphical representation of such prospective application and additional information in a graphical user interface either as part of a visualization authoring environment or a visualization rendering environment. In the present embodiment, custom widgets are incorporated into visualization projects using one of several techniques provided by a visualization authoring environment including using a mouse to click on a representation (for example the a small icon image described in (1f)) of the custom widget, dragging such representation into the graphical user interface area that represents the visualization project and releasing the mouse button. Advantageously, in the present embodiment, incorporation of custom widgets into a visualization project does not require the user of the visualization authoring environment to write computer code. In the present embodiment, several additional activities take place as result of this action, including optionally:","a) The visualization authoring environment determines if the custom widget had already been incorporated into the visualization project, and if not, copy the information in the files that correspond to the custom widget into the project. In the present embodiment determination of if a custom widget has already been incorporated into visualization project is accomplished by searching the visualization project (using techniques common in the state of the art) for a portion of or all of the ID established as described in 1a above. Optionally, the visualization authoring environment may further determine, using similar techniques, if the version designation optionally included in the compound ID of the previously incorporated custom widget matches the version designation of custom widget being incorporated. If full or partial match for the ID is found, optionally, the visualization authoring environment may present one or more options using a graphical user interface to allow the operator of the visualization authoring environment to choose optional processing to occur.","b) The visualization authoring environment inserts an instance of the custom widget in the visualization project at the location received by the visualization authoring environment from the operator, for example, based on the location of the cursor upon release of the mouse button. Based on information that may be included in the files described in 1, such instance may be configured with a list of custom widget properties, default values and other information specific to the particular instance of the custom widget. In addition to the instance of the custom widget, the visualization authoring environment configures such instance and optionally adds additional data to the visualization project, based on if the ID was found in the visualization project, optionally the operator's choice received by the visualization authoring environment and optionally other factors.","For example, if the ID was found in the visualization project and such ID contained a matching version designation, no addition processing is performed.","As a further example, if the ID was not found, the various files described in 1 above are replicated and stored in the visualization project (e.g., encapsulated), and optionally, a reference is created from the newly added instance to the replicated files. In the present embodiment a storage structure is used that contains a header allowing the visualization authoring environment to ensure the data contained in the various files described in 1 above is valid by verifying the header, and allows the visualization authoring environment to ensure the data format used in the various files described in 1 is supported by the visualization authoring environment, at least in part by evaluating an integer representing the iBloc data version in the storage structure.","As a further example, if the ID was found but contained a different version designation, based in least at part on the choice received by the visualization authoring environment in (b) above, the various files described in (1) above replicated and stored in the visualization project, and optionally, a reference is created from the newly added instance to the replicated files.","As a further example, if the ID was found but contained a different version designation, based in least at part on the choice received by the visualization authoring environment in (b) above the visualization authoring environment replaces data associated with the existing custom widget with the information in the various files described in (1).","The forgoing processing facilitates the transfer of visualization projects containing custom widgets among visualization platforms and between the users thereof. Because the information necessary for displaying and defining the behavior of a custom widget can be incorporated into the visualization project, it is not necessary for operators of the visualization platform to separately incorporate such information into their instances of the visualization platform by, for example, installing a new version of a visualization platform component or incorporating the custom widget into their visualization authoring environment as described in (3).","In the present embodiment, the header can be further described as a 15 byte header broken down into a 11 byte file marker (other size headers and markers may be used): \u201ciRise iBloc\u201d and a 4 byte integer representing the iBloc data format version. Additional data is stored as a zip stream containing the ibloc.xml and optionally all resources, with the entries are stored as: namespace\/name\/version\/<resource> where <resource> represents the relative path to the resource. In the present embodiment, iBlocs are stored in DOD at the project level as one Nnde representing the iBloc definition with one Binary Node (Blob) containing the ibloc.xml and one Binary Node (Blob) for each resource.","c) The display of the graphical user interface of the visualization authoring environment is updated to show the inclusion of the custom widget. In the present embodiment, this is accomplished by displaying one or more of the images associated with the custom widget as described in (1f) and one or more of the properties of the custom widget. By way of example, the  depicts a custom action named \u201cSlider (horizontal)\u201d in the display of the graphical user interface of a visualization authoring environment.","In a different embodiment, corresponding to the different embodiment described in (1f), updating the display of the graphical user interface of the visualization authoring environment could be accomplished by executing the instructions stored as, for example Java2D or SVG instructions.","Once the information from the files representing the custom widget are incorporated into the visualization project they become part of the visualization project and are therefore transported with it. For example, visualization authoring environments (which are generally used to create, edit and modify visualization projects), as well as visualization rendering environments (which are generally used to render visualization projects), typically have one or more facilities for transfer of visualization projects between environments, instances of environments, computer hardware systems or individual operators. Including the information needed to define and realize the visual appearance and behavior of the custom widget into the visualization project obviates the need to independently transfer this information between such environments, systems, or operators. For example, one operator of a visualization authoring environment may utilize several custom widgets in a particular visualization project and wish to share his or her work with a college, who is operating another instance of a visualization authoring environment. By simply utilizing the typical features of a visualization authoring environment to transfer a visualization project from the first operator to the second operator, the second operator's can utilize one or more features of the custom widget without having to separately incorporate the custom widget into their instance of the visualization authoring environment. In a different embodiment, the information from the files representing the custom widget may not be incorporated, or may only be partially incorporated, into the visualization project requiring that the second operator identify the missing information or custom widget and incorporate it into their visualization authoring environment through an activity analogous to (3) Adding a custom widget.","(5) Optionally adjust one or more of the placement, orientation, configuration, properties or connections to (or from) the new element.","Custom widgets that have been incorporated into a visualization project may optionally be further repeatedly adjusted to change their placement, orientation, configuration and properties. Further, custom widgets that have been incorporated into a visualization project may optionally be connected to or from other widgets, actions or events (or custom widgets, actions and events). These adjustments and connections enable the visual appearance and behavior of the specific instance of the custom widget to be modified. Because they are applied to the specific instance of the custom widget, the information discussed in activities (1a) through (1j) are not changed and the visual appearance and behavior of other instances of the custom widget (in the same or different visualization projects) are not modified.","In the present embodiment, the adjustments and connections are accomplished using various features and functions of a visualization authoring environment also applicable to widgets, actions and events that may not be custom widgets, custom actions or custom events.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0187","num":"0192"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},"For example, in a visualization authoring environment, a user may select a widget, drag the widget, and drop the widget in a different location in the design area (which may also be referred to canvas or page) of a visualization authoring environment (by way of mouse movements or similar gestures), in order to accomplish adjustment of the widgets' placement.","As an additional example, in a visualization authoring environment, a user may select a widget, drag the widget, and drop the widget on top of another widget (by way of mouse movements or similar gestures), in order to accomplish connecting the widget or from other widgets, actions or events.","As an additional example the properties of a widget may be manipulated by providing inputs (by way of mouse movement or keyboard inputs) to a details panel, or other graphical user interface facilities, in order to modify the properties or attributes of a widget.","The adjustments and connections described herein and provided in these examples, and or the results thereof, may be stored by the visualization authoring environment into temporary computer memory or stored in other computer readable media.","It should be noted that, in the present embodiment, custom widgets can be utilized in visualization projects in the same way that native widgets can be used. For example, custom widgets can be connected to custom or native actions in the same manner as native widgets are connected to native actions of a visualization authoring environment and exhibit the same behavior in a visualization rendering environment.","Further, in the present embodiment, appropriately configured custom widgets may be used in ways advantageous over native widgets. For example, in the present embodiment, custom widgets can be configured to accept multiple connections corresponding to dataflow into the custom widget and out of the custom widget. In either case, the creator of the custom widget or the operator of the visualization authoring environment may specify which properties to flow out of the custom widget as well as which properties to populate with dataflow input values. Further, in the case of dataflow connected from a custom widget, one or more properties can flow out to one or more dataflow destinations. Thus one property can be flowed out to multiple widgets and multiple properties can be flowed out to multiple widgets. When connecting dataflow in, one input value can be flowed in to multiple properties. Multiple input values can also be flowed into multiple properties.","Further, in the present embodiment, dataflow enables custom widgets to participate in visualization data persistence by storing and retrieving values from a datasheet, which may also be may be stored by the visualization authoring environment into temporary computer memory or stored in other computer readable media.","(6) Optionally Render Visualization Project.","Further, the process may optionally continue with an additional step wherein the visualization of the prospective software application that includes the new element is rendered or otherwise interacted with. For example, a visualization rendering environment may read visualization repository information containing a custom widget (for example a movie player) and display on a computer screen an interactive representation of the custom widget in order to solicit feedback from potential users of the prospective application on the placement, appearance or behavior of a movie player. Further, the potential users may operate, through the use of mouse movements or keyboard inputs, various custom actions (e.g., play, stop, fast forward) associated with the custom widget. As an additional example, a visualization platform may be extended to accept feedback on the placement, appearance or behavior of other elements utilizing recording of speech and storage of a corresponding sound file to the visualization repository or other method of storing computer files.","In the present embodiment, a visualization rendering environment is configured to generate a interactive representation containing custom widgets, custom actions, or custom events by optionally performing one or more of the following activities:\n\n","In the present embodiment, the following is a representation of an the iBloc Schema.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0199","num":"0211"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00034","num":"00034"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml version=\u201c1.0\u201d encoding=\u201cUTF-8\u201d?>"},{"entry":"<xs:schema targetNamespace=\u201chttp:\/\/www.irise.com\/schema\/ibloc\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003xmlns=\u201chttp:\/\/www.irise.com\/schema\/ibloc\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003xmlns:xs=\u201chttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003xmlns:xmime=\u201chttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/2005\/05\/xmlmime\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003elementFormDefault=\u201cqualified\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003version=\u201c1.0\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2002<xs:element name=\u201cibloc\u201d type=\u201ciblocType\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2002<xs:simpleType name=\u201crestrictedIblocType\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003<xs:annotation>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002<xs:documentation>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002Restricts the descriptor type attribute to either a widget or an action"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002<\/xs:documentation>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/xs:annotation>"},{"entry":"\u2003<xs:restriction base=\u201cxs:string\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002<xs:enumeration value=\u201cwidget\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002<xs:enumeration value=\u201caction\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/xs:restriction>"},{"entry":"\u2002<\/xs:simpleType>"},{"entry":"\u2002<xs:group name=\u201cjsFunctionGroup\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003<xs:annotation>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002<xs:documentation>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003Javascript function element aggreggate for use in a choice element.

In this example, iTravel corresponds to a prospective software application and\/or a visualization project, slider, horizontal slider, dual slider, and price range slider correspond to non-native widgets, set value action, data table, clipboard, submit form, text, text widget, page, set value, standard button, and button correspond to native actions.","On the \u201cFlights\u201d page of the iTravel web site, two slider controls are desired to enable the user of the iTravel web site to filter the results of their search for flights. The first slider should allow the user of the iTravel web site to specify a price range by selecting a minimum and maximum price; the second slider should allow the user of the iTravel web site to set a maximum number of stops, with a range from 0 to 3. A button should be provided that the user of the iTravel web site can click to specify non-stop flights only. As the values of these three data fields (min price, max price, and stops) are changed by the user of the iTravel web site, the table that displays matching flights will dynamically change to reflect the new limitations.","As depicted in , two iBlocs may used to simulate the requirements for this page: a horizontal Slider widget, and a Set value action. One of the horizontal Sliders may be defined as a dual slider, which enables setting both a minimum and a maximum value for the price range. The Set value action, which will receive an event from a Button widget, may used to set the value of the Max stops Slider to 0.","The values of the min, max and stops data fields may also be used to set where conditions on the data flowing into the data table that displays matching flights from the flights datasheet, as is further described herein.","Example user inputs to the visualization authoring environment for adding widgets are described below:\n\n","Example user inputs to the visualization authoring environment for capturing price range data are described below:\n\n","Example user inputs to the visualization authoring environment for capturing max stops data are described below:\n\n","Example user inputs to the visualization authoring environment for sending data to widgets are described below:\n\n","Example user inputs to the visualization authoring environment for configuring the Set Value action are described below:\n\n","Based on the example inputs above, when the visualization rendering environment renders the visualization project for itravel, the Price Range Slider will appear with two handles, one at the 0 position and the other at the 600 position. The Max Stops Slider will appear with a single handle at the 0 position. In response to the user of the visualization rendering environment dragging any of the handles the values displayed in the Text widgets above the sliders will change and the handles should maintain their positions when they are released. The user of the visualization rendering environment will be constrained to changing the price range values in increments of 25, and the max stops value in increments of 1. If the user of the visualization rendering environment clicks on the non-stops only button the value of the max stops slider will be set to 0.","Based on similar inputs from the user of the visualization authoring environment, the values for min, max and stops may be used to filter the data records flowing from a flights datasheet into a data table on a page. By way of example, this could be accomplished with a get record widget that uses where conditions to filter the records flowing into the data table, as depicted in .","In this example, the slider widgets have pre-defined properties called \u2018Value\u2019 and \u2018Value2\u2019, with Value2 applying only to a dual slider. In order to permit data to be passed from the sliders to the clipboard, an association between the data fields and properties for the widgets is created. In this case, min is associated with Value and max is associated with Value2 in the price range slider, and stops with Value in the max stops slider.","In the example, an event called \u2018On value change\u2019 has also been pre-defined for the slider widgets. This has been associated with a Submit Form action causing the visualization rendering environment to process the data and refresh the page. The values for min, max and stops are also used to populate text widgets, as well as setting the values of the sliders after the page refresh.","Thus, described herein are systems and methods that enable a visualization authoring environment to be extended to encompass additional user interface elements and behavioral elements beyond those that are integral to the visualization authoring environment."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The disclosed aspects will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the appended drawings, provided to illustrate and not to limit the disclosed aspects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 3A-3B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-12, 15A","b":["16","17","18","20","21","23","26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIGS. 13A-13B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIGS. 19","FIGS. 19A-19B"],"b":"22"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
