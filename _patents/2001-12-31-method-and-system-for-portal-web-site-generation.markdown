The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","The invention generally relates to the field of web sites, and more particularly towards the field of portal web sites.","Generally, a web site is an arrangement of content, e.g., text, images, and sound, on a set of web pages configured for presentation over a computer network in a predetermined way. The content appearing on a web page is generally stored in a centralized location, such as, e.g., a database or a set of files. Requests for web pages are processed by a web server, which is a server that transmits web pages in response to HTTP requests from web browsers. Centralizing the storage of the web content found on web pages facilitates its transmission by the web server because the web content is in a known location that is readily available.","Web sites have become more complex as their application has spread. Web sites have proven to be a valuable means of communication both with the public (e.g., a corporate web site) and in private use (i.e., an Intranet site). In either case, it is advantageous to display content with as much breadth and depth as possible to maximize the utility of the web site to its users. However, as web content becomes more complex and diverse, the amount of time, money, and effort in obtaining, storing, and updating the web content increases.","More recently, portal web sites have been used to deliver complex and diverse content over a computer network. A portal web site is a web site containing one or more portlets displayed on a web page. A portlet is a configurable content area displayable on a web page that provides content or performs one or more associated functions. Portlets may display content that is obtained from sources external to the web server. For example, a portal web site may use an arrangement of portlets to display web content on different subject areas. The web content for each of the subject areas need not be stored centrally, but rather may be stored in a plurality of locations accessible to the portlet. Each portlet is configured such that it may display the information it obtains to the web browser.","An existing problem with this approach is that developing portal web sites still requires a significant investment of time, money, and effort. This is due, in part, to the cost of supporting the hardware and software necessary to support a portal web site and the computer specialists required to manage the portal web site. Further, constructing a portal web site from scratch is a time and labor intensive process. These associated costs often prohibit those without significant resources from building or using a portal web site. Unfortunately, there is no current solution in the art to create and deploy portal web sites without incurring these costs.","Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved method and system for portal web site generation. In an embodiment of the present invention, preference data is collected from a user of the portal web site. The preference data identifies a set of user preferences about the appearance and operation of a portal web site. The preference data is stored, and a portal web site is generated based upon the preference data. In an embodiment, the portal web site is generated entirely within the database. In another embodiment, seed data, which is data that identifies an initial appearance and operation of the portal web site, may be stored. Seed data may be used to efficiently store the preference data. Further details of aspects, objects, and advantages of the invention are described below in the detailed description, drawings, and claims.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","A user, as used within, refers to any person using a portal web site. A user will access a portal web site through a web browser. An administrator, as used herein, refers to any user who manages a portal web site. An administrator may have greater access privileges to the portal web site. Specifically, a user may only have sufficient access to change the portal web site for himself (the change is local to the particular user), whereas an administrator may be able to modify the configuration of the portal web site for all users, as well as add new users. A portal web site will be associated with a set of users, at least one of which is an administrator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","110","130","140","150","101","102","103","101","102","103"]},"The router  is a standard piece of equipment for routing digital communication, such as TCP\/IP packets. The router  is in data communication with the portal web server . Communication received over the Internet  by the router  is then routed to the appropriate destination, e.g., the login server  or the portal database , via the portal web server . In some embodiments of the invention, the portal web server  may reside behind the firewall , as shown in FIG. . In other words, data packets originating from the Internet , received by the router , and consequently routed to the portal web server  by the router  may pass through a firewall  before being passed on to their destination.","The login server  is a software component as well as a database that authenticates communication from users. The login server  authenticates communication from users by consulting information it has stored about the set of authenticated users. The login server  is operatively connected to the portal web server , and communicates with the portal database  via HTTP requests. While only one login server  is depicted in , some embodiments of the invention deploy multiple login servers . Such an embodiment may be advantageous for scaling to a large number of users. Accordingly, the invention is not limited by the number of login servers  deployed.","The portal database  is a standard software component for storing data, and includes the plurality of databases known to those in the art, such as, e.g., the Oracle 8i database, available from Oracle Corporation, located in Redwood Shores, Calif. The portal database  is operatively connected to the portal web server , and communicates with the login server  via HTTP requests. For ease of explanation, the portal database  and the login server  that are operatively connected to the portal web server  shall be assumed to be separate and singled databases. However, this need not be the case, and it should be understood to those in the art that for performance and security reasons, the data stored in these databases may be stored in a variety of arrangements, e.g., data may be stored in the same database or multiple databases. In other words, the portal web server  may be coupled to multiple portal databases  and multiple login servers . Thus, the invention is not limited to any particular arrangement of databases. Further, embodiments of the invention include the use of backup or failover discs, such as a RAID arrangement, to promote uninterrupted operability of the portal database  and login server .","The portal web server  is a software component for servicing requests for content on a portal web page via the HTTP protocol. The portal web server  is operatively connected to the portal database  and the login server . In servicing the portal web content request, the portal web server  may contact the login server  or the portal database  to obtain data needed to process the request, as explained in further detail below. In response to portal web content requests, the portal web server transmits portal web content information to the requesting user, which typically is received by a web browser  associated with that user. The portal web page is subsequently rendered by the requesting user's display device, such as a web browser .","A request for web content may be initiated by a user through a web browser  associated with the user. The request may be transmitted via the Internet  to the router . The router  routes data packets to the portal web server . If the user has not been authenticated yet, the portal database  may contact the login server  via HTTP requests, brokered by the portal web server , to authenticate the user making the request. The login server  may respond to the portal database  authentication query via HTTP, brokered by the web server . If the user is not authenticated, then the web browser  may communicate back to the user that the user is not authenticated by rendering an appropriate web page. These web pages may be generated by the portal database , and passed back to the user through the portal web server , and then on to the user's web browser  to be rendered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","200","140"]},"The composition of the seed data may change from embodiment to embodiment. In other words, the data required to identify an initial appearance and operation of a portal web site may change based upon a number of factors, including, e.g., the complexity of the portal web site, the level of specificity desired in designing the look and feel of the portal web site, and performance considerations. Accordingly, the invention is not limited by any particular composition of seed data.","An example of seed data residing within a portal schema table is illustrated in , which is an illustrative portal schema table showing a partial list of the seed data stored therein. As illustrated in , the seed data in table  includes a subscriber id , and information about the administrator of the portal web site, such as administrator first name , administrator last name , and administrator email address . The subscriber id  is a unique identifier associated with each portal web site. In other words, a portal web site may be uniquely identified using the subscriber id . The administrator first name , administrator last name , and administrator email address  each identifies a piece of information about the administrator of the portal web site, specifically, the administrator's first name, last name, and email address respectively.","In embodiments of the invention, the portal schema stores information about multiple portal web sites using the same portal schema. Access is restricted to the portal schema such that users may only access information pertinent to their associated portal web site. In some embodiments, this is performed using a Virtual Private Database (\u201cVPD\u201d), which is a feature of the Oracle 8i database available from Oracle Corporation, located in Redwood Shores, Calif. This feature is described in patent application Ser. No. 09\/167,092, filed on Oct. 5, 1998, and in patent application Ser. No. 09\/812,896, filed on May 31, 2001, each of which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and is hereby incorporated by reference. Other embodiments of the invention may perform the function of restricting access to rows in a database table by user by a variety of other methods, such as, e.g., using a database view or the use of a session table. In order to prevent unnecessarily obscuring the description of the present invention, embodiments of the invention shall store information about one or more portal web sites on the portal schema, but will restrict access such that a user may only access information stored on the portal schema pertinent to the user's portal web site. Embodiments of the invention may use any of the aforementioned mechanisms to restrict access on the portal schema using the subscriber id , which is a unique identifier for each portal web site.","In an embodiment, with reference to , the next step performed is to collect user preference data . In this step, a user of the portal web site development system  defines preferences about a portal web site that is desired to be generated. Preference data is a set of data identifying a set of user preferences about the appearance and operation of the portal web site. Preference data may be collected by a variety of means by the portal web site development system . For example, preference data may be received by the portal web server  via a variety of means, such as, e.g., a comma delimited file or preference data may be received through a graphical user interface. In embodiments of the invention, the person submitting the preference data may be assumed to be an administrator of the portal web site. In other embodiments of the invention, the administrator may be identified later, and the submitter of the preference data is not an administrator, but a user of the portal web site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4I","FIGS. 4A-4I","FIGS. 4A-4I"],"b":["150","103","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIGS. 4A-4I","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4D","FIG. 4D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4E","FIG. 4E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4F","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4G","FIG. 4G"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 4H","FIG. 4H","FIG. 4H"],"b":["440","441","442","443","444","445"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4I","FIG. 4I"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4I","FIGS. 4A-4I","FIGS. 4A-4I","FIGS. 4A-4I"]},"Once collected, the preference data may be stored in a variety of well understood means which enable subsequent retrieval of the preference data, such as, computer memory, a database , or a file. In embodiments of the invention, the collected preference data is stored in a portal database ; such embodiments may be advantageous if a portal web site is not generated contemporaneously with collecting preference data.","After the preference data is collected, the next step according to an embodiment is to generate a portal web site based upon the preference data . Note that the step of collecting preference data  and generating a portal web site  need not occur contemporaneously if the preference data is stored. Various embodiments of the invention advantageously store preference data to allow background checks, inter alia, to be performed on the user submitting the preference data in the interim before the portal web site is generated. This feature allows the portal web site development system  to filter out undesirable preference data from being generated into portal web sites. The portal web server  may be configured such that this filtration step is automatically performed based upon a rulebase. In embodiments of the invention, the portal web server  may be configured such that portal web sites are generated at preset time intervals as well as upon command. In step , the preference data collected in step  is processed such that a new portal web site is generated with the characteristics in the preference data. Step  will be discussed in further detail below.","The process of generating a portal web site in step  is performed within the portal database . The portal web site is generated by storing information in the portal schema residing with the portal database , which may be subsequently used to render the portal web site. In embodiments of the invention, information is stored in the portal schema by (a) making a copy of the set of seed data in the portal schema, (b) assigning and storing a subscriber id  with the copied seed data, and (c) modifying the copied seed data where it differs from the preference data. This process will be explained in further detail below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","305","310","305","301","3","305","302","303","304"]},"In , which illustrates the same portal schema table  as in , the seed data  has been copied in a new row  in the portal schema table with a new unique subscriber id  with a value of 2000. The value for the subscriber id  should be updated such that it is a unique value in the newly added row  because each set of data identifying the appearance and operation of a portal web site must be unique for all the data of the portal web site to be identified. In embodiments of the invention, this restraint is also used to restrict user access such that a user may only access data in the portal schema pertinent to the user's portal web site.","In , which illustrates the same portal schema table  as in , the seed data in row  has been modified where appropriate to store the preference data. Specifically, the seed data in columns , , and  were modified because the preference data differed from the corresponding seed data; however, the preference data in column  did not change because it did not differ from the corresponding seed data  because the first name of the administrator identified in the preference data is also \u201cJohn.\u201d This approach is advantageous because the seed data  already contains default information regarding the appearance and operation of a portal web site, which minimizes updating the data in the portal schema. In particular, the seed data may contain preexisting relationships in the portal schema, such as, e.g., foreign key relationships, which will be preserved in copying the seed data. Alternatively, the preference data may be stored in the portal schema without the aid of seed data using techniques well known to those in the art. The process illustrated in  may be applied to a number of database tables of greater complexity to accommodate any variety of preference data.","The functional steps of generating a portal web site  according to an embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to , which is a flowchart illustrating the same. The sequences of steps of  may be performed by executing any set of stored instructions accessible by the portal database . For example, an API or a stored procedure may be called to perform a particular step discussed in reference to FIG. .","In an embodiment, the first step in generating a portal web site is to store a subscriber name associated with the subscriber id  in the portal schema . The subscriber name is the name associated with the portal web site, such as, e.g., a company name.","In an embodiment, the next step is to generate the portal web pages for the portal web site  using data resident in the preference data. The step of generating the portal web pages comprising the portal web site  itself contains a plurality of steps, which will be explained with reference to , which is a flowchart illustrating the functional steps of generating the portal web pages comprising the portal web site  according to an embodiment of the invention. According to an embodiment, initially the theme to be applied to the portal web pages is determined and stored  in the portal schema. The theme to be applied may be found by referring to the preference data or by referring to a default theme. Next, a page layout is created and stored in the portal schema . A page layout refers to a particular arrangement of web content on a portal web page. The page layout to be applied may be found by referring to the preference data or by deferring to a default page layout. Subsequently, the home page for the portal web site is created and stored in the portal schema . A home page, as widely understood in the art, is the main page for a web site or portal web site. The home page is created by applying the theme and page layout information stored previously, as well as applying any additional rules defined in the portal database . The home page is subsequently stored in the portal schema.","In an embodiment, the next step is to create a set of tabbed portal web pages that appear on the home page and store them within the portal schema . A tabbed web page is any web page that may be accessed by selecting a tab on a web page. In other words, by selecting one of the tabs on the home page, a user may display a tabbed web page. An illustration of a tabbed web page is portrayed in  as a pictorial representation of a home page of a portal web site according to an embodiment of the invention. In , there are three tabbed web pages , , and . The set of tabbed portal web pages to be added may be identified by referring to the preference data or by referring to a default set of tabbed portal web pages. In an embodiment of the invention, the set of tabbed portal web pages added includes a \u201cMain\u201d portal web page , a \u201cMy Docs\u201d portal web page , and a \u201cGroup Docs\u201d portal web page . The tabbed portal web pages provide a way to logically present and arrange web content on separate pages. The web content appearing on a tabbed portal web page is arbitrary, although related web content generally appears on the same tabbed portal web page. Tabbed portal web pages may be shared between users. For example, according to an embodiment of the invention, the \u201cGroup Docs\u201d tabbed web page  may be shared between all the users of a portal web site such that each user will be presented the same web content under that tab. Such a tabbed portal web page would advantageously provide for sharing information between users. Other tabbed portal web pages may contain web content that is only visible to a particular user. For example, in an embodiment, the \u201cMy Docs\u201d tabbed portal web page  displays web content that is not shared among users. In an embodiment, by selecting the \u201cMain\u201d tab , the home page is displayed.","In an embodiment, after the tabbed portal web pages are created and stored within the portal schema, a set of portlets are added to the portal web site . The set of portlets to add to the portal web site may be obtained by referring to the preference data. Alternately, one or more default portlets may be added as well. Preferences may be encoded in the preference data regarding where each portlet should reside in the portal web page. Alternatively, a default layout of portlets may be used. For example, in an embodiment of the invention, portlets categorized as productivity tools reside on the left of the home page, whereas portlets categorized as web content portlets reside on the left of the home page. Portlets may appear on any portal web page in the portal web site. For example,  depicts portlets , , , , and  on a home page according to an embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment depicted in , productivity tool portlets , , and  are displayed on the left, and web content portlets  and  are displayed on the right.","Data identifying the members of the set of portlets to add, as well as their location and other specific characteristics, is stored within the portal schema. Examples of other specific characteristics which may be stored include configuration details about specific portlets, such as particular stocks to track for a stock market portlet and a particular city to monitor for a weather portlet.","After the portal web site is generated in step , a set of users which may access the portal web site are created . The set of users which may access the portal web site may be identified by information in the preference data. Each user may be assigned a default username and password with which to access the portal web site. Alternatively, the username or password of the user may be specified in the preference data. The username and password is stored in the database of the login server . The login server  will access the stored username and password of each user when authenticating the user.","In an embodiment, once a set of authorized users are added to the portal web site in step , a set of groups may be added to the portal web site . The set of groups to be added may be determined by referencing the preference data. In addition, zero or more default groups may be added as well.","According to an embodiment, after the set of groups are added to the portal web site, the set of users which may access the portal web site may be assigned to one or more groups . Users may be added to groups identified in the preference data. Alternately, users may also be added to one or more default groups. After each authorized user is associated with one or more groups, folders are created and added to the portal web site . Folders for each user may be added to the home page or particular tabbed portal web pages. For example, folders for each user may be added to the \u201cMy Docs\u201d tabbed portal page. Additionally, folders for each group may be added to the home page or particular tabbed portal web pages. For example, folders for each group may be added to the \u201cGroup Docs\u201d tabbed portal page.","When a folder is added, the folder is associated with a user or a group. Permissions are set on the folder such that only the user or group associated with the folder may view the folder. For example, if a folder is associated with a group \u201cdevelopment,\u201d then only users who belong to the \u201cdevelopment\u201d group may view the folder. In another example, if a folder is associated with a particular user, then only that user may view the folder. Permissions may be set on web content other than folders in the portal web site in this manner. In other words, the viewing privileges on web content, e.g., a file, may be limited to an associated user or a group.","The sequence of steps discussed above with reference to FIG.  and  may be performed in different orders. For example, step  may be performed before or contemporaneously with step . In various embodiments, it may be desirable to perform the steps depicted in  or in  in a different order, or in parallel, for performance reasons. As such, the invention is not limited by any particular sequence of steps in generating the portal web site.","Subsequent to the portal web site creation in step , notification is transmitted to the administrator of the portal web site that the portal web site has been generated . The notification may be sent by means identified in the preference data, including, e.g., a pager message, a facsimile, or an email. The notification contains directions on how to access the portal web site. For example, the notification may contain information about how to log in to the portal web site, what users are registered to access the portal web site, and what groups exist on the portal web site.","Deployment Considerations","The execution of the sequences of instructions required to practice the invention may be performed in embodiments of the invention by a computer system . In an embodiment of the invention, execution of the sequences of instructions required to practice the invention is performed by a single computer system . According to other embodiments of the invention, two or more computer systems  coupled by a communication link  may perform the sequence of instructions required to practice the invention in coordination with one another. In order to avoid needlessly obscuring the invention, a description of only one computer system  will be presented below; however, it should be understood that any number of computer systems  may be employed to practice the invention.","A computer system  according to an embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to , which is a block diagram of the functional components of a computer system  according to an embodiment of the invention. As used herein, the term computer system  is broadly used to describe any computing device that can store and independently run one or more programs.","Each computer system  may include a communication interface  coupled to the bus .
