The multiple investment styles are implemented for the investor through the opening of multiple separately managed trading accounts. Due to the limitations of the architecture of , distinct accounts must be opened by the by broker, and the investor is typically not shielded from this fact (the BA primarily reflects the relationship between broker and investor).","Let us say, for example, that the account is initially opened in the amount of $500,000. The brokerage firm  will commonly split the $500,000 amount within the BA amongst multiple trading accounts. For this example, we will assume that the $500,000 amount is split between four (4) separate trading accounts at the brokerage firm. The trading accounts are represented in  as TA, TA, TA and TA. The trading accounts are associated with the single brokerage firm . The trading account data for TA, TA, TA and TA is entered into a database A of the automated brokerage firm portfolio management system (BFPMS)  utilized by the brokerage firm .","After the trading accounts TA, TA, TA and TA have been opened by the brokerage firm , the brokerage firm must also open four (4) separate custodial trading accounts, represented in  as CTA, CTA, CTA and CTA, at the custodian firm . The four (4) custodian trading accounts are entered into a database A of the custodian account management system (CAMS)  conventionally utilized by the custodian firm , and typically associated with the tax identifier, i.e. tax ID, of the investor . The official and formal records for the trading accounts TA, TA, TA and TA, and hence the single BA, will be the records for the custodial trading accounts CTA, CTA, CTA and CTA, as maintained by the custodian firm .","The advisor , will most typically recommend to the investor  that each of the individual trading accounts be assigned to a different money manager to increase diversity and reduce risk for investor . In this example, we will assume that the trading accounts TA, TA, TA and TA, will be respectively assigned to money manager A , money manager B , money manager C  and money manager D . Each of these money managers will preferably have a different investment style, which typically reflects a particular investment philosophy. For example, in this case, the respective money manager styles might be large cap growth, large cap value, small cap and fixed income. Thus, each of the four (4) trading accounts TA, TA, TA and TA, will be assigned to a different one of the four money managers -.","Each money manager will open a separately managed trading account, which will sometimes be referred to as an MTA. The managed trading accounts are represented in  as MTA, MTA, MTA and MTA. The trading account records for each of MTA, MTA, MTA and MTA are entered into a database A of an automated money manager portfolio management system (MMPMS)  conventionally utilized by each of the money managers -.","It should be understood that, although the MMPMS shown for each of the money manager's - is referred to using the same reference numeral, each MMPMS could be different from the other MMPMSs. Because each of the money managers - manages a separately managed trading account, i.e. manages a different one of MTA, MTA, MTA and MTA, each of the managed trading accounts are managed separately according to the applicable money manager's individual investment style. Thus, in actuality, although it appears to the investor  that he or she has only a single managed BA with the brokerage firm , in reality he or she has had multiple separate trading accounts combined for reporting. In this case the four (4) trading accounts TA, TA, TA and TA, amongst which the invested amount, i.e. in this example $500,000, is divided and separately invested and managed using different investment styles. Since the managed trading accounts are separate accounts, each of the money managers - could independently perform certain functions on its MTA.","For example, each of the money managers - could independently rebalance its MTA for investor  to its style model, and perform different \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios on its MTA for investor  to determine how that account will be affected by a purchase or sale of a certain security, e.g. publicly traded shares of a particular company. Each of the money managers - could also independently place individual restrictions on its MTA for the investor . In this regard, if the investor  is employed by a certain company and purchases that company's shares through an employee stock purchase program, the investor  may not want the money manager to buy any more securities in that company. In such a case, the applicable money manager can restrict the purchase of the company's shares for the MTA of the investor  which it manages. To avoid such purchases, the money manager will typically enter the restriction in the applicable MMPMS for the investor's MTA. The MMPMS will then automatically prevent or issue a warning, if there is an attempt to purchase the company's stock with funds from the investor's MTA being managed by that money manager.","As the money managers - makes decisions on the managed trading accounts MTA, MTA, MTA or MTA, the associated trade orders, e.g. orders to buy securities or sell securities in a particular company, are initiated by the money managers - and forwarded to the brokerage firm . Based on the issued orders, the brokerage firm  executes the trades in fulfillment of the orders. In this regard, the brokerage firm  will, through its trading desk, execute the buys and the sells to actually perform the ordered trades.","After fulfillment of one or more orders, the brokerage firm  forwards a file representing the executed buys and sells to the custodian . Based on the information represented in the forwarded file, the custodian  records the trades in the books and records for the applicable custodial trading account, i.e. CTA, CTA, CTA or CTA. The brokerage firm  will also forward the prices of the executed buys and sells associated with an order(s) of a particular one of the money managers - to that money manager. For example, if the brokerage firm  purchased 100 shares of IBM at an $80\/share price, the $80 purchase price is forwarded to the custodian  and the applicable money manager - for recording in the applicable CTA maintained by the CPMS and the applicable MTA maintained by the applicable MMPMS, respectively. Once the books and records for the custodial trading accounts CTA-CTA have been modified by the custodian  to reflect the actually executed orders, in accordance with the files forwarded from the brokerage firm , the brokerage firm  and the money managers - will reconcile TA-TA and MTA-MTA, with the modified books and records of the custodian  for CTA-CTA. Thus, information, in the form of a file representing the information associated with the CTAs, flows back from the custodian  to the brokerage firm  and from the brokerage firm  to the money managers -. Accordingly, both the TAs maintained by the brokerage firm  and the MTAs maintained by the money managers - on their respective portfolio management systems, shadow the CTAs maintained by the custodian  on the CPMS. It will be understood that the prices are returned almost immediately, and almost always within the same trading day, while the custodian information is not returned until the next business day.","As described above, each of the money managers - will have a single MTA for the investor , while the brokerage firm  will have multiple separate TAs for investor . The brokerage firm  may report on the TAs to the investor  by presenting four (4) separate trading account statements, i.e. one for each of TA-TA. The brokerage firm  may also, or alternatively, manually roll the separate statements into one single brokerage account statement that is reported to the investor . Each of the money managers - may also independently present a managed trading account statement for the MTA which it manages, to the investor .","Current Portfolio Management System Architecture with Single Managed Client Account and Overlay Manager","As described above with reference to , using the historical brokerage firm portfolio management system architecture, brokerage firms had to open multiple trading and custodial trading accounts. Typically, a different trading account was opened for each investment style or assigned money manager. Since, using this architecture, statements could only be generated by the MMPMS for each individual managed trading account, the brokerage firm was required to either report on each of the trading accounts separately or manually combine the multiple different statements associated with the managed trading accounts to present a single brokerage account statement to the investor. The need to generate multiple trading account statements, i.e. one for each managed trading account, and manually combine these statements into a single brokerage account statement, made reporting to the investor difficult and more expensive for the brokerage firm. For the investor, the need to review multiple trading account statements for a single brokerage account made the review complex, and the statements difficult to understand and use.","More recently, system architectures have been introduced to simplify the reporting and provide greater automation. One such recently introduced architecture is shown in . In the  architecture, an overlay manager, represented by a master overlay manager (MOM) , allows the brokerage firm  to maintain a single client account (CA) in the database A of the brokerage firm portfolio management system (BFPMS) . It should be understood, that the MOM  could be a separate system, which might be operated by a global money manager, or could be functionally included as part of one of the money manager portfolio management systems (MMPMS) , e.g. part of the MMPMS  for money manager  as indicated by one set of dotted lines, or could be functionally included as part of the BFPMS  as indicated by the other set of dotted lines.","Notwithstanding where the master overlay manager functionality resides, because only a single CA need be maintained, the brokerage firm  also need only open, and the custodian  need only maintain, a single custodial client account (CCA) in the database A in the custodian portfolio management (CPMS) , to record transactions associated with the CA performed in accordance with multiple different investment styles. The different investment styles are reflected in the style models, i.e. SM-SM, of the money managers - which are stored in memory C of the MMPMSs , which are incorporated in a single overlay model (OM). Now, rather than generating multiple trading account statements, i.e. one for each style, the MOM  or the brokerage firm  are capable of automatically generating a single managed client account (MCA) statement for reporting to the investor . Thus, using MOM  of , reporting has been simplified for the brokerage firm . For the investor , the single MCA statement is easier to understand and use. Additionally, the investor  need no longer be burdened with multiple different managed trading account (MTA) statements for the same account.","Alternative Current Portfolio Management System Architecture with Single Managed Client Account, Multiple Trading Accounts and Overlay Manager",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["50","50","36","36","20","36"]},"As will be discussed further below, the individual money managers - initiate trade orders for and otherwise manage the MTAs. These transactions are compiled by the AMOM \u2032 into a single alternative managed client account (MCA\u2032). Although multiple trading account statements, i.e. one for each style, are generated by each of the AMMPMSs \u2032, the AMOM \u2032 in the  architecture, is capable of automatically generating a single MCA\u2032 statement for reporting to the investor  on the BA basis, by compiling the multiple the MTA statements generated by the AMMPMSs \u2032. Thus, using AMOM \u2032 of , reporting has been simplified for the brokerage firm . For the investor , the single MCA\u2032 statement is easier to understand and use. Additionally, the investor  need no longer be burdened with multiple different statements for what he or she considers the same account. Unlike the  architecture, the portfolio management system architecture of , like the more historic architecture of , beneficially also allows the money managers - to manage each style in a separate managed trading account.","To summarize, currently available portfolio management system architectures, such as those depicted in , provide the brokerage firm with the ability to establish and maintain only one client account in the case of the  architecture, and to generate and forward one consolidated account statement to the investor in the  architectures, notwithstanding the number of trading styles used for the account. This has simplified the entire investment portfolio management process for both the brokerage firm and the investor.","Brokerage Firm Portfolio Management System (BFPMS)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["32","32","26","26","50","32","32","10","32","32","1","10","32","2","28","10","32","3","18","20"]},"Money Manager Portfolio Management System (MMPMS or AMMPMS)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1A and 1B"],"b":["36","36"]},"As shown, the MMPMS  of  and the AMMPMS \u2032 of  include the database A having data representing a managed trading account (MTA) for the investor . As discussed above, because all trade ordering and account management functions are performed by the MOM  at the MCA level in the  architecture, there are no MTAs to be managed by the individual money managers - using the  architecture and hence the MMPMS  of  has no need for a database A to maintain an MTA.","The MMPMS  of  and the AMMPMS \u2032 of  also include a processor B which includes the logic, e.g. programmed instructions, necessary to perform various functions. As shown, these functions include, but are not limited to, a rebalancing accounts function B, a tax efficient trading function B, a wash sales function B, a drift function B, a generate trade orders function B and a generate MTA function B which performs the necessary operations to generate a statement for its associate MTA. Here again, and as discussed above, because all trade ordering and account management functions are performed by the MOM  at the MCA level in the  architecture, there are no MTAs to be managed by the individual money managers - and hence no need for the AMMPMS \u2032 of  to perform the functions B-B or to include the processor B to perform such functions.","Both the MMPMS  and AMMPMS \u2032 include a memory C that stores a style model (SM) for the investment style utilized by the applicable money manager. As discussed above, in the case of the MMPMS  the stored SM is incorporated in the overlay model (OM) utilized by the MOM  to generate trade orders and manage activity on the single managed client account (MCA). Hence, in the  architecture, the applicable SM is stored on the MMPMS  only for the purpose of recording modifications made to the stored SM made by the applicable money manager. These modifications are then forwarded to the MOM  for incorporation in the overlay model (OM) for the investor . On the other hand, in the case of the AMMPMS \u2032, the processor B will utilize the stored SM in performing functions B-B and B, as applicable, for the applicable MTA of the investor  stored in the database A.","With regard to the rebalancing accounts function B, money managers - have historically rebalanced one managed trading account or style at a time. That is each managed trading account, i.e. each of MTA-MTA, is separately rebalanced to bring that account back in line with the particular model for that style. As described above, each money manager has a particular SM stored in the memory C of the AMMPMS \u2032 associated with that money manager. For instance, a large cap growth style would have a static model requiring certain number of securities and cash to make-up 100% of the MTA. Each MTA must be rebalanced by the applicable AMMPMS \u2032 to the individual style, i.e. the individual SM, of the applicable money manager. To do this, the AMMPMS processor B, executes the rebalance account function B to determine the deviation of the MTA in the database A from the SM stored in the memory C. It then generates trade orders by executing the generate trade order function B, to reduce or eliminate the determined deviation and thereby place the MTA in line with the SM.","With regard to the tax efficient trading function B, the investor  may require that certain lots of or positions in securities held in the MCA be sold at a loss to off-set gains made earlier in a tax year, and thereby reduce the tax burden on the investor . This is commonly referred to as tax harvesting. To do this, the applicable AMMPMS processor B, executes the tax efficient trading function B to identify the lots of or positions in securities that should preferably be sold from the applicable MTA to offset the gains due to prior sales of securities in that MTA. It then generates trade orders, by again executing the B function, to sell the identified securities, and thereby reduce or eliminate the prior gain for the tax year and the associated investor tax burden. With regard to the wash sale function B, a wash sale violation arises when a security in one MTA was previously sold at a loss for the investor  and the same security is repurchased for any of MTA-MTA for investor  within thirty-one days, or some other predetermined period, of the sale. In order to tract potential wash sales, the money managers - must ensure that a security on which the money manager is issuing a purchase order was not sold at a loss for the investor  by it or any other money manager during the relevant period, e.g. during the prior thirty days.","However, the applicable AMMPMS processor B, executes the wash sales function B to identify only whether a security that the applicable money manager intends to purchase for the applicable MTA was previously sold from that MTA at a loss during the relevant period. After determining that no such sale previously occurred, the AMMPMS processor B executes the generate trade order function B to generate a trade order to purchase the security, thus avoiding a wash sale violation with respect to trading activity relating to the applicable MTA, but not with respect to other MTAs of the investor .","There are other conditions that money managers - have to deal with in the  architecture. One is, monitoring and managing drift within a single MTA, which is performed by the drift function B. Each of the money managers -, are concerned with the drift of an individual security or other holding in the MTA which it manages for the investor , away from the conditions for that security or other holding set forth in the SM stored in the memory C for that MTA. Historically, the money managers - tracked such drift manually. To do this, each money manager would need to go through its MTA for the investor  looking for securities or holdings that have become over or under rated, and then adjust the securities or holdings accordingly.","In the architecture of , the AMMPMS processor B performs the drift function B by monitoring and managing drift at the security level within the applicable MTA in an automated manner. To do this, the applicable AMMPMS processor B, executes the drift function B to identify whether a security or other holding in the applicable one of MTA-MTA in the database A has drifted outside of a range, which may be established by the processor B or stored in the memory C, from a position for that security or holding established in the SM stored in the memory C. The processor B then executes the generate trade order function B to initiate trade orders to reduce or eliminate the drift and thereby place the applicable MTA in line with the applicable SM. Since drift is reduced or eliminated one style, i.e. one MTA, at a time and the drift reduction or elimination in each style is typically performed by a different AMMPMS \u2032, the drift in a single client account with funds invested across multiple MTAs is reduced by the MMPMS \u2032 only on a style-by-style basis. Style-by-style drift monitoring may result in an inefficient number of corrective trades for multiple MTAs.","Master Overlay Manager (MOM or AMOM)","As discussed above and shown in , current portfolio management system architectures include one of two types of master overlay managers, i.e. the MOM  of the  architecture or the AMOM \u2032 of the  architecture. The MOM  or AMOM \u2032 may be in the form of a separate system, or be incorporated as part of the BFPMS , or MMPMS  or AMMPMS \u2032.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["50","50","50","50"]},"As shown, the MOM  and AMOM \u2032 include a processor A that includes the logic, e.g. programmed instructions, necessary to perform one or more functions. These functions differ depending on whether the processor A is included in the MOM  or the AMOM \u2032.","In the case of the MOM  of the  architecture, these functions include a rebalancing managed client accounts function A, a managed client account tax efficient trading function A, a managed client account wash sales function A, a managed client account cross style drift function A, a generate trade order function A and a generate MCA statement function A. Because trade ordering and account management functions are performed by the AMMPMSs \u2032 at the MTA level in the  architecture, there is no truly managed client account (MCA) to be managed by the AMOM \u2032 and hence no need for AMOM \u2032 to perform the functions A-A.","However, in order for the AMOM \u2032 to compile the MTA's maintained by the AMMPMS \u2032 into what can be viewed by the investor as a single managed client account (MCA\u2032), the AMOM \u2032 includes a generate MCA\u2032 function which is executed by processor A to combine the records for MTA-MTA, into a single MCA\u2032 record and to modify the MCA based on transaction information received for each of MTA-MTA. In the case of the AMOM \u2032 of the  architecture, the functions performed by the processor A also include a generate MCA\u2032 statement function A, which either combines the individual MTA statements generated by the AMMPMSs into a single corresponding MCA\u2032 statement or generates an MCA\u2032 statement from the MCA\u2032 record. Alternatively, the generate MCA\u2032 statement function A could generate the consolidated MCA\u2032 statement dynamically from individual MTA information, and not require the creation and maintenance of the MCA\u2032 at all. In this discussion, the existence of the MCA\u2032 is assumed.","The MOM  also includes a memory B which stores an overlay model (OM) for the MCA. The OM combines the style models, e.g. SM-SM, for each of the investment styles, e.g. style-style, into the OM for the MCA being utilized for the investor , reflecting a desired allocation distribution across the styles as well as potentially other overlay parameters. As discussed above, because, in the  architecture, all trade ordering and account management functions are performed by the AMMPMS \u2032 at the MTA level and the results are simply compiled by the AMOM \u2032 at the MCA\u2032 level in the  architecture, there is no OM required in the  architecture, and hence AMOM \u2032 has no need for a memory B for storing an OM. Both the MOM  and AMOM \u2032 include a database C which stores a master client account (MCA) in the case of MOM  and an alternate master client account (MCA\u2032) in the case of AMOM \u2032. In the case of the  architecture, the MCA is shadowed, as will be further discussed below, by the BFPMS  of  as the CA stored in the BFPMS database A. If the MOM  is incorporated within the BFPMS , the CA stored in the BFPMS database A will be utilized in lieu of the MCA, eliminating the need for the database C.","In the case of the  architecture, all trade orders are initialed and all account management functions are performed by the MOM  at the MCA level. Accordingly, the MCA stored in database C of MOM  is independently generated and maintained by the MOM . The MOM  has no need to coordinate with or receive information, other than the SMS and modifications thereto, from the individual money managers - to transact and manage the MCA.","In the case of the  architecture, the MCA\u2032 is a compilation of the individual MTAs stored in the AMMPMSs \u2032. Since all trade orders initiated and most account management functions are performed by the individual AMMPMSs \u2032 at the MTA level, the MCA\u2032 stored in database C of AMOM \u2032 merely shadows to the MTAs independently generated and maintained by the respective AMMPMSs \u2032.","With regard to the rebalancing client account function A, the brokerage firm  has historically, at best, performed a manual rebalancing of individual securities across all for the MTAs, i.e. MTA-MTA. That is, all the securities in the managed trading accounts MTA-MTA for the investor  were at best manually rebalanced to bring the securities back in line with the desired security allocation for that investor.","The MOM  can perform an automated rebalancing of the single MCA maintained in the database C, based on the multi-style OM for the MCA of the investor  stored in the memory B of the MOM. For example, the multi-style OM for a particular MCA might require certain number of securities, within the MCA, to make-up 100% of the capital. The MCA must be rebalanced by the MOM  to the OM. To do this, the processor A, executes the rebalance account function A to determine the deviation of the MCA securities in the database C from the security allocation of OM stored in the memory B. It then generates trade orders by executing the generate trade order function A, to reduce or eliminate the determined deviation and thereby place the MCA, and hence the CA stored at the brokerage firm , in line with the OM for the investor .","With regard to the MCA tax efficient trading function A, as discussed above, the investor  may require that certain lots of or positions in securities held in the MCA be sold at a loss, i.e. the loss harvested, to off-set gains made earlier in a tax year, and thereby reduce the tax burden on the investor . To do this, the processor A of the MOM , executes the MCA tax efficient trading function A to identify the lots of or positions in securities that should preferably be sold from the MCA of the investor  to offset the gains due to prior sales of securities in the MCA of investor . It then executes the generate trade order function A to initiate trade orders to sell the identified securities, and thereby reduce or eliminate the prior gain for the tax year and the associated investor tax burden.","With regard to the MCA wash sale function A, as discussed above, a wash sale violation arises when a security in the MCA of investor  was previously sold at a loss for an investor and the same security is repurchased for the MCA within thirty-one days, or some other predetermined period, of the earlier sale. In order to tract potential wash sales, the MOM  insures that a security for which a purchase order is issued was not sold at a loss for the investor  during the relevant period, e.g. the prior thirty-one days. To do this, the processor A of the MOM , executes the CA wash sales function A to identify whether a security proposed to be purchased for the MCA of the investor  was previously sold from that MCA at a loss during the relevant period. Only after determining that no such sale previously occurred, will the processor A of the MOM  execute function A to generate a trade order to purchase the security, thus avoiding a wash sale violation with respect to trading activity relating to the MCA. The MOM  will also monitor and manage drift between the multiple styles associated with the MCA of the investor , using the MCA cross style drift function A. In this regard, the MOM  is concerned with the drift between different styles used to invest the capital in that MCA in database C of MOM , away from the allocation across the multiple styles set forth in the OM stored in the memory B of the MOM . Historically, the brokerage firm , at best, tracked such across style drift manually. To do this, the brokerage firm would need to go through the performance and market value of the individual MTAs, looking for accounts that have become over- or under-weighted, and then adjust the MTAs accordingly. A drift between the individual styles at the MCA level could, for example, occur because some of the multiple styles have performed better than others, resulting in an increase in the individual market value of the securities invested in some of the styles and a decrease in the value of the securities invested in other styles for MCA of the investor . Based on this manual monitoring, the brokerage firm would manually direct a redistribution of the cash among the multiple MTAs for the investor  to counter any determined drift between the various styles, i.e. between the multiple MTAs, and thereby realign the MTAs, which had become overrated or underrated, with a desired style allocation. Thus, historically the money managers - and brokerage firm  were not proactively alerted when a MTA violated certain style drift tolerances based on a desired style distribution.","The processor A of the MOM  performs the MCA across style drift function A and proactively monitors and manages across style drift within the MCA for the investor  in an automated manner. To do this, the processor A of MOM  executes the across style drift function A to identify whether a style of securities in the MCA of investor , has drifted outside of a range, which may be computed by the processor A or stored in the memory C, from the style allocation established in the OM stored in the memory B. The processor A then generates trade orders, by executing the generate trade order function A, to reduce or eliminate the drift and thereby place the MCA for the investor , and hence the CA maintained by the brokerage firm , in line with the OM. Since drift is reduced or eliminated for the entire MCA, not just one style, the drift in a single MCA with funds invested among multiple styles is reduced by the MOM  on an entire account, not a style-by-style, basis.","The processor A of the MOM  also executes the generate MCA statement function A to create statements for reporting on the MCA of investor . By executing function A, the processor A of MOM  is capable of generating statements on both an individual style basis and an entire MCA basis. As will be described further below, these statements may include performance information for the MCA on a style-by-style or entire account basis.","Referring now to the functions performed by the AMOM \u2032 in the  architecture, the combine MTAs function A is executed by the processor A of the AMOM \u2032 to combine and organize the records stored for each of the individual MTAs, i.e. MTA-MTA at the respective AMMPMSs \u2032 into the MCA\u2032 stored in the database A of the AMOM \u2032. The processor A of the AMOM \u2032 will also modify the MCA\u2032 in correspondence with modifications to the MTAs over time based on information received from the AMMPMSs \u2032.","The processor A of the AMOM \u2032 also executes the generate MCA\u2032 statement function A to create statements reporting on the MCA\u2032 of investor . By executing function A, the processor A is capable of generating statements on an entire MCA\u2032 basis only. These statements may include performance information for the MCA\u2032 on an entire account basis only. Statements reporting on the individual MTAs, as discussed above, are created by the respective AMMPMS \u2032 in the architecture of .","In summary, the MOM  can rebalance many styles at the same time, by rebalancing a single MCA, and hence rebalance the shadow CA at the brokerage firm . The MOM  can also transact in many styles in one MCA, making it much more efficient to harvest tax loses in an automated manner, by considering all of the lots of or positions in securities in the MCA to obtain the most efficient tax loss, and thereby harvesting across multiple different styles. Additionally, the MOM  is able to avoid wash sale violations which could occur across styles in an automated manner by tracking potential wash sales within the single MCA so as to insure that a security in any style which the overlay manager intends to purchase for the MCA of the investor  was not sold at a loss for the investor  during the relevant period from the MCA. Furthermore, the MOM  will proactively issue an alert when the MCA has violated certain style drift tolerances based on a desired style allocation set forth in the OM. Both the MOM , and AMOM \u2032 are capable of maintaining and reporting on a single master client account, i.e. MCA or MCA\u2032 for the investor , notwithstanding the use of multiple investment styles.","While the MOM  and AMOM \u2032 have significantly enhanced management capabilities for multiple style portfolios by implementing the above described functionality, the MOM  restricts each of money managers - from managing trading within its particular style. The AMOM \u2032, while allowing each of the money managers - to manage trading within its MTA, does not allow the overlay manager to manage a single multistyle account. Hence, a new architecture is required which will allow each of the money managers - greater flexibility then the current portfolio management system architecture of  to trade and work within their portion of the single client account, while providing the overlay manager with greater flexibility than the architecture of  to manage an investment portfolio across styles.","For example, with regard to the cash management, cash or credit deposits of the investor  must be split up amongst the multiple styles to be utilized. Historically, the distribution of these deposits has been performed manually by the brokerage firm . That is, with reference to , as cash or credit deposits were made by the investor , the brokerage firm  would split the deposit up among the different styles, i.e. the different MTAs, and hence, the different money managers -.","The  architectures do not provide any automation when it comes to the allocation of assets. The process is still manually performed by the brokerage firm .","For instance, if an initial $1,000,000 account were allocated 40% or $400,000 to growth, and it was subsequently desired to redistribute a greater share of the account to growth, historically, the brokerage firm would manually initiate a draw from other style money managers and deposit the drawn amount to the growth money manager. This, for example, might increase the allocation to the growth money manager from 40% of the market value for the entire account of the investor , to the desired 50% or 60%. Neither the MOM  or AMOM \u2032 has provided any automation to this process.","Hence, in the current portfolio management system architectures shown in  the investor  will still open a single brokerage account with the brokerage firm , via his\/her financial adviser , by making a deposit, e.g. $500,000, with the brokerage firm . However, the brokerage firm , rather than opening and maintaining multiple trading accounts for the investor , i.e. one trading account per style, as shown in , now opens and maintains a single client account for the investor at the brokerage firm  as shown in . Additionally, rather than opening multiple custodial trading accounts for the investor  at the custodian , i.e. one custodian trading account per style, as shown in , the brokerage firm  now opens a single custodial client account for the investor  at the custodian , as shown in .","In the  architecture, use of the overlay model (OM) allows multiple styles to be applied within the single managed client account. The master overlay manager  controls the functioning of the single managed client account, including the trading, the reporting, and all other functioning required to manage the account. On the other hand, in the  architecture, there is no overlay model. Rather, separate managed trading accounts managed by different money managers continue to be utilized. This allows multiple styles to be applied to different portions of the single managed client account. The individual managers retain control over the management of respective portions of the single managed client account, including the trading, some of the reporting, and other functioning required to manage the account. The overlay manager compiles information from the separate money managers to provide overall account reporting.","The MOM  or AMOM \u2032 might reside within a special overlay management department of the brokerage firm . This department might have the responsibility to control the client account activity utilizing the functionality available in the MOM , or the reporting to the investor utilizing the functionality available in the AMOM \u2032. The department could, if desired, retain the multiple money managers -, from within or from outside the brokerage firm . In the case of the MOM , the money managers - only provide individual style models for incorporation into the master overlay model (OM). In the case of AMOM \u2032 the money managers are retained to trade and work within their respective portions of the single client account.","On the other hand, the MOM  or AMOM \u2032 could reside with a global money manager, which could be an entirely separate entity from the brokerage firm  and money managers -, or could reside with one of the individual style money managers, such as money manager  in . In either case, the single managed client account is managed utilizing the MOM  or AMOM \u2032 in much the same way as a special department within the brokerage firm .","The global money manager could also retain other money managers, either from within or outside the firm, to either provide style models or to trade and work within a portion of the single managed client account. However, unlike in the case of the MOM  or AMOM \u2032 residing at the brokerage firm , the money manager must forward trade orders to the brokerage firm . The executed trades would then flow back and forth between the money manager and the brokerage firm.","It should be understood that, if the MOM  resides outside the brokerage firm , the BFPMS  and MOM  would both maintain separate identical client accounts, i.e. the CA and MCA. The BFPMS will often be utilized to monitor the single client account.","Risk Category Determination","In all the architectures of , as shown in , the advisor , working with the investor , performs a risk assessment in step  to determine the appropriate risk category for the investor. The advisor  performs the risk assessment on the investor  based on the investor's profile, age, demographics, income, retirement age and other factors well understood by those skilled in the art. Based on the results of the risk assessment, the advisor , in step , selects the proper risk category. In the exemplary flow depicted in , the advisor selects between risk categories - that are identified with the reference numerals A-D. There could of course be more or less risk categories considered. For this example, it is assumed that the advisor  selects category .","In the system architecture of , the MOM  associates each risk category with specific investment products offered by the brokerage firm . As shown, category  has products  and , identified with reference numerals A and B. The other risk categories have associated products -, identified by reference numerals C-H. Here again, is will be recognized that there could be more or less products associated with each category. In step , the advisor  selects the product from those offered for the selected risk category. In this example, the advisor  selects product .","Each of the offered products A-H has a predetermined asset allocation. For instance, if the selected risk category is a low risk category, i.e. a category appropriate for an investor with a low risk tolerance, the category might have an asset allocation of 50% for fixed income investment and 50% value investment. On the other hand if a risk category is a higher risk category, i.e. a category appropriate for an investor with a higher risk tolerance, the category might have an asset allocation of 70% or 80% growth investment and 20% or 30% fixed income investment. These asset allocations are predetermined based on the risk for the risk category.","Also each of the products A-H has a group of predefined styles, and money managers for managing the respective individual styles. Accordingly, in the example presented in , the selected product A has predefined styles - and money managers A-D, identified with reference numerals A-D. These same money managers are identified as money managers - in . Similarly, the styles - are the same styles reflected in the style models, i.e. SM-SM, which are combined in the overlay model (OM) applied to the managed client account (MCA) shown in .","In summary, using the  architecture, the selected risk category determines the asset allocation breakdown, and the available products. Selection of the product determines the styles and money managers for these styles. That is, the styles and money managers for the styles are predetermined for each product, and the allocations and offered products are predetermined for each risk category.","It will be recognized that the required use of predetermined allocations, products, styles and money managers in connection with a selected risk category limits the investor\/advisor flexibility. Thus, using the architecture of , the investor  cannot choose desired allocations, or styles, or money managers, but is limited to the predefined allocations, styles and money managers. Accordingly, the most suitable allocations, styles and money managers may not be used to meet the personal needs of the investor  using the  architecture.","Client Account Establishment, Security Identifier Tagging, and Tracking","As shown in , using the system architecture of  the brokerage firm , in step , opens the managed client account MCA for the investor , with the overlay manager, represented by the master overlay manager (MOM) , and makes a deposit of cash, credit and\/or securities into the account in step . These deposits could be new assets or assets from a previously opened account of the investor  with the brokerage firm .","The money managers - and overlay manager coordinate the combination and incorporation of the style models, i.e. SM-SM, shown in , for the individual styles, i.e. style-style, shown in , into the overlay model (OM), shown in . In other words, each individual security is tied to one specific style. Accordingly, the OM can be used to trade securities in all of the individual styles and otherwise manage the MCA.","The MOM , in step , tags each individual security identifier in the OM with its appropriate style. Preferably, the tagged identifier is the ticker symbol for the security, e.g. IBM, CKFR, KO etc. As shown, security identifier A is tagged with a  for style  and is represented as SECAID, security identifier B is tagged with a  for style  and is represented as SECBID, security identifier C is tagged with a  for style  and is represented as SECCID, and security identifier D is tagged with a  for style  and is represented as SECDID. No security identifier may be tagged with two styles. For example, if security identifier A was included in the OM for both style  and style , security identifier A could not be properly tagged. That is, security identifier A can only be tagged with a single style. Accordingly, security identifier A can only be included in the OM for one style, e.g. either style  or style , but not both. Since in this example, security identifier A is included in style , a different security identifier must be substituted for security identifier A in style . Therefore, in creating the OM in step , any duplicate securities within different styles must to be eliminated in step . As will be discussed further below, in step , the MOM  prohibits trading in the same security in different styles. Practically, this also means that each model, i.e. SM for style , SM for style , SM for style , and SM for style , must include only security identifiers unique to that overlay model and which are not duplicated in any other of the models that may be combined with that model.","The MOM  initiates trade orders and otherwise transacts the MCA for the investor , in step . The BFPMS  executes these orders, resulting in the purchase and sale of individual securities  and a remaining cash balance  in the MCA.","The MOM  also tracks the performance of the MCA. The MOM  tracks the total cash performance for the MCA in step . Such tracking may be during its lifetime of the MCA or during a more limited performance period window. The MOM  additionally tracks the performance of the securities within the MCA, excluding any cash transactions affecting the performance of that security, in step . The MOM  combines the cash and security performance numbers in order to compute, and thereby track, the total performance for the MCA, in step .","It should be understood that, cash transactions are not tracked on a style-by-style basis, i.e. the cash transactions are only tracked on an entire MCA basis. Thus, the effect of these cash transactions is not reflected in the performance computation for each style. Accordingly, the tracked and reported individual style performance on the account statements generated by the MOM  of , may be, and often is, somewhat inaccurate. Therefore, MOM  cannot provide the investor  with a true style performance, as cash transactions affecting each style are not considered in the performance calculation by the MOM .","Additionally, because the OM used by the MOM  does not allow duplicate securities across different styles, the MOM  restricts the flexibility of each of the money managers - to select preferred securities for the respective portion of the MCA assigned to its style. Thus, the money managers may be prevented from investing in preferred securities, which could detrimentally affect their performance. Additionally, an individual money manager might even be required to remove certain existing security identifiers from its SM, because the same security identifier exists in another SM. Thus, not only is the MOM  unable to accurately assess or report on the performance of the individual money manager styles, the MOM  also significantly limits the flexibility of the money managers to control how their respective styles are reflected in the OM.","As shown in , using the system architecture of  the brokerage firm , in step , opens the managed client account MCA\u2032 for the investor , with the overlay manager, represented by the alternate master overlay manager (AMOM) \u2032, and makes a deposit of cash, credit and\/or securities into the account in step . Once again, these deposits could be new assets or assets from a previously opened account of the investor  with the brokerage firm .","In step A-D, the individual money managers - open individual managed trading accounts MTA-MTA, as shown in , to be managed in accordance with their individual style models, i.e. SM-SM, as also shown in , for their individual styles, i.e. style-style, shown in . A portion of the MCA\u2032 funding is allocated to the MTA. Although not shown, it will be recognized that allocations are similarly made to MTA-MTA.","There is no overlay model (OM). There is also no need for the AMOM \u2032 to tag individual securities with the applicable style, since each of the money managers use its style model, i.e. SM-SM, to trade and manage the one account, i.e. MTA-MTA, in its individual styles. Model SM for MTA  is identified with reference numeral . It should be understood that, although not shown, each of the other MTAs opened in steps B-D would likewise be traded and managed based on an associated one of SM-SM.","Since each of MTA-MTA is separately traded and managed, security A can be in both MTA and MTA, and hence traded in accordance with the respective models for multiple styles, e.g. both SM or SM. Therefore, duplicate securities within different styles or SMs need not be eliminated. Practically, this also means that multiple models, i.e. SM for style , SM for style , SM for style , and SM for style , may hold overlapping securities, i.e. securities which are duplicated in another of the models. The MMPMS \u2032 initiates trade orders and otherwise transacts MTA in accordance with SM for the investor , in step . The BFPMS  executes the trade orders, resulting in the purchase and sale of individual securities  and remaining cash balance  in MTA.","More particularly, the money manager  tracks the performance of MTA. The money manager  tracks the total cash performance for MTA in step . Such tracking may be during its lifetime in the MTA or during a more limited performance period window. The money manager  also tracks the performance of the securities within MTA, including any cash transactions affecting the performance of the securities, in step . The money manager  also tracks the performance of cash and securities within MTA individually, as shown in steps  and  respectively. The money manager  combines the cash and security performance numbers in order to compute, and thereby track, the total performance for MTA, in step . The other money managers - would also transact and track performance of MTA-MTA in a similar manner. In step , the respective tracked performances for MTA-MTA are compiled by the AMOM \u2032 to track the performance of the MCA\u2032, opened in step , as a whole. Alternatively, the performance of the MCA\u2032 as a whole could be computed by the AMOM \u2032 using the MCA\u2032 record stored at the AMOM \u2032. Because both cash and security transactions are tracked on a style-by-style basis, the effect of the cash transactions is reflected in the style performance computation for each style, as well as in the performance computation for the MCA\u2033 as a whole. Accordingly, both the tracked and reported individual style performance for MTA-MTA generated by the AMMPMS processors B\u2032 of each money manager, as shown in , and the total MCA\u2033 performance generated by the AMOM processor A based either on the MTA-MTA individual style performances, or the MCA\u2032 record itself, will be accurate. The investor  is thus provided with a true style and total account performance, since cash transactions affecting each style are considered in the performance computations by the respective AMMPMSs \u2032. Additionally, because the AMOM \u2032 does not restrict the inclusion of duplicate securities across different styles, each of the money managers - is given complete flexibility to manage its respective portion of the MCA\u2032 assigned to its MTA. Thus, none of the money managers - is forced to alter their preferred style, i.e. their preferred SMs, so as to avoid securities that are already held by or included in the SM of another money manger for a different style.","In summary, the AMOM \u2032 is able to accurately assess and report on the individual performance of each of the money managers and MTAs, as well as the combined performance of all the money managers and the total MCA\u2032, without significantly limiting the flexibility of the money managers to manage their respective portions of the MCA\u2032. Since individual securities and cash are tracked in each MTA, accurate performance of each MTA, and the MCA\u2032 as a whole, is available, true account performance statements are generated and reported.","The money managers - are allowed to hold duplicate securities across multiple styles in the MTAs and independently manage its MTA. Each manager therefore has the flexibility to hold and transact whatever securities it desires for its style. Because each individual MTA serves as its own individual silo, the transactions of one money manager are unknown to the overlay manager and to the other money managers, making it difficult to monitor movements of securities within the entire holdings of the individual investor . Therefore, avoidance of a wash sale violation across the multiple MTAs, i.e. performing tax-aware trading that takes into account the multiple MTAs, and rebalancing allocations across MTAs, can be difficult.","On the other hand, the architecture of  incorporates the individual styles into one single MCA, which facilitates the monitoring of movements of securities within the entire holdings of the individual investor , and thereby makes wash sale avoidance easy. However, this architecture does not provide the money managers - full flexibility to invest as desired by prohibiting the same security from being held across different styles, and cannot produce true style performance within the MCA.","Rebalancing Security Drift",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4","FIG. 1A","FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["50","1","50","50","124","50","50","50","50","50","170","50","170","172","50","174","176"]},"If rebalancing is required and the allocation of a security in the MCA exceeds the weighting of that security in the OM, the processor A will determine the amount, e.g. the number of shares, to sell down that security from the MCA in step .

As shown in , the master overlay manager (MOM)  manages the single master client account (MCA) stored in the MOM database C, and initiates all trading associated with the MCA. The MOM  manages the MCA in accordance with the overlay model (OM) stored in the MOM memory B. The OM represents a combination of the individual style models, i.e. SM-SM, of the money managers -. Thus, the MOM  transacts the MCA. A wash sale violation will only occur if the MOM  initiates both a sale and a purchase of the same security in a restricted time period. Such situations are easily monitored by the MOM processor A implementing the MCA wash sales function A. For example, the MOM , executing function A, will ensure that, after initiating a trade order to sell IBM on December 1 at a loss, no trade order to buy IBM is initiated within a restricted period of say 31 days, e.g. on December 29, thereby avoiding a wash sale violation for the investor .","Referring to , the  architecture can easily monitor and avoid wash sale violations because all transactions, including all trade orders, are initiated by the single master overlay manager (MOM) , and no two styles are allowed to have the same security, e.g. IBM securities are only allowed to be held and transacted in one style, e.g. style . Hence, if a loss is harvested by selling IBM securities on December 1, and according to the overlay model OM, IBM securities are to be purchased on December 29 of the same year, the processor A of MOM  will execute the MCA wash sales function A to check for a sale of IBM securities within the restricted period before initiating a purchase of IBM securities. Since MOM  initiated the sale of IBM securities on December 1, it will not initiate the December 29 purchase of IBM securities, thus avoiding the wash sale violation.","Furthermore, because IBM can only be held and transacted in style  based on the tagging in the OM, no wash sale violation is likely pursuant to an IBM purchase required by another style represented in the OM. An exception is if one money manager, e.g., money manager A , were to eliminate IBM from the style model being managed, e.g., SM!, and another money manager, e.g., SM within a wash sale violation period. Thus, the MOM  needs to typically only consider transactions associated with a single style in monitoring potential wash sale violation.","Referring now to , and , the process for monitoring wash sale violations will be described for the architecture depicted in . As shown in , the alternate master overlay manager, i.e. AMOM \u2032 overlays multiple independently trading accounts, i.e. MTA-MTA, which are separately managed by money managers -. Each of the money managers - self directs and transacts its individual MTA utilizing the MMPMS \u2032 shown in . As a result, a sale by one money manager for one of the MTAs and a purchase by another money manager for another of the MTAs may result in a wash sale violation.","Such situations are difficult to monitor. For example, if money manger  initiates a trade order to sell IBM from MTA on December 1 at a loss, and money manager  initiates a trade order to buy IBM for MTA within, for example, 31 days, i.e. on December 29, a wash sale violation for the investor  would result. Since the money managers - initiate all transactions independently, and the MCA\u2032 stored in the AMOM database C is merely a compilation of MTA-MTA, the AMOM \u2032 is incapable of monitoring these transactions, except to the extent that the individual money managers either promptly report the transactions to the AMOM \u2032 or are required to forward all initiated trade orders to the brokerage firm  via the AMOM \u2032.","Rebalancing Cross Style Drift","Referring now to , ,  and , the process for monitoring drift will be described for the architecture of . As depicted in , master overlay manager, i.e. MOM  shown in , manages the single master client account (MCA) stored in the MOM database C, and initiates all trading associated with the MCA. The MOM  manages the MCA in accordance with the overlay model (OM) stored in the MOM memory B, which represents a combination of the individual style models, i.e. SM-SM, of the money managers -.","As a result, as described with reference to , MOM processor A implements the MCA cross style drift function A by first monitoring drift over the entire account. That is, the MOM processor A computes the security drift in step  of , on a security-by-security basis by comparing each of the securities in the MCA to the target for that security in the OM.","The processor A then implements the rebalance MCA function A to perform to perform steps  and  of , and thereby rebalance the MCA by reducing or eliminating the computed security drift.","However, the MOM  is incapable of accurately monitoring cross style allocation drift of the MCA from the cross style allocation set forth in the OM, or of rebalancing across styles, since it does not contain style-specific cash buckets and thus cannot calculate accurate asset valuations for each style. Rather, the MOM  only monitors and rebalances on a security-by-security basis within the MCA with respect to the individual security targets in the OM.","Referring now to , the process for monitoring drift will be described for the architecture of . As depicted in , each of the individual money managers, represented by MMPMS \u2032 shown in , independently manages the single managed trading account (MTA-MTA stored in the MMPMS database A, and initiates all trading associated with the applicable MTA. Each MMPMS \u2032 manages its MTA in accordance with the style model, i.e. SM-SM, of the applicable one of the money managers -, stored in the MMPMS memory C.","As a result, the processor B of each MMPMS \u2032 implements the drift function B to monitor drift over the applicable MTA. That is, the MMPMS processor B computes the drift, on a security-by-security basis by comparing each of the securities in the applicable MTA to the target for that security in the applicable SM. The processor B then implements the rebalance MTA function B to rebalance the MTA by reducing or eliminating the computed security drift. Since each of the styles is managed independently by a separate money manager, and in accordance with a different SM, the MMPMS \u2032 is incapable of monitoring drift across styles, i.e. drift across MTA-MTA, or rebalancing across style drift. Rather, the AMOM \u2032 could potentially monitor across style performance or value differences for MCA\u2032 using the information provided by the separate MMPMS \u2032 reports for MTA-MTA. However, AMOM \u2032 does not currently include such functionality. If it did, the AMOM \u2032 has no overlay model or management functions, and therefore still could not determine drift or initiate trades to rebalance across styles within the MCA\u2032.","Thus, in the  architecture, drift is monitored only within separately managed accounts. Each money manager, using its MMPMS \u2032 can produce drift reports for the MTA it manages for the investor . For example, money manager , using its MMPMS \u2032, would determine drift for MTA and rebalance MTA to SM if necessary, and money manager , using its MMPMS \u2032, would determine the drift for MTA and rebalance MTA to SM. To rebalance an individual MTA, the trade orders generated by the applicable MMPMS \u2032 are separately forwarded to and executed by the brokerage firm . There would be no movement of assets between MTA-MTA. Any asset allocation rebalancing across MTAs must be performed manually.","Therefore, if the value of MTA, managed by money manager , has increased to a value exceeding the originally allocated value of MTA, the additional value would remain in MTA, and none of the assets of MTA would be moved to MTA-MTA.","Cash Deposit Allocations","As discussed above with reference to , in the  architecture, a cash deposit of $10,000 made by the investor  is allocated to a single overlay manager, represented by the master overlay manager (MOM) , and hence, to the single managed client account (MCA). The MOM  enters the $10,000 into the MCA, shown in .","The overlay model (OM), shown in , does not perform any further allocations of the $10,000 cash deposit. Rather, the MOM  uses the cash deposit to transact the MCA in accordance with the OM, e.g. to purchase securities in the various styles, i.e. style-style, for the MCA. The individual money managers -, whose style models SM-SM form the OM, do not participate in the transacting of the MCA or the allocation of the $10,000 deposit.","Furthermore, there is no discretion for the MOM  to make cash allocations of portions of the $10,000 cash deposit to each of the styles reflected in the OM or to the money managers - to trade individually. Rather, the cash is entered and retained in the MCA by the MOM  as a single cash pool, and is not associated with any particular style. The MOM  then draws from this single cash pool as required to transact style-style in accordance with the OM.","As discussed above with reference to , in the  architecture, cash deposits are allocated amongst the multiple managed trading accounts, i.e. MTA-MTA. For example, a $10,000 deposit made by the investor  could, for example, be divided such that $3,000 is allocated to MTA and managed by money manager , $2,000 is allocated to MTA and managed by money manager , $4,000 is allocated to MTA and managed by money manager , and $1,000 is allocated to MTA and managed by money manager . Each of the managers - enters the applicable cash allocation as a deposit into its associated MTA for the investor  and uses the allocated cash to transact the MTA, e.g. to purchase securities for the MTA.","Maintaining Cash Balances","In the architecture of  the overlay manager, which as shown in  is represented by the master overlay manager (MOM) , manages a single managed client account (MCA) in accordance with a single overlay model (OM). Therefore, as shown in , cash is maintained as a single pool of cash, or within what can be characterized as a single cash bucket. Securities are likewise maintained as a single pool of securities, or within what can be characterized as a single securities bucket, even though there are multiple styles reflected in the OM.","Hence, in the  architecture, each individual style, e.g. style-style, does not have its own individual cash balance. Instead, the incorporation of the multiple styles into a single MCA for the investor  results in the MOM  being able to generate only a single cash balance for the entire MCA. Thus, the MOM  is incapable of maintaining a division of cash among the different styles reflected within the OM.","On the other hand, in the architecture of  cash balances, as well as securities, are maintained within each of the managed trading accounts, i.e. MTA-MTA, by the money managers -. Therefore, as discussed above with reference to , there are for cash balances, one associated with each of MTA-MTA, for the single client managed account (MCA\u2032) at the AMOM \u2032 shown in .","Rebalancing Style Allocations in Multiple Managed Client Accounts (MCAs)","As discussed above with reference to , using the  architecture, the initial allocations are set based on the selected product A-H. Although the initially established allocations may change from time-to-time, the current allocations are applied to the managed client accounts (MCAs) for all investors which are managed in accordance with the applicable overlay model (OM). Thus, the MCAs are always rebalanced back to that current allocation in accordance with the applicable OM.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 7","FIG. 11"],"b":["220","224","222","222","1","4","172","174"]},"As shown, the OM  has an allocation  of 40% value, 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap.","The master overlay manager (MOM) , as shown in , opens MCAs to be managed under the OM at the designated allocations. Hence, the MCA for investor , identified with reference numeral , is opened on a particular date with the styles  and an actual allocation  of 40% value, 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap. As time elapses, the allocations between these four styles in the MCA for investor  will fluctuate as indicated by block . The values of the securities within the individual styles will move in line of stock market or other fluctuations. We will assume, for purposes of this example, that after 30 days the actual allocations A of styles  in the MCA  for investor  fluctuate to 45% value, 28% growth, 17% small cap and 10% large cap.","MCA  for another investor, i.e. an investor other than investor , is opened on the 30day after the opening of MCA , with an actual allocation  for the styles  of 40% value, 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap, which of course is identical to the OM allocation. As time elapses, the allocations between these four styles in MCA for this other investor will also fluctuate, in line of stock market and\/or other fluctuations.","Therefore, although MCA  and MCA  are subject to management by the MOM  using the same OM , MCA  will have a different actual allocation than MCA  on the 30day after opening MCA . That is, 30 days after the opening of MCA  for investor , MCA will have actual allocations A of 45% value, 28% growth, 17% small cap and 10% large cap while the MCA  for the other investor will have actual allocations  of 40% value, 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap, even though both of these MCAs are managed in accordance with the same OM . As noted above, differences in allocations between MCAs for different investors may also occur at any particular time because of varying account activities, such as different deposits being made by different investors during the lives of the MCAs.","Hence, the MOM  determines, in , that the actual allocation A for MCA  must be rebalanced in , back into line with the OM allocation , and performs the rebalancing i.e. from 45% value, 28% growth, 17% small cap and 10% large cap to 40% value, 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap, in block . It also determines, in , that no rebalancing of the actual allocation  for MCA  is required and hence does nothing with the MCA  current actual allocation  as indicated by block .","Similarly, MCAs associated with other investors (not shown) may not require any rebalancing or may require a different rebalancing from that of MCA . As indicated above, the different rebalancing may be required either because such other MCA was opened at a different time than MCA , or was subject to account activity different than that to which the MCA  was subjected.","Thus, on the 30day after the opening date of MCA , multiple MCAs managed under the same OM  will often need to be rebalanced from different current actual allocations back to the OM allocation , i.e. back to 40% value, 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap. This will in turn require a substantial number of different trades, and accordingly substantial processing by the MOM , to bring the allocations of each of the MCAs for the different investors which are managed according to the same OM, e.g. OM , back into line with the allocation  set forth in the OM.","In summary, a single OM is typically used for multiple MCAs of different investors, which can number in the thousands or even tens of thousands. Each of these MCAs may be subject to a different allocation drift during regular reporting periods, such as the 30 day period referenced above, due to varying opening dates or account activity. Accordingly, many of the MCAs will often need to be separately rebalanced back to the OM allocation every reporting period. This results in a significant amount of processing by the MOM to determine if each MCA needs rebalancing and to initiate different trades to rebalance different MCAs. Furthermore, this will also result in a significant amount of trading by the brokerage firm  being required. The trading may in turn result in additional tax issues for the investors.","It should also be recognized that, in the architecture shown in , because of a need to maintain the OM allocation across the multiple styles for many MCAs, the MOM  rebalances allocations, without consideration of factors which may be relevant to an individual investor. For example, it may be beneficial for the allocation to follow a particular investment trend over a period of market activity or for the allocation to be varied from the current OM allocation to avoid a high number of trades or tax consequences that might otherwise result in bringing the current actual allocation in line with the original OM allocation. However, this is not possible in the  architecture because the style allocation in the OM are fixed and the number of OMs are finite.","The Overlay Model and Managed Client Account",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1A","FIG. 6"],"b":["200","50","1","4"]},"As shown, the overlay model , and discussed with reference to , combines multiple style models, i.e. SM-SM, for multiple investment style-style. Within each of the SM's incorporated in the OM is a list of security identifiers, e.g. IBM, CKFR, KO, PFE, C, F, T, and GM etc., along with a percentage weight, e.g. 5%, 4%, 8%, 1%, 2%, and 3% etc., for each of the identified securities. The identifier for each security is preferably the symbol utilized by the stock exchange on which that security is traded. However, this is not mandatory. Each security identifier is tagged, or otherwise associated with, the specific style of the model from which it originated, and thus to a specific one of styles - being utilized by the overlay manager to manage the MCA for investor . As shown, IBM and CKFR are tagged with the superscript  and thereby associated with style , KO and PFE are tagged with the superscript  and thereby associated with style , C and F are tagged with the superscript  and thereby associated with style , and T and GM are tagged with the superscript  and thereby associated with style .","In the  architecture, an identified security can only exist in one individual style model. Duplicate securities across different style models are not allowed in the overlay model . As a result, when the MCA is transacted in step  of , the tax lots of each security purchased for or sold from the MCA can be associated with the appropriate style since the security identifier for the securities is associated with only one style reflected in the OM. Thus, a purchase of IBM securities for the MCA will necessarily be associated with style  by the MOM , because the IBM security identifier in the OM is tagged to style . On the other hand, a sale of GM securities from the MCA will necessarily be associated with style  by the MOM , because the GM security identifier in the OM is tagged to style . Thus, each tax lot of securities can be associated by the MOM  to an individual investment style reflected in the OM, because the OM prohibits the purchase or sale of such securities for any style except the style to which the identifier for those securities has been tagged. Therefore, all transactions relating to a particular identified security, such as IBM, will be tracked by the MOM  in the style with which the identifier of the security is tagged in the OM. The MOM  will prohibit any style incorporated in the OM, other than SM, from including the IBM identifier, thereby prohibiting transactions in IBM securities in other styles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0123"},"figref":["FIG. 9A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 6"],"b":["202","202"]},"As shown, the MCA  includes a listing of the securities within the MCA.

Using the tagged identifiers in the OM, the MOM processor A, of , can retrieve the information from the MCA and associate each of the securities represented in the MCA with a particular style. This information is processed by the MOM processor A by executing the generate MCA statement function A, to compute the performance results for the MCA, and hence CA, as a whole, as well as the performance results for the securities in the individual styles. As noted above, the individual style performances results will be somewhat inaccurate due the lack of consideration of the cash transactions on a style-by-style basis.","Tracking Security Movement and Account Performance",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0125"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1A","FIG. 4"],"b":["204","10","12","12","202","9","50","50"]},"In accordance with the OM  used for the MCA  of investor , IBM securities can only be held and transacted in style  and KO securities can only be held and transacted in style . Hence, any purchase or sale request must necessarily be limited, in the case of IBM to style , and in the case of KO to style , because these securities can only be held and transacted in those styles. The MOM processor A can thereby track the sale of the IBM securities as a sale from the portion of the MCA  managed under style  and the sale of the KO securities as a sale from the portion of the MCA  managed under style . The MOM processor A, in step , implements the generate trade order function A to initiate trade orders to sell the 50 shares of IBM securities and the 20 shares of KO securities from the MCA  of . The brokerage firm , in step , executes the trade orders.","As described with reference to , A and , in the architecture of  the overlay manager, represented by the master overlay manager (MOM)  shown in , generates reports on the performance of both the individual styles reflected in the overlay model (OM) as well as on the entire managed client account (MCA). However, as discussed with reference to , A and , security identifiers, such as IBM, are tagged with the style in which they are to be transacted. The securities are then purchased and sold based on trade orders initiated by the MOM  in accordance with the OM. However, such purchases and sales are not tracked on a style-by-style basis.","Because each security identifier, e.g. IBM, KO etc., within each style in the OM is tagged to its applicable style and the MOM  prohibits a security identifier from being tagged to more than one style, the performance of securities currently in an MCA can be tracked on a style-by-style basis. However, the tracked performance for each individual style will not be accurate.","For example, as shown in , money manager A, identified in  with reference numeral , who is responsible for the style model for stylet, i.e. SM, which is incorporated in the OM  shown in , requests, in step , that the master overlay manager (MOM)  remove IBM from style of the OM . Money manager D, identified in  with reference numeral , who is responsible for the style model for style, i.e. SM, which is also incorporated in the OM , requests, in step , that the MOM  add IBM to style of the OM. The MOM , in step , retags the IBM identifier in the OM  from IBMto from IBMin accordance with the requests from money managers  and .","Practically, this results in IBM securities residing in the managed client account (MCA) shown in , being removed from style and being added to style. Furthermore, it is unnecessary to trade the IBM securities from the MCA. Rather, the existing IBM securities which were previously associated with style in the OM  remain in the MCA, but are now associated with style in the OM . However, because there is no movement of or change to the IBM securities in the MCA, there is also no way for the MOM  to track the performance ramifications of the removal of the IBM securities from stylet of the OM  and addition of these securities to style of the OM . Therefore, the computed performance of the MCA for both stylet and style will necessarily be skewed because there internal transaction of the IBM securities is not tracked.","It should also be recognized that, since the MOM  maintains a single cash bucket, as discussed above, it is also incapable of tracking cash movements for the MCA on a style-by-style basis. Without the ability to track cash deposits and withdrawal on a style-by-style basis, the MOM  cannot compute the actual cash performance on a style-by-style basis.","Hence, for both the above reasons, the MOM  is incapable of accurately calculating and reporting performance of the OM  on a style-by-style basis. The MOM  can, however, accurately compute and report on the total MCA performance. Thus, in moving from the multiple trading account architecture to that of , the ability to track individual style performance has been lost.","In the architecture depicted in , both the tracking of the movement of securities within a particular MTA and the computation of the performance of that MTA is performed by the money manager - responsible for that MTA. The respective performances of MTA-MTA may be compiled in a single managed client account (MCA\u2032) performance by the overlay manager represented using the AMOM \u2032, as shown in .","Because each of the MTAs is separately managed, the applicable money manager completely controls the single style model (SM) according to which the MTA is managed and the transacting of the MTA. Therefore, each money manager can easily track the movements of securities and cash into and out of the MTA it manages for the investor and the performance of that MTA. The performance of the MTA is typically tracked to a finite or granular level sufficient to provide a true performance of the MTA. Since each MTA represents one style, the performance of each style is accurately tracked.","For example, if MTA, as shown in  is a growth account, MTA is a value account, MTA is a fixed income account, and MTA is a small cap account, movements of securities and cash into and out of each of MTA-MTA are separately tracked. Because both cash and securities movements are accurately tracked, the total account performance of any of the MTAs can also be accurately tracked. With respect to securities, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the movement of securities into and out of a particular MTA will contribute to the MTA performance. Therefore, as securities are bought for and sold from an MTA, the dates and price at which these securities are bought and sold is tracked.","Movements of a security from one MTA to another, and therefore from one style to another, can be tracked in two different ways using the  architecture. A first way is to sell the security, e.g. IBM out of one account, e.g. MTA, and buy the same security into another account, e.g. MTA. In so doing, IBM securities will be moved out of the one style and into another style. However, selling the same security from MTA and buying it into MTA for the same investor  results in potential problems and inefficiencies.","One such problem is that investor  may suffer negative tax consequences due to the buying and selling of the same security. For example, there is a potential for a wash sale violation, as has been discussed above. Additionally, selling IBM for a short term gain from MTA, as desired by money manager , may be less beneficial to the investor than retaining IBM in MTA and subsequently selling it for a long term gain, in view of the desire of money manager  to buy IBM into MTA. Another problem is that the sale from MTA and purchase into MTA of IBM will result in trading for the brokerage firm , and additional work for money manger  who manages MTA and money mangers  who manages MTA.","A second way to move securities between styles is to simply deliver securities, e.g. IBM securities, from one managed trading account, e.g. MTA, into another managed trading account, MTA, without actually trading the securities. However this requires coordination between two different money managers, e.g. money manager  for MTA and money manager  for MTA. This would have also required coordination with the brokerage firm  to coordinate the movement from one custodial trading account, e.g. CTA, to another custodial trading account, e.g. CTA, as shown in .","Thus, delivery of securities from one MTA to another MTA is possible using the  architecture, including movements of securities between MTAs if a particular type of security is to be eliminated from one MTA style model, e.g. from MTA, and added to another MTA, e.g. MTA. However, to do so requires coordination between the money managers for the applicable MTAs and the overlay manager represented by AMOM \u2032.","In summary, using the architecture of , cash and security deposits and transactions for each MTA, as well as the individual performance of each MTA, can be accurately tracked and reported by the applicable MMPMS \u2032 shown in . The individual MTA performances can be compiled by the AMOM \u2032 of  to provide an accurate total client account performance. Thus, individual style performance as well total investor account performance can be accurately tracked and reported to the investor  using the  architecture.","Netting Security Transactions","In the  architecture, the master overlay manager (MOM)  of  is incapable of netting different transactions in a particular type of security, such as IBM, except in the case where the security is to be completely eliminated from one style type and added to another of the style types at the same time.","As discussed above with reference to , a security identifier, e.g. in this case we will use IBM, is initially tagged with a style indicator. Accordingly, IBM securities may only be included in style of overlay model (OM), such as OM  shown in . As described with reference to , the MOM  may, if desired, retag the IBM identifier in the OM  with a style indicator, if IBM is to be removed from style and added to style  in OM . By performing this retagging, the 100 shares of IBM represented in the MCA  of  will tracked as part of the style securities portfolio, rather than the style securities portfolio of investor . It will be noted that no change has been made to the MCA shown in .","Since the MOM  prohibits IBM from being tagged with more than one style at any given time, if only 50 shares of IBM securities are to be removed from the style portfolio represented in the MCA , these shares could not be transferred to the style portfolio represented in the MCA . That is, in order to transfer only 50 of the 100 shares of IBM in the MCA to style, the IBM identifier would need to be tagged with both style and style  in the OM , and this is prohibited. The MOM  cannot track IBM securities in multiple styles. Therefore, only if the 100 shares of IBM securities are completely from the style portfolio in the MCA thereby allowing the style tag removed from the IBM identifier in the OM, can the IBM identifier be retagged with another style identifier, such as the style tag, and some or all of these shares of IBM securities in the MCA be moved to the style portfolio in the MCA.","Thus, the architecture of  also does not accommodate a netting of trades in a single security type, such as in shares of IBM securities, since trades in the same type of security, e.g. IBM securities, under different styles are not allowed. The architecture therefore limits the flexibility of the money managers - for styles , , and  to include IBM securities in the style models SM-SM that are incorporated into the OM or to buy IBM securities until IBM is removed from style  in the OM.","Using the architecture of  and as discussed above with reference to , the individual money managers - initiate transactions and exclusively manage the respective MTAs. Thus, two different money managers may initiate different trade orders to transact the same type of security, e.g. in this case IBM, for different MTAs at any time.","For example, money manager , via its MMPMS \u2032, could initiate a trade order to sell 50 shares of IBM securities from MTA of investor , while at substantially the same time, money manager , via its MMPMS \u2032, could initiate a trade order to buy 100 shares of IBM, securities for MTA of investor . Trading in the same type security, i.e. IBM in this example, for the same investor managed client account (MCA\u2032) on the same day will necessarily result in inefficiencies. However, in the architecture of , such inefficiencies are very difficult to avoid, since money manager  independently initiates the sale of the 50 shares of IBM securities and money manager  independently initiates the purchase of the 100 shares of IBM securities.","These two separate transactions could potentially be netted to a single transaction, since a net buy of 50 shares of IBM securities for MTA is all that is required to fulfill both the desired sale by money manager  and the desired purchase by money manager . However, this requires that the 50 shares of IBM securities in MTA be moved from MTA to MTA. Since money mangers  and  transact MTA and MTA independent of each other, and communications between the money managers - rarely, if ever, occur, such movements of securities between MTAs has proven to be impractical.","Thus, using the architecture of , transactions in the same security type, such as in IBM, initiated by different money managers are typically not netted, and therefore may be performed inefficiently using multiple trades when only one trade is actually necessary. The multiple trades may in turn subject the investor  to undesirable tax consequences and additional brokerage firm costs. However, this has been accepted as a cost of providing individual money managers with control over the management and transacting of accounts pursuant to their respective style models.","Account Management Flexibility","Using the architecture of  a single client account (CA) and corresponding managed client account (MCA) exists. The MCA is transacted and otherwise managed exclusively by the overlay manager represented by the master overlay manager (MOM) , in accordance with the overlay model (OM) which is a combination of the style models (SM-SM) of the multiple money managers -.","The individual money managers - are prohibited from trading or otherwise transacting or managing the MCA. Hence, the only involvement of each of the money managers - is in providing its SM for incorporation into the OM. The MOM  initiates all the trading and other transactions, and performs all reporting on the MCA. The money managers - can, and do from time to time, make changes to SM-SM and forward these changes to the overlay manager. However, although these changes may reflect a desire of a money manager that the MCA be transacted, the money managers cannot initiate the desired transactions, and must instead rely on the discretion of the overlay manager, represented by the MOM , to perform in a timely manner the desired transactions. In practice, a money manager is not advised as to when, or even if, such desired transactions are initiated. Yet, the money manager remains subject to being judged on the performance of the relevant portion of the MCA. Accordingly, the architecture of , with its single MCA for the investor , substantially reduces the management flexibility of the individual money managers, limits the ability of the individual managers to report on, or even track, style performance, and eliminates the ability of individual money managers to trade within the portion of the MCA subject to its style model. Thus, the control over the management and transacting of the MCA is effectively removed from the money managers and given to the overlay manager.","Using the architecture of , the individual managers - have total control over the management and transacting of the individual managed trading accounts, i.e. MTA-MTA, of the investor . Each money manager has complete flexibility in trading its individual MTA.","For instance, money manager  has exclusive control over the transacting of MTA for investor . Thus, money manager  can, if desired, add 2% of IBM securities to MTA by simply modifying SM and initiating, via its MMPMS \u2032 as shown in , a purchase of the addition 2% of IBM securities. Money manager  could also independently adjust MTA by selling and\/or buying individual securities which are not mandated by SM. Money manager  can perform tax efficient trades using the MMPMS \u2032, as previously discussed, although the tax effectiveness would not consider other managed trading accounts, i.e. MTA-MTA, of the investor . Thus, money manager  manages MTA independently from the other money managers -, and has full discretion over MTA.","Additionally, money manager , using its MMPMS \u2032, can generate all MTA specific reports, and can accurately track the performance of MTA and movements of the specific holdings within MTA. Because money manager  has complete and accurate information regarding MTA, it can also accurately perform all desired analysis relating to MTA.","Accordingly, the architecture of , with its multiple MTAs for the investor , provides complete management flexibility to the individual money managers, provides the individual managers with the ability to accurately report on and accurately track style performance, and provides the individual money managers with the ability to trade within a MTA. Thus, the control over the individual MTAs effectively remains with the money managers and is not given to the overlay manager. However, since control is decentralized, the  architecture lacks various benefits provided by the centralized control in the  architecture, specifically: a single custodial account, across-style rebalancing, a single point of trading control, tax-efficient trading across styles, and the ability to identify and prevent wash sale violations.","It is an objective of the invention to overcome one or more of the above-described problems.

The assets will commonly include cash assets and security assets, but may also or alternatively include other kinds of assets. The different styles are preferably associated with different categories of securities, e.g. value, growth, small cap, large cap, etc.","The investment account may represent transactions of various types including, but not limited to, purchases and sales of shares of securities, e.g. shares of IBM stock, and movements of cash, e.g. dollars, euros, yen, and shares of securities between styles within the investment account. The investment account itself may preferably be stored in a database. The database may reside on a storage device, which could, for example, be part of or associated with a mainframe, workstation, desk top or other type computing device.","A processor (or similar type of computing device) may interact with the database (and more particularly with the investment account) in order to perform various operations. These operations may include asset drift determination and operations associated with rebalancing assets in the investment account such as making a determination whether or not to rebalance.","In determining whether to rebalance the investment account, a value of total assets associated with one of the investment styles, such as the growth investment style, may be determined or established. The determined market value may be compared to a desired value (or desired percentage) set forth in an investment style allocation. In an investment style allocation, the allocation of each investment style may be based on actual total assets associated with the respective investment style. Based on this comparison, an investment style drift (or investment style difference) may be determined. As one example of determining the drift, an actual total asset allocation associated with a first investment style may be determined. The total actual asset allocation associated with the first investment style may be compared to an allocation rule or actual investment style allocation. The determined drift of total assets associated with the first investment style may be determined based on the comparison.","The determined drift may be compared with a threshold value (or threshold values) and a determination may be made whether to rebalance the investment account based on the comparison. Threshold values may be the same for each of the investment styles or the threshold values may be different for each of the investment styles. The threshold value of the first investment style may be determined based on an allocation size associated with the investment style. A larger threshold may be set when the desired allocation is large (as set by a threshold) and a smaller threshold may be set when the desired allocation is small (as set by a threshold). That is, an investment style may be assigned a +\/\u22125% threshold value (for the drift) when the allocation size for that particular investment style exceeds 15% of the total value of the investment account. Otherwise, the investment style may be assigned a +\/\u22123% threshold value (for the drift) when the allocation size for that particular investment style is below 15% of the total value of the investment account.","After deciding to proceed with rebalancing, drifts (or differences) of security assets associated with the first investment style may be identified. Again, the drifts may be determined based on a difference between actual market values of the security assets and the desired values of the security assets (as set forth in an allocation rule for a particular investment style, for example). More specifically, security assets having a greatest determined drift may be identified for rebalancing. These identified specific security assets having the greatest determined drift may be bought or sold.","Rebalancing of cash assets may also occur such that a total cash asset allocation associated with the first investment style substantially conforms to the allocation rule. As one example, cash assets associated with the first investment style may be rebalanced to a second investment style such that a total cash asset allocation associated with the first investment style substantially conforms to the allocation rule (or investment style allocation). As another example, cash assets associated with the second investment style may be rebalanced to the first investment style such that a total cash asset allocation associated with the first investment style substantially conforms to the allocation rule.","In at least one embodiment, a selection may occur between a first type of rebalancing and a second type of rebalancing. The selected type of rebalancing may be performed based on this selection.","Other aspects, features and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following disclosed description taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, which disclose preferred embodiments of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0226","num":"0225"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["10","14","12","14"]},"The brokerage firm is represented by a brokerage firm portfolio management system, such as the conventional brokerage firm portfolio management system (CBFPMS)  depicted in .

Thus, as shown in , the custodian firm is represented by a custodian management system, such as the conventional custodian management system (CCMS) , which includes a custodian client account (CCA) in the system database A. The CCA is maintained by the CCMS  as the authority of record for all transactions associated with the CA, as has been previously described.","The architecture of  also includes multiple money manager portfolio management systems (MMPMSs) , each representing a different money manager or at least a different investment style. As shown, four money managers (i.e. money manager A, B, C and D) are each represented by a different MMPMS . Each MMPMS includes a memory B, which stores the applicable money manager's style model (SM). As shown in the exemplary architecture of , the MMPMS  representing money manager A  has a memory B, which stores style model SM. The MMPMS  representing money manager B  includes a memory B, which stores style model SM. The MMPMS  representing money manager C  has a memory B, which stores style model SM. Finally, money manager D  is represented by an MMPMS  having a memory B which stores style model SM.","As also shown, the  architecture also includes a master overlay manager (MOM) , which is a system component that automates functionality of an overlay manager. The MOM  includes a memory B having a compiled overlay model (COM), and a database C having a stylized managed client account (SMCA). As in the  architecture, the MOM  may be a separate system, operated, for example, by a global money manager, or could be functionally included as part of one of the MMPMS  (e.g. part of the MMPMS ) for money manager  as indicated by one set of dotted lines, or could be functionally included as part of the BFPMS  as indicated by the other set of dotted lines in .","The MOM  interfaces with the BFPMS  in a manner similar to that discussed above with reference to the  architecture. The MOM  also interfaces with each MMPMS  in a manner substantially different than the interfacing of the MOM  with each MMPMS  in the  architecture, as will be described in detail below.","Money Manager Portfolio Management System (MMPMS)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0232","num":"0231"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":["1036","1036","1036","1036","1036","1036","1","4","1036"]},"Unlike the MMPMS  in the  architecture, the processor A is configured (i.e. programmed) with the logic necessary, to perform various functions. Unlike the AMMPMS \u2032 of the  architecture, the MMPMS  does not include a database for storing a managed trading account (MTA) for the investor , because the  architecture does not require multiple separately managed trading accounts for the investor ; nevertheless, the memory B may also include a \u201cshadow\u201d of the appropriate portion of the client account (CA) stored in database A.","The MMPMS  interfaces to the MOM  as indicated in , but in a manner significantly different than the interfacing between the AMMPMS \u2032 and AMOM \u2032 in the  architecture. As discussed above, in the  architecture, the only interfacing required between the MMPMS  and MOM  is to download the SM stored in the memory C of the MMPMS to the MOM  for inclusion in the overlay model stored in the memory of MOM .","In the  architecture, the interfacing may include synchronous or asynchronous communications to transfer the SM (in its entirety or just updates) or other instructions (e.g., swap or trade instructions) to the MOM , or to receive updates from the MOM  for a locally stored \u201cshadow\u201d account. Additionally, the interfacing may include synchronous or asynchronous support for accessing and\/or modifying just the relevant portion of the stylized managed client account (SMCA) stored in database C, through money manager tools available in the MMPMS , or provided by the MOM , or both cooperatively. One or more tokens associated with the particular money manager, for example money manager A , could support both identity authentication and access control, correlating to the tagging in the SMCA stored in database C and thus restrict access appropriately.","As shown in , the MMPMS processor A includes the logic, e.g. programmed instructions, necessary to perform various functions. As shown, these functions include a rebalance SMCA style function A, a SMCA style drift function A, a generate SMCA style trade directive with tag function A, a generate SMCA style statements function A, and a SMCA style swap function A. As noted above, the MMPMS  stores a style model in the memory B for the investment style utilized by the applicable money manager. As will be discussed further below, the stored SM is incorporated in an overlay model utilized by the MOM  to generate trade orders and otherwise manage activity on the relevant portion of a single stylized managed client account (SMCA). However, unlike in the case of the  architecture, MMPMS  stores the applicable SM both to record modifications made by the applicable money manager, as well as to perform functions executable by the processor A on a relevant portion of the single managed client account (SMCA). With regard to the rebalance SMCA style function A, using the architecture of , each of the money managers A-D - can separately rebalance a portion of the single managed client account maintained by the MOM , as will be discussed further below. This allows the individual money managers to bring a portion of the single managed client account managed in accordance with that money manager's style back in line with the SM for that style. To do this, the processor A executes the rebalance SMCA style function A to determine the deviation of the applicable portion of the single managed client account maintained by the MOM  from the SM stored in the memory B. It then generates trade directives by executing the generate SMCA style trade directive with tag function A, as will be described in more detail below, to reduce or eliminate the determined deviation and thereby place the relevant portion of the single managed client account in line with the applicable SM.","Drift within a relevant portion of the single managed client account is monitored and managed by executing the SMCA style drift function A. The execution of this function by the MMPMS processor A allows the monitoring and managing of drift within the applicable portion of the single managed client account in an automated manner. More particularly, by executing the drift function A, the MMPMS  is able to identify whether a security or other holding in the relevant portion of the single managed client account stored at the MOM  has drifted outside of a range from a position for that security or holding included in the SM or in other data stored in the memory C, or otherwise identified. For example, the range may be established in real time by the processor A if so desired. In any event, the processor A then executes the generate SMCA style trade directive with tag function A to initiate trade directives in order to reduce or eliminate the drift, and thereby place the relevant portion of the single managed client account in line with the applicable SM. Since drift is reduced or eliminated one style at a time, and the drift reduction or elimination in each style is typically performed by a different MMPMS , the drift in the single managed client account is reduced only a style-by-style basis.","The processor A can also execute the SMCA style swap function A to swap one type of security, e.g. IBM, for another type of security, e.g. GE, within a relevant portion of the single managed client account. Once again it should be recognized that the swap function A can only be utilized to swap different types of securities within a single relevant portion of the single managed client account. Here again, once the types of securities have been selected, the processor A may execute the generate SMCA style trade directive with tag function A to direct the necessary purchases and sales of securities to accomplish the desired swap. Alternatively, the swap instructions transmitted to the MOM  may cause the MOM  to generate trades for all affected single managed client accounts.","The generate SMCA style statements function A can also be executed by the processor A to generate a statement for the relevant portion of the single managed client account, which is managed in accordance with the applicable SM stored in the memory B of the applicable MMPMS .","Master Overlay Manager (MOM)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0240","num":"0239"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 13","FIG. 15","FIG. 1A","FIG. 4","FIGS. 1A and 1B"],"b":["1050","1050","1050","1050","1050","1050","1050","1050","1050","1050","1050","1036"]},"The functions executable by the processor A include a rebalance SMCA function A, SMCA tax efficient trading function A, SMCA wash sale check function A, SMCA across style drift function A, generate trade order with tag function A, generate SMCA statement function A, SMCA tag transaction function A, SMCA style drift function A, SMCA across style transfer function A, an execute style swap function A, a cross style swap function A, and a COM management function A. Hence, although trade directing and account management functions can be performed by the MMPMS  at the style level in the  architecture, there is a single managed client account which can be managed and transacted by the MOM , via execution of the functions A-A by the processor A.","As has been discussed previously in describing the MOM  of the  architecture, the COM stored in the memory B combines the style models, e.g. SM-SM, for each of the investment styles, e.g. style-style, into the COM for the SMCA being utilized for the investor . The SMCA is shadowed by the CA stored in the database A of the BFPMS  representing the brokerage firm. If the MOM  is incorporated with BFPMS , the CA will be replaced by the SCMA, eliminating the need for the database C.","As will be understood by those skilled in the art, although trade orders are usually initiated by the MOM , each MMPMS  may direct the initiation of such trade orders for a respective portion of the SMCA. On the other hand, the MOM  may also independently initiate trade orders and other account management functions for the entire SMCA stored at the database C. The interface between each MMPMS  and the MOM  facilitates the necessary coordination between the overlay manager and the individual money managers which is necessary to properly transact and manage the SMCA.","By executing the rebalance SMCA function A, the MOM processor A will automatically rebalance the SMCA maintained in the database C, based on the multi-style COM stored at the memory B. The rebalancing will be performed across the entire SMCA and accordingly, across the multiple styles.","For example, the multi-style COM for the particular SMCA might require that a certain number of securities within the SMCA make up 100% of the capital. The SMCA must be rebalanced by the MOM  to the COM. To do this, the processor A, executes the rebalance SMCA function A to determine the deviation of the SMCA securities from the security allocation set forth in the COM stored in the memory B. The MOM processor A then executes the generate trade order with tag function A to generate the appropriate trade orders to reduce or eliminate the determined deviation, and thereby place the SMCA in line with the COM for the investor .","The MOM processor A may also execute the SMCA tax efficient trading function to, for example, determine the appropriate lots or positions in securities held in the SMCA to sell at a loss to offset gains made earlier in the tax year and thereby reduce the tax burden on the investor. As noted above, this is often referred to as tax loss harvesting. The execution of the SMCA tax efficient trading function A allows the processor A to identify the lots of or positions in securities in any style that should preferably be sold from the SMCA of the investor  to offset the gains due to prior sales of securities for investor . Once the preferred lots of or positions in securities have been identified, the MOM processor A executes the generate trade order with tag function A to initiate the sell of the identified securities or positions, and thereby reduce or eliminate the prior capital gain for the tax year and the associated investor tax burden.","The MOM processor A executes the SMCA wash sale function A to avoid a wash sale violation. Such a violation will arise when shares of a particular type of security in the SMCA were previously sold at a loss for the investor  and shares of that security are repurchased for investor  within thirty-one (31) days of the earlier sale, or some other predetermined period. In order to track potential wash sales, the MOM , by executing the SMCA wash sale function A, determines whether shares of a security proposed to be purchased for the SMCA of investor  were previously sold at a loss from any style in the SMCA during the violation period. Only after determining that no such sale occurred during the violation period, will the processor A execute the generate trade order with tag function A to initiate the desired trade order. Thus, wash sale violations are avoided in the SMCA.","The MOM  will also monitor and manage drift between the multiple styles associated with the SMCA of the investor . More particularly, the MOM processor A will execute the SMCA across style drift function A to proactively monitor and manage the drift between the different styles represented in the SCMA, away from the allocations across the multiple styles set forth in the COM stored in the memory  of the MOM .","The processor A identifies whether a style of securities in the SMCA of investor  has drifted outside a range, which may be computed by the processor A or stored in the memory B as part of the COM, from the style allocation established in the COM. The processor A then generates trade orders, by executing the generate trade order with tag function A, to reduce or eliminate the drift and thereby place the SMCA for investor  in line with the COM. Hence, the drift is reduced or eliminated across all styles in the SMCA.","The processor A of the MOM  also executes the generate SMCA statement function to create statements or reporting on the performance of the SMCA of investor . By executing the function A, the processor A is capable of generating statements both on an individual style basis and an entire account basis. The generated statements, whether for an individual style or the entire SMCA, will, unlike the statements generated by the MOM  of the  architecture, provide accurate performance information.","The processor A of MOM  will also execute an SMCA tag transaction function A to tag transactions other than those tagged in the execution of the generate trade order with tag function A with the associated style(s). The tagging of trade orders and other transactions will be discussed further below in detail.","The processor A of MOM  may also execute an SMCA style drift function A to proactively monitor and manage drift in an individual style reflected in a portion of the SMCA. This monitoring is identical to that performed by the MMPMS  when executing the SMCA style drift function A, as described above with reference to . However, in the case of the MOM , rather than generating style trade directives in view of the determined style drift, the processor A will execute the generate trade order with tag function A to reduce or eliminate the determined style drift.","By executing the SMCA across style transfer function A, the processor A of MOM  efficiently performs across style movements of securities. Based upon the transfer identified in the execution of the SMCA across style transfer function A, the processor A executes the SMCA tag transaction function A to tag the security transfer transaction, as will be discussed further below. It is perhaps worthwhile noting that the MOM  in the  architecture had no need for such functionality since individual securities could not be selectively moved between styles. Rather, because the same type of securities were not allowed in different styles, transfers could occur only by eliminating a security identifier from one style to another style in the OM stored in the memory B of the MOM . The AMOM \u2032 also had no need for such functionality since the investors account was completely managed under separate MTA's by the individual money managers.","The COM execute style swap function A allows the MOM  to execute the style styles as directed by the style managers. The MOM implements the style swap instructions, and the processor A executes the tag transaction function A to tag the security swap transaction, as will be discussed further below.","It should also be noted that the MOM  has the ability to execute an across style swap function A as well. In this instance, the MOM  would need to have control or permission from the style managers to enact changes to their individual styles. However, once permission was received, the MOM  can make changes to models, create offsetting trades in different styles, and execute those trades. Also, the MOM  has the ability to move cash within the SMCA, and thus a sale in one style could generate cash for a purchase in another style.","The MOM  is the controller of the COM and executes the COM management function A to control the COM. As such, in many situations, the MOM  can make changes directly in the styles provided by the style managers. In some cases, the style managers provide their styles, and give the MOM  full control of their style, thus allowing the MOM  to have discretion over the styles, and thus over all COMs. The individual style managers can also be given the ability to interact directly with the SMCA by executing functions found in the processor A via the interface. In some cases, the MOM  can give the individual style managers the ability, for instance, to trade directly on the SMCA, rather than providing trade instructions to the MOM . This results in additional flexibility when trading an investor's account. There is no need to wait for the MOM  to enact the trade; the style manager can update his or her style, then create the trade directly. How the processor A is used, depends on how the MOM  sets up the COM management function A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0257","num":"0256"},"figref":"FIG. 15A","b":["10508","1050"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0258","num":"0257"},"figref":"FIG. 15B","b":["1050","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0259","num":"0258"},"figref":"FIG. 15C","b":["1050","1050"]},"Risk Category Determination","As shown in , the financial advisor , working with the investor , performs a risk assessment in step  to determine the appropriate risk category for the investor . The advisor  performs the risk assessment on the investor  based on the investor's profile, age, demographics, income, retirement age and other factors well understood by those skilled in the art. Based on the results of the risk assessment, the advisor , in step , selects the proper risk category. In the exemplary flow depicted in , the advisor  selects between risk categories -, which are identified with the reference numerals A-D. There could be more or less risk categories considered. In this example, it will be assumed that the advisor  selects category . It should be noted that up to this point, the process is identical to that previously described above with reference to .","However, unlike the process required using the system architecture of  and described with reference to  above, the MOM  and the architecture of , need not associate each risk category with specific investment products offered by the brokerage firm . Furthermore, greater flexibility is provided in the selection of the money managers to manage different portions of the SMCA using different investment styles.","Rather than selecting standard allocations and predetermined money managers, using the architecture of , the financial advisor  and investor  would preferably work together to determine a preferred asset allocation which can be different than any of the standard allocations from which a selection must be made in the  architecture. Furthermore, the financial advisor  and investor  can select from a larger pool of available money managers rather than being limited to a small restricted group of predetermined money managers, to manage a desired portion of the SMCA in accordance with a desired style. Thus, as shown in , once the risk category is chosen, the desired allocations between styles and the desired money managers are selected. As shown in , after having selected category , in this particular example an allocation A is selected and a set of money managers B are selected for the investor . This combination is only one of many possibilities that could satisfy risk category . In the case of the other categories B-D, other allocations and sets of money managers C-H would typically be selected. Based upon the selected allocation A and selected money managers B, the allocations between and the money manager selected to oversee the trading in each of styles - are defined as indicated by reference numerals A-D. These same money managers are identified as money managers A-D - in . Similarly, styles - are the same styles reflected in the style models, i.e. SM-SM, which are combined in the COM applied to the SMCA in the  architecture. It is possible that selection of a style necessarily defines, or at least restricts, the choice of a money manager. In summary, using the  architecture, selected risk categories need not be associated with predefined allocations or money managers. Hence, the financial advisor  and investor  have complete flexibility in establishing an appropriate allocation and selecting those money managers to manage the SMCA in accordance with the selected allocations. Therefore, if the selected risk category is a low risk category, i.e. a category appropriate for an investor with a low risk tolerance, the asset allocation could, for example, be established at 50, 51, or 52% for fixed income investment and 48, 49, or 50% for value investment. On the other hand, if the selected risk category is a higher risk category, i.e. a category appropriate for an investor with a higher risk tolerance, the category might have an asset allocation of 70 or 71 or 72% growth investment and 28, 29, or 30% fixed income investment. Since there is no need using the architecture of  to limit the selection of asset allocations to a limited number of predetermined allocations, the investment advisor  and investor  have complete flexibility to select those allocations with which the investor will be most comfortable, although the architecture of  may facilitate the process by proposing one or more \u201cstandard\u201d allocations. Furthermore, because the architecture of  does not require that only a limited number of predefined products be offered, the investor  and financial advisor  are also given the complete flexibility to select whatever styles and money managers to manage the portion of the SMCA to be traded in the selected style, although, again, the architecture of  may facilitate the process by proposing a number of \u201cstandard\u201d styles or money managers that may be associated with one or more products. This results in the most suitable allocations, styles and money managers being utilized to meet the personal needs of the investor .","The ability to customize allocations provides the financial advisor  and investor  with the ability to establish allocations which are right for the individual investor. Thus, using the architecture of , each individual investor may have a custom allocation which is different from other investors in the same risk category. Rather than being limited to a finite number of standard allocations, typically  to , the financial advisor  and investor  can choose from a substantially larger, i.e., multiple orders of magnitude number of allocation, style, and money manager combination alternatives. This in turn requires that the architecture of  be capable of monitoring drift, rebalancing and performing other functions on many accounts having a virtually unlimited number of variations in their compiled overlay models. That is, by allowing flexibility for each SMCA to have a different risk allocation, the MOM  may need to perform rebalancing, tax efficient trading, loss sale tracking, drift monitoring and cash management on accounts having thousands of different allocations.","Client Account Establishment, Security Identifier Tagging, and Tracking","As shown in , using the system architecture of , the brokerage firm  in step  opens the SMCA for the investor  with the overlay manager, represented by the MOM . The brokerage firm  makes a deposit of cash, credit and\/or securities in step . These deposits could be new assets or assets from a previously opened account of the investor  with brokerage firm .","The money managers A-D - and overlay manager coordinate the combination and incorporation of the style models, i.e. SM-SM shown in , in accordance with the inter-style allocation previously determined, into the COM which is stored in the memory B of the MOM , shown in , in step . In other words, each individual security in the SMCA will be tied to a specific style which is traded in accordance with a particular one of the style models SM-SM included in the COM. Accordingly, the COM can be used to trade securities and all of the individual styles and to otherwise manage the SMCA. Thus, the MOM , by executing the functions A-A can perform all required transactions and management across the entire SMCA. Furthermore, by providing the interface between the MOM  and the MMPMS , each of the individual money managers -, represented by its MMPMS , can perform the functions A-A to transact and otherwise perform management functions on the portion of the SMCA for which that money manager has responsibility.","The MOM  initiates trade orders and otherwise transacts the SMCA for the investor  in accordance with each of the respective style models, i.e. SM-SM, and the inter-style allocation previously determined, compiled to form the COM in steps A-D. As will be discussed further below, these transactions may be directed by the MOM  itself or by an MMPMS  representing the applicable money manager A-D -.","It will be noted that security identifiers within the COM are not tagged, as required in the architecture of . Rather, each position and each transaction is tagged within the SMCA with an appropriate style code as indicated in steps A-D. The appropriate style code will identify the particular style model with which the applicable position or transaction corresponds. That is, if the transaction is directed based on SM, the transaction will be tagged with the style code representing SM and therefore corresponding to a particular style.","As indicated by reference numerals A-D, any purchases or sales of securities for the SMCA are tagged with the appropriate style. Most cash transactions, such as dividends and interest and cash withdrawals, are also tagged with the appropriate style as indicated by reference numerals A-D. Cash transactions that are not tagged are broken up proportionally based on a cash allocation found in the COM. Thus, all cash is associated with a particular style.","The tagged cash and securities positions and transactions are used, for example, when executing the generate SMCA style statements function A, and the generate SMCA statement function A, to generate true style performance for each style within the SMCA as well as for the total SMCA. That is, the MOM  can compute accurate performance at both the style level and full account level for the SMCA. Such accurate performance computation can be for a style or the full SMCA on a total market value basis, securities only basis, or cash only basis. It will be recalled that although the MOM  of the  architecture could compute accurate performance of the total account on a full market value, securities only, or cash only basis, and an accurate individual style performance on a securities only basis. On the other hand, the AMOM \u2032 in the  architecture was only capable of compiling the individual reports generated by each MMPMS  into a total account report. Thus, the architecture of  allows accurate reporting at both the style and total account levels without the need for multiple trading accounts as required in the  architecture.","Thus, as indicated in steps A-D, the cash performance is included in the style-level performance calculations. The security performance is also tracked on a style basis in steps A-D. The determined cash and securities performance are combined in steps A-D to give accurate market value performance at the style level for each of the styles -. In step , the individual style performances are combined to provide a total accurate performance for the entire SMCA. As will be understood, the processor A of the MOM  can, if so desired, selectively combine style cash performance computations to calculate the cash performance for the total SMCA or security performance across the various styles to calculate the securities performance across the total SMCA, by executing the generate SMCA statement function A in the processor  of MOM .","The MOM  may track the desired performance during the lifetime of the SMCA or during a more limited performance period window.","It should also be noted that using the  architecture, accurate performance can be computed, and therefore tracked and reported, at both the total account and style level, without restricting money managers from including the same types of securities in multiple of the style models, i.e. more than one of SM-SM, as in the  architecture, or without requiring compilation of reports associated with multiple trading accounts as in the  architecture.","Drift Rebalancing",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0273","num":"0272"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 18","FIG. 17"],"b":["1050","1","1050","1050","1124","1124","1140","1036","1050","1050","1036","1","1036","1036","1036"]},"If rebalancing of the SMCA to the security allocation within a particular style is selected in step , in step  the processor A, or the processor A in the case of rebalancing at the request of a particular money manager, will identify all securities with drift within the style of interest. If the rebalancing is being performed by the MMPMS , the processor A will next execute the generate SMCA style trade directive with tag function A to direct the initiation of trade orders for all securities to rebalance the SMCA to the security allocation within the style in step . Whether the rebalancing is being performed by the MMPMS  or the MOM , the processor A, of MOM , will then execute the generate trade order with tag function A to generate the trade orders in accordance with the received directives to initiate trading of all the identified securities to rebalance the SMCA to the security allocation within the applicable style. As has been previously discussed, the trade orders will be forwarded to the brokerage firm  for execution.","On the other hand, if rebalancing of the SMCA to the style allocation is selected in step , a further selection of the type of rebalancing trigger, for example based on either cash or total allocation, must be made in step . The selection may also be made by the overlay manager entering an input identifying the type of rebalancing trigger desired. Alternatively, the processor A may be programmed to automatically select a particular type of rebalancing trigger based upon one or more predetermined factors. In either event, a selection of either rebalancing the style allocation or rebalancing of the total SMCA securities allocation is performed in step .","If rebalancing to the style allocation is selected in step , the securities in the SMCA with the greatest drift from the security allocations in the COM are identified in step . In step , some or all of the identified securities are selected for trading to rebalance the SMCA to the across style security allocation. It should be noted that the securities selected for trading are limited to only those required to attain style allocation. If the selected type of total allocation rebalancing is securities, all securities in the SMCA with drift from the security allocations in the COM are identified in step . In step  all of the identified securities are selected for trading to rebalance the SMCA to the securities allocation. It should be noted here that all of the securities that have drifted are selected for trading if the selected type of total allocation rebalancing is based on securities. Thus, the selection made in step  will determine whether all securities having drift are traded or if only the minimum number of required trades of securities necessary to return the SMCA to the proper style allocation will be performed. The processor A of MOM  then executes the generate trade order with tag function A in step  to initiate trade orders for the selected securities to rebalance the SMCA to the applicable allocation. The generated trade orders are executed by the brokerage firm .","After execution of the trade orders, the across style cash allocation must also be rebalanced. Accordingly, in step , the processor A of the MOM  executes the rebalance SMCA function A to move cash within the SMCA between styles to rebalance the SMCA cash allocation across styles. The processor A also executes the SMCA tag transaction function A to tag these increments of cash in step .","If, in step , the cash rebalancing trigger is selected, a further selection of the type of cash drift rebalancing trigger is next performed in step . The selection may be performed by the overlay manager entering an input which identifies a desired type of cash rebalancing, or by programming the processor A to make an automated selection of the type of cash rebalancing based upon predetermined factors. Based upon the selection, either cash rebalancing against the COM cash allocation or cash rebalancing based on the SMCA current market value will be performed.","Assuming that cash rebalancing based upon the COM allocation is selected, in step , the processor A executes the rebalance SMCA function A to identify the total SMCA cash drift versus the COM cash allocation. If on the other hand, cash drift rebalancing based on the SMCA total market value is selected in step , the processor A executes the rebalance SMCA function A, in step , to identify the total cash drift versus the SMCA current market value. The processor A then continues with step , which has been previously described, to select the type of rebalancing which will be performed. The processor A further performs steps -, as applicable and discussed above, to transact the SMCA to reduce or eliminate the identified cash and securities drift.","As noted earlier, a number of different events could trigger the rebalancing described in . For example, rebalancing might be required due to a change in the COM which creates a drift in the SMCA as compared to the modified COM. Rebalancing might also be required as a result of a deposit or withdrawal from the SMCA. Such deposits and withdrawals may, if desired, automatically trigger a rebalancing of the SMCA back to the COM by the MOM . Rebalancing could additionally be required due to market fluctuations. Such fluctuations could be tracked and, if desired, automatically trigger a rebalancing of the SMCA back to the COM. Rebalancing for market fluctuation could also be performed periodically, if so desired.","It should be noted that because duplicate securities may reside in the SMCA in multiple different styles, the computation of security drift would in all cases be performed on a style-by-style basis. For instance, if IBM shares are held in the SMCA in two different styles, two different security drift computations must be made to determine if the IBM securities in the SMCA vary from the IBM security allocation in the COM.","As shown in , if the SMCA is to be rebalanced to the across style allocation and the rebalancing is to be performed on a style allocation basis, the processor A will initiate trade orders re-aligning the SMCA to the original style value allocation in the COM. Not every type of security will necessarily be traded. Rather, preferably only those securities having the largest drift are traded to bring the security allocation for each style back in line with the security allocation of the COM. This may result in some securities within the SMCA remaining untraded. However, if desired, the processor A may be configured to trade every security in the SMCA to the proper allocation as set forth in the COM. This of course will result in more trading, but will more accurately rebalance the security drift within the SMCA.","In summary, if rebalancing is performed by executing steps  and , or by selecting the securities allocation from options presented in , more accurate rebalancing will be performed and less security drift will result, but will require more trading and may have a higher cost to the investor. On the other hand, if the rebalancing is performed by selecting style rebalancing in step , somewhat less accurate rebalancing will result, and only the style allocations will be rebalanced: however, with less trades being required and potentially less cost to the investor. Thus, the MOM  provides the overlay manager with three options to rebalance the SMCA, one of which minimizes trades and cost to the investor but provides somewhat less accurate results, and the others which provides a more accurate rebalancing by initiating more trades at a somewhat greater cost to the investor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0284","num":"0283"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 18"],"b":["1142","1144","1142","1144","1036","1036","1"]},"As depicted in , if the SMCA is rebalanced to the security allocation within a particular style, the portion of the COM stored in the memory B of the MOM  which is associated with that style is compared to the securities in the SMCA stored in the database C of the MOM  in step  of .

The type of distribution may be based on either the COM model asset allocation  or a current actual asset allocation in the SMCA which is determined in step  can be read from SMCA, and shown as the SMCA determined asset allocation .","If cash allocation distribution is selected, the processor A will distribute the deposit in accordance with the COM model cash allocation . As shown, this will result in 30% of the deposit being allocated to style in the SMCA, 20% to style in the SMCA, 40% to style in the SMCA and 10% to style in the SMCA.

The processor A next compares, in step , the determined asset allocation to the COM model asset allocation. The COM model asset allocation  is identical to the COM model asset allocation  discussed above. The processor A will now compute the cash distribution and withdrawals to rebalance the SMCA to the COM based on the comparison performed in step . Thus, as indicated, a distribution  requires S dollars be deposited to style of the SMCA, O dollars to style of the SMCA and T dollars to both style and style of the SMCA.","If an ad hoc distribution is selected, the processor A will, typically based upon an input from the overlay manager, identify an ad hoc allocation distribution for the SMCA in step . As shown, a distribution  with W dollars being deposited in style of the SMCA, X dollars being deposited in style of the SMCA, Y dollars being deposited in style of the SMCA and Z dollars being deposited in style of the SMCA is identified by the processor A based upon the input of the overlay manager or financial advisor or other source.","It should be noted that the process described with reference to  can be reversed for withdrawals. However, in the case of withdrawals, if the withdrawal to rebalance asset allocation is selected, cash withdrawals would be taken from the over weighted styles first in an attempt to bring the SMCA back in line with the COM.","Specific cash deposits and withdrawals would be tagged with the appropriate style and reflected in the SMCA. For example, in , the SMCA shows a deposit in style of $100.00 on Feb. 27, 2003. For each style with a DCASH identifier tagged with the appropriate style number in the SMCA. These deposits could then be traded or would be included in the cash portion of the market value of the style within the SMCA to which it has been tagged.

As for example shown in , the SMCA includes what may be characterized as a \u201ccash bucket\u201d for each style for entry of the allocated deposited funds. Deposited and withdrawn funds are not tagged, so the amounts (positions) shown in the lower entry or \u201ccash buckets\u201d of the SMCA will sometimes be referred to as untagged cash.","Untagged cash withdrawals from an individual style in the SMCA are subtracted from the untagged cash deposits. This results in the untagged cash values shown in each of the lower four entries in the exemplary SMCA of . It is perhaps worth emphasizing here that untagged deposits and withdrawals are those deposits to and withdrawals from the SMCA itself. That is, untagged deposits and withdrawals reflect the free flow of cash into and out of the SMCA rather than cash flows between styles within the SMCA. For example, cash flows resulting from a purchase or sale of shares of a security for a particular style within the SMCA are considered tagged, but the sale of a security that did not belong to any style, e.g. a security left over from an old account, will result in untagged cash that is split among styles based on the COM cash allocation.","As shown in , the untagged cash balance, such as that set forth in the bottom four entries of the exemplary SMCA is now modified by any dividends, interest or other tagged flows into or out of the specific style of interest within the SMCA. More particularly, dividends, interest and other flows are added or subtracted to the untagged cash balance to obtain a cash balance for both untagged and tagged funds which have flowed into and out of the particular style in the SMCA.","For example, if a dividend is paid on shares of the security, such as IBM, held in the style on a certain date, that cash dividend will be distributed to that particular style within the SMCA. Thus, as shown in , the exemplary SMCA includes a dividend paid on IBM shares which has been distributed proportionally to styles  and  within the SMCA, as identified by the \u201cIBMDIV\u201d and \u201cIBMDIV\u201d entries in the SMCA. The entry of dividends from IBM shares in two styles reflects the fact that IBM shares were held on the dividend date in both style and style of the SMCA.","The exemplary SMCA shown in  also indicates interest flows to each of style-style. These interest flows are identified by \u201cINTEREST\u201d, \u201cINTEREST\u201d, \u201cINTEREST\u201d, and \u201cINTEREST\u201d. It should be recognized that although the interest entries in  reflect deposits of interest payments to the SMCA, interest payments out of the account would be similarly reflected but with the cash amounts being enclosed in parentheses to indicate a debit rather than a credit.","Other tag flows could, for example, include the removal of cash from one style to another for any number of reasons, including rebalancing. In the exemplary SMCA shown in , a flow of cash from style to stylet is indicated by the two tagged transactions characterized as \u201cWCASH\u201d \u201cDCASH\u201d.","After computing the tagged and untagged cash balance, any further modifications to the computed balance are made to reflect purchases and\/or sales of shares of securities from the style of interest in the SMCA. Hence, the funds obtained from the sale of shares of securities from the style of interest in the SMCA are added to the untagged and tagged cash balance, and the funds required for purchases of security shares for the style are subtracted form the untagged and tagged cash balance to compute a total cash balance for the style in the SMCA. For example, if a purchase of IBM shares has been made, or if a trade order to purchase IBM shares has been generated, the funds for this purchase can be subtracted from the untagged and tagged cash balance to compute the total cash balance for the style. Similarly, if a sale of IBM shares has been consummated, or an order for the sale of such shares initiated, the untagged and tagged cash balance can be modified to reflect the cash returned to the SMCA as a result of the sale.","As shown in the exemplary SMCA of , the cash in style has increased as a result of a sale of GM shares. This sale has been characterized in the SMCA of  as \u201cSGM\u201d. A purchase of IBM securities for style of the SMCA is also reflected in . The purchase is characterized by the \u201cPIBM\u201d entry.","In summary, a processor A of the MOM , by executing the generate SMCA statement function A, can compute an accurate cash balance for each style within the SMCA reflecting both deposits and withdrawals into and out of the SMCA as well as the dividends, interest, other flows, and purchases and sales of securities within individual styles reflected in the SMCA.","It is perhaps worth noting here that the processor A of the MOM  can easily flow funds between the different styles within the SMCA without any need to interface with the client account being maintained by the brokerage firm (CA) or the custodial client account (CCA) maintained by the custodian, which need only maintain total untagged positions in cash and securities. Hence, the MOM  can, at the discretion of the overlay manager or based on any desired factors, flow cash from one style to another style independent of the brokerage firm and custodian for any desired purpose. Thus, unlike in the architecture of , movements of cash are performed without the need to enter a withdrawal and corresponding deposit within a single CA or CCA, or between independent but related CAs or CCAs managed trading account. The architecture of  of course does not provide for cash flows between different styles within the master client account (MCA) since only a single cash bucket for the entire MCA is maintained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0342","num":"0341"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["1050","1050"]},"As shown in , the COM  allocates equally between the four models forming COM . Thus, the four styles, i.e. style-style, within the SMCA  receive equal allocations.","However, as shown, the market value of each of the individual styles within the SMCA has changed over time. Style and style are perfectly aligned with their style model, i.e., SM and SM, allocations, as can be seen by comparing the individual style current market values against the style targets in . However, style and style are now out of alignment with their style model, i.e. SM and SM, allocations.","Therefore, style is under weighted by $10,000.00 in total ($5,000.00 in securities and $5,000.00 in cash). Style is over weighted by $10,000.00 (all $10,000.00 in securities). Thus, it is at a minimum desirable to purchase $5,000.00 in securities for style and to sell $10,000.00 in securities from style. This will result in style and style both having $245,000.00 in securities.","However, style, which began with a zero cash balance, will have a ($5,000.00) cash balance as a result of the purchase of the securities. On the other hand, style, which began with a $5,000.00 cash balance will now have a $15,000.00 cash balance as a result of the sale of securities. Therefore, the processor A of MOM  will, preferably in an overnight process, flow $5,000.00 from style to style within the SMCA, thereby resulting in style having a zero cash balance and style having a $10,000.00 cash balance. This will also result in each of the styles, i.e. style-style, having securities in line with the target security allocation in the COM of 98%, i.e. $245,000.00.

It will also be understood that other techniques for moving cash to rebalance the SMCA can be performed as previously described.","Rebalancing Style Allocations in Multiple Single Managed Client Accounts (SMCAs)","As discussed above with reference to , using the  architecture, the initial allocations are set and money manager selected based on a selected risk category for the investor.  depict a COM , which could serve as the COM shown in , having the initial allocation , or across the styles . The styles correspond to style-style depicted in . An exemplary computation of security drift and determination as to whether or not rebalancing is required will be described below with reference to .","As shown, the COM  has an allocation  of 40% value, for 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap. The master overlay manager (MOM) , as shown in , opens a first of the SMCAs to be managed under the COM at the designated allocation. Hence, SMCA for investor , identified with reference numeral , is opened on a particular date, referred to as day one, with the styles  and an actual allocation  of 40% value, 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap. As time lapses, the allocations between these four styles in the SMCA for investor  will fluctuate as indicated by block . The values of the securities within the individual styles will move in line with the stock market or other fluctuations. We will assume, for purposes of this example, that after thirty days, the actual allocations A for styles  in SMCA for investor  fluctuate to 45% value, 28% growth, 17% small cap, and 10% large cap.","The processor A of the MOM , executes the cross style drift function A to determine in step  if rebalancing of the COM  is required. For example, the threshold previously discussed with reference to , A and B could, if desired, be utilized in determining whether or not to rebalance the COM . If it is determined that no rebalancing is required, no further action is taken as indicated in step . If however, rebalancing is required, the processor A executes function A to determine if rebalancing of the COM or SMCA is required in step . Rebalancing of the COM is performed in step .","As shown in , this results in a rebalanced COM A having styles  but with a modified allocation corresponding to the actual allocation of the SMCA on day thirty. Hence, as shown in , the rebalanced COM A on day thirty has an allocation of 45% value, 28% growth, 17% small cap, and 10% large cap.","Referring again to , on day thirty, another SMCA, i.e. SMCA, is opened for another investor, i.e. an investor other than investor . The funds or other assets deposited at the time of opening the SMCA are allocated in accordance with the modified allocation A in the rebalanced COM A shown in . Hence, as shown in , the initial deposit for SMCA is allocated in accordance with the rebalanced COM A allocation A. Therefore, the initial deposit is allocated at 45% value, 28% growth, 17% small cap, and 10% large cap.","It should be recognized that by rebalancing the COM allocation for fluctuations in the actual account allocation of SMCA, and using the modified allocation in the rebalanced COM for allocations to newly opened accounts, rebalancing of each of the multiple SMCAs being managed in accordance with a single COM allocation can be avoided. This in turn substantially reduces the number of trades required across the multiple SMCAs and thus, the cost to the investors for whom the SMCAs are maintained.","As time continues to pass, further market fluctuations and\/or account activity fluctuations will occur in the currently managed SMCAs for the multiple investors. For example, as shown in , on day sixty, SMCA and SMCA have further fluctuated. Accordingly, the actual allocation in each of SMCA and SMCA has fluctuated to 50% value, 20% growth, 15% small cap, and 15% large cap. Accordingly, a further rebalanced COM B is generated with an across style allocation corresponding to that of the SMCAs currently being managed. Accordingly, as shown in , the rebalanced COM B on day sixty has an allocation B with 50% value, 20% growth, 15% small cap, and 15% large cap.","Hence, as fluctuations occur between day thirty and day sixty as indicated in step  of , the SMCAs on day sixty, i.e. SMCA B and SMCA A, have actual allocations  and SMCA and A and SMCA, which are different than the actual allocation in these accounts on day thirty. Accordingly, the processor A of MOM  will again execute the necessary functionality to perform steps  to determine if rebalancing is required, and if so, step  to determine if the COM or SMCAs are to be rebalanced. In this case, the processor A has again determined to rebalance the COM and therefore executes step .","However, had the processor A in step  determined that rebalancing of the SMCAs was now required, in step , the current rebalanced COM A is rebalanced to the original COM allocation of COM . Accordingly, as shown in , on day sixty the COM is again rebalanced to have an allocation of 40% value, 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap, as indicated by allocation  and COM C. The SMCAs are now rebalanced by the processor A by executing the rebalance SMCA function A, to rebalance all of the SMCAs for all investors to the original COM allocation, in step . As shown in , the actual allocation of both SMCA and SMCA are rebalanced on day sixty to the allocations in COM C, i.e. the original COM allocation. Accordingly, SMCA and SMCA will be rebalanced to have 40% value, 30% growth, 20% small cap, and 10% large cap. Thus, if the processor A selects the rebalance SMCAs in step  on day sixty, all of the SMCAs being managed under the same COM will be transacted to be in line with the original COM allocation .","It should be understood that although in the example shown in , the rebalancing of the SMCA and SMCA has brought these accounts exactly into line with the original COM allocation in COM C, as has been previously discussed, the rebalancing may be performed such that the resulting actual allocation in SMCA and SMCA are only transacted to more closely, but not exactly, align with the original COM allocation. Further, it will be recognized that using the technique described above, the amount of required trading to rebalance the actual SMCA allocations to the COM allocation can be significantly decreased and hence the cost and efforts required in managing multiple accounts under thousands of different COM allocations can also be drastically reduced. The above-described process may be performed on a regular periodic basis, such daily or monthly. The process may also be performed at the discretion of the overlay manager.","As will also be understood, using the above technique, each account which is opened will have the same, or approximately the same, allocation. Therefore, less rebalancing of the SMCAs is required, resulting in less trading and less cost. Furthermore, because of the reduced trading, there is less likelihood of the investor being subjected negative tax consequences.","The processor A of the MOM  may rebalance the COM to the original allocations based on any desired factors or at the discretion of the overlay manager. For example, the rebalancing of the COM to the original allocation may be performed periodically or on the basis of a threshold variation of the actual allocation in the SMCAs to a predefined tolerance, or based on other factors. All of the SMCAs then being managed in accordance that COM can now be easily rebalanced back to the original allocation. In a practical implementation this will typically result in the avoidance of trading due to minor fluctuations within the SMCAs. Furthermore, the overlay manager, represented by the MOM  is given the flexibility to dynamically rebalance the COM to thereby reduce the trading within the SMCAs.","Netting Security Transactions",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0361","num":"0360"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 31"],"b":["1050","1050","18","1290","1050","1050","20","1292","14"]},"The processor A of the MOM  executes the generate trade order function A to process the request.

The processor A then determines, in step , if trade order initiation is required.","If the values of X and Y are equal it will be unnecessary to initiate a trade order. Accordingly, the processor A will proceed by transacting the SMCA in step . In this case, transacting the SMCA will result in a transfer out of X shares of KO securities from style of the SMCA and transfer in of those same securities to style of the SMCA. Accordingly, in this particular example, step  corresponds to steps A and B of . As indicated in step , the processor A transfers out X shares of KO from style of the SMCA and in step  transfers in the same X shares of KO securities to style to fulfill the requests of money manager A  and money manager B . As shown in the SMCA of , entries corresponding to the transfer out of fifty shares of KO securities is entered in the SMCA with the identifier \u201cTOKO\u201d. The transfer of the same securities to style of the SMCA is entered in the SMCA using the identifier \u201cTIKO\u201d.","If the value of X is either greater than or less than the value of Y, initiation of a trade order will be required. Accordingly, in step , the processor A in accordance with the execution of the generate trade order function A shown in , determines if a wash sale violation will occur by executing the SMCA wash sales function A. More particularly, a determination will be made if KO shares have been previously sold within the violation period at a loss. If so, the overlay manager is notified by the MOM in step . If not, the processor A proceeds to transact the SMCA in step . In step  all, or less than all, of the X shares of KO stock are transferred out of style of the SMCA. In step , the same shares are transferred in to style of the SMCA. In step , the processor A generates a trade order to either sell any untransferred shares of KO securities from style of the SMCA, if the value of X is greater than the value of Y. On the other hand, if the value of Y is greater than the value of X, the processor A will generate a trade order for the purchase of additional shares of KO securities which when added to the X shares transferred to style will result in style having an additional Y shares of KO securities. The trade order is forwarded to the brokerage firm  and executed by the brokerage firm in step  as shown in .","Here again, the transfer out and transfer in of the shares of KO securities are entered in the SMCA as has been previously discussed. Furthermore, a purchase entry or sale entry for any shares associated with a trade order would also be entered using an SKOor TKOindicator.","Thus, by performing the above-described processing the MOM  avoids the initiation of unnecessary trades. Furthermore, the original cost basis of the KO securities transferred out of style of the SMCA is preserved. However, cash in the amount of the current fair market value of the transferred securities will be moved to style of the SMCA from the cash balance in style of the SMCA. Furthermore, if the shares in style have lost value with respect to the original purchase price, there is no sale which could subsequently result in a wash sale violation. To the extent that no trade order is initiated, the client account (CA) maintained at the brokerage firm and the custodian client account (CCA) maintained by the custodian are unaffected by the netting of the requested trades.","As described above, the architecture depicted in  allows for a single managed client account to be maintained for an investor, as in the architecture of , but returns the ability to manage relevant portions of the account back to the individual money managers. Thus, the money managers perform functions similar to those performed in the architectures of , but without the need for multiple managed trading accounts.","Using the architecture of , each money manager can direct the transacting of a relevant portion of a single managed client account, can make adjustments to the portion of the SMCA for which they are responsible, rebalance the applicable portion of the SMCA and generate accurate performance statements for both cash and securities for the applicable portion of the SMCA.
