abstract: A segmented patch antenna has a dielectric material substrate, a plurality of primary electrically conductive segments consecutively disposed on the dielectric material substrate and spaced apart so that a portion of the substrate is exposed between any pair of adjacent primary segments, and a layer of dielectric material disposed over the primary segments. Secondary electrically conductive segments are disposed over the layer of dielectric material wherein each secondary segment corresponds to a pair of adjacent primary segments. Each secondary segment overlaps a portion of each primary segment of the corresponding pair of adjacent primary segments to which that secondary segments corresponds. The overlap of each secondary segment with a portion of each primary segment in a pair of adjacent primary segments produces a plurality of capacitive gaps that capacitively couple the primary and secondary segments together to define a single antenna.

Such a microstrip patch antenna suffers from limited bandwidth as a result of its resonant properties. Bandwidth of patch antennas is typically limited to 1\u20133% of the antenna's center frequency. This characteristic is due to the resonant properties of the antenna.","The prior art discloses several antenna structures. Yu U.S. Pat. No. 4,218,682 and Josypenko U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,406 disclose wideband antennas that are formed by stacking several resonant antennas on top of each other. Pouwels et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,708,444 and Derneryd et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,091,365 disclose array antennas that consist of a multitude of identical antenna elements, each of which being resonant, arranged in a regular grid pattern. Faraone et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,933,115 discloses a planar antenna with patch radiators for wide bandwidth. The planar antenna utilizes a primary resonant patch and a smaller, resonant, parasitic element that is located near the primary resonant patch. Croq U.S. Pat. No. 5,497,164 discloses a multilayer radiating structure of variable directivity (i.e., gain). The actual radiating elements are arranged in a regular grid pattern. All of these prior art antenna systems and structures involve resonant structures. Specifically, the radiating elements themselves are all resonant devices.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved microstrip patch antenna that has improved bandwidth characteristics.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a microstrip patch antenna that does not support a resonant mode.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a microstrip patch antenna that has improved bandwidth characteristics for a variety of antenna applications.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the ensuing description.","Thus, the present invention is directed to a microstrip patch antenna that comprises a grounded dielectric material substrate, a plurality of primary electrically conductive segments consecutively disposed on the dielectric material substrate and spaced apart so that a portion of the dielectric material substrate is exposed between any pair of adjacent primary electrically conductive segments. The microstrip patch antenna further comprises a layer of dielectric material disposed over the plurality of primary electrically conductive segments and a plurality of secondary electrically conductive segments disposed over the layer of dielectric material wherein each secondary electrically conductive segment corresponds to a pair of adjacent primary electrically conductive segments. Each secondary electrically conductive segment is positioned over the exposed portion of the dielectric material substrate that is located between the adjacent primary electrically conductive segments. Each secondary electrically conductive segment overlaps a portion of the corresponding pair of adjacent primary electrically conductive segments. The overlap of each secondary segment with a portion of each primary segment in a pair of adjacent primary segments produces a plurality of capacitive gaps that capacitively couple the primary and secondary segments together to define a single antenna. A feedline is electrically connected to a first one of the plurality of primary segments.","The microstrip patch antenna of the present invention enhances bandwidth by reducing the resonant effects of the antenna. The microstrip patch antenna of the present invention does not have any portion or components that support a resonant mode. Thus, the primary and secondary electrically conductive segments and the feed structure do not support a resonant mode. The microstrip patch antenna of the present invention does not utilize parasitic elements and does not use capacitive coupling to connect the antenna structure to the feedline which is typically done in prior art patent antenna systems. In the microstrip patch antenna of the present invention, capacitive gaps are used to connect the individual segments into a single antenna.","Referring to , there is shown microstrip patch antenna  of the present invention. Microstrip patch antenna  comprises substrate  of grounded dielectric material. The material from which substrate  is fabricated depends upon the frequency of operation. Suitable materials that can be used to fabricate substrate  include Teflon\u2122, FR4 and Duroid. Preferably, substrate  is generally planar and is substantially rectangular shape. Microstrip patch antenna  further comprises N primary segments  of electrically conductive material that are disposed over substrate . In a preferred embodiment, each primary segment  is configured as single strip or piece of metal that has a substantially flat or planar top surface. In one embodiment, primary segments  are plated onto substrate  in accordance with techniques known in the art. Preferably, the metal selected for use in fabricating primary segments  has excellent electrical conductivity characteristics. Examples of metals for fabricating each primary segment  include copper and silver. In an alternate embodiment, vapor deposited aluminum may be used to fabricate each primary segment .  shows substrate  having primary segments  plated thereon. Each primary segment  has a width \u0394X. Primary segments  are spaced apart by distance that is substantially the same as \u0394X. Consequently, a portion of dielectric material substrate  is exposed between any pair of adjacent primary segments . For example, a portion A of substrate  is exposed between adjacent primary segments A and B. In another example, a portion B of substrate  is exposed between adjacent primary segments B and C. The actual number N of primary segments depends upon the desired operational characteristics of antenna . In a preferred embodiment, the number N of primary segments is 5 or more segments.","Referring to , patch antenna  further comprises a relatively thin layer or sheet  of dielectric material that is disposed over primary segments . In a preferred embodiment, layer  is fabricated from the same material used to fabricate substrate . In one embodiment, layer  is adhered to primary segments  with a suitable adhesive. Other suitable techniques can be used to dispose layer  over the primary segments . Layer  of dielectric material has a predetermined thickness that depends upon the desired operational characteristics of patch antenna .","Antenna  includes feedline  that is electrically connected to first primary segment A. In one embodiment, feedline  is configured as a microstrip feedline. In an alternate embodiment, feedline  is configured as a coaxial probe.","Referring to , ,  and , patch antenna  further comprises N\u22121 secondary segments  of electrically conductive material that are disposed over layer  of dielectric material. In accordance with the invention, each secondary segment  has a width that is greater than width \u0394X of each primary segment . In a preferred embodiment, each secondary segment  is configured as single strip or piece of metal that has a substantially flat or planar top surface. In one embodiment, secondary segments  are plated onto layer  of dielectric material in accordance with techniques known in the art. Preferably, the metal selected for use in fabricating secondary segments  has excellent electrical conductivity characteristics. Suitable metals for fabricating each secondary segment  include copper and silver. In an alternate embodiment, vapor deposited aluminum is used to fabricate each secondary segment . Each secondary segment  corresponds to a pair of adjacent primary segments  and is positioned over the exposed portion of substrate  that is between those adjacent primary segments . Each secondary segment  overlaps a portion of each primary segment  in the pair of adjacent primary segments  to which the secondary segment  corresponds. Thus, for example, secondary segment A is disposed over layer  such that secondary segment A is located over the exposed portion A of substrate  that is between primary segments A and B and overlaps a portion of primary segment A and primary segment B (see ). The overlapping of a portion of secondary segment A with the portion of primary segment A cooperates with layer  to form capacitive gap  (see ). Similarly, the overlapping of a portion of secondary segment A with a portion of primary segment B cooperates with layer  to form capacitive gap . Other capacitive gaps are formed in the same manner by the overlapping of secondary segments  with portions of primary segments . In accordance with the invention, these capacitive gaps capacitively couple together the primary and secondary segments  and , respectively, to form a segmented patch that is indicated by reference numeral  in . The capacitance of each gap  is controlled by the amount of overlap of each secondary segment  with corresponding portions of primary segments . The vertical distance or gap between primary segment  and overlapping secondary segment  is indicated by letter H in . The vertical distance H remains constant and therefore is the same for each gap . The distance H is primarily determined by the thickness of layer  and any adhesive used to adhere layer  to primary segments . In accordance with the invention, the capacitances formed at each capacitive gap (e.g. capacitive gaps , ) are chosen to reduce the resonant properties of antenna  over the passband of interest. The capacitances at the capacitive gaps decrease exponentially from one electrically conductive segment to the next electrically conductive segment and is represented by formula (1):\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwherein Cis the capacitance of the first capacitive gap  and \u03b1 is a real parameter referred to as the taper factor. Thus, the capacitance of the subsequent capacitive gaps decrease as one moves in a direction away from feedline . Consequently, the magnitude of the current wave on antenna  is reduced as the current wave travels along patch  and reduces the formation of a resonant standing wave on microstrip patch antenna .\n","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the capacitance of the capacitive gap  is selected so that its capacitive reactance at the lowest desired frequency of operation is no more than about one tenth of the characteristic impdence of the atenna  if it is treated as a transmission line. This impedence is determined by the width of the patch , the thickness of the lower dielectric substrate , and the substrate's  dielectric constant.","It is to be understood that the drawing figures are for illustrative purposes only and shall not be interpreted as limiting the number of primary segments  or secondary segments  to that shown in the figures. The actual number of primary and secondary segments depends upon the desired operational parameters of patch antenna  of the present invention.","Referring to , segmented patch  has an overall length L and a width W. Width W is defined by the individual length of primary segments . The overall length L of patch  is determined by formula (2):\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwherein L is the overall length of patch , N is the number of primary segments , \u0394X is the width of each individual primary segment  and the width of the space between each adjacent pair of primary segments .\n","A microstrip patch antenna, in accordance with the invention, was constructed in accordance with the parameters shown in Table I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE I"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Length L of Segmented Patch","31.0 mm"]},{"entry":[{},"Width W of Segmented Patch","19.0 mm"]},{"entry":[{},"Thickness of Duroid Substrate","2.0 mm"]},{"entry":[{},"Thickness H of Dielectric Layer","0.05 mm"]},{"entry":[{},"Bandcenter","6.0 GHz"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of Primary Segments","11"]},{"entry":[{},"Number of Secondary Segments","10"]},{"entry":[{},"Capacitance of First Capacitive Gap","20.7 pF"]},{"entry":[{},"Taper Factor","20\/mm"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["30","40","17"],"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"None of the components or portions of microstrip patch antenna  utilize or support a resonant mode. Thus, primary segments , secondary segments  and feedline  do not support a resonant mode. Patch antenna  of the present invention does not utilize parasitic elements and does not use capacitive coupling to connect the antenna structure to the feedline which is typically done in prior art patch antennae. The capacitive gaps (e.g. capacitive gap ) that are used to connect together the individual primary and secondary segments  and , respectively, also produce a current distribution that is tapered, thereby suppressing the current standing wave on the antenna as well as the resonant nature of the antenna. The patch antenna of the present invention achieves significantly enhanced bandwidth without increasing the thickness of the antenna or degrading the efficiency of the patch antenna.","In an alternate embodiment; primary segments  are printed on substrate . In such an embodiment, layer  is adhered to the printed primary segments and secondary segments  are disposed over layer  by any suitable technique.","The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification.
