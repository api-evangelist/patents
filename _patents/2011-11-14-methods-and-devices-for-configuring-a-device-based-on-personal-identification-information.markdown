{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application relates to methods and systems for application management and configuration, and more particularly to methods and electronic devices for configuring an electronic device based on personal identification information.","Electronic devices are sometimes preloaded with software. Some preloaded software, such as operating system software, may provide basic functions on the electronic device such as the ability to execute other applications, control peripherals, etc.","Additional applications which expand the functionality of the electronic device may also be preloaded on the electronic device. By way of example, electronic devices are sometimes preloaded with one or more instant messaging applications. The instant messaging application(s) may allow a user of the electronic device to engage in instant messaging (IM) with users of other electronic devices . Preloading applications may be convenient for a user since it provides for expanded functionality on the electronic device; however, a user may not use all preloaded applications. Thus, preloading applications may unnecessarily occupy resources (such as memory) of an electronic device.","Electronic devices typically allow a user of an electronic device to install additional applications on the electronic device. That is, a user may manually load applications onto the electronic device. Loading such applications onto the electronic device may be time consuming for a user and may also occupy resources (such as wireless bandwidth, battery power, etc.) while a user locates, and possibly downloads and installs such applications.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","In one example aspect, the present application describes a method implemented by a processor of an electronic device. The method includes: obtaining personal identification information in a first application; and based on the personal identification information and one or more predetermined rules, determining if a second application should be loaded onto the electronic device.","In another example aspect, the present application describes an electronic device. The electronic device includes a memory and a processor coupled with the memory. The processor is configured to: obtain personal identification information in a first application; and based on the personal identification information and one or more predetermined rules, determine if a second application should be loaded onto the electronic device.","In yet another example aspect, the present application describes a method implemented by a processor of an electronic device. The method includes: obtaining personal identification information in a first application; and configuring a second application based on the personal identification information obtained in the first application.","Other example embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.","Example embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to any particular operating system, mobile device architecture, server architecture or computer programming language.","Example Electronic Device","Reference is first made to  which illustrates an example electronic device . In the illustrated example embodiment, the electronic device  is a communication device, such as a mobile communication device. In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  is a two-way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the electronic device , in various example embodiments the electronic device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a mobile telephone such as a smartphone, a tablet computer such as a slate computer, a wearable computer such as a watch, a PDA (personal digital assistant) or a computer system. In other example embodiments, the electronic device  may be of a type not specifically listed above.","Accordingly, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may be a smartphone. A smartphone is a mobile phone which offers more advanced computing capability than a basic non-smartphone cellular phone. For example, a smartphone may have the ability to run third party applications which are stored on the smartphone.","Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may be a tablet computer. A tablet computer (which may also be referred to as a tablet) is an electronic device  which is generally larger than a mobile phone (such as a smartphone) or personal digital assistant. Many mobile phones or personal digital assistants are designed to be pocket sized. That is, mobile phones or personal digital assistants are generally small enough to be carried by a person easily, often in a shirt or pant pocket while tablet computers are larger and may not fit within pant pockets. For example, many tablet computers have a height which is seven inches (7\u2033) or more. In some example embodiments, the tablet computer may be a slate computer. A slate computer is a tablet computer which does not include a dedicated keyboard. A slate computer may allow for text input through the use of a virtual keyboard or an external keyboard which connects to the slate computer via a wired or wireless connection.","The electronic device  includes a housing (not shown) housing the components of the electronic device . The internal components of the electronic device  are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The electronic device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the electronic device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including input interfaces  (such as a keyboard, one or more control buttons, one or more microphones , and\/or a touch-sensitive overlay associated with a touchscreen display), flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , a data port  (which may be a serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port), one or more output interfaces  (such as a display  (which may be a liquid crystal display (LCD)), one or more speakers , or other output interfaces ), a short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The electronic device  may include a touchscreen display in some example embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller. The touch-sensitive input surface overlays the display  and may be referred to as a touch-sensitive overlay. The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input interface  and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller. That is, the touchscreen display acts as both an input interface  and an output interface .","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the electronic device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver  and transmitter , as is known in the art. The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which electronic device  is intended to operate.","The electronic device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","In some example embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The electronic device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network. The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may include a pointing or navigational tool (input device) such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the electronic device  such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  also includes a removable memory module  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory module interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device  via the memory module , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory module for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module  may be inserted in or connected to the memory module interface  of the electronic device .","The electronic device  may store data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments, the data  may include service data having information required by the electronic device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the electronic device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the electronic device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases or data stores each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the electronic device  memory.","The data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device  by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the electronic device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The electronic device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the electronic device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the electronic device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short-range communication subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the electronic device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the electronic device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable device subsystems . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (e.g. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the electronic device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the electronic device .","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded web page may be further processed by a web browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the electronic device  may also compose data items, such as email messages; for example, using an input interface  in conjunction with the display . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the electronic device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar to the data communication mode, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., a voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory; for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  include operating system software , and software applications  including an application manager . In the example embodiment of , the application manager  is implemented as a separate stand-alone application , but in other example embodiments, the application manager  could be implemented as part of the operating system  or another application .","The electronic device  may include a range of additional software applications , including, for example, a notepad application, web browser application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display ) according to the application.","The software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The operating system  is software that manages electronic device  components (such as the display , input interface , communication subsystem , etc.) and provides a platform for software applications . The operating system  also acts as an intermediary between the electronic device  components and the software applications . For example, the operating system may recognize data that is being input from a navigational input device and route the inputted data to be executed by a software application . The operating system  may be Microsoft Windows OS\u2122, BlackBerry OS\u2122, iOS\u2122, Linux\u2122, UNIX\u2122 Android\u2122 or any other operating system  having the necessary capabilities for implementing the functions described herein.","In at least some example embodiments, a first application associated with the electronic device , such as the operating system , is configured to obtain personal identification information from a user of the electronic device . As will be described in greater detail with reference to  below, the personal identification information may include one or more names, phone numbers, email addresses, instant messaging account information, etc. In some example embodiments, the first application (e.g. the operating system ) may obtain such personal identification information during a first start of the first application.","The application manager  (which may be a component in the first application or may be separate from the first application) is configured to determine, based on the personal identification information and one or more predetermined rules, whether another application (which may be referred to as a second application) should be loaded onto the electronic device. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the one or more predetermined rules may specify that an instant messaging application should be loaded onto the electronic device  if instant messaging account information is specified in the personal identification information. In such example embodiments, the application manager  may determine if the personal identification information specifies instant messaging account information and if so, it may determine that an instant messaging application should be loaded onto the electronic device.","In at least some example embodiments, if the application manager  determines that the second application should be loaded onto the electronic device  it may automatically download, install and\/or configure the second application to the electronic device .","Thus, the application manager  may facilitate the identification, download, installation and\/or configuration of one or more applications which may be useful to the user of the electronic device .","Specific functions and features of the application manager  will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","In at least some example embodiments, the operating system  may perform some or all of the functions of the application manager . In other example embodiments, the functions or a portion of the functions of the application manager  may be performed by one or more other applications. Further, while the application manager  has been illustrated as a single block, the application manager  may include a plurality of software modules. In at least some example embodiments, these software modules may be divided among multiple applications.","Personal Identification Information","Accordingly, in at least some example embodiments, personal identification information is obtained by the electronic device  and the personal identification information is used in order to identify, download, install and\/or configure another application.","Reference will now be made to , which shows example personal identification information . The personal identification information  may be obtained by the operating system , the application manager  and\/or other applications on the electronic device . In at least some example embodiments, the operating system, application manager  and\/or other applications on the electronic device  may display one or more user interface screens (not shown) which allow a user of the electronic device  to input the personal identification information . One or more of the user interface screens may have one or more interface elements which permit personal identification information  to be input to the electronic device . That is, the one or more user interface screens may act as a form and receive data. In at least some example embodiments, personal identification information  may be received via one or more of the following interface elements: text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, selections from a menu, and\/or password fields (in which text entered by a user is not displayed). Personal identification information  may be received via other interface elements not specifically listed herein. Different types of interface elements may be used for the input of different types of personal identification information .","A user of the electronic device  may input the personal identification information  using an input interface  associated with the electronic device . For example, a user may interact with the interface elements to input the personal identification information . In other example embodiments, at least some of the personal identification information  may be received via another method. For example, after a user has input information associated with an account which may contain other personal identification information  (such as a Facebook\u2122 account, etc.), the electronic device  may use the input information to log into the account and retrieve the other personal identification information .","In at least some example embodiments, after the personal identification information  is obtained, it may be stored in memory of the electronic device . For example, the personal identification information  may be stored in the data area  of memory (such as the flash memory ).","The personal identification information  may include for example, one or more names  (which may for example, include a first name, middle name, last name and\/or nickname), one or more mailing addresses  (such as a residential and\/or business address), an electronic messaging address, such as an email address  (which may include a local-part portion and a domain name portion ), one or more phone numbers  (such as a home phone number, a business phone number, a mobile phone number, etc.), instant messaging account information  (which may include for example, an instant messaging username , an instant messaging password  and\/or an instant messaging provider  (which may identify the provider of the instant messaging service associated with the instant messaging username )), and\/or one or more interests  (such as for example, hobbies, political affiliation, religious affiliation, favourite books, favourite movies, celebrities of interest, social groups) of the user.

The predetermined rules may specify one or more conditions related to personal identification information  which cause the electronic device  to determine that a second application should be loaded onto the electronic device . The predetermined rules are provided in the application manager . A predetermined rule may for example, associate personal identification information  of a specific type with a predetermined application. If at , the electronic device  determines that the personal identification information  obtained at  includes a specific predetermined type of information, then it may determine that a second application which is associated with that type of information should be loaded onto the electronic device .","For example, in some example embodiments, the electronic device  may determine whether the personal identification information  specifies instant messaging account information and\/or whether it specifies instant messaging account information associated with a predetermined instant messaging provider  ().

Configuring the second application may for example, include changing or setting configurations, user accounts, settings, defaults and\/or preferences of the second application and\/or logging into a user account.","By way of example, in at least some example embodiments in which the second application is an instant messaging application, the electronic device  may configure the instant messaging application based on instant messaging account information  included in the personal identification information .","Similarly, an email application may be configured based on email account information, such as an email address  (and possibly a password).","Similarly, a user's mailing address  could be used to configure location information associated with a web browser, email account, map, etc. By way of example, the electronic device  may add an address, such as a home address and\/or work address as a location to a travel application. The travel application may for example, be a navigation application such as a global positioning system (GPS) application. In at least some example embodiments, the address may be added as a favourite location or as a point-of-interest in the travel application. In some example embodiments, the travel application is a traffic reporting application, such as BlackBerry Traffic\u2122 which is configured to provide traffic information. By way of example, the travel application may be configured to provide an estimated time of arrival to a destination, provide information regarding traffic and\/or road closures, and\/or to suggest a driving route. In such example embodiments, the address information may be added to the travel application to allow a user to easily select a home and\/or work destination.","While  illustrates a method  which includes features of downloading the second application (at ), installing the second application (at ) and configuring the second application (at ), in other example embodiments, one or more of these features may not be included. For example, in some example embodiments, a second application may already exist on the electronic device, in an uninstalled state, when the electronic device  makes the determination at  as to whether the second application should be loaded onto the electronic device . In such example embodiments,  may be omitted and the method  may install the second application at  without first downloading the second application at .","Example Embodiment with Input Interface Assisted Features","While, in some example embodiments the download (at ), installation (at ), and\/or configuration (at ) of the second application may occur automatically, in other example embodiments, further user input may be required from a user via an input interface  in order to download, install and\/or configure the second application on the electronic device . Referring to , one such example embodiment is illustrated. The method  includes, at , obtaining personal identification information  in a first application and at , determining, based on the personal identification information  and one or more predetermined rules, whether a second application should be loaded onto the electronic device .  and  are discussed in greater detail above with reference to .","If at , the electronic device  determines that the second application should be loaded onto the electronic device , then at , the electronic device  presents a prompt via an output interface  of the electronic device, such as the display , to request confirmation to download, install and\/or configure the second application on the electronic device . The prompt, may in various example embodiments ask the user to confirm or cancel the download, installation and\/or configuration of the second application.","Next, at , confirmation may be received via an input interface  associated with the device . The input interface  may for example, be a trackpad, trackball, keyboard, or touchscreen. If confirmation is received (which is determined at ), the electronic device  downloads, installs and\/or configures the second application on the electronic device  in the manner described above with reference to , ,  of . If no confirmation is received at  (i.e. if the electronic device  receives an instruction from the user to not to install the second application on the electronic device ), then the method  ends without downloading, installing and\/or configuring the second application on the electronic device .","Determining Whether Instant Messaging Application Should be Loaded","As noted previously, in some example embodiments, the electronic device  may determine whether the personal identification information  specifies instant messaging account information  () (i.e. whether it includes any instant messaging account information ) and\/or whether it specifies instant messaging account information which is associated with a predetermined instant messaging provider  () (i.e. whether it includes instant messaging account information for a specific provider, such as Yahoo Messenger\u2122 account information). If so, then the electronic device  may determine that an instant messaging application (such as an instant messaging application associated with the instant messaging provider ) should be loaded onto the electronic device .","Referring now to , one such example method  is illustrated. The method  may include features , , ,  which are discussed in greater detail above with reference to . In the method  of , the application manager  includes a predetermined rule which specifies that an instant messaging application should be loaded onto the electronic device if instant messaging account information is specified in the personal identification information. In some such example embodiments, when determining whether the second application should be loaded onto the electronic device , the electronic device  determines, at , whether the personal identification information  specifies instant messaging account information . If the personal identification information  specifies instant messaging account information , then the electronic device  may determine (at ) that an instant messaging application should be loaded onto the electronic device . If the personal identification information  does not specify instant messaging account information , then the electronic device  may determine that an instant messaging application should not be loaded onto the electronic device . If the electronic device  determines (at ) that an instant messaging application should be loaded onto the electronic device , it may download, install and\/or configure the instant messaging application at ,  and\/or  in the manner described above with reference to .","In at least some example embodiments, if the personal identification information specifies instant messaging account information, the electronic device  may download contact information for one or more contacts associated with the instant messaging account information at .","In downloading the contact information, the electronic device , may retrieve a list of contacts from a network, and\/or a server, a system and\/or another device across a network storing the list of contacts associated with the instant messaging account information. In at least some example embodiments, contact information is stored on a server, such as a remote server, of the entity hosting the instant messaging application. In such example embodiments, the electronic device  retrieves the contact information from the particular server associated with the instant messaging application.","The contact information may include one or more account contact entries. An account contact entry may include information similar to the personal identification information  but, represents information associated with a contact rather than the user of the electronic device . The account contact entry may include a plurality of fields with field entries associated with each field. For example, one or more of a name field, a mailing address field, an email address field and a phone number field with corresponding field entry information may be included. The account contact entry may also include other fields for storing other field entry information not specifically listed herein.","In at least some example embodiments (not shown), further user input may be required via an input interface  in order to download the contact information. The electronic device  may present a prompt via, for example, the display  of the electronic device  to request a user to enter a password associated with the instant messaging account in order to download the contact information. If a password is not entered or an incorrect password is entered, the electronic device  may not download the contact information.","Next at , the electronic device  synchronizes the contact information with an address book associated with the electronic device . One or more applications  stored on the electronic device  may perform the functions of an address book. The application may be implemented as a separate stand-alone application or as part of another application including the application manager . A separate address book application in performing the function of an address book may allow contact entries to be created and stored in memory, for example the flash memory , of the electronic device . In at least some example embodiments, the address book application may permit one or more contact entries to be stored in a data store in the data area  of memory. The address book application may access the contact entries in the data store. In at least some example embodiments, one or more other applications may access the contact entries in the data store.","The electronic device , in performing the synchronization process, synchronizes the information in the account contact entries included in the downloaded contact information with the information in the contact entries stored in a data store of the electronic device . The contact entries may be updated and modified, and\/or new contact entries may be created based on the information in the account contact entries. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may search the contact entries for a full name corresponding to a full name in an account contact entry. If a contact entry shares a full name with an account contact entry, the electronic device  may synchronize the information in that contact entry with the information in that account contact entry by modifying, adding and\/or deleting information in the contact entry to match the information in the account contact entry. However, if a contact entry does not share a full name with an account contact entry, the electronic device  may create a new contact entry matching the information in that account contact entry.","In the example embodiment of , a determination was made by the electronic device  at  regarding whether the personal identification information specified instant messaging account information. If so, then the electronic device determined (at ), that an instant messaging application should be loaded.","In another example embodiment, at , the electronic device  may determine whether instant messaging account information  associated with a specific instant messaging provider is included in the personal identification information  and if such information is included, the electronic device  may determine that a specific instant messaging application associated with that provider be downloaded.","In some example embodiments, the instant messaging account information  may be received in such a way that it is associated with a specific provider. For example, each field which allows a user to input instant messaging account information may be associated with a specific instant messaging provider. For example, a field may be provided to allow a user to input MSN Messenger\u2122 account information and another field may be provided to allow a user to input Yahoo Messenger\u2122 account information. This allows the electronic device  to determine whether instant messaging account information associated with a specific instant messaging provider is included.","In other example embodiments, in order to identify the instant messaging provider associated with instant messaging account information, the electronic device  searches a plurality of instant messaging applications in order to correlate the instant messaging account information  with an instant messaging application. For example, the electronic device  will use the username  and password  as specified in the instant messaging account information  to check if the information correlates to an account in a searched instant messaging application (e.g. by attempting to log into the instant messaging service provided by each provider with the specific instant messaging account information). If the information correlates to an account in a searched instant messaging application, then the particular instant messaging provider is identified.","Determining Whether Email Application Should be Loaded","As noted previously, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may determine whether the personal identification information  includes an email address of a specific predetermined type. If so, then the electronic device  may determine that an email application associated with that type of email address should be loaded on the electronic device .","Referring now to , one such example method  is illustrated. The method  may include features , , ,  which are discussed in greater detail above with reference to . In the method  of , the application manager  includes a predetermined rule which associates an email application with an email address type. That is, a first email application may be associated with a first email address type and in at least some example embodiments, a second email application (which is not the same as the first email application) may be associated with a second email address type (which is not the same as the first email address type).","In the method  of , when the electronic device  determines whether a second application should be loaded onto the electronic device , the electronic device identifies an email address type associated with an email address included in the personal identification information  (at ). The electronic device  may identify the email address type based on a domain name portion of an email address.","That is, in order to determine the email address type of an email address in the personal identification information , in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  searches the personal identification information  for a domain name portion of an email address . An email address has two parts. The first part, which precedes the \u201c@\u201d symbol, is the local-part portion of the email address and may be the username of the recipient. The part after the \u201c@\u201d symbol is the domain name portion to which the email message is sent. For example, in the example email address of  (jdoe@domainname.com), \u201cjdoe\u201d is the local-part portion and \u201cdomainname.com\u201d is the domain name portion. At , the electronic device  may search the personal identification information  for a domain name portion and based on the domain name portion, identify an email address type.","Then, at , the electronic device  determines whether the one or more predetermined rules associate an email application with the email address type identified at . If so, then at , the electronic device  may determine that an email application associated with the email address type identified at  should be loaded onto the electronic device . If the electronic device  determines that the predetermined rules do not associate an email application with the email address type identified at , then the method  may end.","If the electronic device  determines that an email application should be loaded onto the electronic device , then at ,  and  it may download, install, and\/or configure the email application in the manner described above with reference to .","The email application, when executed, may create a mailbox platform correlating to the email address. The mailbox platform may replicate the functions of a domain (i.e. a mail box provider) hosting an email address, and allow a user of the electronic device , to access the email address via the mailbox platform.","Configuring Applications","As noted in the discussion of  above, in at least some example embodiments, a second application may be configured based on personal identification information  obtained within a first application. In the examples of , such configuration occurred as a result of a determination being made on the electronic device  that the second application should be loaded onto the electronic device .","However, in other example embodiments, personal identification information received within a first application may be used to configure a second application which may already be downloaded and\/or installed on the electronic device .","Referring now to , an example embodiment of one such method  is illustrated in flowchart form.","First, at , personal identification information is obtained within a first application, such as an operating system .  is discussed in greater detail above with reference to .","Next, at , the electronic device  configures a second application based on the personal identification information obtained in the first application.  is discussed in greater detail above with reference to .","Configuration Based on Address","In at least some example embodiments, as part of the configuration process at , the electronic device  determines whether there is a mailing address  included in the personal identification information .","In at least some example embodiments, the personal identification information  may have one or more mailing address fields in which a mailing address  may be stored. In at least some example embodiments, at , the electronic device  examines the personal identification information  to determine whether the mailing address field is populated with a mailing address . If the mailing address field is populated with a mailing address , then the electronic device  may determine that the personal identification information  includes a mailing address . If however, no mailing address  is included in the mailing address field, then the electronic device  may determine that the personal identification information  does not include a mailing address .","If the electronic device  is unable to identify a mailing address  (e.g. because a mailing address  is not specified in the personal identification information ), the method  may end. If a mailing address  is specified in the personal identification information , the electronic device  may use the mailing address to configure a second application (i.e. an application which is not the application through which the personal identification information  was initially input). For example, in at least some example embodiments, if a mailing address is specified in the personal identification information then, at , a web browser associated with the electronic device  may be customized based on the mailing address.","In some example embodiments, when customizing the web browser, the electronic device , configures localization settings and preferences of the web browser to be associated with the geographic location of the mailing address . The configured web browser is localized for the geographic location as specified in the mailing address . That is, the web browsing experience could be tailored based on the geographic location. For example, in at least some example embodiments, a configured web browser accessing a search engine such as Yahoo Search\u2122, Google Search\u2122, MSN Search\u2122, etc. may display search results associated with the specific geographic location as specified in the mailing address . In such example embodiments, a search of the example term, \u201cseafood restaurants\u201d in a search engine, may cause the web browser to search and display results of seafood restaurant webpage links which are around the geographic location as specified in the mailing address .","Similarly, map data sent from a mapping server could be customized based on the geographic location. For example, when a user navigates to a mapping website via the web browser, the mapping website may initially send a map to the electronic device based on the geographic location.","A mailing address  may be used to configure other applications instead of or in addition to the web browser. For example, in some example embodiments, the electronic device  may determine whether the personal identification information  includes a home address and\/or a work address. If a home address and\/or work address are included, the electronic device  may add the home address and\/or the work address as a location to a travel application. The travel application may for example, be a navigation application such as a global positioning system (GPS) application. In at least some example embodiments, the address may be added as a favourite location or as a point-of-interest in the travel application. In some example embodiments, the travel application is a traffic reporting application, such as BlackBerry Traffic\u2122 which is configured to provide traffic information. By way of example, the travel application may be configured to provide an estimated time of arrival to a destination, provide information regarding traffic and\/or road closures, and\/or to suggest a driving route. In such embodiments, at , the address information may be added to the travel application to allow a user to easily select a home and\/or work destination.","Configuration Based on Interest","In at least some example embodiments, as part of the configuration process at , the electronic device  determines whether one or more interest fields  is included in the personal identification information .","That is, in at least some example embodiments, the personal identification information  may have one or more interest fields in which an activity of interest  (such as for example, hobbies, political affiliation, religious affiliation, favourite books, favourite movies, celebrities of interest, social groups) to the user may be specified. In at least some example embodiments, at , the electronic device  examines the personal identification information  to determine whether the interest field is populated with an interest . If the interest field is populated with an interest , then the electronic device  may determine that the personal identification information  includes an interest . If however, no interest  is included in the interest field, then the electronic device  may determine that the personal identification information  does not include an interest .","If an interest  is not specified in the personal identification information , the method  may end. In one example embodiment, if an interest  is specified, then at , the electronic device  may configure a second application to present a RSS feed associated with the interest . For example, an RSS reader may be configured to subscribe to an RSS feed associated with the interest.","RSS is a web feed format used to publish web content in a standardized format. A RSS feed may include full or summarized content of the associated webpages. RSS feeds may be constantly updated based on a user's interests. RSS feeds may be read by an RSS Reader. The RSS reader aggregates the web content in a centralized location for easy viewing by a web user. The RSS reader provides a user interface to monitor and read the feeds. The RSS reader may further constantly update the feeds based on a user's interests. Example RSS readers include Amphetadesk\u2122, FeedReader\u2122, NewsGator\u2122, My Yahoo\u2122, Google Reader\u2122, etc.","In configuring the second application to present a RSS feed, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may input the specified interest  in a RSS reader associated with the second application. The RSS reader aggregates web content associated with the specified interest and presents the aggregated web content as RSS feeds. In at least some example embodiments, a graphical user interface (GUI) icon, such as a feed icon, is presented in the second application in order to provide a user with an interface to access the RSS feeds. A GUI is a type of user interface that allows the user to interact with an electronic device and\/or an application utilizing images rather than text commands. The GUI represents information and actions available to the user through graphical icons and visual indicators. The GUI can be implemented by various programming languages including JavaScript, .NET, C++, etc. A selection of the feed icon displays one or more RSS feeds associated with the specified interest .","The method  of  may use other types of personal identification information  to customize a second application apart from the personal identification information  specifically discussed in the examples above. Furthermore, the application which is customized may be a different application from the applications specifically discussed above.","While the present application is primarily described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present application is also directed to various apparatus such as a handheld electronic device including a mobile communications device.
