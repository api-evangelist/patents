Btk is primarily expressed in most hematopoietic cells such as B cells, mast cells and macrophages (Smith et al., 152: 557-565, 1994) and is localized in bone marrow, spleen and lymph node tissue. Btk plays important roles in B-cell receptor (BCR) and FcR signaling pathways, which involve in B-cell development, differentiation (Khan, 23: 147, 2001). Btk is activated by upstream Src-family kinases. Once activated, Btk in turn phosphorylates PLC gamma, leading to effects on B-cell function and survival (Humphries et al., 279: 37651, 2004). These signaling pathways must be precisely regulated. Mutations in the gene encoding Btk cause an inherited B-cell specific immunodeficiency disease in humans, known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) (Conley et al., 27: 199-227, 2009). Aberrant BCR-mediated signaling may result in dysregulated B-cell activation leading to a number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Preclinical studies show that Btk deficient mice are resistant to developing collagen-induced arthritis. Moreover, clinical studies of Rituxan, a CD20 antibody to deplete mature B-cells, reveal the key role of B-cells in a number of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis (Gurcan et al., 9: 10-25, 2009). Therefore, Btk inhibitors can be used to treat autoimmune and\/or inflammatory diseases.","In addition, aberrant activating of Btk plays important role in pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas indicating that inhibition of Btk is useful in the treatment of hematological malignancies (Davis et al., 463: 88-92, 2010). Preliminary clinical trial results showed that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor PCI-32765 was effective in treatment of several types of B-cell lymphoma (for example, 54American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting abstract, December 2012: 686 () (-32765), -(): -2 ). Because Btk plays a central role as a mediator in multiple signal transduction pathways, inhibitors of Btk are of great interest as anti-inflammatory and\/or anti-cancer agents (Mohamed et al., 228: 58-73, 2009; Pan, 21: 357-362, 2008; Rokosz et al., 12: 883-903, 2008; Uckun et al., -7: 624-632, 2007; Lou et al., 55(10): 4539-4550, 2012).","Small molecule inhibitors of Btk are being developed for anti-inflammatory and anticancer therapy. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765, See: U.S. Pat. No. 7,514,444B2 and related documents, for examples, US2012053189A1; WO 2011153514; WO 2011046964; US2010254905A1; WO2010009342; WO2008121742; WO2008054827; US20080139582; US20080076921; U.S. Pat.

Another Btk inhibitor entered clinical trials is AVL-292 (See, for example, US 20100249092; US20100029610; US2010016296; US20120077832; WO 2011090760; WO 2010028236; WO 2009158571; WO2009051822; WO2010123870). Ono pharmaceuticals and Mannkind Corporation have been doing clinical trials with their small molecular Btk inhibitors, respectively (See, for example, ONO-4059, WO2011152351; WO2007136790A2).","Other Btk inhibitors are also known.

Bivalent radicals formed from substituted benzene derivatives and having the free valences at ring atoms are named as substituted phenylene radicals. Bivalent radicals derived from univalent polycyclic hydrocarbon radicals whose names end in \u201c-yl\u201d by removal of one hydrogen atom from the carbon atom with the free valence are named by adding \u201c-idene\u201d to the name of the corresponding univalent radical, e.g., a naphthyl group with two points of attachment is termed naphthylidene. Aryl, however, does not encompass or overlap with heteroaryl, separately defined below. Hence, if one or more carbocyclic aromatic rings are fused with a heterocyclic aromatic ring, the resulting ring system is heteroaryl, not aryl, as defined herein.","The term \u201chalogen\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d refers to F, Cl, Br or I.","The term \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d refers to alkyl comprising at least one heteroatom.","The term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d refers to a group selected from:","5- to 7-membered aromatic, monocyclic rings comprising 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon;","8- to 12-membered bicyclic rings comprising 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms, selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon and wherein at least one ring is aromatic and at least one heteroatom is present in the aromatic ring; and","11- to 14-membered tricyclic rings comprising 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms, selected from N, O, and S, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon and wherein at least one ring is aromatic and at least one heteroatom is present in an aromatic ring.","For example, the heteroaryl group includes a 5- to 7-membered heterocyclic aromatic ring fused to a 5- to 7-membered cycloalkyl ring.

Where the compounds possess two or more asymmetric centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. Enantiomers and diastereomers fall within the broader class of stereoisomers. All such possible stereoisomers as substantially pure resolved enantiomers, racemic mixtures thereof, as well as mixtures of diastereomers are intended to be included. All stereoisomers of the compounds and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are intended to be included. Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, reference to one isomer applies to any of the possible isomers. Whenever the isomeric composition is unspecified, all possible isomers are included.","The term \u201csubstantially pure\u201d means that the target stereoisomer contains no more than 35%, such as no more than 30%, further such as no more than 25%, even further such as no more than 20%, by weight of any other stereoisomer(s). In some embodiments, the term \u201csubstantially pure\u201d means that the target stereoisomer contains no more than 10%, for example, no more than 5%, such as no more than 1%, by weight of any other stereoisomer(s).","When compounds contain olefin double bonds, unless specified otherwise, such double bonds are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.","Some of the compounds may exist with different points of attachment of hydrogen, referred to as tautomers. For example, compounds including carbonyl \u2014CHC(O)\u2014 groups (keto forms) may undergo tautomerism to form hydroxyl \u2014CH\u2550C(OH)\u2014 groups (enol forms). Both keto and enol forms, individually as well as mixtures thereof, are also intended to be included where applicable.","It may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (\u201cSMB\u201d) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., a substantially pure enantiomer, may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S.

tested for inhibition of Btk kinase activity in an assay based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer methodology. Recombinant Btk was pre-incubated with the compounds disclosed herein at room temperature for 1 hour in an assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH7.4, 10 mM MgCl, 2 mM MnCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20 nM SEB, 0.1% BSA, 0.005% tween-20. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (at the concentration of ATP Km) and peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH2). After incubating at room temperature for 1 h, an equal volume of stop solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH7.0, 800 mM KF, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, Eu cryptate-conjugated p-Tyr66 antibody and streptavidin-labeled XL665 was added to stop the reaction. Plates were further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the TR-FRET signals (ex337 nm, em 620 nm\/665 nm) were read on BMG PHERAstar FS instrument. The residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds was calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence at 615 nm to that at 665 nm. The ICfor each compound was derived from fitting the data to the four-parameter logistic equation by Graphpad Prism software.","Btk pY223 Cellular Assay","Btk pY223 cellular assay is a HTRF based assay intended to determine the endogenous levels of phosphorylated Btk at Tyr223. Phosphorylated Tyr223 is necessary for full activation of Btk. The assay was performed in Ramos cells (CRL-1596, ATCC) with a Btk pY223 assay kit (63IDC000, Cisbio).","Briefly, Ramos cells were serum starved in 0.5% FBS-containing RPMI1640 for 2 hours. Following starvation, the cells were incubated with compounds to be detected at various concentrations in a CO2 incubator for 1 hour. After incubation, cells were stimulated with 1 mM pervanadate (PV) or NaVO(OV) for 20 min. Then, the cells were spinned down and lysed with 1\u00d7 lysis buffer at RT for 10 min (4\u00d7 lysis buffer supplied in the kit). During the incubation, 1\u00d7 antibody mix was prepared by diluting anti-Btk-d2 and anti-pBtk-K in detection buffer (supplied in the kit). 2 ul\/well of 1\u00d7 antibody mixture was dispensed into the OptiPlate-384 assay plate (6005620, Perkin Elmer). After that, 18 ul of cell lysate was transferred to the assay plate pre-loaded with antibody solution. After mixing gently and spinning briefly, the plate was sealed up and kept in dark at RT for 18 hours. The fluorescence emission was measured at two different wavelengths (665 nm and 620 nm) on a compatible HTRF reader (PHERAstar FS, BMG). The potency of compounds was calculated basing on the inhibition of ratio between signal intensities at 665 nm and 620 nm. IC50 values were calculated with GraphPad Prism software using the sigmoidal dose-response function.","Representative compounds as disclosed herein were tested and found to inhibit Btk and autophosphorylation of Btk at Tyr-223 with IC50 values ranging from subnanomolar to 10 micromolar.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0648","num":"0646"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00023","num":"00023"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
