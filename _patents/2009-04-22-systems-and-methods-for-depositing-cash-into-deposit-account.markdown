title: Systems and methods for depositing cash into deposit account
abstract: A deposit card may be issued to a user that allows the user to go to a merchant and deposit cash into a deposit account of the user using information from the deposit card. The deposit card is unidirectional as it only can be used to deposit money into the deposit account. A barcode may be generated and disposed on the deposit card or provided separately. The barcode represents data that may be used in the deposit of cash to the deposit account, such as the name or other identification of the user, a card number of the deposit card, the name or other identification of the institution, an account number of the deposit account, etc. A merchant may use a barcode reader to read the barcode and obtain data that may be used in the deposit.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A check is a negotiable instrument that instructs a financial institution, such as a bank, to pay an amount of money from a specific account held in the payor's name with that financial institution to an account held in the payee's name. Remote deposit of checks is well known. For example, the payee may scan a check into an electronic image using a scanning device and a computing device. The payee may then send the electronic image of the check to a financial institution. The financial institution may use the electronic image to credit funds to the payee.","However, a user has no way of remotely depositing cash. Depositing cash typically involves going to a local bank branch and physically depositing the cash at the bank, e.g., by presenting the cash to a bank teller or depositing the cash into an automated teller machine.","In an implementation, a deposit card may be issued to a user that allows the user to go to a merchant and deposit cash into a deposit account of the user using information from the deposit card. The deposit card is unidirectional as it only can be used to deposit money into the deposit account and cannot be used to make purchases.","In an implementation, the deposit card may have a barcode disposed thereon. The barcode may represent data that may be used in the deposit of cash to the deposit account, such as the name or other identification of the user, a card number of the deposit card, the name or other identification of the institution that holds the deposit account, an account number of the deposit account, etc. The barcode may be directed to the unique card number of the deposit card. The merchant may use a barcode reader to read the barcode and obtain data that may be used in the deposit.","In an implementation, the user may send a cash deposit request to an institution system and in response to the cash deposit request, the institution system may generate a barcode and provide the barcode to the user. In an implementation, the barcode may comprise information directed to the amount of cash that the user has requested to deposit in the deposit account. The barcode may be provided as output on an output device of a computing device, such as displayed on a display of the computing device (e.g., on a display of a mobile device) or printed out from a printer of the computing device. The user may go the merchant and present or otherwise display the barcode to the merchant. The merchant may use a barcode reader to read the barcode and obtain data that may be used in a deposit of cash to the deposit account.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","102","102"]},"A user  and an associated computing device  are shown. In an implementation, the user  may be an individual or other entity who owns a deposit account  that is held by the institution  and is accessible via the institution system . A deposit account is an account at an institution (here, the institution ) that allows money to be deposited and withdrawn by the account holder (here, the user ), with the transactions and resulting balance being recorded on the institution's books. The deposit account  may be any type of deposit account, such as a savings account, a checking account, a brokerage account, and the like.","The computing device  may be any type of personal computer (PC) or handheld computing device such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smartphone, or a mobile phone, for example. An example computing device is described with respect to .","The computing device  and the institution system  may be connected over a network. The user  may communicate with the institution system  by way of a communications network such as an intranet, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless fidelity (WiFi) network, a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a cellular network, a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) network, and the like. The user  may also communicate with the institution system  by phone, email, instant messaging, text messaging, web chat, facsimile, mail, and the like.","The institution  or another entity may issue a deposit card  to the user  that allows the user  to deposit cash into the deposit account  using information from the deposit card . The deposit card  is a type of financial card that is unidirectional as it only can be used to deposit money into the deposit account  and cannot be used to make purchases (other than a purchase of a \u201cdeposit cash to the account associated with the card\u201d or an equivalent, for example). If the deposit card  is lost or stolen, it is of no value to an unauthorized user because no value is stored on the deposit card . The deposit card  may comprise a magnetic stripe or chip (e.g., comprising embedded integrated circuits, non-volatile and\/or volatile memory storage components, security logic, and\/or microprocessor components) that contains data pertaining to the deposit card , the user , the institution , and\/or the deposit account , for example. In an implementation, the deposit card  may be a \u201cchip and PIN\u201d card that uses smartcard technology and comprises an embedded microchip and is authenticated using a PIN (personal identification number).","In an implementation, the user  may go to a merchant , such as a supermarket, drugstore, discount store, financial services company (e.g., Western Union, MoneyGram, etc.), casino, and the like, and provide the deposit card  and cash to the merchant . The merchant  takes the cash and associates the cash with the deposit card  (e.g., rings up a purchase of a \u201cdeposit to the account associated with the card\u201d). The merchant  may obtain card data (e.g., card number, user name, etc.) from the deposit card  and verify the data using an electronic verification system, for example. In an implementation, the verification may be performed using a known financial card payment terminal or point of sale system with a communications link to the institution  and\/or a card processor . The merchant  may also associate the deposit (e.g., the purchase) with the institution  where the cash is being deposited.","In an implementation, the merchant  may provide the card data along with an amount of the deposit and\/or funds (or payment data pertaining to the funds) to a card processor  (which may be separate from the institution  and institution system  or comprised within the institution  or institution system , depending on the implementation). The card processor  may verify that the card data is valid and initiate a transaction with the institution  to deposit the funds into the deposit account  that is tied to the card number of the deposit card . In an implementation, the card processor  may provide a conversion service to translate the card number of the deposit card  to an account number of the deposit account , and may deposit the funds into the deposit account .","In an implementation, the card processor  may collect payment data directed to the deposit and transmit payment data to a transaction collection system that may receive payment data from a distributed network in communication with a plurality of merchants to receive payment data from the plurality of merchants including the merchant . Using the payment data, the funds from the deposit may be provided to the institution  for deposit into the deposit account .","Upon receipt and approval of the card data, account data, payment data, and\/or funds, the institution  may credit the funds to the deposit account . In this manner, the user  may deposit cash into their deposit account  without visiting a bank or an automated teller machine (ATM).","The deposit card  may be act as a sweep card that can be loaded at the merchant . In an implementation, a sweep account  may be provided, e.g., by the institution , that is associated with the deposit card . The user  may provide the deposit card  and the cash to the merchant  for loading with the funds of the cash. The merchant  may send the card data and the funds to the card processor  for loading the funds onto the deposit card . When the deposit card  is loaded, the funds may be loaded into the sweep account  associated with the deposit card  and swept (e.g., immediately) from the sweep account  to the deposit account . Thus, the deposit card  carries no value and is unidirectional as it may only be used for deposits.","The institution system  may provide the user  with information pertaining to merchants who may accept a cash deposit, such as which merchants are close to a particular location (e.g., the user's residence address, a current location of the user , etc.).","The merchant  may have a merchant computing device  and a communications module . The merchant computing device  may be used to read card data from the deposit card  (e.g., by the merchant  swiping the deposit card  through a magnetic reader, smart card reader, or point of sale terminal associated with the merchant computing device ) or the merchant  may enter card data into the merchant computing device . The merchant  may also enter an amount of the deposit into the merchant computing device . The merchant computing device  may communicate with the card processor  and the institution system  over a communications network (e.g., intranet, Internet, LAN, WAN, WiFi, a PSTN, cellular, VOIP, etc.) via the communications module , for example. An example merchant computing device is described with respect to .","In an implementation, the deposit card  may have a barcode  disposed thereon. The barcode  may be any type of optical machine-readable representation of data. In an implementation, the barcode  may be a universal product code (UPC). The barcode  may represent data that may be used in the deposit of cash to the deposit account , such as the name or other identification of the user , a card number of the deposit card , the name or other identification of the institution , an account number of the deposit account , etc. The barcode  may be directed to the unique card number of the deposit card . The merchant  may use a barcode reader  (e.g., an optical scanner) to read the barcode  and obtain data that may be used in the deposit.","In an implementation, the user  may send a cash deposit request to the institution system  (e.g., via any electronic technique(s) such as a website  of the institution system  or by phone, facsimile, email, web chat, instant message, text message, and the like). The user  may access the institution system  by opening a communication pathway via the communications network using the computing device . There may be several ways in which the communication pathway may be established, including, but not limited to, an Internet connection via the website . The user  may access the website  and log into the website  using credentials, such as, but not limited to, a password and a username. The cash deposit request may identify the user , the deposit account , and an amount of cash the user  wants to deposit, for example.","In response to the cash deposit request, the institution system  may generate a barcode similar to the barcode  for example, and provide the barcode to the user . In an implementation, the barcode may comprise information directed to the amount of cash that the user  has requested to deposit in the deposit account . In an implementation, the barcode may be electronically provided (e.g., by the website , by email, facsimile, instant message, text message, web chat, etc.) to the computing device  as a barcode . The barcode  may be provided as output on an output device of the computing device , such as displayed on a display of the computing device  (e.g., on a display of a mobile device) or printed out from a printer of the computing device .","The barcode  may be a unique one-time barcode (the barcode can only be used once, to make one cash deposit and cannot be used to make any further deposits) that may scan at the merchant  as a \u201cdeposit to user deposit account\u201d, for example. In an implementation, the barcode  is uniquely generated and may have an expiration date. Thus, if the user  does not make the cash deposit using the barcode  prior to the expiration date, the user  will not be able to make a cash deposit using the barcode  because the barcode  is no longer valid.","The user  may go the merchant  and present or otherwise display the barcode  to the merchant  (e.g., on a mobile phone display or as a printout). The merchant  may use the barcode reader  to read the barcode  and obtain data that may be used in the deposit, as described further herein.","Thus, a presentation instrument may comprise a barcode. For example, the deposit card  may act as a presentation instrument and comprise the barcode , and the mobile phone display or printout of the barcode  may also act as a presentation instrument.","The institution system  may include a user interface module , a cash deposit engine , and a data source access engine . The user interface module  may generate and format one or more pages of content  as a unified graphical presentation that may be provided to the computing device , or another user computing device such as a PC or any other computing device, as an output from the cash deposit engine . In an implementation, the page(s) of content  may be provided to the computing device  via a secure website  associated with the institution system . On the website , the user  may be presented with information pertaining to the deposit account , the deposit card , and\/or making a cash deposit, as described further herein.","The cash deposit engine  may comprise a card generation module  that may generate and issue a deposit card  for the user , e.g., responsive to a user request for the deposit card . The cash deposit engine  may comprise a barcode generation module  that may generate a barcode for a cash deposit and provide the barcode, such as the barcode  or the barcode , to the user . The cash deposit engine  may comprise a card to account translation module  that may translate the card number and\/or other card data of the deposit card , barcode , or barcode  into an account number and\/or other account data of the deposit account  for deposit of the cash into the deposit account .","In an implementation, the cash deposit engine  may obtain data from internal data source(s)  and\/or external data source(s)  by the data source access engine . The cash deposit engine  has access to data, files, and documents pertaining to the user  as well as any other data, files, and documents that are currently stored by the institution system  as well as external data, files, and documents that may be useful in the generation and issuance of the deposit card  for the user , the generation of a barcode, such as the barcode  or the barcode , for a cash deposit, providing the barcode to the user , and translating card data of the deposit card  into account data of the deposit account .","Data pertaining to the user  and\/or the user account(s) may be retrieved from internal data source(s)  and\/or external data source(s) . Internal data source(s)  may contain data, metadata, email, files, and\/or documents that the institution system  maintains pertaining to the user , such as personal data such as name, physical address, email address, etc., as well as other account information. The retrieved data may be stored centrally, perhaps in storage . Information may also be provided to the institution system  from the user , the merchant , and the card processor .","A user access system may be communicatively coupled to the cash deposit engine  and may be configured to send machine-readable instructions to the cash deposit engine . As mentioned above, the institution system  may provide a unified graphical presentation output. The unified graphical presentation may be transmitted to the user access system. In an implementation, the unified graphical presentation may be combined with other materials and transmitted to the user . In an implementation, the unified graphical presentation is received by the user access system and transmitted directly to the user  without the inclusion of any other materials.","The user access system may be implemented as a web server in an implementation. The user access system, through the use of any suitable interactive web technology, provides an interactive experience to the user  through which access to deposit card, barcode, and cash deposit data and status and related data can be accomplished. Any technology that provides interactivity through a web browser is considered to be within the scope of the present discussion and may include, without limitation, Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), JavaScript, and Ajax.","The institution system  may include any combination of systems and subsystems such as electronic devices including, but not limited to, computers, servers, databases, or the like. The electronic devices may include any combination of hardware components such as processors, databases, storage drives, registers, cache, random access memory (RAM) chips, data buses, or the like and\/or software components such as operating systems, database management applications, or the like.","The institution system  may comprise one or more computing devices . The computing device(s)  may have one or more processors , storage  (e.g., storage devices, memory, etc.), and software modules . The computing device(s) , including its processor(s) , storage , and software modules , may be used in the performance of the techniques and operations described herein. An example computing device and its components are described in more detail with respect to .","Examples of software modules  may include modules that may be used in conjunction with receiving and processing an application for the deposit card  for the user , issuing the deposit card  to the user , receiving a request for a barcode from the user , processing a deposit into the deposit account , generating web page content for display, and receiving instructions from the user , for example.
