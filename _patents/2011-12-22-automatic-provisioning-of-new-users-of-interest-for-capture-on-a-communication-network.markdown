title: Automatic provisioning of new users of interest for capture on a communication network
abstract: A system, method, and apparatus for collecting data streams, such as data packets, on a network, such as the Internet, are disclosed. A metadata portion of at least one of the data streams is analyzed on the network and evaluated using a metadata processing engine to identify a relationship between at least two of the plurality of data streams, e.g., a relationship between multiple users of a network, regardless of whether the users are currently of interest or if they are not of interest. An interface manager can receive an information of a new user of interest, evaluate the new user of interest for redundancy against existing known users of interest of the NMS; then communicate the information of the new user of interest to at least one access device to collect data streams associated with the new user of interest.

No. 61\/428,817 filed Dec. 30, 2010 and entitled: \u201cAutomatic Provisioning Of Targets For Interception On A Communication Network,\u201d which applications is also incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of network communication, and in one example embodiment, this disclosure relates to a method, apparatus and system of collection of data on a network.","An analyst may want to monitor a set of users or a set of online identities associated with the set of users to observe their behavior online. The analyst may already be monitoring a set of known users of the communication network. The analyst may have previously identified a set of known users based on a set of identifier characteristics. The analyst may also be interested in locating other new users or new online identities of interest based on a set of desired identifier characteristic. The analyst may be interested in finding other users based on a set of desired characteristics or a type of project he may be working on. The analyst may be interested in understanding and studying a whole set of online behavior associated with the user or online identity associated with a person of interest. The analyst may want to study a set of communication and transaction data created and exchanged between a known user of interest of the communication network and a new user of interest. The analyst may want to collect a set of data belonging to the user of interest and\/or a new user of interest to study a particular pattern in behavior. The analyst may also want to understand a set of interactions between the user of interest and a user not currently of interest or a new user of interest. Similarly, the analyst may seek content and metadata communicated between users on a wide variety of communication systems and formats. This information can be useful for determining commercial, investment, and personal information and relationships between the users or online identities and persons at large.","A network monitoring system may be required to monitor a set of activity between users and\/or online identities associated with a set of persons. Some users of a communication system may be easily identifiable. However, other users of a communication system may be of interest, but may not yet be identified or provisioned easily. These users and\/or online identities may be difficult to locate, and analysts may have a difficult time finding links between existing online identities and other potential online identities manually. Finding links between known users and new users or online identities related to the known user users may be time-consuming and inefficient task. In addition to being cumbersome and inefficient, it may also be financially expensive to identify new users of interest manually.","A method and system for collecting data streams, such as data packets, on a network, such as the Internet, is disclosed.","In one or more embodiments, a network monitoring system may include a metadata processing device operative to receive a metadata portion of a data stream from a user not currently of interest in a network. The metadata processing device may also evaluate the metadata portion of the data stream, in one or more embodiments. In one or more embodiments, metadata processing device may also be operative to create a relationship between the metadata portion of the data stream of the user not currently of interest and any data of a known user of interest.","The application also discloses a method of monitoring data that may also include receiving at a metadata processing device, a metadata portion of a data stream from a user not currently of interest in a network. The method also includes evaluating the metadata portion of the data stream. The method also includes creating a relationship between the metadata portion of the data stream of the user not currently of interest and any data of a known user of interest.","The application also discloses a network monitoring system comprising an access device for retrieving data from a network and a metadata processing engine coupled to the access device, wherein the metadata processing engine determines a new user of interest using metadata from a user not currently of interest of the network. The metadata processing engine may further be operative to retrieve the data to be monitored from the network, to evaluate the data retrieved from the network, to create a new user of interest of the network based on the evaluating of the data retrieved from the network, to communication an ID for the new user of interest to the access device and to monitor the network for data related to the user of interest.","The application finally also discloses a method of provisioning a new user to be monitoring in a network, the method comprising retrieving data to be monitored from the network, evaluating the data retrieved from the network, creating a new user of interest on the network based on the evaluating of the data retrieved from the network, communicating an ID for the new user of interest to the access device and monitoring the network for data related to the new user of interest","The methods, systems, and apparatuses disclosed herein may be implemented in any means for achieving various aspects, and may be executed in a form of a machine-readable medium embodying a set of instructions that, when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform any of the operations disclosed herein. Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.","Other features of the present embodiments will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.","A method, apparatus and system of a hierarchy of a structure of a volume is disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident, however to one skilled in the art that various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.","The analyst may be interested in identifying a set of new users of interest communicating through a communication network or any network based on what the analyst is looking to monitor. These new users of interest may not be identifiable because their existence is unknown, or their relationship to a known user or other users of the network is not currently known. The analyst may use a network monitoring system to monitor a set of known users of interest and to identify new users of interest. The network monitoring systems and architecture may utilize hardware and software solutions that may be segregated into three primary functional groups, or stages, called: access, mediation, and collection.","The term \u2018access\u2019 refers to the function of literally accessing data from a network. Thereafter, the data is similarly communicated to mediation equipment.","Typically, communications associated with known users of interest interacting on a network are sought by analysts who are monitoring a particular system. A known user of interest may refer to a specific person, online entity or any entity communicating on a specific medium and format. For example, an analyst may monitor a particular online identity xyz@gmail.com who might be communicating via email on the Internet at any time during the day. The analyst may be interested in collecting a set of information and data associated with a set of communications between the online identity xyz@ gmail.com and all correspondences of the online identity, in one example.","Mediation may refer to the hardware and software solutions that provide the function of literally \u2018mediating\u2019 between the analyst and the system itself with its access function and collection function of data.","The collection function may refer to the hardware and software solutions that further organize, analyze, and provide the data to the analyst and the solutions that may interact with the analyst typically via a graphical user interface (GUI), to locate and identify meaningful data. The type of data may be a set of communication and transaction data associated with a user and\/or online identity. The set of data may further be broken down to: content and metadata.","The set of communication and transaction data may consist of a metadata (e.g. IP address, email address, cyber-address recipient address, sender address, time of the email, time of the mail, information on a post card, etc.). The metadata may be an information about the data in one or more embodiments. The metadata may encompass a time and place that the data was received. The metadata also encompass a set of information related to the senders and receivers of the information, a time of a communication event, or where an information was collected from. For example, if an email is sent to the POI, the metadata may consist of the sender and recipient addresses of the email, an IP address and a time of the email among others. In one or more embodiments, the metadata may also be a cyber-name, a cyber-address, contact list, an analyst login information, a chat IP address, a chat alias, a VOIP address, a web forum login, a website login, a social network login, a sender and\/or receiver of a chat, a time of a chat conversation, a file name sent in a chat or an email or any other cyber-communication, a number of files transferred in the cyber communication, a type of chat text, a name of an audio and\/or video attachment sent in the cyber communication, a number of parties involved in a communication, a buddy list, an avatar description associated with the cyber communication. The metadata may also be associated with voice and\/or voice over IP communications. The metadata may also be associated with social networking sites, and may include an analyst name, a time of a social networking communication or publication, a size of a social networking communication, a number of followers and others. The metadata may also include telephone numbers, phone numbers, IMSI information and\/or IMEI information.","The set of data may also consist of a content. The content may be the substantive part of the data collected. The data may consist of the actual text of the email, attachments in the email and what the information actually says. Similarly, the content may include the substantive portion of a record. In addition to the text of the communication, or a transcript of a recorded conversation, it may also include a text of an email attachment, a transferred file, a content of an uploaded or downloaded document\/video or any other file, a pooled information between many users of a network, a substance of social network communication, a tweet, a message exchanged between two parties, a substance of a text message, and any other communication.","Function Block Diagram","Referring now to , a functional block diagram  of a network monitoring system (NMS) is shown, according to one or more embodiments. The functions shown herein represent a high-level overview of the functionality of the NMS to be implemented in hardware, software and methods that are described in subsequent figures. A starting function is known user receiving block -A and optional known user receiving block -B which act as an interface to receive known user data from an analyst, either manually or electronically, which is then passed to a known user mediating function block  for mediating the known user of interest based on predetermined criteria for identification of users on the network as well as for resource allocation. The present disclosure provides for one NMS to receive known user inputs from a plurality of analysts, e.g., via known user input blocks -A and optional -B; hence it is referred to as multi-tenant capable. Once approved, known user information, shown as a solid line, is passed to functional block  for provisioning an accessing function  to the appropriate networks, e.g., Network NW  and NW , which would then actually access and collect data from the appropriate networks to be monitored. The present disclosure provides for one NMS to access a plurality of networks with a single NMS system; hence it is referred to as multi-network capable.","Portions of data collected from the network by access functional block  are communicated parallely on multiple paths to first, second, and third paths, or any combination thereof, then serially communicated down each multipath for subsequent processing and analysis. In particular, a first data path, or first path, couples accessing function  to collecting function  that collects metadata and\/or authorized or desired content, of data streams collected from the network for known users of interest (shown as solid lines) and for new users of interest, (shown as dashed lines) and for optionally storing data. In one or more embodiments, a new user of interest may be a user of the network who was previously not of interest to the analyst, but may be of interest to the analyst based on criteria determined by the system. In one or more embodiments, the system may auto provision these new users of interest indicating to the analyst that his new user of interest warrants his attention. This collected data is communicated to: mediation block  for subsequent processing such as assembling data streams into communications, such that packets of fragmented data can be reconstructed into more meaningful and readable messages, and for temporarily storing them prior to communicating them to collecting and analyzing functional block ; and subsequently displaying data and relationships to GUI functions -A and optional -B, for interacting by one or more analysts.","A second data path includes an collecting function  coupled to accessing function  that receives metadata, but essentially no content data, from any quantity of users of the network, including an option to collect and communicate metadata to a metadata mediating function  from either every available data stream of a single user on the network to every available user on the network, e.g., mass metadata, or any quantity of users or population definition of users in between. Mediating the metadata includes: primarily extracting the metadata portion of the data stream and discarding the balance of the data stream; establishing possible relationships between the communicated data; temporarily storing this data therein; delivering the metadata to other engines; and receiving feedback of known user data, e.g., from known user mediating function . After mediating the data, the relationship information and metadata itself is communicated to the advanced targeting function  which identifies a new user of interest to be monitored on the network, and communicates it, as indicated by the dashed lines, to the mediation function  to then be provisioned per provisioning function  on accessing network function .","The new user of interest and metadata analysis information can also pass to collecting and analyzing function  for displaying the results of the metadata, either directly, or in conjunction with data from mediation function . Together, the function of generating a new user of interest, based on relationships algorithmically determined between metadata from collected data streams of both known users and users not currently of interest may be referred to as autoprovisioning. That is, the new user of interest is provisioned automatically without requiring an ab initio input from the analyst, thereby resulting in the collection of data streams more timely and with fewer resources.","A third data path from accessing function  to collecting function  collects data streams from the network and communicates them to storing data function  for storage of data. Third data path in one embodiment neither dissects data streams, e.g., content from data, nor, process them beyond tagging, storing, retrieving, and overwriting them. Thus, the third data path can store any desired portion of data, whether the data originating from the known user of interest or from a user not currently of interest regardless of whether the data is and metadata or content. In one embodiment, third data path stores both content and metadata for every available data stream of all available users on the network and communicates them to circular buffer functional block  for storage of data. In one or more embodiments, all users of the network may comprise of known users of interest, users currently not of interest and new users of interest. However, many different embodiments can be realized with third data path, from recording different portions of a data stream, e.g., content or metadata, for any population of communication network users, with any kind of retention duration algorithm.","Known user mediating function  can request retained data associated with known user of interest and user not currently of interest from storing data function  for retrieval and communication to collecting and analyzing block  and subsequently to displaying data GUI function . Thus, collecting and analyzing function  can receive data from a plurality of sources via mediation function , including essentially real-time collected data streams for known user and new user of interest from function , real-time metadata from advanced targeting functional block , and retained, or saved and collected, data from circular buffer function . The latter function is referred to as retained data recovery.","By tagging, e.g., in a header, each collected data stream with an identifier, i.e. a known user identification (ID) that is unique to the NMS, the collected data can be routed and managed through the network monitoring system as traditional data packets. A database, look up table (LUT), or any other system for tracking data can be utilized by components in the NMS to cross-reference the unique identifier in the data stream with details about the data stream including known user of interest status, analyst administration details, and other useful fields.","Overall, functional block diagram  illustrates several features including: a multi-path approach for parallely processing different levels of metadata and\/or content from users of a network; a dynamic feedback retrieval system for identifying new users of interest, using among other things metadata from all users on a network in conjunction with data from a known user of interest; auto provisioning of the new users of interest to access functions for collecting data; recovery of retained data based on known user of interest or new user of interest needs; mediating of collected data using scaled mediation functions; managing packets through the NMS via known user ID; and collecting and analyzing functions of data received from a plurality of parallel sources.","System Architecture","Referring now to , an architecture layout of the network monitoring system (NMS)  as applied to a plurality of networks is shown, according to one or more embodiments. Known user input block  is a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be a centralized data entry point or a distributed and remotely accessed interface that performs the known user entry function of block  of . Input block  can be hardware and software such as a computer system with keyboard data entry, scanner and optical character recognition, or any other system to enter data. While only one known user input block  is shown, the present system is capable of coupling a plurality of known user input blocks, where one or more can be utilized by one or more authorized analysts. Data mediation engine  receives known user of interest information from known user input block , to which it is coupled, and mediates the known user of interest information per the functionality of block  of . Data mediation engine  can process collected data streams from known users of interest and users not currently of interest via standard scalable network components as described in subsequent , or it can use an application specific integrated circuit and hardware","One or more Access+Mass Metadata extraction (MME) storage+Buffer devices -A to -Ap and - are coupled on the backend to data mediation engine  to receive instructions on the known user of interest and the new user of interest that they should collect on one or more networks, e.g., NW - and NWn -, where n and p\u22670. An access device, e.g., - can be coupled to a plurality of networks, e.g., - and -, or a plurality of access devices, e.g., -A and -Ap can be coupled to a single network, e.g., NW -. AMB devices -A, to -Ap and - utilize hardware and software described in subsequent  to perform the functions of  including: access network functional block ; collecting metadata of at least one or of all data streams per block ; collecting data streams of known users of interest ; and collecting data streams of all users . Instructions may be communicated to access devices via secure, or encrypted, links on wired systems, wireless, satellite, etc.","Access devices -A to -Ap and - are also coupled to a plurality of processing devices on the frontend, and particularly to: a mass metadata extraction (MME) and advanced targeting engine, or metadata mediation engine,  that receives metadata; and to data mediation engine,  that receives collected data. Data mediation engine  performs the mediation function  of  where it mediates the known user of interest against predetermined rules and criteria for identification and data collection on the network as well as against available resource allocation. Data mediation engine  then communicates processed data from known users of interest and new users of interest to collection and analysis engine , and also to metadata mediation engine  for processing against metadata from all users or a portion of users, e.g., to find meaningful relationships, correlations of data, and other insights into relationships between known users of interest to other known users of interest and to users not currently of interest, which can be output to GUI , e.g., data monitors. Meanwhile, metadata mediation engine  is also coupled in parallel to data mediation engine  to send and receive data regarding new users of interest.","NMS  is modular, such that an analyst can build up or scale down the functionality to a system as budget and need dictates. Thus, a core function of collection of data of a known user of interest can be a starting function, with an upgrade of autoprovisioning via metadata mediation, or an upgrade of retained data recovery via circular buffer being modularly addable. Thus hardware integration and expansion can be implemented with software upgrades and interface sensing techniques that allow the NMS  to detect the hardware and provision the system to implement the increased or decreased functionality.","Referring now to , a block diagram of the access device+mass metadata extraction (MME) server+storage buffer (together \u201cAMB\u201d) engine -A of the network security system is shown, for collecting data on a network, according to one or more embodiments. Access function  of  is implemented in Access engine -A via a scalable quantity of line cards, i.e., 10 Gigabit, or 10 G, line cards - through -with t\u22670, being receive cards as required to collect content and metadata from all available traffic on the network, i.e., NW -, and to communicate it with other components in the network security system. Line cards - through -receive data streams from the network via any commercially available or proprietary access device coupled to the network to collect the data streams used by the known users of interest. The access device can be a passive probe tied or tapped into a junction on the line of the network or it can be an active port to a network router, both of which are known to those skilled in the art; collecting the data streams of the known user on the network; optionally capable of tagging the data streams of the known user of interest that are being collected from the network with a respective known user ID or record ID; and transmitting the data streams of the known user to the NMS for subsequent analysis.","Ethernet interface (I\/F)  with 1 G\/10 G capability and optional legacy compatibility, i.e., with 10\/100\/1000 M bit\/sec, communicates the full content and metadata of all available traffic on the network to the following coupled devices: 1) an MME server ; 2) a peripheral control interface (PCI) mezzanine card (MC) input\/output (I\/O) module (together \u201cPIM\u201d) data card  and ) a storage, or circular buffer . Note that any communication protocol can be utilized between engines or components in the NMS, e.g., 40 G\/100 G, etc., while still meeting the functionality, methods, and overall system architecture and benefits of the present disclosure.","MME server  buffers and transmits metadata for users on the network to the metadata mediation engine  of , e.g., via connection \u201cB,\u201d thereby satisfying function  of collecting metadata as second data path shown in . MME server  also functions to buffer and manage data to account for differences in line speed, line failures, data backup, and other system interconnectivity issues that inhibits continuous and real-time data streaming between the components.","PIM data card  is essentially the gate keeper for what portion of the data stream gets directed to the first data path of known user mediation and the second data path of metadata mediation for the NMS. For example, PIM data card  can send the first few packets having raw metadata for a session for all users to the MME server  for subsequent transmission to metadata mediation engine  for processing metadata. Similarly, the PIM data card  can send the entire data stream for known users of interest, including the first few packets having raw metadata and the subsequent packets containing the content, to the data mediation engine , shown in , e.g., via connection \u201cC,\u201d thereby satisfying function  that monitors and stores data streams of known users as first data path, as shown in . Metadata belonging to the known user of interest is stripped out by data mediation engine  and communicated to, and processed in parallel by, metadata mediation engine , e.g., as tracked by a common known user ID as shown in . PIM data card  can be a commercially available card, or a proprietary design PIM card capable of communicating with the packets as described herein.","Storage, or circular, buffer, or drive,  receives and stores metadata and content of desired users, which can include known users of interest, users not currently of interest and new users of interest on a network, via the Ethernet interface card . Storage buffer  satisfies circular buffer functional block  and collecting function  as third data path, as shown in  for temporary storage of all metadata and content collected for every available data stream of all available users, in one embodiment, on a network. Storage buffer  can be any size buffer device, translating to a time limit of original stored data for a given data rate, with optional expandability, and various data management techniques for interruption, recovery, and preservation of strings of critical data. Storage buffer can be accessed to recover retained data that was collected from a known user of interest, a new user of interest or a user not currently of interest, via an analyst's request input from data mediation engine , e.g., via connection \u201cA,\u201d or via an autoprovisioning function via MME server  from the metadata mediation engine  through data mediation engine . Storage buffer  can be any commercially available or proprietary design drive that will communicate with the system and store data.","Optionally, additional storage buffers, not shown, may be used in parallel with shown storage buffer . Additional storage buffers could use a hand-off technique whereby when a critical security event occurs, as notified by an analyst or an algorithm, e.g., sensing key terms or traffic from specific known users of interest, users not currently of interest or analysts, a first storage buffer that was actively recording data can stop overwriting its existing data, thus saving the most recent communications on the network at the time of the notice. This would provide a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of the existing communications on networks up to that point which can be downloaded to other storage devices, e.g., long term or off-site storage devices. Going forward, recording of current communications on the network is seamlessly transferred to the parallel circular buffer unit. Thus, the most recent past data is preserved, while current and future data is captured as well. In other words, multiple banks of storage buffers can serially store data e.g., via flip-flopping or round robin, until an event occurs, at which point, the most recent storage buffer changes to a download mode, while the unused storage buffer is swapped to assume the duty of recording current communications. Storage buffer  can be either an external unit communicating to access device -A or it can be a unit integrated into access device -A. Storage buffer  is coupled to MME server  to provide data back and forth between the units.","While  illustrate an integrated storage buffer  and MME server  located in each Access engine, e.g., as a card in a blade server, for element -A, the present disclosure is well suited to implementing the functions in a distributed metadata server device and storage buffer device, either as a standalone or incorporated in another engine, i.e., the metadata mediation engine .","Additionally, while access device -A is illustrated for collecting data on communications on a hardwire communication system, e.g., electromagnetic signal communication on copper lines or electromagnetic light waves on a fiber optic line via taps, etc., it can also be implemented via receivers or probes on other communication links such as wireless, e.g., satellite, radio signals including microwave, cellular communications, etc., via either monitoring that link in its domain, e.g., wirelessly on the airwaves, or monitoring it in the wired domain, e.g., accessing cellular communications when transmitting through hardwire links in the mobile telephone switching office (MTSO) or via a subscribers wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi\u2122) network","Referring now to , a block diagram of a mass metadata extraction (MME) and advanced targeting engine, or metadata mediation engine, 402 portion of the network security system, for evaluating a metadata portion of the network traffic, is shown, according to one or more embodiments. Metadata mediation engine  embodies the metadata mediation functions  and advanced targeting function  of  for second data path.","MME and Advanced Targeting engine  includes a 1 G\/10 G Ethernet card  coupled to a storage buffer , for receiving and buffering the first few packets of raw metadata for each session, e.g., primarily for users not currently of interests received from MME server , via connection \u201cB\u201d from AMB engine -A of , and for receiving and buffering collected data, e.g., for known users of interest and new users of interest, via connection \u201cE\u201d from data mediation engine  of . Thereafter, both the first few packets with the raw metadata and the collected data is communicated to metadata extraction engine , which strips and retains, the metadata portion of the raw metadata and the collected data, and communicates the processed metadata to the MME output handler , while discarding the rest of the content. The MME output handler  groups, labels, and packetizes the metadata for subsequent communication to the MME output application programming interface (API)  for transmission to collection and analysis engine , via connection \u201cG.\u201d Metadata extraction engine  is implemented in one embodiment using any commercially available deep packet inspection solution for inspecting and\/or filtering of the packets for advanced network management, user service, and security functions as well as internet data mining and other functions.","Advanced targeting function  of  is specifically accomplished by advanced targeting agent engine  communicating with both MME output handler  for known user update -B and known user configuration -A as well as with data mediation engine  of , via connection \u201cD.\u201d In particular, advanced targeting agent engine  implements algorithms and recursive analysis to infer relationships and correlations between known-user-data received from data mediation engine  and metadata portions of known users of interest and users not currently of interest collected from the network. The newly identified user not currently of interest is then labeled as a \u2018new user of interest\u2019 and communicated to data mediation engine  for provisioning on the network via the Access engine of . Storage buffer , metadata extraction engine , MME output handler , advanced targeting agent engine , and MME output API  can all be implemented as discrete devices or as integrated functions on a personal computer, minicomputer, server or other suitable device.","Referring now to , a block diagram of a data mediation engine  portion of the network security system for provisioning known users to be monitored and for mediating collected data is shown, according to one or more embodiments. Data mediation engine  embodies the mediation function  for known users of interest and new users of interest for both first data path and second path, as shown in .","Data mediation engine  includes a load balancer  for receiving collected data, including known users of interest and new users of interest, per connection \u201cC,\u201d from at least one AMBs -A to -Ap through -, and spraying, or distributing, the data across one or more data processing units (DPUs) - through -coupled to one or more data storage units (DSUs) - through -, respectively, and together referred to as data processing engines, where f\u22670 and g\u22670 and in some cases f=g for matched paring between the units, though multiplexing can occur with f being different than g.","The DPUs - through -, also known as an internetwork protocol data units (IPDUs), organize the collected packets for content delivery, eliminate any packets not authorized to be captured, fan-out packets destined for multiple analysts and ensure the packet is only sent once to an analyst that has multiple known users of interest that request the same packet and routes them to the DSUs for temporary storage for subsequent communication to collection and analysis engine  of , per connector \u201cF.\u201d In addition, DPUs - to -are coupled to target mediation engine  which receives potential new users of interest from metadata mediation engine  of , per connector \u201cD,\u201d and compares them to known users of interest being processed in DPUs - to -as well as performing administrative tracking and approval of potential new user of interest before provisioning them to Access devices -A to -Ap through -, via connector \u201cA.\u201d DPUs and DSUs can be proprietary communication cards or off-the-shelf line cards. Any commercially available or proprietary-design DPU may be used for this function, given the adaptation and implementation of drivers specific to the actual device. Target mediation engine  can be implemented as a discrete ASIC device or as an integrated function on a personal computer, minicomputer, server or other suitable device.","While only one load balancer  is illustrated, the data mediation engine  can utilize any number of load balancers and any quantity of data processing engines to provide a scalable system based on the quantity of data streams, based on the data rates, and based on any other application or customer needs to provide a functional system. A modular network chassis can be utilized with any quantity of slots for line cards or application specific engines to accommodate data processing engines.","Referring now to , a block diagram of a collection and analysis engine  of the network security system for analyzing and presenting collected data to the analyst is shown, according to one or more embodiments. The collection and analysis engine  embodies the collecting and analyzing function  for collected data from the network, as shown in .","A plurality of sources provide information delivered to collection and analysis engine , namely metadata information via connection \u201cG\u201d from metadata mediation engine  of , and collected data via connection \u201cF\u201d from data mediation engine  of .

Analysis tools engines - through -can include proprietary tools known to those of ordinary skill in the art of network analysis. This enables the multi-tenant functionality of the NMS including a situation where same data of the known user of interest or user not currently of interest and\/or analysis of the user is provided by a fanout feature to multiple analysts.","Servers mentioned hereinabove, e.g., MME server , server for metadata mediation engine , server for data mediation engine , or FTP server , or any other function in the scalable network monitoring system, can be any brand of server, e.g., Sun\u2122, HP\u2122, etc., and any type of server computer, e.g., application server, blade server or any processing device capable of performing the data management and communication functions with any quantity of cores, e.g., six (6) core X86 Intel Quad Xeon MP, which can be programmed for any type of operating system (\u201cOS\u201d), e.g., Solaris, UNIX, LINUX, or other computing OSs.","Case Table","Referring now to , case tables -A through -C illustrating several different possible combinations of known users of interest and users not currently of interest communicating on a network to be monitored are shown, according to one or more embodiments. Descriptions of columns A through column GG for case table are described immediately hereafter as exemplary fields, which fields are able to be reduced or expanded as desired by a given analyst. Column letters I, O, Q, S, X, and Z are intentionally omitted. The substantive entries for each case, e.g., each cell in rows - of data in the table, are fictitious and provided as arbitrary examples to illustrate the disclosure, and will be described in respective portions of flowcharts of . All or part of case tables -A through -C, and additional management data, can be implemented as a lookup table (LUT) in memory managed by a controller or microprocessor of NMS complying with protocol instructions, e.g., per the method of a first data path of metadata and content for known users, second data path of metadata only for some or all users, and third data path of metadata and content for all or selected users, as described for .","Referring now to , a case table -A illustrating data entry to data mediation engine and access function, showing several different possible combinations of identification and collection scenarios for known users of interest and users not currently of interest communicating on a network, is shown according to one or more embodiments. Columns A through N of table -A illustrate data entry values provided to data mediation engine  via known user input block  shown in , viz., as input by an analyst. In particular, column A of case table -A is an authorization identification (AUTH ID), while column C provides a known user of interest, e.g., a known user name for an individual or a company name for a corporation, or a pseudonym, handle, nom de plume, nom de guerre, alias, chat room name, or other identifier. Column C also includes parenthetical names of users not currently of interest in rows , , and . Column D provides a known user type, such as the medium, link, channel, or other communication media or format on which metadata and content is communicated, thereby indicating what network or format should be provisioned for collection of data. Column E refers to a network identification (NW ID) on which the communication is sought. No column is provided for metadata, as it is presumed that metadata is available for monitoring on all users, including both known users of interest and users not currently of interest.","Column F refers to a third party (3PTY) to whom a known user of interest is communicating. Columns G, H, and J refer to timing of when monitoring is sought, e.g., a start day or date, a duration time or ending date, and times of day during a user prescribes monitoring, respectively. Column K lists the analyst, while the analyst's supervisor or manager is listed in column L, and while a preauthorized contact identification (CONTACT ID) is listed in column M. Column N refers to a known user ID that is assigned by the network monitoring system to the unique case described in the table, e.g., the given combination of variables, or fields, for the given known user of interest. Similarly, column N refers to a record ID that is assigned by the network monitoring system as well, in order to unique case described in the table for known users of interest and users not currently of interest. Thus, with a unique known user ID and\/or record ID, the data streams, or packets of data, can be tagged or wrapped, e.g., in the header of a packet, with the unique known user ID and record ID. This allows the packet to be processed in the NMS as a discrete and traceable packet on fungible or proprietary, and scalable, hardware and engines, seeing as the unique known user ID and\/or record ID can be determined for a given packet, and thus its data can be collected and processed for the given known user ID. A NMS could deselect some of the variables listed in the columns or add other columns such as, for example: known user bio information such as social security number, driver's license number(s), etc.; analyst information such as comments and suspected relationships to other known users, etc.","Rows  through  represent known users that are available to enter into an NMS at a given point in time. Row  is a known user of interest that only becomes known at a future point in time for entering into the NMS, and is thus segregated away from the known users of interest ready to enter immediately. Rows - are users not currently of interest presented in the table for comparison and explanation of subsequent steps on known users and new users, and are not typically entered into the LUT system for tracking known user IDs. Row  represents all known users of interest on all networks serviced by NMS while row  represents all users currently not of interest on all networks serviced by NMS; together which represents all available users on all networks serviced by NMS.","Referring now to , a table -B, illustrating functions of access and mediation, mass metadata processing, and circular buffer functions, e.g., first, second, and third path of data processing of , for data collected from known users of interest and users not currently of interest communicating on a network, is shown according to one or more embodiments. Column N known user ID, and column N record ID, for known users of interest and users not currently of interest respectively, are repeated in table -B because the known user ID or record ID is retained with the collected data as it propagates through the NMS, and thus will be available to any engine in the NMS. Column D, known user type, is repeated in table -B for convenience of reading the table. Table heading \u201cAccess+Mediate\u201d includes columns T through W which represent variables used in access device -A, or access portion thereof, of  and data mediation engine  of  for processing of the data streams. In particular, column T identifies the Mediation user ID, for an administrator or analyst that has access to the mediation functions of the NMS. Column T indicates an Access probe ID used to collect data on a given network. In some cases, multiple probes will be used on a network, and thus, both probes may have to be provisioned and tracked. The probe IDs and network IDs used in tables -A and -B are exemplary and do not necessarily match NW IDs shown in preceding hardware figures. Column V indicates which known user of interest and which user not currently of interest has mass metadata engine input (MME INPUT) to the NMS. Because all metadata is accessible by the NMS, including both known users and users not currently of interest, every row has a check. However, the analyst can selectively gain metadata information for whichever known users or users not currently of interest desired, possibly based on prioritizing limited resources to only known users and to suspicious users not currently of interest for a high-data rate scenario. Column W refers to communication, e.g., for content of communication, which in most scenarios are limited to known users. Table heading \u201cCircular Buffer\u201d includes column Y which indicates which data is being recorded in storage, or circular, buffer  of .","Table heading \u201cMME\u201d includes Column N; known user ID, again for the MME function performed on the data. Column AA indicates whether the Metadata is recorded and evaluated by the MME mediation engine; while column BB indicate whether an analyst has a relationship to a known user of interest, e.g., to known user ID of \u201c2\u201d in this example; and while column CC indicates whether a newly auto provisioned new user of interest was established by the MME function.","Referring now to , a table -C, illustrating collection and analysis of data provided by the network security system for GUI display, is shown according to one or more embodiments. Table -C includes column N known user ID, and column N record ID, as these identifiers travel with the data stream through the NMS for known users and users not currently of interest respectively. Table heading \u201cCollection\u2014GUI Output\u201d includes: column DD for memory location in the FTP server  of ; column EE to indicate content available to GUI output, column FF to indicate metadata available to GUI output, and column GG for dossier information available to GUI output, e.g., a summation of known user and user not currently of interest related information and other analysts comments and analysis. Note that memory location per column DD for common known users of interest has row  utilizing memory locations M+M and row  utilizing the same memory locations M+M, seeing as their known user data matches in important areas, such as same known user of interest, same time of collection, etc., per Table A that would allow the access to that same data by different analysts, thus saving memory by storing the data once, all while maintaining confidentiality and security between the two analysts, for multi-tenant.","Method of Use",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A through 8C"},"Referring now to , a flowchart -A of a method for collecting data streams on a network is shown, according to one or more embodiments. Flowchart -A begins with step  of receiving at a network monitoring system (NMS), a known user of interest to be monitored on the network. Step  is implemented by entering known user information via known user input  of  for columns A-M of table -A of  for known users belonging to a given analyst in column K, typically segregated for security and confidentiality purposes. Thus, analyst L would enter their known user info in columns A-M for \u201cDewey Doe\u201d of row . Similarly, analyst L enters their known user info in rows  for \u201cJohn Doe\u201d, and  for \u201cTom Doe,\u201d while analyst L enters known user info in rows  for \u201cChee Doe,\u201d row  for John Doe, row  for \u201cJohn Doe\u201d, and row  for \u201cClyde Jones,\u201d and while analyst L enters known user info in rows  for \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d which is the same known user and known user type, e.g. cell phone, as row , but for a different analyst, and other different factors. At some point in the future, analyst L would enter the information for row  for \u201cMary Smith,\u201d which in this example would only be available at some time in the future. Analysts L-L can enter data according to their own independent timetables, and their independent data input facility. Step  includes the creation of a known user ID in known user input  for the given known user data entered into the NMS.","Alternatively, if implementing a multi-tenant feature of the present disclosure on the NMS, a given neutral administrator could be tasked with entering all known user information for all analysts using the present disclosure, because after being entered, the NMS via the look up table (LUT) would be able to discriminate which data belonged to which known user of interest belonged to which analyst, and could make that information only available to the given analyst with administrative privileges to see it.","Furthermore, with a multi-network feature of the present disclosure, a given analyst entering information for different systems would not have to enter them on different systems slated for different networks. Instead, a given analyst could enter the known user information on a single NMS system for collecting data streams for known users of interest on different networks. Without the multi-network feature the analyst might have to enter known user info on multiple systems, one for each communication network on which the known user of interest is suspected of communicating. Combined together, multi-tenant and multi-network could provide a single NMS with which a single analyst could enter known user information for multiple analysts collecting data on multiple networks, resulting in substantial reductions in turnaround times, bureaucratic conflicts, operating expense, and other resources.","Step  is for creating a known user identification (known user ID) for the known user, wherein the known user ID is unique to the NMS in order to track data streams of the known user of interest during subsequent processing, such as extraction of content and metadata, in the NMS. Step  is implemented by the NMS, and specifically the data mediation engine  of , by having an accounting system that provides unique known user ID numbers for a given unique known user, e.g., one having unique values for all the variables desired, e.g., some or all of columns A through M of table -A, all of which values presented in given rows - are unique with respect to each other. The NMS accounting system would also time out or delete, known user ID values when a given known user of interest had expired or been expunged by an analyst. The known user ID is unique for a combination of information chosen from a set of data including, but not limited to: the known user, e.g., a known user name, phone number, handle, etc.; a known user type associated with the known user; relational data associated with the known user such as a network provider ID, a data collect time and a data collect date, network ID, etc. A look up table (LUT) or other relational data or database system can be used to track the known user and the data streams of the known user. A single common database\/LUT, or a plurality of databases\/LUTs, can be used for tracking known users of interest and\/or users not currently of interest or new users of interest.","Regarding multi-tenant and multi-network features, the different network values entered in columns K and E, respectively, provide another variable for the row, thus making them unique with respect to each other, and thereby resulting in different known user IDs. For example, similar known user of interest John Doe in Row  and  has different tenants of analysts L and L as well as different networks NW and NW, respectively.","Step  inquires whether additional users are to be entered, and if so, returns to step  to repeat steps of receiving a known user and creating a known user ID, so the known user can be provisioned and collected in a group. Step  is implemented in table -A by entering information for known users that haven't been entered or are newly available, e.g., for rows - currently, or for row  when it is available in the future. Row  can be entered at the time it becomes available.","Step  implements optional aggregating of the known users of interest received at the NMS to determine a superset of data streams to be provisioned and collected in order to prevent duplication of effort and data in the NMS, due to the intensive storage requirements of current high data rate communications. Step  is implemented by data mediation engine  examining via software algorithms and comparing values in memory for all entered known users of interest and seeking any rows that are identical for all appropriate fields. The aggregating step can also provide hierarchical grouping functions per user-defined fields, e.g., primarily grouping known users of interest per the network to which they are listed, secondarily grouping known users by date, etc.","Step  involves provisioning a list of known user IDs via a data mediation engine  to access device(s), e.g., -A, of  in order to collect data streams used by the known users on one or more networks. The provisioning step can include provisioning multiple access devices for a given network, e.g., -A and -Ap coupled to network NW -. In particular, step  is implemented by communicating known user type information of column D assigned by data mediation engine  per algorithms developed to known user given data communication types and links, e.g., phone number, webmail address, etc.","Step  implements collecting data on the network. In one embodiment, only known user data is collected on the network, by searching for strings of identifiers in traffic that match identifiers of known user sought, e.g., the known user name, or alias, per column C, or known user type, per column D, and given chronology variables as in columns G, H and J, amongst other potentially important variables, such as the third-person to whom a known user is communicating, e.g., column F. In another embodiment, the entire data stream, including both metadata and content, for all available users of the network, is collected and then segregated into appropriate portions of data depending on an application and level of monitoring desired by the analyst. Other embodiments can be implemented in step  to retrieve: portions of data streams, e.g., content and\/or metadata; for known users, users not currently of interest portions thereof, or any population of communication network users that NMS defines, e.g., by an ad hoc or an algorithmic rule.","In one embodiment, the entire data signal, e.g., content and metadata, of all available users on the network are communicated to the AMB device for access. The different quantities of collected data are segregated and split off for different levels of processing as described in a subsequent step. The present disclosure is well-suited to monitoring a wide range of signal types and a wide range of one or more collection conditions, seeing as content and metadata can be analyzed to determine compliance with a given monitoring condition.","Step  is for transmitting the collected data streams to the NMS for subsequent analysis. Step  is implemented differently depending upon what types of data streams are being collected. In one embodiment, parallel data paths, as described in  of a first, second, and third data path, are communicated in parallel to different respective portions of a NMS for processing according to the protocol of the specific data path. In the present embodiment, the metadata and content for all available users of the network is communicated to engines in each of the three data paths, where the data is then reduced as required by the protocol for that data path. Thus, in the present embodiment, the metadata and content for all available users of the network is communicated via: connector \u201c1\u201d to flowchart -B of  for processing of first data path; connector \u201c2\u201d to flowchart -C of  for processing of second data path, and connector \u201c3\u201d to flowchart -D of  for processing of third data path. Thus, the flow paths are: 1) known user of interest mediation of first data path which will strip out and analyze the content portion of data stream for known users of interest, including new users of interest, and pass the first few packets of the data stream containing primarily raw metadata to the metadata mediation of second data path; 2) while similarly the first few data packets of all non-users are sent to the metadata mediation of the second data path in parallel, wherein the metadata is further refined; and 3) while retained data mediation of third data path will accept and record data, e.g., both metadata and content, of desired data streams, e.g., all communication network users.","Referring now to , flowchart -B, continued via connector \u201c1\u201d from , of a method of mediating the collected data, is shown according to one or more embodiments. Flowchart -B embodies the first data path function of the NMS illustrated in  starting with step  of receiving the metadata and content for all available users of the network from the access portion of the NMS via connector \u201cC\u201d of , at the load balancer . When a data stream containing metadata, content or both are received at the load balancer , then it proceeds directly to subsequent distributing step.","Step  is for distributing the data streams across a scalable quantity of data processing engines, such as data processing units (DPUs) and data storage units (DSUs), in the NMS. Step  is implemented by load balancer  distributing, or spraying, data streams across the scalable quantity of DPUs - to -and then to subsequent DSUs - to -, together \u201cdata processing engines.\u201d The process of distributing or spraying the data streams can be done according to balancing a quantity of data streams themselves, or balancing a quantity of data in the data streams. The present embodiment balances the quantity of data streams across the scalable quantity of data processing engines. A modulo-x algorithm may be used where \u2018x\u2019 is the quantity of branches or parallel data processing engines that are used. Thus, if values \u2018f\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019 equal 4 for the DPUs and DSUs, then a modulo-4 algorithm would be used to deal one out of every four a sequential data streams to each of the multiple DPU and DSU sets. Other techniques for load balancing and traffic management in an even or a biased distribution across the multiple DPUs and DSUs can be implemented in the present disclosure as well.","In step , evaluating a metadata portion of the data streams is performed using a scalable quantity of DPUs. This step essentially screens the metadata and content for all available users of the network for known user data. Step  is implemented by DPUs examining the metadata portion of the data stream and comparing it to the known user ID criteria of LUT as exemplified in Table -A of . Data streams that do not qualify as known users do not advance to DSU units - to -. Thus, while the metadata and content for all available users of the network may be evenly distributed across multiple DPUs, the resulting known user data streams that pass to the multiple DSUs may not be evenly distributed. A feedback loop to load balancer from multiple DSUs - to -may help to more evenly distribute data streams if a given DSU becomes burdened with a higher than normal traffic rate.","Step  implements tagging the data streams of the known user that are collected from the network, with a respective known user ID and optionally a record ID. Thus for example, when a cell phone communication is discovered on a cell network, e.g., via active collection into the mobile traffic switching office (MTSO) or via packetized cell data passed on a network such as the Internet, for known user John Doe, per Row  of Table -A having a known user ID of \u201c2,\u201d and a record ID of \u201c82,\u201d then this known user ID and record ID is then embedded, e.g., in the header, in the data stream for future reference during processing in the NMS or collection and analysis by an analyst. Thus data collected for rows  through  will be tagged with respective known user IDs -, and record IDs - respectively. Step  tagging can be implemented in various alternative embodiments, with either access components performing the tagging, or with mediation engines performing the tagging step. In one embodiment, tagging can occur at the time a data stream is collected, e.g., for known users, or at a later time, such as when retained record is retrieved from a historical file and re-designated as a new user and is now tagged and entered into the NMS for processing and analysis. An example of retained data used for a new user would be when data is stored on the NMS from the analyst that was originally a unknown user but who has now become a new user.","Step  can be implemented in different ways depending upon the number of modular features and functions integrated into their NMS. For example, an NMS can be configured to only mediate known user content for the first data path, or to analyze metadata of unknown users and known users for the second data path, or to retain data for some or all of known users and unknown users for the third data path, or any combination of these functions. Thus, in another embodiment, data streams for known users are tagged with a known user ID for analysis of content and tagged with record ID for analysis of metadata and\/or for short-term retained data storage, while data streams for unknown users are tagged with a record ID for analysis of metadata and\/or for short-term retained data storage in circular buffer. If known users are only mediated for known user content for the first data path and are not analyzed for metadata, and their data is not retained for future use, then only a Known user ID is used and a RID is not needed. Tagging a data stream with a record ID or a known user ID can be implemented by using a wrapper around an existing packet in one embodiment. For retained data function, tagging of known user ID and record ID for retained data stored in storage buffer  can be performed by MME server  of , or by Metadata extraction engine  of  and communicated back to storage buffer . For metadata mediation, tagging of record ID for a user not currently of interest, and known user ID for a known user, can also be performed by MME server  of , or by Metadata extraction engine  of .","Step  is implemented by known user mediation engine  of  that receives metadata of data streams and evaluates the known user, known user type, and other factors of the data communication that allows the system to identify the data stream uniquely, per the LUT -A for example, and then tags the previously assigned known user ID value into the respective data stream for subsequent processing in the NMS, e.g., the DPU - through -and DSU - through -, and subsequent engines.","With step , storing a content portion of the data streams is performed in a scalable quantity of data storage units DSUs - to -as shown in . This storing process buffers the data streams before being passed via connection \u201cF\u201d to collection and analysis engine  of . Thereafter flowchart -B proceeds to connector \u201cDD\u201d which leads to  flowchart -E of a method for analysis and collection of data.","Referring now to , a flowchart -C, continued via connector \u201c2\u201d from , of a method of mass metadata extraction and analysis is shown, according to one or more embodiments. Flowchart -C embodies the optional second data path function, illustrated in  of processing, e.g., collecting and mediating, the mass metadata of at least one of the data streams, or of all the data streams of known users and users not currently of interest and\/or new users of interest on the network. A substantial amount of relational data can be obtained between known users and users not currently of interest, and combinations thereof, via the metadata.","Step  implements tagging the data streams of the users not currently of interest that are collected from the network, with a respective record ID (RID) for subsequent metadata mediation. The data as content or metadata from either the known user and\/or new users or user not currently of interest are provided from step . Thus for example, when a data stream of a new unknown user is identified and the first few packets of the session are sent via MME server  to MME and Advanced Targeting , then metadata extraction engine  can assign a new record ID and tag or wrap the data received from access with the RID. For example, the data collected by access for rows  through  are users not currently of interest and thus will be tagged with respective record IDs -. RID for both known users and users not currently of interest are any unique code for referencing or correlating, including either a: date\/time stamp, a revolving number, or etc.","In step  the evaluating of the metadata portion of the data stream of all users of the network is performed, after receiving the metadata and content for all available users of the network from flowchart -A via connector \u201c2,\u201d at 1 G\/10 G Ethernet interface  coupled to storage buffer  to accommodate bursts of data or variations of data rates between engines. Step  is implemented by metadata extraction engine  that evaluates the incoming the metadata and content for all available users of the network stream and removes only the metadata portion, e.g., the sender name, receiver name, date and time of transmission, size of communication, attachment file identification, subject line, size of attachment, format or file type of attachment, known user type, protocol of communication, session identification, location, proxy server identification if applicable, and any other logistical information describing the content or the communication link, typically located in a header and\/or footer. To locate the metadata, a deep packet inspection per protocol is performed on the data stream. First, the type of communication is identified, e.g., VOIP; Yahoo!\u2122, Gmail\u2122, or Hotmail\u2122, email; chat; video streaming; etc. Then the metadata is retrieved based upon the protocol for that type of communication, which defines the location of the metadata, e.g., a specific bit location in the header of the first or second IP packet for an email. Depending on the protocol, the raw metadata can usually be extracted from the data stream, by line card - and PIM data card , as the first several packets of a session for a given communication network user with the balance of the packets in a data stream being discarded as not needed for metadata meditation. The term \u201cmass metadata extraction\u201d refers to extracting metadata from the entire mass of, e.g., all, users of a communication network. However, step  and metadata extraction engine  can be applied to any quantity of users of a system, from none to all available users. This analysis of all users can occur in parallel, e.g., on multiple parallel engines; or nearly simultaneously on a single engine.","MME server  can be programmed to send to metadata MME and Advanced Targeting  only the first several packets of a session that are known to contain the metadata, and not send the subsequent data packets that contain content. Alternatively, metadata mediation engine  can be programmed to provide a feedback to MME server  when the metadata for a given session has been retrieved and no further packets are necessary for the given session ID. If the data stream is being actively monitored and collected from the network, then that data is currently available. However, if the known user of interest was identified only after a session started, then MME server  can request storage buffer  to retrieve the retained data for the given known user of interest for delivery to metadata mediation engine , assuming the storage buffer is large enough and\/or the retained data didn't occur too far in the past to be already overwritten.","Step  is for identifying a relationship between at least two of a plurality of data streams from a plurality of network users of a network, e.g., between known users of interest to other known users of interest, known users of interest to users not currently of interest, or between two users not currently of interest and combinations thereof. Sometimes a relationship is not apparent between two or more users of a communication system, whether they are either known users of interest, or users not currently of interest or new users of interest. In this case, a relationship, or link, is created using metrics and other fields of data from both users, along with the evidence that supports the supposition of the relationship, which can optionally be noticed, reviewed and\/or approved by an analyst for validity or sufficiency of evidence, e.g., as transmitted from step  to collection and analysis methods described in flowchart -E. The analyst would have the ability to override the autoprovisioning and thereby withdraw the new user of interest from being monitored on the network and changing the status of the new user of interest back to a user not currently of interest. The increasing separation between two users, e.g., the existence of intermediate users or factors, can be referred to as or degrees of separation (DOS), or degrees of freedom (DOF). A high DOS may make two users of a communication system less likely to have a relationship, but it still may exist, e.g., at different levels of involvement or strategy in a solicitation or conspiracy. For example if a given user passes an email attachment to another user who then passes it to a third and fourth user, then the given user may be sufficiently connected to a fifth user who commits a crime based on a solicitation from the fourth user. If a DOS is sufficient, e.g., meets a threshold of quantity of degrees of separation set by analyst, then the status of the user not currently of interest may be changed to that of a new user of interest, e.g., by assigning a known user ID (TID) to the new user. Step  is implemented using mass metadata extraction (MME) output handler  which contains algorithms operated on a processor to tabulate metadata and list patterns and degrees of separation between network users, etc. The relationship can be determined from known data, e.g., familial relationships, historical data, etc., or can be constructed by looking for patterns or similarities from a given known user's content or metadata to other users' content and\/or metadata, if they are known users of interest or to other users' metadata if they are unknown users. Thus, step  may identify a new user as a potential new user of interest based on the relationship of the metadata of the user not currently of interest to any data of the known user of interest. As exemplified in , the second data path function herein would produce the linking data between John Doe's communications on row  and  along with the user not currently of interest communications of John Doe on row  and  and with the user not currently of interest communications of Mrs. J. Doe on row , assuming a LEA provided a link between Mrs. J. Doe and John Doe; or assuming metadata analysis provided linking logistical analysis, e.g., origination of communication by John Doe and Mrs. J. Doe from same physical address. The information of which network users contacted which network users, at what chronology information (time, date, duration, etc.), would be available to all analysts. And that information together with the known user information available to LEA L and L for rows  and , respectively, a larger comprehensive picture can be established of the known users of interest and other known users of interest and users not currently of interest that might become new users of interest in the future, possibly based on the information gathered herein","Step  is for identifying a new user of interest to monitor which is implemented in the present embodiment by algorithms based on experience, stochastic processes, and\/or other factors, and combinations thereof. That is, step  can identify, a user not currently of interest as a potential new user of interest, e.g., create a new user, based on evaluating data, e.g., the relationship of the metadata of the user not currently of interest to any data of the known user of interest, retrieved from the network. A new user of interest may be identified by an advanced algorithm that is capable of identifying the new user of interest automatically by algorithms with or without identification or evaluation by an analyst. That is, autoprovisioning is capable of identifying a new user of interest on the network solely based on the evaluating of the data retrieved from the network. Step  is implemented by processor in MME and advanced targeting engine , and in particular by MME output handler  that implements these algorithms and rules. Thus, in the example provided for step , the relationship identified between Mrs. J. Doe communicating to John Doe on row , and then the subsequent communication from Mrs. J. Doe to Shady Joe on row  might raise the inference that Mrs. J. Doe should become a new user of interest, especially since John Doe is already a known user of interest with respect to communications with Shady Joe per row . In another embodiment, the existence of a known user of interest for a given analyst is utilized in step  for determining the strength of a case for creating a new user for another analyst, though none of the substantive data collected from a first analyst is directly given to a second analyst who does not have the known user, without the second analyst generating the known user of interest per protocol themselves as prompted after generation per finding new users of interest. While the example provided simply linked communications between network users, much more sophisticated linking can occur using other variables and fields from metadata, e.g., a common subject reference, a meeting location, a same attachment to an email, etc.","Step  inquires whether the new user of interest is listed as an existing known user of interest already for purposes of avoiding duplication of effort. In particular, step  inquires whether a new user for a second analyst already exists as a known user of interest for a first analyst. Step  is implemented by advanced targeting agent engine  communicating to MME output handler  the results of a search through existing known users in its memory for one that matches a desired new user, sought by MME output handler . If the requested new user of interest already exists, then a pointer per step  is provided for the second request for the collected data of the known user of interest to point it to the data, or portion of data, that has already been collected for the known user of interest.","If there is no overlap or only a partial overlap between a potential new user of interest against a known user of interest per step , then the new user's information can be provisioned to be collected based upon the relationship discovered by the metadata processing unit for the portion of data needed. The provisioning step  is implemented by target mediation engine , acting as an interface manager, in data mediation engine  of  that is coupled via coupling \u201cD\u201d to advanced targeting agent engine  of MME and advanced targeting engine  of . Subsequently, step  collects any available data streams on the network that meet the predetermined criteria via to access device, e.g., -A--Ap and - of . Thereafter flowchart -C proceeds to connector \u201cBB,\u201d which leads back to step  of  for receiving data for known user, e.g., including new user of interest, and proceeds in parallel via connector \u201cDD\u201d which leads to  flowchart -E of a method for analysis and collection of data. Connector BB essentially communicates an ID, e.g., a RID, for the new user to the access device; and monitors the network to collect data, either content or metadata, related to the new user. Thereafter, metadata processing engine can process data from the new user as described herein.","Referring now to , a flowchart -D, continued via connector \u201c3\u201d from , of a method of storing and retrieving data on a circular buffer is shown, according to one or more embodiments. Flowchart -D embodies the optional third data path function, illustrated in , of storing collected data on a circular buffer storage and retrieving the retained data on the circular buffer storage at a later time. This method allows the convenience of retrieving data from a circular buffer that stores only a given timeframe of data before being overwritten. A system such as this becomes invaluable when needing to look back in time after the occurrence of a serious security breach to retrieve network communication data that is otherwise not collectable.","Step  implements tagging the data streams of known users of interest with a known user ID (TID) and a record ID (RID) and tagging the data streams of users not currently of interest whose data is collected from the network, with only a RID, for subsequent storage as retained data. Thus for example, when data streams of a known user or a user not currently of interest are received in access portion of the NMS, MME server  can identify known users of interests, and tag or wrap them with the RID and Known user ID, as well as identify users not currently of interest s and tag or wrap them with the RID (TID is ZERO), then pass them all to storage buffer . Step  can optionally perform the tagging portion of this step for the known users of interest.","Step  is for storing data on a circular storage device, such as a circular, or storage, buffer  of , for future access. Storage of data can be performed according to any protocol, whether storing just a portion of, or a full content of, the data streams collected from the network, and whether collecting a portion of the users of the network or all the users of the network. Thus the present method may store both the content and metadata for both known users of interest and users not currently of interest collected from the network, or any other combination desired by an analyst. Step  is implemented in  by receiving at a storage buffer , the collected data from a network via an access device, e.g., as provided by line cards - thru -and via 1 G\/10 G Ethernet I\/F . Management of the portion of data stored is provided by control lines, not shown, in  that communicate to the analyst storage preferences to known user input block  to AMB, e.g., -A, via data mediation engine . As shown in , column \u201cY\u201d has a \u201cYES\u201d for every row entry in the present embodiment, thus indicating that every data stream, whether known user or user not currently of interest would be recorded on the circular, or storage, buffer . In an optional embodiment, prioritization can be added to given known users and user not currently of interest that have higher likelihood of needing retained data. Thus, in table -B of , rows , , , and  have a \u201cYES-1\u201d entry for column \u201cY\u201d circular buffer, indicating that they have a longer retention time, e.g., overwriting only after a given quantity of cycles, an elapsed time, or a command from an analyst or the NMS system. The record ID and\/or known user ID is stored along with the content and\/or metadata in the storage buffer , so that the stored content and\/or metadata may be retrieved at some later point per a request referencing the RID and\/or TID.","Step  is for overwriting data on the circular buffer, which automatically occurs once the circular buffer capacity has been reached. While the present embodiment utilizes an overwrite protocol that overwrites data continuously on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, the present disclosure is well-suited to a wide range of overwriting algorithms, with optional hierarchical and Pareto sequencing formats for more important data streams, e.g., for suspected but not actual known users. Step  is implemented for every AMB device on every network, or on prioritized AMB(s) on prioritized network(s). Thus, a given known user of interest may have fragmented data that is distributed across multiple storage buffers on multiple AMB engines.","Step  is for retrieving data from circular buffer . A request to retrieve data can be provided by an analyst or by an auto provisioning request. Once received, circular buffer will seek the oldest data for a requested known user or network user. Retained data of either content or metadata can be retrieved from circular buffer via known user ID, record ID, or other global search term. Optionally, circular buffer can be programmed to preserve critical data that would otherwise be overwritten, by selectively skipping over the desired data when overwriting new incoming data, either for either a prescribed or an indefinite time period. Additional circular storage buffers may be coupled to the 1 G\/10 G interface so as to preserve the entire record of network communication at the occurrence of a serious security breach. Once requested to be retrieved, retained data can enter into the NMS similar to a real-time collected data stream on the first data path per connector \u201cBB\u201d back to , e.g., via a 10 G line card -transmitting via PIMS card  of  to data mediation block  of , where target mediation block would identify the new user of interest from LUT -A and tag the data stream for subsequent processing, such as processing per flowchart -E of a method for analysis and collection of data. Alternatively, if circular buffer is centrally located, then a single request to a single circular buffer will suffice to retrieve any existing data.","Referring now to , a flowchart, continued via connector \u201cDD\u201d from either , C, or D of a method of collecting and analyzing collected data is shown, according to one or more embodiments. Step  is for receiving processed data at a collection and analysis portion of the NMS. Step  is implemented by receiving and buffering on FTP server : content and meta data of known users and\/or new users of interest from the scalable quantity of data processing engines, e.g., DPUs and DSUs, per  connector \u201cF\u201d; metadata from users not currently of interest, from MME & advanced targeting engine  connector \u201cG;\u201d and other relational data and metrics from any combination of first, second, and third data path.","Step  is for evaluating relational data between data streams of users at an analysis system for performing analysis, evaluation, feedback, and\/or output to user interface. Step  is implemented via further processing methods including: link charts; dossier collection of metadata and\/or content for a given record ID of a user not currently of interest or for a given known user ID or a given known user of interest comprising multiple known user IDs; social networking program for interactive processing of metadata or content of a given known user or user not currently of interest by an analyst with respect to other known users of interest or users not currently of interest; relational data analysis between multiple network users, whether known users of interest or users not currently of interest, using content and\/or metadata; relationship and a degree of freedom, or degree of separation, graphing or tabulation between a plurality of network users, etc. on analysis tools platforms - to -","Step  is for displaying the data of the known user collected on the network on analysis GUI. Optionally, processed or analyzed data may be displayed on GUI for subsequent interface, feedback and instructions from the analyst. The analysis GUI is operable to receive commands from an analysis user in order to collect additional data, query the system, or add notes or other metadata regarding the known user or user not currently of interest.","Multi-Tenant and Multi-network usage of a single NMS is implemented by tracking and controlling access to known users, users not currently of interest and their data via an analyst ID vis-\u00e0-vis a known user ID and\/or record ID, where the analyst ID specifies the administrative rights and privileges the analyst has on the NMS, e.g., to the known users they entered into the NMS or the known users of interest to which they have authority to access. Thus, the present disclosure allows a single NMS to manage multiple analysts while still maintaining strict security and confidentiality from other analysts. By not requiring a separate system for each analyst, substantial savings in cost and other resources can be realized.","While not illustrated in flowcharts, the methods, apparatus, and system herein can act as a single source to manage known users of interest or users not currently of interest, and their collected data for a plurality of analysts (multi-tenant).","Similarly, the methods, apparatus, and system herein can act as a single source to manage known users of interest and users not currently of interest, and their collected data on a plurality of networks (multi-network). This is accomplished by tracking and controlling access to known users and users not currently of interest and their data via a network ID vis-\u00e0-vis a known user ID, where the network ID can specify features such as data link types, individual network protocols, rules, and other requirements. Thus, the present disclosure allows a single NMS to manage multiple independent networks, can be realized while still maintaining strict security and confidentiality and compliance on a network by network basis.","A present embodiment of the disclosure utilizes flowcharts in  to illustrate functions of collecting, mediating, extracting metadata and analyzing both content and metadata, and storing and retrieving data on a network security system for an analyst seeking information on known users of interest and users not currently of interest exemplified from case tables in . However, the present invention is useful for any other type of analyst, e.g., a corporate agent, an educational associate, or any other valid person or entity needing to gather and analyze information of a known user of interest or user not currently of interest on a communication system, seeking any kind of information, metric, or relationship.","For example, educational analysts could be any valid educator or student seeking studies on anonymous populations of users, on contractually consenting users, or other broad-based studies such as demographics. Finally, a valid person or entity needing information could include a private citizen performing a missing person or lost relative search.","Any of the above analysts could use the network security system for analyzing content of communications if authorized or if not regulated. Alternatively, any of the above analysts could use the network security system for analyzing metadata of communications, typically without any regulation issues as metadata is not usually regulated.","While fields and metrics utilized in case tables in  are for known users and users not currently of interest sought by an analyst the present invention is also applicable to a wide range of fields and metrics to be sought and tracked for known users or users not currently of interest for other analysts as well. Other fields and metrics could apply to many different analysts' needs and applications. For example, logistics of the communication such as time, date, location, attachments and names thereof, names of parties, etc. can apply to many different types of analysis. Other fields may be more applicable to a specific analyst's needs. For example, finance metrics for corporate security or marketing could include: financial transactions, product purchases, investments, psychological profiles, buying profiles, stock market transactions, consumer behavior, financial credit ratings, etc. Similarly, educational metrics e.g., case studies, etc.; personal and social networking, e.g., personal information and relationships, suggested connections, marketing, etc.; or any other application of content, metadata, and\/or relationship metrics. The type of data gathered and analyzed is limited only by the existence of the data in the communications. Data can be used by the analyst for any valid temporal purpose whether for historical, contemporaneous, or a predictive future basis, and for any degree of resolution, whether for individuals, or different sizes of populations, and for factual data as well as stochastic variations and studies.","Referring now to , an illustration of partitioned memory for storing content, metadata, and analysis information for known users and users not currently of interest is shown, according to one or more embodiments. Memory block M covers data stored for known user \u201cJohn Doe\u201d from day 1 to day 7 from 6 am-6 pm, while block M covers data stored for known user \u201cJohn Doe\u201d from day 8 to day 14 from 6 am-6 pm. Block M covers data stored for known user \u201cJohn Doe\u201d from 6 pm-6 am from data 8 to day 14. By have a sufficient resolution in the data, and by segregating the stored data in partitions that consider the allowed days, times, known user types, etc. for a known user of interest, the data can then be stored, and shared among multiple analysts and thereby save memory and cost.","References to methods, systems, and apparatuses disclosed herein that are implementable in any means for achieving various aspects, and may be executed in a form of a machine-readable medium, e.g., computer readable medium, embodying a set of instructions that, when executed by a machine such as a processor in a computer, server, etc. cause the machine to perform any of the operations or functions disclosed herein.
