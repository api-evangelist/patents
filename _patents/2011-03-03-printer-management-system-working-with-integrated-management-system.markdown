{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present application relates to a system and method of integrating a print management system and an environment management system so that data read from printers on either system can be merged into a common view for the user.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","There may be different types of management systems for a specified scope of management or for providing a wider scope of management. A specified scope of management may include a printer management system that manages a fleet of printers. A wider range of management may include management of an infrastructure of a city including building management, traffic signal management, central heating\/cooling system management, energy management, and so on. The wider range management system may also include management of a fleet of printers.","Thus, there may be two separately managed sets of printers: one set under a printer management system and another set under the wide range management system. Thus, there is a need to integrate the managed data of the printers under the printer management system with the managed data of the printers in the wide range management system, so that both sets of managed printer data can be viewed on only one system.","According to one embodiment, a printing system is provided that includes a print management system, including a first type of printer, and a printer management client device that periodically reads data about first type of printer from the first type of printer; and an environment management system, including an integration device that periodically retrieves the data about the first type of printer from the printer management system, a data storage unit that receives the data about the first type of printer from the integration device, and a second type of printer that provides data about the second type of printer to the data storage unit, wherein the second type of printer has a management function that is configured to provide the data about the second type of printer to the data storage unit in the environment management system, and the first type of printer does not have the management function.","According to another embodiment, a method is provided that is implemented on a printing system that includes a print management system and an environment management system, comprising: at the print management system, periodically reading data about a first type of printer from the first type of printer; and at the environment management system, periodically retrieving the data about the first type of printer from the printer management system, storing the data about the first type of printer at a data storage unit, and at a second type of printer, providing data about the second type of printer to the data storage unit, wherein the second type of printer has a management function that is configured to provide the data about the second type of printer to the data storage unit in the environment management system, and the first type of printer does not have the management function.","Hereinafter, embodiments will be described with reference to the attached drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","102"]},"The printer management system  includes a plurality of printers , an on-site client , and a central server . A more detailed view of printer management system  is shown on .","In the example shown in , the printers  (also referred to as a \u201cprinter fleet\u201d) are SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) enabled and accessible behind routers. The printers  are considered printers of a first type because they do not have a management function configured for the environment management system . On the contrary, the printers  shown in , which will be discussed in more detail below are considered printers of a second type because they do have a management function configured for the environment management system .","One-time discovery of the printers  occurs once during system implementation and the results are stored in the on-site client . Subsequently, new printers added to the printer fleet are added to the discovery results on the on-site client . An initial discovery procedure, which is performed after the printer management system  is installed, may use a discovery application. The discovery procedure results in list of IP addresses of all printers discovered on the system . The list may be converted to spreadsheet format, and printers which are not printers of the first type may be removed from spreadsheet list. The list may be imported into the on-site client , which then reads data from all the printers on the printer management system  at predetermined time intervals (for example, every 2 hours). For any new printer added to the network (after initial discovery step described above), the on-site client  will collect data from these printers during a next scheduled data collection (i.e., within two hours in the example time interval above) and each collection thereafter. In the present example, the data flow from the printers  to the on-site client  is uni-directional in nature, but the present application is not limited as such.","The central server  shown in  collects and stores data from each on-site client  in the system. The on-site client  may be installed on a server. The central server  may be accessed, for example, by an interne browser running on a computer  in order to manage components of the system. In the case of integrating the printer management system  with the total environment management system, the management may involve simply setting up a single user account for accessing the central server  and any other management components. This provides the advantage that installation, configuration and maintenance of all components of the system can be performed by a single entity.","The printer management system  shown in  may be located behind a firewall. Alternatively, the overall system  may be located behind a firewall.","Returning to the overall system shown in ,  shows that the environment management system  includes a system-to-system integration component  and a log monitoring agent . The system-to-system integration component  retrieves device data from the central server  located in the printer management system , and performs such retrieval according to a configurable refresh interval (for example, every hour). In an example, the system-to-system integration component may use an application programming interface (API) to retrieve device data from the central server . For example, the system-to-system integration component makes one or more web-services calls to the central server  based on the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to extract data from the central server . The data may be stored on the central server in a database format.","The log monitoring agent  and the system-to-system integration component  may be separate devices (such as separate computers) or they may be running on the same device. The log monitoring agent  continually monitors data from the system-to-system integration component . The log monitoring agent  sends the monitored data to a data warehouse , which is a data storage device as is known in the art.","A portal unit  retrieves the data from the data warehouse . The portal unit  provides real-time data about the printers for display on a device . For instance, if there is a change in the status or condition of a monitored printer, such a change will be available at the portal unit  with minimal delay. The portal unit  may be a program or application implemented on the same device (such as a computer) as the device  or it may be implemented on a separate device. The portal unit  may also be web-accessible from a remote computer, where the remote computer accesses a port on the device of the portal unit  and then can view the portal unit display via a web browser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["112","113","113","102","103","101","113","112","112","113","113","112"]},"The base agent  receives data from the printers  and provides the data to the data warehouse .","Data collected regarding the printers  and the printers , may be displayed in both table and graph form in navigator views provided via the portal unit as will be described in more detail below.","For retrieving device location data, which is also displayed to a user on device , a data import may be done by a database administrator that populates a database table containing location data based on the device identifier.","A total time between a printer event, such as a toner status change, and the time it takes for such an event to be available for viewing at the device  may depend upon the audit schedule with the printer management system , the system-to-system integration component refresh interval and the portal history configuration time interval.","Data collected for printers  in the system  and printers  that are directly connected to the system  are merged into a common view to the end user via the portal unit.  shows how data flows from the data warehouse to being displayed by the portal unit.","A tree-structure view hierarchy for device statistics of the printers may also be available at the portal unit. Examples of the different types of hierarchies is shown on .  shows that device statistics may be displayed based on device counters which show a total page count at each printer, and\/or based on the toner level at each printer. The device statistics for each type of device statistic can further be organized based on the vendor and\/or the type of printer, such as: black-and-white (BW), Top 10 BW, color, or Top 10 color.","A user input of selecting or modifying the view hierarchy may have the effect of filtering table and graph data accordingly. It is noted that the table data shown at the portal can also be sorted by location. For device location data, a data import may be performed by a database administrator that populates a database table at the data warehouse, the database table containing location data based on a device identifier (ID).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["103","113","103","113","113","103"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 6","FIGS. 6"],"b":["7","8","7","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"100"},"In step , the on-site client  reads data from all the printers  on the printer management system  at predetermined time intervals (for example, every 2 hours).","In step , the central server  collects and stores data from each on-site client  in the system.","In step , the system-to-system integration component  retrieves device data from the central server  located in the printer management system , and performs such retrieval according to a configurable refresh interval (for example, every hour).","In step , the log monitoring agent  continually captures data from the system-to-system integration component .","In step , the log monitoring agent  sends the captured data to a data warehouse .","In step , the base agent  receives data from the printers  and provides the data to the data warehouse .","In step , the portal unit  retrieves the data from the data warehouse .","In step , the portal unit  merges the data from the printers  and printer , and provides the data for display on a device .","The above described examples describe using different devices which may be a computer or CPU.
