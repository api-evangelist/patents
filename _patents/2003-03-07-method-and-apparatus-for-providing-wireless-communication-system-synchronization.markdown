title: Method and apparatus for providing wireless communication system synchronization
abstract: When insufficient traffic is present in the network to maintain synchronization in this manner, other methods must be used. One approach involves making direct measurements of the timing between base stations. This is accomplished in one of two ways. The base may interrupt its transmissions on all sectors for a short interval during which it determines the time of arrival of signals from other base stations. Given knowledge of the other base station locations, time errors relative to all other base stations may be derived. Alternatively, the base may send a short signal at high power in the mobile transmit band. This time-of-arrival of this signal is measured by the surrounding base stations and the time errors between pairs of base stations are computed. In some cases, a base station may be isolated sufficiently from all other base stations in the network such that direct base-to-base measurement is not viable. In this case, a fixed mobile is placed at a location in the handoff region between the isolated cell and another cell in the network. The fixed mobile either performs measurements of base station pilots on command of the base and reports the timing information, or sends a burst transmission at a specified time and power level to be measured by the base stations.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["I. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for synchronizing base stations in a wireless communication system.","II. Description of the Related Art","The use of code division multiple access (CDMA) modulation techniques is but one of several techniques for facilitating communications in which a large number of system users are present. Although other techniques, such as time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and AM modulation schemes such as amplitude companded single sideband (ACSSB) are known, CDMA has significant advantages over these other modulation techniques. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM\u201d, both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and are incorporated by reference. The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System\u201d, referred to herein as IS-95.","In the just mentioned patents, a multiple access technique is disclosed in which a large number of mobile station users, each having a transceiver, communicate through satellite repeaters or terrestrial base stations (also known as cell base stations or cell-sites) using code division multiple access (CDMA) spread spectrum communication signals. By using CDMA communications, the frequency spectrum can be reused multiple times thus permitting an increase in system user capacity. The use of CDMA techniques result in much higher spectral efficiency than can be achieved using other multiple access techniques.","A method for simultaneously demodulating data that has traveled along different propagation paths from one base station and for simultaneously demodulating data redundantly provided from more than one base station is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,390 (the '390 patent), entitled \u201cDIVERSITY RECEIVER IN A CDMA CELLULAR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. In the '390 patent, the separately demodulated signals are combined to provide an estimate of the transmitted data which has higher reliability than the data demodulated by any one path or from any one base station.","Handoffs can generally be divided into two categories\u2014hard handoffs and soft handoffs. In a hard handoff, when a mobile station leaves an origination base station and enters a destination base station, the mobile station breaks its communication link with the origination base station and thereafter establishes a new communication link with the destination base station. In soft handoff, the mobile station completes a communication link with the destination base station prior to breaking its communication link with the origination base station. Thus, in soft handoff, the mobile station is redundantly in communication with both the origination base station and the destination base station for some period of time.","Soft handoffs are far less likely to drop calls than hard handoffs. In addition, when a mobile station travels near the coverage boundary of a base station, it may make repeated handoff requests in response to small changes in the environment. This problem, referred to as ping-ponging, is also greatly lessened by soft handoff. An exemplary process for performing soft handoff is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,501, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING A SOFT HANDOFF IN COMMUNICATIONS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM\u201d assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","An improved soft handoff technique is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,261, entitled \u201cMOBILE STATION ASSISTED SOFT HANDOFF IN A CDMA CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. In the system of the '261 patent, the soft handoff process is improved by measuring the strength of \u201cpilot\u201d signals transmitted by each base station at the mobile station. These pilot strength measurements are of assistance in the soft handoff process by facilitating identification of viable base station handoff candidates.","The base station candidates can be divided into four sets. The first set, referred to as the Active Set, comprises base stations, which are currently in communication with the mobile station. The second set, referred to as the Candidate Set, comprises base stations whose signals have been determined to be of sufficient strength to be of use to the mobile station but are not currently being used. Base stations are added to the candidate set when their measured pilot energy exceeds a predetermined threshold T. The third set is the set of base stations which are in the vicinity of the mobile station (and which are not included in the Active Set or the Candidate Set). And the fourth set is the Remaining Set which consists of all other base stations.","In IS-95, a base station candidate is characterized by the phase offset of the pseudonoise (PN) sequence of its pilot channel. When the mobile station searches to determine the strength of the pilot signal from a candidate base station it performs a correlation operation wherein the filtered received signal is correlated to a set of PN offset hypotheses. The method and apparatus for performing the correlation operation is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,644,591, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING SEARCH ACQUISITION IN A CDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM\u201d, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","The propagation delay between the base station and the mobile station is not known. This unknown delay produces and unknown shift in the PN codes. The searching process attempts to determine the unknown shift in the PN codes. To do this, the mobile station shifts in time the output of its searcher PN code generators. The range of the search shift is called the search window. The search window is centered about a PN shift hypothesis. A base station transmits to the mobile station a message indicating the PN offsets of base station pilots in its physical proximity. The mobile station will center its search window around the PN offset hypothesis.","The appropriate size of the search window depends on several factors including the priority of the pilot, the speed of the searching processors, and the anticipated delay spread of the multipath arrivals. The CDMA standards (IS-95) define three search window parameters. The searching of pilots in both the active and candidate sets is governed by Search Window \u201cA\u201d. Neighbor Set pilots are searched over window \u201cN\u201d and Remaining Set pilots over window \u201cR\u201d. The searcher window sizes are provided below in Table 1, where a chip is 1\/1.2288 MHz.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["SRCH_WIN_A",{},"SRCH_WIN_A",{}]},{"entry":["SRCH_WIN_N","Window Size","SRCH_WIN_N","Window Size"]},{"entry":["SRCH_WIN_R","(PN chips)","SRCH_WIN_R","(PN chips)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0","4","8","60"]},{"entry":["1","6","9","80"]},{"entry":["2","8","10","100"]},{"entry":["3","10","11","130"]},{"entry":["4","14","12","160"]},{"entry":["5","20","13","226"]},{"entry":["6","28","14","320"]},{"entry":["7","40","15","452"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Window sizing is a trade-off between search speed and the probability of missing a strong path lying outside the search window.","The base station transmits to the mobile station a message which specifies the PN hypotheses that the mobile station should search relative to its own PN offset. For example, the originating base station may instruct the mobile station to search for a pilot  PN chips ahead of its own PN offset. The mobile station in response sets its searcher demodulator  chips ahead in the output chip cycle and searches for the pilot using a search window centered about the specified offset. Once the mobile is instructed to a search a PN hypothesis to determine the resources available for performing a handoff, it is critical that the PN offset of the destination base station pilot is very close in time to the directed offset. The speed of searching is of critical importance near base station boundaries because delays in completing the necessary searches can result in dropped calls.","In CDMA systems in the United States, this base station synchronization is achieved by providing each base station with a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver. However, there are cases where a base station may not be able to receive the GPS signal. For example, within subways and tunnels the GPS signal is attenuated to a degree that prohibits their use for timing synchronization of base stations or micro base stations. In addition, there are national agendas that discourage dependence upon the GPS signal for operation of critical services.","The present invention describes a method and system for providing timing synchronization in these circumstances where a fraction of the network is capable of receiving a centralized timing signal and achieving timing therefrom and a portion of the base stations are not capable of receiving the centralized timing signal. This situation is addressed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/933,888 (the '888 application), entitled \u201cMOBILE STATION ASSISTED TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION IN A CDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM\u201d, filed Sep. 19, 1997, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. In addition, the present invention describes a method and system for providing timing synchronization where no base stations rely on a centralized timing signal.","In the '888 application, the slave base station attains synchronization with the reference base station through messages transmitted from and received by a mobile station in the soft handoff region between the reference base station and the slave base station. First, the round trip delay between the mobile station and the reference base station is measured by the reference base station. Next, the slave base station searches until it acquires the signal transmitted by the mobile station, referred to as the reverse link signal. In response to the acquisition of the reverse link signal, the slave base station adjusts its timing so that the mobile station can acquire its signal, referred to as a forward link signal. This step may be unnecessary if the timing error in the slave base station is not severe.","Once the mobile station acquires the signal from the slave base station, it measures and reports the difference between the amount of time it takes a signal to travel from the reference base station to it and the amount of time it takes a signal to travel from the slave base station to it. The last measurement necessary is a measurement by the slave base station of the time difference between the time it received the reverse link signal from the mobile station and the time it transmitted a signal to the mobile station.","A series of computations are performed upon the measured time values to determine the time difference between the slave base station and an adjustment of the slave base station timing is performed in accordance therewith. It should be noted that all of the measurements mentioned are performed during the normal operation of an IS-95 CDMA communication system.","The present invention is a novel and improved method and apparatus for synchronizing base stations in a wireless communication system. The present invention describes methods by which a wireless communication system keeps itself synchronized without an external reference. One method, disclosed in \u201cMOBILE STATION ASSISTED TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION IN A CDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM\u201d application Ser. No. 08\/933,888, is to use the messaging of mobiles in handoff to determine the relative timing of pairs of base stations. Given the measured timing errors, the base stations' timing is adjusted to maintain network synchronization.","When insufficient traffic is present in the network to maintain synchronization in this manner, other methods must be used. One approach involves making direct measurements of the timing between base stations. This is accomplished in one of two ways. The base may interrupt its transmissions on all sectors for a short interval during which it receives forward link signals from other base stations. Given knowledge of the other base station locations, time errors relative to all other base stations may be derived. Alternatively, a base station sends a short signal at high power in the mobile transmit band. The time-of-arrival of this signal is measured by the surrounding base stations and the time errors between pairs of base stations are computed.","In some cases, a base station may be isolated sufficiently from all other base stations in the network such that direct base-to-base measurement is not possible. In this case, a fixed dummy station is placed at a location in the handoff region between the isolated cell and another cell in the network. The fixed dummy station either performs measurements of base station pilots on command of the base and reports the timing information, or sends a burst transmission at a specified time to be measured by the base stations.","I. Base Station Blanking","When there is insufficient data from mobile stations in handoff, the handoff messaging of mobile stations cannot be used to perform the synchronization. This is likely when there is very little traffic, or when the mobile stations are largely stationary. In the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a base station receives the forward link transmissions from a neighboring base station or set of neighboring base stations. The base station extracts necessary timing information from the signal received from the other base station.","Because all base stations transmit on the same frequency, a base station must inhibit its forward link transmission in order to permit reception of the signals from other base stations. Referring to , base station  is configured to receive the forward link signal from base station  in order to synchronize its timing with that of base station . If base station  has multiple sectors (not shown), then preferably all sectors will cease forward link transmission simultaneously because the backlobes of an antenna will exceed the signal levels of transmissions from base station . Receiving the forward link signal from base station , requires base station  to have a forward link receiver subsystem  to receive the forward link signals from base station .","Because base stations are designed to cover a particular area, with some overlap of the coverage area of the adjacent cells, it is not necessarily true that a base station can receive signals from other base stations. However, in most deployments this is unlikely to be a problem. For example, if the base stations have roughly circular (or hexagonal) coverage areas with about the same radius, then the distance between base stations is about double the coverage radius. In the COST-231 propagation model, the path loss increases by about 10 or 11 dB with a doubling of distance, assuming base station antenna heights in the range of 20-60 m. This is a relatively small increase in path loss that is easily offset by:\n\n","It may also be necessary to prohibit forward link transmissions on more than one base station at the same time in order to perform the forward link measurement. For example, there may be cases where a pair of base stations has a clear line-of-sight (LOS) path between them, but all other neighboring base stations are not visible. In this case, when one of the pair blanks its transmission it can receive only the signal from the other base station of the pair, since that base stations signal masks the other neighbor base stations' weaker signals. The same result occurs when the other base station of the pair blanks its transmission. The result is that the two base stations are isolated and cannot determine their timing relative to the rest of the network. Connection with the rest of the network is only possible if both base stations blank simultaneously. The same sort of problem can arise with larger collections of base stations that are effectively isolated from the network unless certain specific patterns of blanking are employed.","To avoid the detailed analysis of the network that may be required to determine the blanking patterns, a simple approach of randomly blanking at a given fixed intervals is employed. At predetermined time intervals, each base station decides in a randomized fashion whether or not to blank its transmissions. In the exemplary embodiment, the probability of randomly determining to blank is set at 50%. In this manner about 50% of the base stations in the system are off every few minutes. In this manner, each base eventually gets to see all of its neighbors.","Given the known locations of base stations, the propagation delays between base stations may be removed from the time-of-arrival estimates, and the timing differences between cells determined. The timing errors may be used to adjust the base station timing, either using a centralized processor or processing in individual base stations, possibly based on a pre-established base station hierarchy.","Blanking the base stations affects the forward link for all active mobile stations. To minimize this impact the blanking time should be short. The active mobile stations in the coverage area of a blanked base station increase their transmit power by about 1 dB per millisecond when the forward link signal disappears. If the blanking is only 5 msec, then the recovery time is about 6 msec, and most mobile stations will only lose a single frame. If the blanking extends to more than 10 msec, then more than 1 frame will likely be lost. However, loss of 2 consecutive frames every 2 minutes is only a frame error rate (FER) increase of 0.03%. This is not significant relative to a typical operating FER of 1% or greater.","Forward link signals transmitted from base stations  and  are transmitted on a first frequency. Reverse link signals transmitted from mobile stations (not shown) to base stations  and  are transmitted on a second frequency. In the exemplary embodiment, the forward link signals and the reverse link signals are code division multiple access (CDMA) signals.

Searcher controller  determines a window for searching for the forward link pilot signal from base station. In the exemplary embodiment, each base station is a predetermined PN offset from its neighboring base stations. In the exemplary embodiment, base station  knows the predetermined PN offset between its forward link pilot signal and the forward link pilot signal from base station  (PN). In addition, base station  knows the distance between base station  and base station  (R).

In addition, searcher controller  compensates for the propagation of the signal to travel from base station  to base station . The time shifting of PN generator  can be performed by bank loading the taps of the linear shift register within PN generator  or by masking the output to provide a shifted PN sequence or by combination of these two methods as is known in the art. This initial phase information for performing the search for the pilot of base station  is provided from searcher controller  to PN generator .","In the exemplary embodiment, the received signal is modulated by quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK), so PN generator  provides a PN sequence for the I modulation component and a separate sequence for the Q modulation component to despreading elements  and .

The results of each of the comparisons is then fed back to searcher controller .

Timing adjustment element  compares the PN offset with the hypothetical PN phase offset generated in accordance with the timing signal from forward link modulator , the known propagation path delay and the predetermined phase offset between the PN sequences of base stations  and . A timing error signal is provided from timing adjustment element  to forward link modulator . In response forward link modulator  adjusts its timing signal for the generation of its forward link spreading signal.","In an alternative embodiment, described in the proposed European Telecommunications Standards Institute (hereafter WCDMA) UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access ITU-R RTT Candidate Submission describes a method of PN spreading wherein each base station uses a distinct PN sequence generator (referred to as an orthogonal Gold code generator). In order to facilitate initial acquisition and handoff, it is desirable to have the base station PN sequences time aligned so that the mobile station can search a reduced search hypothesis window which in turn reduces acquisition time and lessens the probability of dropped calls during handoff.","In accordance with the proposed WCDMA spreading format, a timing signal from forward link modulator  would be provided to searcher controller . Searcher controller  compensates this timing signal in accordance with the known propagation path delay from base station  to base station . This provides a phase reference used to initialize the PN generator . PN generator  can be bank loaded in accordance with this timing offset. The key difference between synchronizing a system based on different spreading functions and those base on offsets of a single spreading function is that those systems base on different spreading functions would require the additional step of extracting a time reference from the received spreading function that is a time relative to a known phase of the two spreading functions.","II. Transmissions from Base Stations on Mobile Frequencies","An alternative to blanking base station transmissions and detection of the neighboring base station transmissions is to periodically transmit a short probe from a base station on the mobile station transmit frequency. Normally, CDMA mobile station transmissions near a base station are at very low power, but these short transmissions would be of sufficient power to reach the neighboring base stations. For the time interval during which the base station transmits on the reverse link frequency band, the reverse link receiver in the base station is unable to demodulate reverse link signals from mobile stations in the coverage area of the base station. In addition, other nearby base stations might be adversely affected by the reverse link transmission from the base station, and frame erasures might result. As with the base station blanking, this would occur infrequently, so that the overall system performance would be minimally impacted.","Scheduling of these transmissions is required so that all base stations know at what time to search for the timing probe. A base station in need of synchronization would request that measurement of its probe be performed by neighboring base stations. The data indicative of the base station timing is then used with the known distance between base stations to develop a set of timing error values. As with the previous method the timing error values are then used to adjust the timing of various base stations in the network.","As with the base blanking approach, the link budget for transmission of the probe from base station to base station must be sufficient to overcome the additional path loss due to the larger distance. The same 10 or 11 dB increase in path loss is to be expected, and the same mitigating factors discussed above apply to this approach. If we assume that the base station uses a standard mobile station power amplifier (\u02dc200 mW) for its transmitter, then the base station blanking approach has a larger link margin given that the base station pilots are generally transmitted at 10-20% of the base HPA, i.e., the pilot is transmitted at about 1-4W. However, the factors discussed above are much larger than the difference in power amplifier size, so for most networks either technique would apply equally well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","304"]},"As described above base station  knows when to search for the probe sequence from base . One method for providing this information to base station  is for base station  to send a request message to a base station controller (not shown) that is in communication with both base station  and base station . In response to the request message from base station , the base station controller generates a probe schedule message indicating the time at which the probe is to be transmitted by base station  and provided this message to base station . The difference between the scheduled time for receipt of the probe at base station  and the time at which base station  does receive the probe from base station  is the time error in base station  with the assumption that the timing clock in base station  is correct.","Base station  includes all of the circuitry necessary for typical operation. In addition, base station  includes the capability of transmitting messages on the reverse link frequency band while simultaneously inhibiting reception of reverse link signals. In base station , pilot symbols and forward link traffic data are provided to forward link modulator . In the exemplary embodiment, forward link modulator  is code division multiple access modulator as described in detail in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459.

If the probe is transmitted at sufficient energy that the reverse link is essentially interrupted during the transmission, switch  may for a period inhibit the provision of the reverse link signal to reverse link demodulator .","Matched filter  is designed to provide the maximum signal to noise power ratio at its output for the predetermined transmitted sequence. Realizations of matched filter  are well known in the art. Two methods of realizing matched filter  include use of a convolution base matched filter and a correlator based matched filter. The function of matched filter  is to output a high power signal when the predetermined sequence is received.","The output from matched filter  is provided to energy detector .

A timing adjustment signal is provided from timing adjustment element  to forward link modulator . In response to the timing adjustment signal, the internal clocks of base station  are adjusted.","III. Use of Fixed Stations to Measure Base Station Transmissions.","A problem occurs with the methods above when there is a base station that cannot see any other base stations. For instance, a base station in a subway may be isolated from all other base stations, but still able to receive signals from mobile stations which are in handoff with other base stations. Effectively, the signal needs to go around a very sharp corner in order to go from one base station to the other, but a mobile station in the proper location is able to receive signals from both base stations.","To cover these cases where there is no base station to base station propagation path, a fixed dummy station is installed which delivers pilot phase measurements on command. Since the fixed dummy stations are stationary and at known locations, estimates of timing error between two base stations may be made as long as the fixed dummy station can measure pilots from both base stations, and report the measurement to one of the base stations. The base station uses the distances from the base stations to the fixed dummy station together with the relative pilot delays reported in the message to determine its timing relative to the other base station.","If it is difficult to place the fixed dummy station in the region where the base stations are close to the same power level, then it may be necessary to employ blanking of the nearer base station in order to measure the delay to both base stations. In order to accomplish this, the base station tells the fixed dummy station to perform two pilot measurements, one before the blanking and one during. The combination of information in these measurements is then equivalent to the single measurement made on two pilots simultaneously.","The performance of fixed dummy stations depends on the relative strengths of the base stations to be measured. Assuming a pilot at \u22127 dB Ec\/Ior, and another base station 10 dB stronger, the weak pilot is at \u221217 dB Ec\/Io. In order to get 90% detection probability in Rayleigh fading and a false alarm rate of 10%, an SNR of 21 dB is required, so integration over 6000 chips is necessary. This is about 5 msec with a chip rate of 1.23 MHz. If the other base station is 20 dB stronger, then integration over 50 msec is required. Coherent integration over 50 msec is probably possible for a fixed dummy station, but does require significant processing to consider the various delay hypotheses. The acceptable level of coherent integration determines how closely matched the path losses between the two base stations must be to avoid the requirement of blanking the nearby base station.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","402","404","406","402","406","404","406","406","402","404","402","404"]},"In base station , the pilot and traffic symbols are provided to forward link (FL) modulator .

This embodiment has the additional factor of permitting information from many base stations to be jointly evaluated and system wide synchronization can be performed in fewer instances.","IV. Use of Fixed Stations to Transmit Probes to Base Stations","The fixed dummy station may also be used to transmit probes on command.

Fixed Transponder","A fifth embodiment of the present invention for base synchronization involves use of a simple transponder. As with the fixed dummy station of methods described above, this transponder is placed so that it can receive signals from two or more base stations.","The transponder periodically digitizes and stores the received signals on the forward link for a short time, and retransmits these samples on the reverse link. So the transponder gets a snapshot of the base station pilot transmissions which may be used to determine the relative timing of the base stations. Rather than process this information in the transponder, it is simply relayed to the base stations for analysis. This approach allows for a low-cost, low-power device to be employed. The transponder may also simply perform a frequency translation of the incoming forward link signal and retransmit on the reverse link without storing the signal. This requires the transponder to receive and transmit at the same time, but avoids the requirement of A\/D conversion and storage of the samples.","The transponder is not, in general, synchronized with the CDMA system. To simplify the processing at the base station(s) to detect the transponder transmission, the transmission is performed at fixed intervals (for example, every 10 minutes or so). The ambiguity in the timing of the pulse is just due to the error in the transponder clock over the time between transmissions. With a clock accuracy of 3\u00d710(a good low power TCXO), the drift is only 180 \u03bcsec every 10 minutes.","To simplify the base station search further, the transponder sends its burst transmission at a reasonably high power level. This results in no significant degradation in the system performance, since it occurs infrequently. The transmission may also be proceeded by a short fixed preamble, a PN code unique to a particular transponder which may be detected by a simple matched filter at the base station.","Referring to , in base station , the pilot and traffic symbols are provided to forward link (FL) modulator .
