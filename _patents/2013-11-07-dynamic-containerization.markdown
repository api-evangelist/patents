title: Dynamic containerization
abstract: In an example embodiment, a container is downloaded, the container being an application natively executable by a first operating system of the user device, the container including: a container service including one or more libraries of functions designed by a container designer to natively operate on the first operating system; a browser; container metadata defining functions of the application, the functions compatible with the container service for the first operating system and also compatible with a container service for a second operating system; and a plug-in including one or more additional libraries of functions designed by an entity other than the container designer to perform additional native operations on the first operating system. Then, the container metadata can be executed using the browser, causing function calls to the container service and plug-in and thus controlling native functions of the user device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This document generally relates to methods and systems for use with computer networks. More particularly, this document relates to dynamic containerization.","Mobile applications (also known as \u201capps\u201d) have dramatically increased in popularity with the rise of smartphones and tablets. It is common for these applications to be downloaded by end users from a central repository, sometimes referred to as an \u201capp store\u201d or other location where digital files can be downloaded to user devices. Software developers often create apps and upload these apps to the app store. These apps may be designed as self-contained through a process known as native application development. One drawback to native application development is that it can become difficult to develop applications that operate on multiple different mobile platforms (cross-platform solutions), thus driving up the cost of development for apps that are intended to operate on multiple different mobile platforms.","The description that follows includes illustrative systems, methods, techniques, instruction sequences, and computing machine program products that embody illustrative embodiments. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art, that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures, and techniques have not been shown in detail.","For purposes of this disclosure, a container is a runtime environment executable on a mobile device within which mobile applications can be executed. The container is a native application that is installed on the mobile device. This container may include messaging libraries and a local datastore, as well as a toolkit having a runtime from the native operating system's software development kit (SDK). It may also then embed a browser, which allows developers to build mobile applications using web development as opposed to traditional software development, while still maximizing the power of the native device services. This allows rapid development of mobile workflows across multiple platforms. These types of applications may extend existing enterprise business processes to, for example, a mobile device, so that business process decisions can be made on a mobile device. Mobile device types may include, but are not limited to, a mobile phone, a feature phone, a smartphone, a tablet computer, a mobile computer, a handheld computer, a laptop computer, an in-vehicle or in-appliance device, a personal digital assistant, etc.","In some example embodiments, the container may be designed to allow developers to create applications in open, standards-based protocols such as hypertext markup language (HTML) 5, JavaScript\u2122, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The applications that run in the container may be considered web apps. The web apps may be constructed similarly to an application written for a browser, in that they may contain a web page, with a set of div and form elements that make up the app screens. A set of JavaScript\u2122 files may include the methods for navigating from screen to screen and the functions for accessing data for the screens. A set of CSS files may provide the styling for the screen elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","106","106","106","102","104","108","110","112","114","116","112","114","112","116","104"]},"In an example embodiment, the container  may be dynamically extended or altered through the use of one or more plug-ins.  is a diagram illustrating a system , in accordance with an example embodiment, to provide a plug-in to a container  on a mobile device. The system  may include the container platform , which may store workflow metadata  obtained from one or more designers A, B. The system may additionally include a plug-in developer . A client mobile device  may then operate a container , which includes container services , a plug-in , a browser , and container metadata . The plug-in  may be transmitted to the client mobile device  from the plug-in developer  via the container platform . In an alternative example embodiment, the plug-in developer  sends the plug-in directly to the client mobile device .","The plug-in  may provide functionality not available in the container services  that the plug-in developer  believes that application designers, such as designers A, B, may wish to utilize. At runtime, the browser  is designed to run both the container services  and the plug-in , making for a seamless experience for the user. This is accomplished without modifying the other aspects of the container , such as the container services , browser , and container metadata .","In an example embodiment, the container services  include Javascript\u2122 libraries that provide consistent APIs that can be called the same way on any supported device. In this example embodiment, multiple plug-ins  are provided, including plug-ins  for application lifecycle management, implementation of a common logon manager, single sign-on (SSO), integrating with server-based push notifications, etc. The plug-ins  may utilize a configuration file of the container  and extend it for any settings they need for their purposes. For example, if a plug-in  needs to extend application configuration items such as sandboxing, application lifecycle, supportability, and so on, it can utilize an additional property name field in the configuration file.","In an example embodiment, a designer A, B may install the container services  and plug-ins, such as plug-in  on its own system, in order to be used for creating and testing the container metadata  prior to distribution to mobile devices, such as client mobile device .","The designer A, B may then set configuration parameters to configure the ultimate client devices that will run the container . This may include, for example, designing back-end connections for selected native and hybrid applications. This may be performed by setting fields defining whether the client device will use a system proxy, whether the client device will rewrite uniform resource locators (URLs), the maximum connections for the client device, and identifying a certificate alias of a specific certificate in the system keystore that is used when making a secure connection to the specified server. Additionally, whitelisted connections can be expanded.","The plug-in  may expand the universe of capabilities, services, etc. that are available to applications written in open, standards-based protocols, that operate within the container  without altering the container  or any of the other plug-ins that may reside within the container . Thus, such a plug-in  may coexist with any other plug-ins and would not impact the ability of a mobile device  to update aspects of the container , while minimizing the time required for an application designer to create the application.","Such a plug-in  can also make a container  more capable, robust, etc. by offering additional or missing features, functions, services, etc. and generally make the container  more enterprise-ready, among other things.","Such a plug-in  can also provide access to native functionality (e.g., camera, accelerometer, contact list entries) of a mobile device . As such, the plug-in serves as something of a bridge between the native or traditional world of mobile device applications, which would have direct access to native functionality such as the camera, and non-native applications. Such a plug-in  can abstract, or otherwise hide, various aspects of the complexities associated with accessing and using this native functionality by, for example, exposing a simplified interface for it. Such a plug-in  may offer, among other things, enhanced security, limits on available operations, in connecting with, accessing and using native functionality.","Such a plug-in  may also provide various performance enhancements that can improve, among other things, the loading time of the application.","Such a plug-in  may also support server-controlled management (e.g. provisioning, updating, etc.) of applications as frequently required within an enterprise setting. Among other things the transfer and application of secure incremental updates, patches, etc., transparent to the user, may be supported.","Such a plug-in  may also support the flexible, extensible, and dynamic management of activities during any of the different phases (e.g., instantiation, startup, operation, shutdown, etc.) of the lifecycle of an application. Such a plug-in  may also address structural weaknesses, deficiencies, etc. that exist within a container , such as data access, security, the concurrent operation of multiple applications, etc. through, for example, the offering of additional, or possibly replacement, capabilities and services.","In an example embodiment, the plug-in  is a logon plug-in. The logon plug-in provides inter alia a login screen where the user can enter values needed to connect to a server, which stores those values in its own secure data vault. This data vault may be separate from the one provided with other plug-ins. It also provides a way to lock and unlock the application defined by the container metadata , so the user can leave sensitive data open in the application. In order to set-up this functionality, the designer A, B may load the container services  and the plug-in  on their own system, and then create the application. The designer A, B may then build a project including the application and the container services  and plug-in , and then register the application in the container platform . The plug-in  then provides screen flow application program interfaces (APIs) for the application, including APIs to register the user, unlock secure storage, manage a passcode, change a password, and show registration data.","In an example embodiment, the logon plug-in may contain a series of functions, including, for example, successCallback, errorCallback, applicationID, context, and logonView. SuccessCallback is called when the logon is successful. ErrorCallback is called when the logon fails. ApplicationID is a string defined on a mobile platform server. Context is an object that can be used to override the logon plugin default values. LogonView can be used to point to a custom logon view. Below is example code for logging into an application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"function init( ) {"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/\/Application ID on SMP 3.0"]},{"entry":[{},"var appId = \u201ccom.sap.flight.kapsel\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Optional initial connection context"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Sets defaults on MAP Login Component"]},{"entry":[{},"var context = {"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u201cserverHost\u201d: \u201c10.7.96.217\u201d, \/\/SMP 3.0 Server hostname or IP"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cserverPort\u201d: \u201c8080\u201d, \/\/SMP 3.0 Server port"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201chttps\u201d: \u201cfalse\u201d, \/\/Use HTTPS?"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"};"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Init the Logon component"]},{"entry":[{},"sap.Logon.init(logonSuccessCallback, errorCallback, appId,"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"context, sap.logon.IabUi);"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"}"},{"entry":"..."},{"entry":"\/\/ Device is Ready!

The settings plug-in provides the ability to trigger an operation on a server to allow an application to store device and user settings on the client device for later use.","In another example embodiment, the plug-in  is a push notification plug-in. The client device sends the server a device type, device model, whether push is enabled, and other push-related statuses. The settings can also use a device token received during device configuration. The server then can use this information to decide what kind of push notification to send (e.g., cloud messaging, push notification service, etc.).","In another example embodiment, the plug-in  is an application update plug-in. The application update plug-in provides server-based updates to the application content and manages the process of checking, downloading, and installing updates to the application running within the container .

Delta updates only download and install aspects of the application that have been changed since the last update. A full update may be used when, for example, the local revision number is 0, or where the local revision number is unknown or not provided.","In another example embodiment, the plug-in  is an authorization proxy plug-in. The authorization proxy plug-in automates the process of accepting certificates, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates, returned by a call to a web resource. If users want to send an Asynchronous Jayscript and Extensible Markup Language (AJAX) request, for example, to an HTTPS server and the embedded browser  does not support the SSL, then users could utilize the authorization proxy plug-in for this purpose. In another example, if datajs users want to send a request through an HTTPS connection, they can replace a default odata:DefaultHttpClient with one provided by the authorization proxy plug-in.","The authorization proxy methods may act as proxies for requests for the application. There may be two functions for sending requests, get, which takes the parameters function, url, header, success callback, error callback, user, password, timeout, and certificate source, and send request, which takes the parameters function, method, url, header, request body, success callback, error callback, user, password, timeout, and certificate source. Constructor functions can also be used, with each constructor function covering a different type of certificate source (e.g., from file, from store, etc.).","Below is a table of example platform dependent methods, error codes, and object definitions.

Each of them have a need to deliver multiple mobile applications to their constituents and customers, but the complexity of developing and distributing multiple apps (often one for each department or division) is daunting.","Traditionally, any organization looking to enable different departments or business units to deliver mobile applications to end-users delivered those applications separately\u2014a different application (and associated icon on the device home screen) for each use. Banks, for example, could have a different application for managing personal checking and savings accounts, potentially others for financial management, mortgage, credit cards, insurance and more. City or county governments could have an app for garbage collection, utilities (water, electric), taxes, concerts, parks, community service and much more. Colleges and universities would have an app for schedules, athletics, alumni, a book store and more.","What these organizations need is a single mobile application that has the ability to be provisioned with multiple sub-applications (with each sub-application potentially created by separate parts of the organization).","Unlike the requirements for enterprise applications, these applications need to be self-provisioned by the end-user rather than managed by corporate IT. Users would need the ability to login to a web portal (or do the same in-app\u2014it's better to do this from within the app) and select the different department or divisional apps they want provisioned on their device. With the mobile application already on the device, after making their selections (adding or removing sub-apps from their profile) the next update from the server makes sure that the selected apps are added, appropriate apps are removed and, of course, that the latest versions of all sub-apps are on-device.","The solution to this particular problem is a modified version of the hybrid web container application with some new, hosted back-end infrastructure needed for the customer organization to manage the list of available applications that can be provisioned into the container . The back-end infrastructure may be, for example, a consumer cloud offering.","Instead of apps being pre-built and available to sell to customers, the app is a generic, empty container  that is simply branded for the organization (city, county, bank or whatever) and deployed into the appropriate mobile device platform's app store(s). The application can be deployed empty or deployed with some common content, such as a department contact list or customer service\/311 link, so users have something to look at as they wait for their sub-apps to provision. The sub-apps themselves can either be pre-built (for some common apps customers will want) by a mobile platforms or partners and sold to customers, such as banks or government agencies, or built by the customers themselves.","Since this is a hybrid application approach, the apps are built using standard, out of the box HTML5 plus the traditional and mobile platform-supplied APIs that developers of sub-apps can use to extend an application beyond what is supported by HTML5. Each application may need to somehow look and feel like the other apps from the same organization, but that can be easily accommodated through the creation of custom, organization-specific CSS that is distributed to developers (or applied to existing pre-built apps).","Some users would have many sub-apps installed, others would have just a few\u2014but there would be a tailored environment for each user.","Existing server infrastructure already supports push requests, so the consumer hybrid container  provides organizations with the ability to push alerts, reminders and even specials or promotions to users. The container  is location aware, so there's value-add services that can be added around where the user is located. This becomes an ATM or branch finder for banking applications, a nearest park capability for a city or county government and a nearest open parking space feature for a university application.","Amber alerts, severe weather alerts, and reminders about off-cycle garbage pick-up days can be provided easily and efficiently. Since the app may have the user's email address or phone number (easily retrieved from the device), the application could even support specific alerts tailored for the particular user, such as whether tax payments are due, credit card or utility payment due, etc. An app could push an alert to a device that reminds the user of purchased tickets for a community event. An app could proactively alert the user if the event is cancelled because of pending severe weather or unexpected events.

Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied (1) on a non-transitory machine-readable medium or (2) in a transmission signal) or hardware-implemented modules. A hardware-implemented module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more processors  may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware-implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a hardware-implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware-implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware-implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor  or other programmable processor ) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware-implemented module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware-implemented module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily or transitorily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and\/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware-implemented modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware-implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware-implemented modules comprise a general-purpose processor  configured using software, the general-purpose processor  may be configured as respective different hardware-implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor , for example, to constitute a particular hardware-implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware-implemented module at a different instance of time.","Hardware-implemented modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware-implemented modules. Accordingly, the described hardware-implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware-implemented modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware-implemented modules). In embodiments in which multiple hardware-implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware-implemented modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware-implemented modules have access. For example, one hardware-implemented module may perform an operation, and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware-implemented module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware-implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors  that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors  may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors  or processor-implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors , not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor  or processors  may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors  may be distributed across a number of locations.","The one or more processors  may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a \u201ccloud computing\u201d environment or as a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., application program interfaces (APIs).)","Electronic Apparatus and System","Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them.

The computer system  may further include a video display unit  (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT)). The computer system  also includes an alphanumeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard or a touch-sensitive display screen), a user interface (UI) navigation device  (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive unit , a signal generation device  (e.g., a speaker) and a network interface device .","Machine Readable Medium","The disk drive unit  includes a machine-readable medium  on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures (e.g., software)  embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions  may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory  and\/or within the processor  during execution thereof by the computer system , the main memory  and the processor  also constituting machine-readable media .","While the machine-readable medium  is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d may include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and\/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more instructions  or data structures. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions  for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the presentdisclosure or that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions . The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of machine-readable media  include non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.","Transmission Medium","The instructions  may further be transmitted or received over a communications network  using a transmission medium. The instructions  may be transmitted using the network interface device  and any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., HTTP). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), the Internet, mobile telephone networks, plain old telephone (POTS) networks, and wireless data networks (e.g., WiFi and WiMax networks). The term \u201ctransmission medium\u201d shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions  for execution by the machine, and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.","Although an embodiment has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the disclosure.
