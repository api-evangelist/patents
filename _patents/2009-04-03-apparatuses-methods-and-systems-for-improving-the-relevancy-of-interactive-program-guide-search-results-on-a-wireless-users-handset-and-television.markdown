The IPG implements a search facility whereby users may enter search criteria into a wireless user's handset or television or the like and receive search results sorted to provide the most relevant results first. In one embodiment, a method is disclosed, comprising: receiving search criteria into a search engine; determining one or more search results in response to the search criteria; querying one or more databases of attributes; comparing the search results to the attributes; calculating weights for each of the search results according to one or more attributes; sorting the search results so the results are returned in order of relevance according to the weighting; and returning the results.","It is to be understood that, depending on the particular needs and\/or characteristics of an IPG user, attributes, administrator, data files, servers, data payload, monetization model, hardware configuration, network framework, and\/or the like, various embodiments of the IPG may be implemented that enable a great deal of flexibility and customization. The instant disclosure discusses embodiments of the IPG primarily within the context of cable television based searches through set-top boxes. However, it is to be understood that the IPG described herein may be readily configured\/customized for a wide range of other applications or implementations. For example, aspects of the IPG may be adapted for wireless user handsets, portable mobile devices, computer-based searches, and\/or the like applications. It is to be understood that the IPG may be further adapted to other implementations and\/or applications that return search results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","105","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","205"]},"In one embodiment, the IPG controller  may be housed separately from other modules and\/or databases within the IPG, while in another embodiment, some or all of the other modules and\/or databases may be housed within and\/or configured as part of the IPG controller. Further detail regarding implementations of IPG controller operation, modules, and databases is provided below.","In the implementation illustrated in , the IPG controller  may be configured to couple to external entities via a communications interface . The communications interface may, for example, configure data received from the IPG controller  and\/or any of a variety of external entities for receipt and\/or transmission to other entities and\/or IPG components. In various implementations, a communications interface  may, for example, serve to configure data into application, transport, network, data link, and\/or physical layer formats in accordance with a TCP\/IP communications model. The communications interface  may further be configurable to implement and\/or translate SIP, SIP CPE, VOIP, and\/or the like data formats and\/or protocols. The communications interface  may further house one or more ports, jacks, antennas, and\/or the like to facilitate wired and\/or wireless communications with and\/or within the IPG.","In one implementation, the IPG controller  may further be coupled to a plurality of modules configured to implement IPG facilities and\/or services. A search module  may, in one implementation, be configurable to receive and\/or process a search request. For example it may perform a search query and return results of the search. The search module  may, in one implementation, be further configurable to map search terms. Synonyms of search terms can be mapped to the search terms that were entered, for example. In one implementation, entries that return few or no results can be culled and synonyms for the entered terms can be used to generate additional results. Additional search terms can also be obtained from tracking successive user entries that are entered after a failed search attempt. The additional terms entered after failed search requests can be tied to the original term in a mapping file. Where users enter the same failed search term, but their successive attempts to achieve results are different, additional mappings can include all the successive attempts or the results that are common to each subsequent attempt by the various users. In one implementation, the search module and\/or one or more other IPG components may comprise components of a search engine.","Mapping may also include genre mapping. In one implementation, all genres can be mapped to a subset of genres in a hierarchy so similar genres will return the same results. For example, where the genre \u201cchildren\u201d is searched or the genre \u201ckids\u201d is searched, the results will be mapped to the same genre so that the results of either search will return the appropriate results. For example, a file can be retrieved from the attribute database . An example XML hierarchy map for genres may take the following form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Genre_Mapping>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<Genre_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Name> Entertainment <\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<ID> 11111 <\/ ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Parent_ID> NULL <\/Parent_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Weight> +1 <\/Weight>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Advertiser_ID> 1234 <\/Advertiser_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Advertiser_Weight> +2 <\/Advertiser_Weight>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<\/Genre_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<Genre_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Name> Children's Programming <\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<ID> 22222 <\/ ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Parent_ID> 11111 <\/Parent_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Weight> +2 <\/Weight>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Advertiser_ID> 2223 <\/Advertiser_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Advertiser_Weight> +1 <\/Advertiser_Weight>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<\/Genre_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<Genre_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Name> Kids <\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<ID> 33333 <\/ ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Parent_ID> 22222 <\/Parent_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Weight> +3 <\/Weight>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Advertiser_ID> 5234 <\/Advertiser_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Advertiser_Weight> +4 <\/Advertiser_Weight>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<\/Genre_ID>"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":[{},"<\/Genre_Mapping>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In one embodiment, the file pulled from the database may have genre pairings or mappings in a tree structure, for example where a node may be labeled \u201cchildren's programming\u201d but other genres like kids, children, family, and\/or the like will fall under the children's programming genre in the tree hierarchy. In a similar way, \u201cCollege Football\u201d can be mapped in a hierarchy where \u201cFootball\u201d is a node. Another example of mapping can include spelling mapping so when search terms are misspelled, users can nevertheless receive the results they intended to search for or results they would have received had they entered the correctly spelled search term. For example, a search word typed \u201casorbed\u201d will be mapped to the correct spelling \u201cabsorbed\u201d through a mapping file that contain alternate or common spellings of words. In still another example, abbreviations can be mapped to the complete name so a user can enter an abbreviation or nick name and still achieve results that would be achieved by spelling out the entire term. For example, a search for \u201cEd\u201d should return results that contain the word \u201cEdward.\u201d In still another example, search terms that would properly contain punctuation could be searched without the user having to enter the punctuation which is often difficult or impossible to include depending on the user friendliness of the search entry user interface. For example, some user interfaces may be difficult to use, may not provide certain characters or punctuation marks, or may take too much time if a user has to enter a complete word, title or the like. For example the proper title of the TV show \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d is printed with the asterisks, however this may be inconvenient for a user to enter or it may be unknown to a user. Upon typing the word \u201cMASH\u201d without the asterisks, the popular TV show should nevertheless appear in the results. The mapping files can be maintained in the attributes database and can be imported by the search module periodically. In one embodiment, there can be a file like a dictionary, for example, where nick names, or words without punctuation, or shortened versions of some words are mapped to the complete or more proper version of the words. In such an embodiment the file can be accessed from the attribute database  and the search terms can be compared to the entries in the file so a determination can be made regarding which results should be selected for the entered search terms. Such a file can employ GREP, and\/or the like notation and employ root expanders or wild cards characters within the search tokens so as to allow variations to the search terms, which allows for a more complete and accurate list of results to be obtained.","The attribute module  can apply one or more attributes to the search results. These attributes can include seasonality, geography, time, place or viewing habits of other users, and\/or other like attributes. For example, the seasonality attribute can be used to return results based on sport season, holiday season, time of year, election cycles, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, a time stamp can be identified and compared to a file that will indicate the relevant seasonality which can then be used by the weighting module  to classify the relevance of the search result to the entered request. For example, a search result that contains \u201cChristmas\u201d will get a plus one added to its weight during the holiday season. The sorting module  can then sort the results by weight and return the results to the user. In one embodiment the sorting can be done using a sort algorithm by reading the weights and reorganizing the results from greatest weight to least weight. In another example a geographical attribute can be used to return results based on the geographical location of the user.","In one embodiment, for example, a GPS can be used to determine the location of the user, while for home televisions and set-top boxes, for example, video hub offices (VHOs) can be used. The geography attribute can be used to return results based on the location of the user so that a search for certain sporting events, would return home teams' games and events, or other local viewing opportunities. For example, results containing \u201cPatriots\u201d for a search on the word will receive a plus one weight during football season in Boston. In this example, seasonality and geography can both operated on the results to aggregate and increase the weight assigned to certain results. In this example a result with the word \u201cPatriots\u201d might get one weight value for being a result in a search during football season and another for being in the result list of a search that was initiated in Boston. The relevant geography can be used in conjunction with information associated with a VHO which can then be used by the weighting module  to classify the relevance of the search result to the entered request. The sorting module  can then sort the results by weight and return the results to the user.","In another embodiment, the weighting module  can weight search results based on the results selected by other users that may be proximate in time or place or proximate and\/or otherwise similar in viewing habits with the current user submitting a search request. For example, in one embodiment a popular show such as \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d, as may be ascertained in one implementation from Most Viewed Program statistics, may be assigned an increased weight compared to other assets and\/or program content. A user submitting a search query with \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d among less popularly viewed results may see the more popular program displayed more prominently among the returned results. In one implementation, the popularity of a program may be determined in relation to a subset of all viewers, such as may be defined by a particular set of characteristics, and the subsequent weighting of the result based on that popularity may be applied only for users within that subset. For example, a particular program may be especially popular among users who, according to their user profiles, are in a low-income group. This program may then be assigned an increased weight as a search result for members of this group.","In another embodiment, aspects of user viewing habits as well as search result selections may be stored in association with a user identifier, user profile, and\/or the like. In one implementation, a user's most frequently viewed genres may be stored in association with the user as a characterization of the user's viewing habits. In another implementation, a viewing habit score may be generated, such as on a per-genre basis, for storage in association with the user. For example, a viewing habit score may begin at an initial value for each genre and may be incremented each time a user views a show associated with that genre. Viewer habit proximity may then be established by comparing viewing habit characteristics, favorite genres, viewing habit scores, etc between and\/or across different user profiles. By way of example only, in an implementation in which a user has an associated viewing habit score assigned to each genre, the user may submit a search request. The user's profile may be queried to extract viewing habit scores and a user profiles database may be queried to discern other user profiles having viewing habit scores sufficiently close to those of the searching user (e.g., within a specified number of points). Those user profiles having sufficiently close viewing habit scores may be further queried to determine whether similar queries have been submitted and, if so, which search results were ultimately selected. These or similar results may then be preferentially presented to the searching user in response to the search request.","In general, the weighting module may query different tables in the IPG database, and retrieve weights to augment search results. In one embodiment, the search results from a search query, the results themselves are used to query the IPG database tables to match weight terms. For example, if search results have genre terms that match the XML genre terms already discussed, then the matched terms may include weights that are to be used to resort the search results. In one embodiment, the weights associated with the matched terms (e.g., a +3 weight associated with the \u201ckids\u201d genre term) are used as weights to affect sort rankings. In one embodiment the information regarding the location of users can be obtained from the user database  and compared to the user who has entered certain search criteria. Where users are close in proximity, for example, or viewing habits with the user who is performing the search, a weight of plus one can be added to a result that those other similar users have previously selected.","Users of wireless handsets and televisions select assets to watch, play, record and\/or the like including videos, shows, games, videos on demand, and\/or the like. In one implementation, this data may be logged into the VHOs and\/or may be stored as one or more log files. The logged data in a log file may be extracted and sorted based on the number of selections that each asset receives, and the log file and\/or extracted logged data, such as the most frequently selected assets and\/or program content, may be incorporated in a boosting file and stored in the user database . The search module  can match queries with the indexed data in the boosting file. A list of results can be determined in response to a search request and\/or query by matching keywords in different data fields associated with program content, such as titles, genres and descriptions for example to elements of the search query. In one implementation, a data field comprises a selection of an indexed document and\/or asset which the search module can query against. For example, each document may include subsections such as Title, Description, Actor, Genre, and\/or the like, and queries may be issued to seek matches with terms in one or more of these fields. Some or all of this list of results may be stored in the boosting file. The weighting module  can then weight each item depending on whether it is in the boosting file and which data field associated with program content is matched with the search criteria. For example, in one implementation, a title matching a search query may be weighted more heavily than a genre matching the search query, so a first program with a matching title may be preferentially provided to a searching user over a second program having only a matching genre. The search results generated by a query can be compared to the boosting file. If the search result is found in the boosting file it can be assigned a weight of plus one and it can be assigned additional weights depending on how many or in which data fields the item is found or how many other users selected that result, for example. The final result list can then be sorted by the sorting module  through a sorting algorithm that can re-order the results based on the weight values assigned to each and then the weighted and sorted results can be returned to the user. The boosting file may be updated regularly, such as on a weekly basis in one implementation.","The weighting module  can also interface to the product line of management (PLM) so that search result weighting can be managed for different search terms based on relevancy of different criteria. For example, keywords may be weighted differently depending on what field they are in. For example, a search request with the word \u201cBatman\u201d in it may produce results where the word \u201cBatman\u201d in the title may be weighted more heavily than if it were in a genre or description field.","In one implementation, the IPG controller  may further be coupled to one or more databases configured to store and\/or maintain IPG data. A users database  may contain information or attributes pertaining to users, contact information, profile information, geography, viewing habits, previous search queries and accessed results, identities of hardware devices, CPEs, and\/or the like associated with users, service preferences, system settings, and\/or the like. A hardware database  may contain information or attributes pertaining to hardware devices with which the IPG may communicate, such as but not limited to types of mobile devices, serial number of set-top boxes, television model, CPEs, gateways, routers, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, a robust operating system like Linux, for example, which contains drivers for communications with other devices may be employed allowing for communication using various transmission protocols, data formats, and\/or the like suitable for communicating with hardware devices employed by any of a variety of IPG affiliated entities. An asset database  may contain information or attributes pertaining to shows, videos on demand, videos, games and\/or the like including information regarding titles, studios, actors, directors, descriptions, genres, etc. An attribute database  may contain additional information or attributes that may be used for searching and weighting. These attributes can include seasonality, geography, numbers of users who have selected a certain asset, and other information that could constitute attributes of users or assets.","In another embodiment, a user will be able to work through a user interface to select the relevance criteria that is important to him or her. A user can essentially select a relevance hierarchy and have results sorted or limited by what is most relevant to that particular user.  show implementations of such an interface through screen shots.  is the home page  of the user interface \u201cRelevance Tool\u201d where a user can enter a search term or terms.  shows results returned by the IPG with predetermined relevance values  in a list of all results.

An edit feature  will also provide the user with a means to change or delete changes made to the relevance values.  shows that a relevance value can be entered by the user and saved so that the results will be reordered according to the relevance values selected by the user as shown in . The user can further drill down in the menus  to continue to hone the results for more personalized lists as shown in . In , a drill down item  may be selected before the search is performed so that a user will receive a more tailored list of results from the first search attempt rather than having to perform a series of searches, sorts and drill downs if they choose to do so.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["405","410","415","420","425","430","435"]},"IPG Controller",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"501"},"Typically, users, which may be people and\/or other systems, engage information technology systems (e.g., commonly computers) to facilitate information processing. In turn, computers employ processors to process information; such processors are often referred to as central processing units (CPUs). A common form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative signals to enable various operations. Such communicative signals may be stored and\/or transmitted in batches as program and\/or data components facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction code signals may engage the CPU circuit components to perform desired operations. A common type of program is a computer operating system, which, commonly, is executed by CPU on a computer; the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Common resources employed in information technology systems include: input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer; memory storage into which data may be saved; and processors by which information may be processed. Often information technology systems are used to collect data for later retrieval, analysis, and manipulation, commonly, which is facilitated through a database program. Information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.","In one embodiment, the IPG controller  may be connected to and\/or communicate with entities such as, but not limited to: one or more users from user input devices ; peripheral devices ; a cryptographic processor device ; and\/or a communications network .","Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients, servers, and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted that the term \u201cserver\u201d as used throughout this disclosure refers generally to a computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting \u201cclients.\u201d The term \u201cclient\u201d as used herein refers generally to a computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that facilitates, processes information and requests, and\/or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a \u201cnode.\u201d Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a \u201crouter.\u201d There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks (LANs), Pico networks, Wide Area Networks (WANs), Wireless Networks (WLANs), etc. For example, the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.","The IPG controller  may be based on common computer systems that may comprise, but are not limited to, components such as: a computer systemization  connected to memory .","Computer Systemization","A computer systemization  may comprise a clock , central processing unit (CPU) , a read only memory (ROM) , a random access memory (RAM) , and\/or an interface bus , and most frequently, although not necessarily, the foregoing are all interconnected and\/or communicating through a system bus . Optionally, the computer systemization may be connected to an internal power source . Optionally, a cryptographic processor  and\/or a global positioning system (GPS) component  may be connected to the system bus. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and provides a base signal. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of signals embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative signals may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply signal communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. Of course, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as AMD's Athlon, Duron and\/or Opteron; IBM and\/or MOTOROLA's PowerPC; IBM's and SONY's Cell processor; INTEL'S CELERON, ITANIUM, PENTIUM, XEON, and\/or XScale; and\/or the like processor(s). The CPU interacts with memory through signal passing through conductive conduits to execute stored signal program code according to conventional data processing techniques. Such signal passing facilitates communication within the IPG controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount of speed, parallel, mainframe and\/or super-computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively, should deployment requirements dictate greater portability, smaller Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) may be employed.","Power Source","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like. Other types of AC or DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells, in one embodiment, the case provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell  is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the IPG thereby providing an electric current to all subsequent components. In one example, the power source  is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment, an outside power source  is provided through a connection across the I\/O  interface. For example, a USB and\/or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.","Interface Adapters","Interface bus(es)  may accept, connect, and\/or communicate to a number of interface adapters, conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards, such as, but not limited to: input output interfaces (I\/O) , storage interfaces , network interfaces , and\/or the like. Optionally, cryptographic processor interfaces  similarly may be connected to the interface bus. The interface bus provides for the communications of interface adapters with one another as well as with other components of the computer systemization. Interface adapters are adapted for a compatible interface bus. Interface adapters conventionally connect to the interface bus via a slot architecture. Conventional slot architectures may be employed, such as, but not limited to: Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), Card Bus, (Extended) Industry Standard Architecture ((E)ISA), Micro Channel Architecture (MCA), NuBus, Peripheral Component Interconnect (Extended) (PCI(X)), PCI Express, Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA), and\/or the like.","Storage interfaces  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to a number of storage devices such as, but not limited to: storage devices , removable disc devices, and\/or the like. Storage interfaces may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: (Ultra) (Serial) Advanced Technology Attachment (Packet Interface) ((Ultra) (Serial) ATA(PI)), (Enhanced) Integrated Drive Electronics ((E)IDE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394, fiber channel, Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI), Universal Serial Bus (USB), and\/or the like.","Network interfaces  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to a communications network . Through a communications network , the IPG controller is accessible through remote clients (e.g., computers with web browsers) by users . Network interfaces may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: direct connect, Ethernet (thick, thin, twisted pair 10\/100\/1000 Base T, and\/or the like), Token Ring, wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11a-x, and\/or the like. A communications network may be any one and\/or the combination of the following: a direct interconnection; the Internet; a Local Area Network (LAN); a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN); an Operating Missions as Nodes on the Internet (OMNI); a secured custom connection; a Wide Area Network (WAN); a wireless network (e.g., employing protocols such as, but not limited to a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), I-mode, and\/or the like); and\/or the like. A network interface may be regarded as a specialized form of an input output interface. Further, multiple network interfaces  may be used to engage with various communications network types . For example, multiple network interfaces may be employed to allow for the communication over broadcast, multicast, and\/or unicast networks.","Input Output interfaces (I\/O)  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to user input devices , peripheral devices , cryptographic processor devices , and\/or the like. I\/O may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: Apple Desktop Bus (ADB); Apple Desktop Connector (ADC); audio: analog, digital, monaural, RCA, stereo, and\/or the like; IEEE 1394a-b; infrared; joystick; keyboard; midi; optical; PC AT; PS\/2; parallel; radio; serial; USB; video interface: BNC, coaxial, composite, digital, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), RCA, RF antennae, S-Video, VGA, and\/or the like; wireless; and\/or the like. A common output device is a television set, which accepts signals from a video interface. Also, a video display, which typically comprises a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) or Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) based monitor with an interface (e.g., DVI circuitry and cable) that accepts signals from a video interface, may be used. The video interface composites information generated by a computer systemization and generates video signals based on the composited information in a video memory frame. Typically, the video interface provides the composited video information through a video connection interface that accepts a video display interface (e.g., an RCA composite video connector accepting an RCA composite video cable; a DVI connector accepting a DVI display cable, etc.).","User input devices  may be card readers, dongles, finger print readers, gloves, graphics tablets, joysticks, keyboards, mouse (mice), remote controls, retina readers, trackballs, trackpads, and\/or the like.","Peripheral devices  may be connected and\/or communicate to I\/O and\/or other facilities of the like such as network interfaces, storage interfaces, and\/or the like. Peripheral devices may be audio devices, cameras, dongles (e.g., for copy protection, ensuring secure transactions with a digital signature, and\/or the like), external processors (for added functionality), goggles, microphones, monitors, network interfaces, printers, scanners, storage devices, video devices, video sources, visors, and\/or the like.","It should be noted that although user input devices and peripheral devices may be employed, the IPG controller may be embodied as an embedded, dedicated, and\/or monitor-less (i.e., headless) device, wherein access would be provided over a network interface connection.","Cryptographic units such as, but not limited to, microcontrollers, processors , interfaces , and\/or devices  may be attached, and\/or communicate with the IPG controller. A MC68HC16 microcontroller, commonly manufactured by Motorola Inc., may be used for and\/or within cryptographic units. Equivalent microcontrollers and\/or processors may also be used. The MC68HC16 microcontroller utilizes a 16-bit multiply-and-accumulate instruction in the 16 MHz configuration and requires less than one second to perform a 512-bit RSA private key operation. Cryptographic units support the authentication of communications from interacting agents, as well as allow for anonymous transactions. Cryptographic units may also be configured as part of CPU. Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include VLSI Technology's 33 MHz 6868 or Semaphore Communications' 40 MHz Roadrunner 184.","Memory","Generally, any mechanization and\/or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and\/or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However, memory is a fungible technology and resource; thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the IPG controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; of course, such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  will include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum; a (fixed and\/or removable) magnetic disk drive; a magneto-optical drive; an optical drive (i.e., CD ROM\/RAM\/Recordable (R), ReWritable (RW), DVD R\/RW, etc.); an array of devices (e.g., Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)); and\/or other devices of the like. Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.","Component Collection","The memory  may contain a collection of program and\/or database components and\/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s)  (operating system); information server component(s)  (information server); user interface component(s)  (user interface); Web browser component(s)  (Web browser); database(s) ; mail server component(s) ; mail client component(s) ; cryptographic server component(s)  (cryptographic server); the IPG component(s) ; and\/or the like (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","Operating System","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the IPG controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Plan 9; Be OS; Unix and Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and\/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and\/or the like); and\/or the like operating systems. However, more limited and\/or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS, IBM OS\/2, Microsoft DOS, Microsoft Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista\/XP (Server), Palm OS, and\/or the like. An operating system may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and\/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may enable the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the IPG controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the IPG controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, and\/or the like.","Information Server","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and\/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the IPG controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port 21, and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the IPG database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the IPG database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the IPG. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the IPG as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","User Interface","The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, functionality, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, functionality, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS\/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista (i.e., Aero)\/XP, or Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by, with, and\/or atop operating systems and\/or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and\/or operation of program components and\/or system facilities through textual and\/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact with, and\/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The user interface may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Web Browser","A Web browser component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and\/or the like. Some Web browsers allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, web browser plug-in APIs (e.g., FireFox, Safari Plug-in, and\/or the like APIs), and\/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, and\/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. Of course, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the IPG enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","Mail Server","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POP3), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and\/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the IPG.","Access to the IPG mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","Mail Client","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP3, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","Cryptographic Server","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash function), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the IPG may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the IPG component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the IPG and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The IPG Database","The IPG database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the IPG database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data, but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the IPG database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the IPG database  may be integrated into another component such as the IPG component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A Users table may include fields such as, but not limited to: user_ID, user_name, contact_info, hardware_ID, mobile_device_type, usage_history, and\/or the like. A Hardware table may include fields such as, but not limited to: hardware_ID, hardware_type, hardware_name, data_formatting_requirements, protocols, addressing_info, usage_history, hardware_requirements, user_ID, and\/or the like. An IPG table may include fields such as, but not limited to: asset-ID, attribute_ID, user_ID, weight_ID, mapping_data, log_file_ID, time, date, source, destination, and\/or the like. These tables may support and\/or track multiple entity accounts on the IPG controller.","In one embodiment, the IPG database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search IPG component may treat the combination of the IPG database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the IPG. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the IPG may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The IPG may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The IPG database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the IPG database communicates with the IPG component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The IPG Component","The IPG component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the IPG component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the IPG that was discussed in the previous figures. As such, the IPG affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The IPG component is configurable to access, calculate, engage, exchange, generate, identify, instruct, match, process, search, serve, store, and\/or facilitate communication channels between IPG components and\/or affiliated entities, transmission of search criteria, results, and\/or the like and use of the IPG.","The IPG component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the IPG server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The IPG component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the IPG component communicates with the IPG database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The IPG may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Distributed IPGs","The structure and\/or operation of any of the IPG node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the IPG controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), local and remote application program interfaces Jini, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. Again, the configuration will depend upon the context of system deployment.","The entirety of this disclosure (including the Cover Page, Title, Headings, Field, Background, Summary, Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description, Claims, Abstract, Figures, and otherwise) shows by way of illustration various embodiments in which the claimed inventions may be practiced.
