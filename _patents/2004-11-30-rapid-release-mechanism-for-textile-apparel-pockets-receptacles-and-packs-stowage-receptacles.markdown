{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention provides the mechanism whereby contents of an apparel receptacle (pocket) or a stowage receptacle (bag, pack) can be accessed or released upon via a one-handed operation of the mechanism. The present invention relates to (1) garments worn by humans, particularly to pockets designed or located such that contents stored therein are difficult to access because of the location of the opening mechanism and (2) other stowage receptacles (e.g., bags, packs, luggage, etc.) wherein quick access to content therein is hampered by an inconvenient location or requires two-handed operation of the opening mechanism.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Textile apparel and its accessory storage items, such as bags and packs often provide the human user (hereafter termed \u201cuser\u201d) mechanisms that enable the storage of and access to ancillary items. These mechanisms include hardware clips and rings, textile loops, textile pouches, and cloth pockets. Items stored in such features can include a variety of items including personal items, tools, and, particularly for those in high-risk-of-injury occupations, survival aids.","The current invention was created from design of a special type of coverall naval aviators use called an immersion protective coverall (also known as \u201cdry-suit\u201d and \u201canti-exposure suit\u201d) that function to protect the wearer from wetting in cold seas and resultant hypothermia. A major shortcoming of conventional coveralls is the lack of a cloth pocket that provides an accessible location secure storage, while allowing quick access to the protective gloves required to be worn to survive cold water mishaps. However, the only conventional accessible pockets are hidden under a heavily laden survival vest, or are out of reach on the calf or on the thigh. Adding to the difficulty is the closure mechanism, a metal zipper that requires two hands to operate\u2014one to move the metal slider, and the other to provide countertension that enables slider movement. Operations that require two hands should be strictly avoided in the design of survival equipment because of concomitant injuries that may disable one hand or arm of the user. Thus, although the hand protection provided by protective gloves is technically available, it is not accessible to the user. The present invention develops a rapid release mechanism to enable fast access of the pocket contents using one hand. Side benefits of the invention are abrasion protection for the elbow area underneath the pocket, and because the gloves are made of soft materials, cushioning the wearer's elbow during flight.","The primary objective of the present invention is to enable one-handed rapid release of the closure mechanism to allow access to pocket or bag contents from an inconvenient location. The mechanism enables pulling open two sides of the receptacle, be it pocket or bag and simultaneously, thus releasing contents by the use of one hand.","In accordance with the above objectives, a panel is provided that comprises the rapid release mechanism installed on a fabric panel and can represent a pocket of a garment or the access panel for a bag. The invention comprises: (a) first panel (containing the rapid release mechanism) that overlaps and attaches to a fabric panel (representing the garment or bag) having an access region, such that all edges of the first panel are in correspondence with one another, two edges being attached permanently, and the other two access edges being engaged with each other, via a reversible closure, and shaped such that these two access edges are roughly perpendicular to each other; (b) one or more thongs travel freely within a novel fabric tunnel (called a \u201ccasing\u201d) of which the pulling ends of the thongs extend beyond the mouth of the casing, and the terminal ends of the thongs are permanently attached at the first panel access edges; and (c) a gripper for the user's fingers or teeth to grasp and apply a pulling force on the thongs' pulling ends such that the terminal ends pull two panel access edges away from the access region of the fabric panel. The reversible closure apparatus includes a first and second reciprocal members releasabley engageable with each other with the first reciprocal member being attached to one of the first two access edges and the second reciprocal second member being attached to the other two access edges. The first and second reciprocal members being arranged so that when one access edge is placed on the other edge, releasable engagement occurs therebetween.","The above and other novel features and advantages of the invention, including various novel details of the construction and combination of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out by the claims. It will be understood that the particular devices of the different embodiments are shown and described herein by way of illustration only, and not as limitations of the invention.","With reference to the drawings wherein the same reference number indicates the same element throughout, there is illustrated in  a garment , more particularly, coveralls  constructed in a conventional fashion from materials selected from the group consisting of fabrics of woven and non-woven constructions and having laminated or coated treatment. The coveralls  are worn by a person .","In general, and as to be further described, the present invention provides a fabric panel having an access region used for storing items. The rapid release mechanism includes (a) a first panel having four edges and embodying the rapid release. The first panel overlaps and attaches to the fabric panel such that all four edges of the first panel are in correspondence with each other and such that two of the four edges of the first panel are attached to the fabric panel and the other two of the four edges serve as access regions that are substantially perpendicular to each other. The two access edges are engaged with each other by a reversible closure apparatus and in alignment with the access region of the fabric panel. The rapid release mechanism further comprises (b) a casing serving as a fabric tunnel having a mouth and length so as to extend across the first panel and attach to two access edges. The rapid release mechanism further comprises (c) at least one thong that enters the mouth of the casing and travels freely within the fabric tunnel. The thong has oppositely spaced pulling and terminal ends with the terminal end attached to two access edges of the first panel and the pulling end extending beyond the mouth of the casing and (d) a gripper to provide fingers or teeth of the wearer of the fabric panel to grasp and apply a pulling force on the thongs' pulling end such that the terminal end pulls two of the first panel access edges away from the panel access regions.","The person of  is depicted as an individual who is unable to reach open and access the pocket or receptacle  with one hand. The person may represent any individual such as those in the military, whereas the coveralls  may be anti-exposure coveralls , particularly useful for those in the military. The coveralls  have an inconvenient location  whose access is enhanced by the practice of the present invention, and which may be further described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["18","10","20","10","20","22","20","24","26","20","28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","10","30","30","30"]},"The receptacle  for storage comprises at least one pocket comprised of first and second sheets of material  and , respectively, that may be selected from the group of materials comprising fabrics of woven or non-woven construction and having laminated or coated treatment. In one embodiment, sheet  serves as a fabric panel or second panel permanently attached to the wearable garment and sheet  serves as a first panel, which embodies the rapid release mechanism of the present invention. The shape of the first and second sheets is a predetermined shape and may be selected from the group consisting of rectangular or rounded corner, such that the two access edges, to be further described, are roughly perpendicular to each other. Each of the sheets  and  has an access region respectively shown in  by reference designations A and A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIGS. 3"],"b":["30","32","10","34","36","32","32","34","32","34","30","4","5","32","34","32","34","36"]},"Dimensions of sheets  and  are dependent upon the intended end-use. The functional length of these sheets  and  should be nearly equivalent to the diagonal length component of the first panel , and no longer than necessary. The length of the pull thong , to be further described, directly determines the amount of arm movement required to effect separation of first panel  from the fabric panel . The dimensions of a pocket provided by receptacle  designed to carry gloves, for instance, may be six (6) inches in width by nine (9) inches in length which are the approximate dimensions of the glove itself preferably stowed in the pocket . Thus, a short jerk of the pull thong  releases the gloves from the pocket . For a contrasting example, an emergency responder's bag, the rapid release access panel provided by the first panel , would need to be sized large enough to enable extraction of the largest object therewithin, but not so large that the required arm pulling movement is in excess of the wearer's functional arm reach. A maximum pull thong  length of 12 to 15 inches extending our from under the stitching  is recommended.","More particularly, the fabric panel and first panel  and , respectively, are sewn together on only two sides allowing two complete sides of the receptacle  to be open simultaneously and rapidly in a manner to be further described hereinafter. The fabric panel  is preferably open-pleated along the long axis of the receptacle , so as to add volume to the receptacle .","The receptacle  for storage further comprises a casing  serving as a fabric tunnel  and which is attached to the first panel , such as stitching . The casing  is attached to the sheet  so as to extend into at least a portion of the second access region A as shown in . For the embodiment shown in , the \u201cV\u201d shaped casing  runs diagonally from the lower corner of the first panel  to the lateral corners of first panel , which includes the access region A.","The casing  contains a thong , serving as a gripper, that has a terminal end affixed within the fabric tunnel  and which has a portion that protrudes from the lower corner of the first panel  under the stitching . The thong  enters the mouth of the tunnel fabric  and travels freely therein. The thong  has oppositely spaced pulling and terminal ends with the terminal end attached to the access edge A and the pulling end extending beyond the mouth of the tunnel fabric . The thong , preferably of a doubled, narrow textile tape or webbing, may also have attached thereto an apparatus for facilitating the grasping, gripping and pulling thereof selected from the group consisting of a bead , and a self-knot  threaded through the bead .","The receptacle  for storage further comprises a reversible closure apparatus  comprised of at least a first and a second reciprocal members releasably engageable with each other. The first reciprocal member is shown in  as a pile fastening tape , whereas the second reciprocal member is preferably comprised of the two hook arrangements  and . The first and second members are complementary selected from each other, and in addition to the hook ( and ) and pile fastening tape (), consist of the group including unlocked slide fastener chains, light duty snap tape, and basted stitches that are to be further described hereinafter with reference to  illustrating additional embodiments of the present invention.","In operation, the receptacle  for storage is closed by a hook ( and ) and pile fastening tape (), along the \u201cL\u201d shaped region of the lateral opposite edge formed from adjacent side edges as shown in . The remaining sides of the rectangular receptacle  are stitched to the coveralls or garment . This configuration allows two sides of the receptacle  to be opened\/closed to allow ingress\/egress to the contents stowed therein. The user can merely grip the thong  or bead  with fingers from one hand or with teeth to peel the corner occupied by the access regions A and A down thereby providing rapid access for releasing the contents stored in receptacle .","It should now be appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides for the receptacle  that allows rapid access, via one hand to the contents being stored therein and that is inconveniently located over the elbow . This location, which is particularly inconvenient because it is hard to see and access, is utilized by the present invention because receptacle  provides rapid exposure of its contents by the user by merely gripping thong  with fingers of one hand or with teeth and pulling the corner of the receptacle  down, thereby, releasing the contents that are stored therein.","Another embodiment A of a receptacle for storage for a garment , may be further described with reference to . The embodiment A of  is similar to the embodiment  of , with the exception that the casing  and fabric tunnel  of  have been replaced with a \u201cY\u201d shaped arrangement for both a casing  and a fabric tunnel . The upper portion, for example, the upper portion of the \u201cY\u201d shaped fabric tunnel  is comprised of its upper members A and B extends into the second access region A. Further, the thong  of  preferably, as shown in , has a further gripping device comprising the pull thong  threaded through a plastic bead  and self-knotted  to secure the bead .","In operation, the embodiment A of  operates in the same manner as the embodiment  of , with the exception that the user need only pull the bead member  which, in turn, moves the thong  in the direction indicated by directional arrow  causing the access region A to be rapidly exposed and, thereby, allowing the contents retained in the receptacle  for storage to be rapidly accessed.","Another embodiment B of the present invention serving as a receptacle for storage, may be further described with reference to . The embodiment B of  is similar to the embodiment  of , with the exception that the casing  and fabric tunnel  of  has been replaced and two spaced apart casing A and B having associated fabric tunnels A and B, respectively. Each of the spaced apart casings A and B having fabric tunnels A and B, respectively, acts as a channel having at least a portion that extends in to the second access region A, with at least the second region A having located thereunder the pile fastening tape  on the first sheet  as shown in . Further, the narrow textile tape thong  of  is replaced by a \u201cU\u201d shaped member . The singe pull \u201cU\u201d shaped member  runs through the fabric tunnels A and B and thus serves a strap where it crosses from one casing A to the next B. casing A to the next B. Further, the \u201cU\u201d shaped member  can function as the thong , or can be attached to a different gripping device, such as the \u201cT\u201d shaped member  or any of the heretofore described gripping device. The first panel  of the embodiment The first panel  of the embodiment B serves as a dart, that is a stitched tapered fold. This dart replaces the pleated arranged first panel or sheet  of , so as to increase the volume of the receptacle B for storage of its contents.","In operation, the embodiment of B of , works in a similar manner as that of the embodiment  of , with the exception that an operator need only pull \u201cT\u201d shaped member  causing the \u201cU\u201d shaped member  to be moved in direction , which simultaneously opens the access region A thereby exposing two sides of the receptacle B. This exposure is done in a rapid access manner merely by pulling on the \u201cU\u201d shaped member .","The receptacle B for storage of  has contained therein a pair of gloves, not shown, interposed between the panels  and  and being located over the elbow .
