{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT REGARDING GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. J-FBI-02-101 awarded by the Department of Justice. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention relates generally to a system, apparatus and method for forensically approximating facial characteristics, and more particularly to a computer-based system, apparatus and method for forensic facial approximation.","For more than one century, facial reconstruction has been used to recreate the appearance of a person's face based on a discovered skull. The field of facial reconstruction is divided into three main classes, namely facial restoration, superimposition, and facial approximation. Forensic facial restoration is used to create a lifelike representation of an unidentified individual whose face has been mutilated or decomposed, but for which much of the soft tissues and bone are available. Superimposition seeks to determine whether, given a photograph of an individual, a questioned skull is a sufficient match for the depicted face. The skull is overlaid with a transparency of the photograph, and anatomical landmarks on the skull and the photograph are compared to confirm or rule out a possible match.","Forensic facial approximation is the building of a three-dimensional model of the face from a skull or skull replica when there is no direct information about the original form of the face. Three-dimensional facial approximation can be traced back to the latter half of the nineteenth century. The earliest three-dimensional facial approximations were accomplished by measuring the thickness of the soft tissue at various positions on the faces of cadavers. Using the average of these values, a technique was developed for building a facial approximation on a skull. Several researchers have created general tissue depth tables. Further, tissue depth tables for various races have been created.","Researchers have more recently adapted facial approximation techniques to the computer. One researcher has developed a three-dimensional reconstruction system using a color laser scanner to digitize an unknown skull, a user interface to add average tissue depths, and a color laser scanner to digitize and add facial features.","Many of the computer-based approaches work directly on either volumetric or CT images or work from polygonal models derived from CT data or obtained directly from a range sensor.","Forensic facial reconstruction has two conflicting constraints. A reconstruction must contain sufficient detail for the face to be recognizable, but must not inject detail where detail does not exist.","The present invention describes an apparatus, a system and a method for performing a three-dimensional forensic facial approximation for a skull of unknown identity.","One exemplary embodiment of the invention is a system for performing a forensic facial approximation. The system includes an acquisition subsystem for acquiring models of known skulls and of a questioned skull, and a facial approximation algorithm for comparing the models of the known skulls with the model of the questioned skull and for removing variation in the facial structure of the questioned skull due to skeletal variation between the known skulls and the questioned skull.","One aspect of the exemplary system embodiment is that the acquisition subsystem comprises at least one from the group consisting of a computed tomography machine, an MRI machine, an ultrasound machine, and a laser range finding apparatus, and that the models of the known skulls are superimposed upon the model of the questioned skull and warped to alter the shape of the known skulls to the shape of the questioned skull.","Another exemplary embodiment of the invention is a method for performing a forensic facial approximation. The method includes the steps of acquiring models of known skulls and a model of a questioned skull, comparing the models of the known skulls with the model of the questioned skull, and removing variation in the facial structure of the questioned skull due to skeletal variation between the known skulls and the questioned skull.","Another exemplary embodiment of the invention is a method for performing a facial approximation and tailoring the resultant approximation to specific assumed facial characteristics. The method includes the steps of comparing models of known skulls with a model of a questioned skull, superimposing the models of the known skulls upon the model of the questioned skull, warping the models of the known skulls to alter the shape of the known skulls to the shape of the questioned skull, and removing variation in the facial structure of the questioned skull due to skeletal variation between the known skulls and the questioned skull. The removing variation step includes superimposing models of known soft tissue upon the questioned skull and warping the models of the known soft tissue to provide the facial structure of the questioned skull.","Another exemplary embodiment of the invention is an apparatus for use in a computerized system for performing a forensic facial approximation. The apparatus includes a bony structure software component for comparing models of known skulls with a model of a questioned skull, a bony structure warping software component for removing variation between the bony structure of the questioned skull and the bony structure of the known skulls, and a soft tissue software component for warping models of soft tissue from the known skulls onto a model of a questioned skull.","These and other advantages and features will be more readily understood from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention that is provided in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the invention, as described and illustrated herein, are directed to a system and a methodology for performing a forensic facial approximation on a questioned skull S(). The questioned skull Sis a skull for which an identification is being sought. The questioned skull Sis compared to a multitude of known skulls S, and characteristics of the known skulls Sare translated onto the questioned skull Sto provide a mapping from the known skulls Sto the questioned skull S. The mapping is then applied to the associated known faces Fto derive an average questioned face F. Further, characteristics of the known faces Fof the known skulls Sobtained after mapping provide likely variations from the average questioned face F.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 10"],"sub":["K ","Q","K ","K ","Q ","K ","Q "],"b":["12","52","52"]},"With specific reference to , next will be described the generation of a face-space  () that contains a recognizable representation of the questioned face F. For ease of illustration,  illustrate the generation of a single input to the face-space .  illustrates the culmination of the preprocessing steps by showing the superimposition of skull Son skull Sto form a superimposed skull S.  also shows a preprocessed and un-deformed representation of the known face F. After the preprocessing steps, representations of the known and questioned skulls S, Sare deformed, or warped, through a warping function T( ). This warping function maps the known skull Sonto the questioned skull Sas being approximately equal to T(S). The function for the questioned face Fcan be written as F=T(F). Through these algorithms, known skulls Sare warped onto the questioned skull S, and the same warping function is applied to known faces F, thereby causing warping of the known face Fonto the questioned skull Sto generate a questioned face F. These algorithms are designed to tolerate holes in the representational data (due to missing bony sections) in the questioned skull S. The warping algorithm is designed to merge the surface of a known skull Swith the surface of a questioned skull S, as shown in .","A portion of the algorithms relies upon finding and matching crest lines  or lines of maximal curvature on the skull. Such lines are formally calculated based on spatial derivatives of the skull surface. Approximate crest lines  may be determined by looking at the angle of intersection between a pair of triangular patches. If the angle of intersection is high, namely greater than a threshold of thirty degrees (30\u00b0), the line of intersection is considered a crest line .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 10","FIG. 4"],"b":["20","54","54","54","12"],"sub":["K ","Q ","Q","K ","K ","K","K ","K ","Q","K","1","K","1 ","K","2","K","2 ","K","3","K","3 ","1 ","3 ","K ","Q","2 ","Q ","K","K"],"sup":["1","2","\u22121","1","3","2","2"]},"The complete warping of the three passes can be represented by the algorithm T(S)=t(t(t(S))). Each of the three passes has the same construction and includes removing outliers to aid robustness when registering to incomplete skulls. If, for example, an attempt is made to calculate a deformable transformation t( ) for pass i, such that Sis approximately t(S), outlier removal is accomplished by generating a rigid transform r\u2032(S). Such a transform is an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm that finds points on two skulls that lie close to one another when the skulls are aligned. Given a source Sand a target S, the ICP algorithm (a) selects a set Pof n points from S, (b) selects a set Pof the n closest matching points from S, (c) calculates the rigid transformation that minimizes the distance between the sets Pand P, (d) applies the transform to P, and (e) starts over by finding a new set P. The set Pis denoted as the source landmarks and the set Pas the target landmarks of r\u2032( ).","The rigid transformation r\u2032( ) rigidly transforms the skulls in a direction opposite from the desired direction. Although this transformation ultimately is discarded, it serves to identify points P\u2009Sthat are close to S. Sis a polygonal surface including points, edges and surfaces, and Pis a subset of the points. It can be reasonably ascertained that at any point p\u2009Phas a close corresponding point P\u2009S. In other words, if a point is in the target landmarks of the initial rigid transformation, it can be assumed that the point is not an outlier, does not lie over a missing bony structure in the source skull, and must have a close correspondence to a source point.","A new ICP transform r\u2032( ) is then calculated based only on the reduced set of points, such that Sapproximates r\u2032(P). By limiting the source points from which r\u2032( ) can select, the members of Pare limited to only valid correspondence points.","A final step is the calculation of a deformation d. This calculation treats the correspondences as lying in a deformable medium and pushes and pulls points in the source set until they lie close to the target set. Deformations propagate outward from the source points. Alignment between the source points and the corresponding target points is not absolute and a relaxation parameter \u03c3 allows the algorithm to trade off positional accuracy of the alignment with stresses induced by the deformation. The source landmarks of the second ICP registration, r\u2032(P), are selected as the points to be deformed by a thin plate spline. The fixed points of the deformation are determined by searching the skull surface Sfor the closest point on the skull surface with a surface normal orientation within a threshold of the surface normal at the corresponding point in r\u2032(P). The full transformation, t, is then given as t(X)=d(r\u2032(X)). As indicated in , the three passes calculate successively better approximations for Ssuch that Sis a better approximation of Sthan S, which itself is a better approximation of Sthan S:\n\n()\n\n(), and\n\n().\n","Although the passes are conceptually the same, different inputs and different parameters are chosen to achieve desired results. For the first pass, the skull features are coarsely aligned. The selected points are limited to points on the crest lines  and Pand Pare limited to roughly two hundred points each. The angle constraint between normals is fairly rigid, requiring source and target points for the deformation to be within about eighteen degrees. The relaxation parameter \u03c3 is set at  to allow the thin plate spline more freedom to define smooth transformations.  shows a superimposition of the two skulls, denoted as S, following the initial alignment pass.  further shows the associated facial deformation of the superimposed skull Sas F. This first pass is designed to bring areas of high curvature on known skulls Sinto alignment with corresponding areas on a questioned skull S.","The second pass is designed to work similarly to the first pass, except that the matching is from the questioned skull Sto the known skulls S. The second pass attempts to reconcile skull areas where the first pass algorithm was unable to correctly differentiate between multiple candidate crest lines on the questioned skull S. By running the same algorithm in the opposite direction on the same points, a higher likelihood is created that conflicts can be resolved. As with the first pass, the points available for registration are limited to those lying on crest lines of the skull. Unlike the first pass, the number of landmarks used in the registration is increased to the range of about 200-350. Since the second pass is a reverse of the first pass, the actual warping is such that Sapproximates t(S), and S=t(S). The relaxation parameter \u03c3 is set at 1 and the deformation is set at sixty degrees.  illustrates the skull alignment (S) and corresponding facial deformation (F) following the completion of the second pass. As can be seen by a comparison of , the major changes from the second pass are in the maxilla\/front tooth region where the known skull and soft tissue are pulled in toward the questioned skull surface and in the frontal process region where the known skull and soft tissue are pulled out toward the questioned skull surface.","Finally, the third pass is intended to complete the skull deformation. An even larger number of landmarks, specifically divided up between the landmarks used in the second pass and an additional 200-500 landmarks chosen from the smooth skull surfaces, are used to ensure dense coverage of the skull. Stiffer splines force greater alignment between the correspondences chosen, and so the relaxation parameter \u03c3 is again set at 1 and the deformation is again set at sixty degrees.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":["K3","Q3"]},"The ICP algorithm is used to align different instances of deformed skulls and used in the selection of landmarks for the thin plate spline deformation. The landmarks selected for the three passes are shown in, respectively, , , and . As can be seen, the number of landmarks used increases from (first pass) to (third pass). As noted previously, all of the landmarks of and are used to calculate the third pass deformation.  illustrates a close up view of the right zygomatic process and ascending ramus of the mandible of the skulls following each step of the registration. Specifically, shows the initial alignment, and -respectively show the alignments following each of the three passes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 11"],"b":["50","50","52","54","56","50","54","54","56","56","58","56","56"],"sub":["Q ","Q ","K "]},"Referring with specific reference to , next will be described a method for performing a forensic facial approximation between a questioned skull Sand a database of known skull representations S. At Step , a transformation of the known skulls Sfrom the known skull database  into the questioned skull Sis performed. The transformation is accomplished through warping of variations. Step  represents the three passes described above with reference to ), (), and (). At Step , each three-dimensional skull representation Sis reduced into a one-dimensional vector. A matrix of the one-dimensional vectors is prepared at Step . A mean of the matrix is computed to obtain an average face at Step .","Finally, at Step , a covariance is computed. The covariance may be computed through a standard mathematical technique, namely a principle component analysis (PCA). The PCA utilizes the concept that eigenvectors vary most along the line of the greatest eigenvalue, thus allowing one using PCA to determine how data varies together. Specifically, using PCA allows one to denote that the change in one part of the model concurrently causes changes in other parts of the model. Thus, instead of independently adjusting each point comprising the representation of the approximated face, one can utilize PCA and ascertain how deformation occurs more naturally through the population of the faces of the known skull database  after warping. It should also be appreciated that, with any particular questioned skull S, one may have additional information that can be used to prevent the change of any particular voxel based upon other voxel changes. For example, one may have heuristic or a priori data regarding the position of the tip of the nose of the questioned skull Srelative to the face. That data allows certain data in the face space to become static, or to only change a small amount.","The system and method described thus far encodes the face and skull as a matrix of radial distance measurements outward from a central axis. Following the generation of the faces F, this depth-based encoding forms the basis for the input to the PCA and subsequent generation of the face-space . This is only one of the possible encodings of the faces F. As an alternative to using depth, feature points, such as, for example, the tip of the nose or corner of the eye, can be marked and tracked through the warping of the known faces Finto the faces F. A linearization of the three-dimensional coordinates of these points, augmented by additional points on the face determined from them, can form the basis for the PCA analysis and generation of the face-space , separate from that derived from the depth-based encoding.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["200","205"],"sub":["K","K "]},"At Step , one arbitrary transformed face is nominated to be a canonical face F\u2032_c. The feature points for the canonical face F\u2032_c are fp\u2032_c. Then, a warping function wf_i( ) is defined such that the feature points fp\u2032_c on the canonical face F\u2032_c are transformed into the feature points for the i'th warped face F\u2032_i at Step . The warping function wf_i( ) is defined based upon the relationship between the canonical face feature points fp\u2032_c and the i'th warped face feature points fp\u2032_i. Preferably, the warping function wf_i( ) is a basic thin plate spline transform. This second warping stage aligns the features of each face F\u2032_I with that of the canonical face F\u2032_c, allowing arbitrary points on the canonical face to be put in to correspondence with points on each of the faces F\u2032_i.","At Step , a new set N of points, f\u2033p_c, are selected from the canonical face F\u2032_c. Ideally, f\u2033p_c contains those points f\u2032p_c with additional points specified manually to highlight areas of concern, and\/or selected randomly by the computer software. Correspondences between the points f\u2033p_c and points on the faces F\u2032_I are calculated as f\u2033p_i. This is accomplished by transforming the feature points fp\u2032_c as well as its normal, and then intersecting the normal with the transformed surface. The set of points f\u2033p_I are linearized by their (x, y, z) coordinates and the resulting vectors composited into a matrix M of the one-dimensional vectors as described with reference to Step . Processing of the matrix M proceeds on as described previously. There are N feature points on the canonical face and L samples in the database. Next, at Step , the mean face is computed using the equation C=(M\u2212mean)(M\u2212mean). Further, E is computed such that CE+E(Lambda).","While the invention has been described in detail in connection with only a limited number of embodiments, it should be readily understood that the invention is not limited to such disclosed embodiments.
