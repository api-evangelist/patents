title: Localization of short duration periodic signals
abstract: A method for localizing signals of interest includes initializing characteristics of the signals. Signals are acquired from a sensor array having at least three acoustic sensors. After digitization and conditioning, the signals associated with each sensor are validated by comparison with initialized characteristics. The signals are correlated across sensor groups to obtain time differences of arrival (TDOA). These TDOA are validated and associated with other TDOA from different times. TDOA from different sensor pairs are associated when they share a common sensor. A hyperbola of possible locations is created for each validated TDOA. Summation of the hyperbolas gives an intensity function. The location is identified as the most intense point in the intensity function. The source can be tracked across time as a computer output.

More particularly it relates to locating and tracking these sources utilizing time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) validation and association measures.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","In passive sonar, as shown in , it is well known to deploy an array of acoustic sensors  from a vessel  in a body of water . Each acoustic sensor or hydrophone  on array  is positioned a known distance from another hydrophone  along the array line or other such structure. Hydrophones  are capable of receiving acoustic signals  from sources such as . Array  is typically joined to a signal processor  on board vessel . Once such a signal has been received at several hydrophones , signal processor  utilizes the time the signal  arrives at each hydrophone  to calculate a time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) between several pairs of hydrophones. The signal processor  has a sound velocity profile from either calculation, a database or a determination giving the speed of sound in the body of water , and separation between the hydrophones  is also known. Using the known distances, the sound velocity profile and the TDOAs from the array, the signal processor can utilize hyperbolic calculations to determine the location of source .","Source  can be a variety of sources, such as vessels, pingers, marine mammals or the like. Marine mammals and other biological sources often make short duration periodic signals such as clicks. It is common to locate whales by measuring the time difference for the same click arriving at two spaced hydrophones.","There are several deficiencies with the current state of the art. First, many false TDOA measurements are created with TDOA estimates that are found using correlation. When data from two hydrophones are correlated, the noise that is independently received at each sensor does not correlate well and produces very little or no output. However, when a common signal is present at the two hydrophones, it will cause a correlation peak at the TDOA estimate. When the signal is weak, it is difficult to separate the valid TDOA measurements from fluctuations caused by noise or false peaks spaced from the true peak by the period of the repeating click sequence.","Another issue with the current state of the art arises when more than one source is present with each source having a similar signal. This can occur when the sources are whales in a pod. In this case, a set of hyperbolic solutions will be created for each source and many false intersections are created when the hyperbolic solutions of one source intersects the solutions of another source. It is impossible to know that these intersections are false unless additional information is made available. One way to resolve these ambiguities is to only accept intersections of hyperbolic solutions from hydrophone pairs that share one hydrophone (referred to as hydrophone triples). This results in a fixed relationship between the TDOA measurements that can be checked for consistency.","The problem with the hydrophone triple method is that it does not lend itself well to soft decisions, in other words, whether the TDOAs are related or not related. Granted, it could be adapted to a soft measure simply by measuring how well the fixed relationship holds. However, to get a meaningful measure of association, it is necessary to compare the full set of click arrivals that went into making the TDOA estimate.","As can be seen, there is a need for improved methods for detection, TDOA determination and TDOA association for localization of sources such as marine mammals and other short duration periodic signal sources.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for locating short duration periodic signal sources.","It is a further object to locate such sources in three dimensions.","Another object is the ability to distinguish one signal source from another in the same environment.","It is yet another object to track signal sources from one time to a next.","Accordingly, there is provided a method for localizing and tracking a short duration periodic signal source utilizing a computer. The method includes initializing signal characteristics of signals of interest and acquiring signals from a sensor array having at least three acoustic sensors. The signals are digitized and conditioned based on initialized signal characteristics. The conditioned signals are validated for each sensor by comparison with initialized signal characteristics. The validated conditioned signal associated with one sensor are correlated with the validated conditioned signal associated with another sensor for each sensor pair in the sensor array to obtain time differences of arrival for each sensor pair. These time differences of arrival are validated for each sensor pair. Time differences of arrival from different times from the same sensor pairs are associated with each other, and time differences of arrival from different sensor pairs are associated with each other when the time differences of arrival share a common sensor. Hyperbolas of possible source locations are created for each validated time difference of arrival. These hyperbolas are summed to obtain an intensity function. The location of the signal of interest can be found at a time as the position in the intensity function having the greatest intensity. A source can be tracked across time by utilizing the identified location and associated validated time differences of arrival from different times. The identified location and track can be provided as computer output.","Referring now to , there is shown a flowchart  giving an overview of the current procedure. Details of each step in the method will be provided following this overview. In step , the method is initialized by developing known information for use in the method. This includes a generic replica of the signal of interest, a range of frequencies for the signal of interest, and a threshold time used to distinguish reflected signals from source signals. The method also uses a computer model trained from experimental and known data to identify valid data and invalid data. This computer model is developed before using the current method to localize signal sources.","In step , signals are acquired from an array of hydrophones having at least three hydrophones as described with reference to . The signals are digitized and processed separately. A typical input signal in the time domain is given in . Each signal is correlated in step  with the replica developed in step . This correlation reduces signals from sources other than the source of interest and is known in the prior art. Each correlated signal is transformed into a frequency domain signal utilizing a Fourier transform in step . In step , peaks are found in the time domain. Peaks not meeting previously developed parameters concerning frequency and timing are eliminated in step . A first order smoothed click map (SCM) is developed for each signal in step . This SCM is time windowed in step  to create a windowed first order smoothed click map (WSCM). In step , the SCM from one hydrophone is correlated with the WSCM from a second hydrophone. An initial time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) can be given by a peak from this correlation.","In step , the initial TDOAs are examined to determine if these initial TDOAs are valid. This is performed by calculating a second order smoothed click map (SCM) and determining if the clicks occur with an expected inter-click interval established in step . Another validation test is performed by analyzing the autocorrelation function of the SCM. The trained computer model from step  can be used to establish this validity from these measures as described below. On completion of this step, invalid TDOAs are removed from processing. In step , TDOAs from different time segments are associated with each other for tracking a source across time segments. TDOAs from different sensor pairs incorporating one common sensor can be associated with one another in step . This step produces an association measure that can be used to further modify the analysis. The associated TDOAs are used to create hyperbolas indicating the source location in step . Different sensor pairs give different hyperbolas. These created hyperbolas are modified by an association measure calculated in step  and summed in step  to get an intensity function. The location of the source is identified as the location with the highest intensity value in step .","This process is further described as follows. Data was acquired as in step  at a sample rate of 96 kHz. After replica correlation, the instantaneous power is shown . The base level signal is indicated at . Higher level signals are given at . These periodic signals of interest  could be whale calls and the current example was captured from calls from Blainville's beaked whale. The overall signal is processed in step  by developing a matched filter derived from calls from Blainville's beaked whale using distributed bottom-mounted hydrophones. A replica waveform was obtained by starting with a single, high signal to noise ratio (SNR) whale click, then determining the peak time of the correlator output response for a training set of several hundred clicks. Each click was time-delayed to align to a data window so that the clicks from all training samples were time-aligned. These were then averaged to obtain the new reference click. After three repetitions, it was found that the replica didn't change significantly.","Utilizing the prior art technique of correlation with the replica was conducted utilizing the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["y","t"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["r","i"]},{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":["t","i"],"mo":"+"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{}],"sub":["t ","i ","t "]},"After replica correlation, the Fourier transform of step  was calculated.

This produced a 0.0625 millisecond (msec) time resolution. Each Fourier transform bin was normalized separately by a time domain median-based background power estimator. To obtain total power, a frequency-weighted power summing across frequency was performed, selecting only the frequency bands in which the beaked whale energy lies (14-40 kHz). These frequency bands were selected for experimental data in the initialization step, step . This produced a power time series with 0.0625 msec resolution that was searched for local maxima above a threshold to identify candidate clicks.

Traditionally, TDOA is determined by producing an amplitude-versus-time description (amplitude time series) of each hydrophone, then correlating the amplitude time-series from two nearby hydrophones. If the clicks from a given whale are present in each amplitude series, then there will be a correlation peak at the corresponding time-delay. It is useful to correlate in such a way that the value of the correlator peak is an indication of the number of clicks that associate or correlate and not a function of click amplitude. To do this, amplitude information is eliminated by forming a synthetic time-series of impulses at the times of the detected clicks. This is called a \u201cclick-map\u201d. This method further processes the click map by implementing time-domain smoothing in order to allow time uncertainty to be incorporated into the correlation process.

Date form the smoothed ACF has a ripple at the 0.33 second inter-click interval rate and the power spectrum has a peak near 3 Hz. A change in the ICI can cause the power spectrum to have multiple peaks. Thus, experimentally derived characteristics of a valid SCM are that the smoothed auto-correlation function (ACF) r(\u03c4), normalized for r(0)=1, exhibits ripple at time lag equivalent to the ICI, denoted by T. The peaks in the ACF slowly drop in amplitude as \u03c4 increases. Also, the power spectrum (i.e. the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function) exhibits a large peak at the frequency 1\/T.","These characteristics can be established by calculating the moments of the ACF and saving the value of the power spectrum at 1\/T.

A three dimensional volume can be obtained by repeating the procedure at a set of depths. In order to maximize this process, a three dimensional peak peaking algorithm can be used; however, this results in many local maxima. These can be used as candidate position solutions that can be associated utilizing the TDOA association measure, \u03b1. One way of performing this association is by utilizing the technique taught in Baggenstoss, P.
