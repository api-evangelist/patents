{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to a system and method for annotating a document, and, more specifically, to a system and method for electronically annotating an electronic document.","Over the years, various techniques have been developed to assist persons in providing annotative comments to documents. For example, in instances where portions of text of a paper document are to be annotated, an annotator may simply provide hand written annotations in the margins of the paper document, near the portions of the document to which the annotations apply. However, such hand written annotations on the paper document are not easily removable from the document and, may in fact be difficult to decipher, depending upon the neatness and penmanship of the annotator.","Text portions of a paper document may also be annotated by writing an annotative comment on an adhesive backed paper (e.g., Post-It\u2122 pads, available from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company). An advantage of using such adhesive backed paper for providing annotative comments thereon is that a piece of such adhesive backed paper may be affixed to the paper at virtually any location on the face of the document (e.g., in the margin of the document or proximate the portion of the document to which the annotative comment applies). However, as hand written comments on the paper are difficult to revise or erase, and as the adhesive on such paper is relatively weak (e.g., mild), such adhesive backed papers are not readily reusable.","Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a system and method for annotating documents.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an easy-to-use, flexible system and method for annotating documents.","The present invention achieves one or more of the above objectives by providing a system and method for annotating electronic documents. In one aspect, the system of the present invention allows a first person to annotate at least a first portion of a first electronic document displayable to the first person via a display screen. The system generally includes a receiver for collecting a plurality of inputs from the first person, wherein a first of the plurality of inputs concerns generating at least one of a first annotation and a first annotation box displayable to at least the first person via the display screen and a second of the plurality of inputs concerns linking the one of the first annotation and first annotation box to the first portion of the first electronic document, a first processing means for processing the first of the plurality of inputs to generate the one of the first annotation and first annotation box displayable to at least the first person, and a second processing means for processing the second of the plurality of inputs to establish a first reference link between the one of the first annotation and first annotation box and the first portion of the document to which the one of the first annotation and first annotation box refers. Such first and\/or second processing means may be implemented in a computer memory encoded with executable instructions representing a computer program that can cause a computer (e.g., the system) to generate the one of the first annotation and first annotation box displayable to at least the first person, and to establish a first reference link between the one of the first annotation and first annotation box and the first portion of the document to which the one of the first annotation and first annotation box refers.","In one embodiment, where the first of the plurality of inputs corresponds to generating the first annotation box, the system further includes a third processing means for processing a third plurality of inputs corresponding to generating the text of the first annotation, the text being displayable within the first annotation box. The functions of the third processing means may also be implemented in a computer memory encoded with executable instructions representing a computer program that can cause a computer (e.g., the system) to generate the text of the first annotation.","In another embodiment of the system of the present invention, the system accommodates annotators and\/or viewers who wish to move an annotation box to review information of the electronic document covered or concealed by the annotation box. In this regard, the system is capable of processing inputs from a first person (e.g., annotator, viewer of annotated document) which concern moving the annotation box and\/or annotation from a first location, relative to the first portion of the document to which the annotation refers, to a second location, relative to the first portion of the electronic document. To accommodate such inputs, the system of the present invention includes a means for processing such inputs to move the image of the annotation box, as displayed on the computer screen, accordingly. Such a processing means may be implemented in a computer memory encoded with appropriate executable instructions representing a computer program that can cause a computer (e.g., the system) to move the image of the annotation box from one location to another.","In another embodiment, the system includes a processing means for reconfiguring the reference link in instances where the first annotation box is moved from the first location to the second location. As such, a first annotation box and first annotation associated therewith may be moved to different locations, relative to the first portion of the electronic document, while preserving the link between the first annotation box and the first portion of the electronic document related thereto. In this regard, the system is especially useful in instances where the annotator or viewer of the document wishes to review a portion of the electronic document concealed or overlayed by an annotation box. In particular, where the reference link includes a first end associated with the annotation box and\/or annotation and a second end associated with the first portion of the electronic document, the processing means is capable of reconfiguring the reference link such that the first end of the reference link moves with the first annotation box and the second end of the reference link remains associated with the first portion of the electronic document. Such a processing means for reconfiguring the reference link may be implemented in a computer memory encoded with appropriate executable instructions representing a computer program that can cause a computer (e.g., the system) to reconfigure the reference link, as described hereinabove.","The system of the present invention also includes at least one means for processing inputs directed to reconfiguring at least the first annotation box. In one embodiment, the system includes a processing means for reconfiguring the first annotation box into at least one of a collapsed condition, where the first annotation associated therewith is concealed, and an enlarged condition, where at least part of the first annotation is displayable to the annotator and\/or viewer via the display screen. In another embodiment, the system includes a processing means for sizing at least the first annotation box. Such processing means for collapsing and enlarging the first annotation box and for sizing the first annotation box may be implemented in a computer memory encoded with executable instructions representing a computer program that can cause a computer (e.g., the system) to reconfigure and\/or size annotation boxes.","In another aspect of the present invention, a method for annotating electronic documents is disclosed. Generally, the method for annotating at least a first electronic document displayable on a computer screen to a first person (e.g., first annotator) includes the steps of receiving at least a first input from the first person, generating, in response to the first input, at least one of a first annotation box and a first annotation displayable to the first person via the computer screen, the first annotation being displayable within the first annotation box and referring to a first portion of the electronic document, and linking at least one of the first annotation box and first annotation with the first portion of the electronic document to which the first annotation relates, via a displayable first reference link. As such, the method of the present invention provides an efficient and easy to use process for both annotating electronic documents and for reviewing annotated electronic documents.","In one embodiment, linking the first annotation box and first annotation displayable therein with the first portion of the electronic document includes the steps of receiving inputs from the first person (e.g., annotator) concerning establishing a reference link and generating a displayable reference link from such inputs. In particular, the step of generating the displayable reference link includes processing at least a first link input to establish a first end of displayable reference link, the first end being associated with the first annotation box, processing at least a second link input to generate a line extending from the first end of the reference link and processing at least a third link input to establish a second end of the displayable reference link, the second end being associated with the first portion of the electronic document to which the first annotation displayable with the first annotation box refers.","In another embodiment, the method further includes the steps of displaying at least the first annotation box, first portion of the document to which the first annotation displayable within the first annotation box refers, and the first reference link extending therebetween. In a preferred embodiment, the first annotation box is displayed adjacent the first portion of the electronic document, such that the first annotation box and first annotation displayable therein do not overlay or conceal the first portion of the electronic document. In this regard, an annotator and\/or viewer of the electronic document can easily and conveniently view the first annotation and the first portion of the document to which the first annotation applies for purposes of possibly editing the document or verifying the information contained within the first portion of the electronic document.","In some instances however, an annotator or viewer of the electronic document may wish to review the information in a second portion of the electronic document which is concealed or partially concealed by the first annotation box and first annotation displayable therein. In this regard, the method of the present invention may further include the step of collapsing the first annotation box to a collapsed condition of reduced area, whereby the first annotation associated therewith is concealed and\/or moving the first annotation box and first annotation displayable therein from a first location, proximate the second portion of the document, to a second location, away from the second portion of the document, such that the first annotation box and first annotation displayable therein does not overlay or conceal the second portion of the document. In one embodiment, in conjunction with the step of moving the first annotation box from a first location to a second location is the step of reconfiguring the first reference link between the first annotation box and the first portion of the electronic document. In particular, for purposes of preserving the link between the first annotation box and the first portion of the electronic document when the first annotation box is moved, the step of reconfiguring the first reference link includes the steps of determining, from at least one input from the first person, the second position of the first end of the first referencer, relative to at least one of the first position of the first end and the first portion of the first electronic document and positioning the first end of the first referencer at the second position, proximate the second location, along with at least one of the first annotation box and the first annotation.","In yet another embodiment, for purposes of facilitating review of the electronic document by an annotator or viewer thereof, the method of the present invention provides for concealing at least the first reference link which extends between the first annotation box and the first portion of the electronic document, such that the first reference link does not cover or overlay any portion of the electronic document. Concealing at least the first reference link may include the steps of receiving at least one input from an annotator or viewer and processing such input to generate an internal first reference link, which is revealable (e.g., displayable) upon receipt of another input form an annotator or viewer. Such a first reference link and\/or internal first reference link may also be stored to provide a record of the reference link.","FIGS.  to A-B illustrate embodiments of the system and method for annotating an electronic document, according to various features of the present invention. Generally, the system and method of the present invention facilitate the annotation of electronic documents and the review of electronic documents annotated according to the principles of the present invention. In accordance with the features of the present invention, the electronic document and annotations associated therewith are viewable by an annotator or viewer via a computer display screen (e.g., video display terminal). As such, the system and method of the present invention allow an annotator of an electronic document to provide displayable electronic annotations concerning specific, displayable portions of the text of the electronic document. Of primary importance, for purposes of assisting the annotator and\/or reviewer of the displayable electronic document and annotations associated therewith, the system and method of the present invention allow the annotator of the electronic document to provide a displayable link (e.g., line, arrow) between each annotation and the portion of the electronic document to which each annotation relates. As such, the system and method of the present invention provide a means by which the annotator and\/or reviewer of an electronic document and associated electronic annotations can quickly and readily examine, the portions of the electronic document to which each of the annotations refer. In this regard, the system and method of the present invention are particularly suited to the publishing and\/or layout industries, where large electronic layout documents, such as telephone directories (e.g., yellow pages) are displayable on computer display screens and are subject to annotation.","The system for annotating an electronic document, illustrated in , generally includes at least a first receiver  for receiving a plurality of inputs from a first person  (e.g., annotator) and at least a first means for processing such inputs from the first person  in accordance with selected computer software programs, the pseudo-code of which is included hereinbelow, where appropriate. As such, the system may be implemented in various known computer systems (e.g., desktop or personal computers, Personal Digital Assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d)).","More specifically, and as illustrated in , the system  for annotating may be used in conjunction with and\/or implemented in a commercially available computer system having a display processor  for coordinating the display of appropriate items (e.g., document, annotation boxes, annotations), a display terminal  for displaying the electronic document to a first person  and one or more input devices, whereby a user, such as the first person , can direct the system  to perform certain tasks. In this regard, the system  includes a receiver  (e.g., server) for collecting inputs from the user or first person  and at least one processor for performing a number of tasks, in accordance with the inputs received and in accord with computer software programs of the present invention. The receiver  is capable of collecting inputs from various computer input devices, such as a computer mouse, a keyboard, touch-screen systems and\/or voice systems, all of which are commercially available from various vendors.","The method for annotating at least a first portion of an electronic document displayable to a first person via a display screen or terminal, illustrated in , generally includes the steps of receiving  at least a first input from the first person, generating , in response to the first input, at least one of a first annotation and a first annotation box displayable to the first person via the display screen, the first annotation being displayable within the first annotation box and concerning the first portion of the electronic document, and linking  at least one of the first annotation box and first annotation displayable therein with the first portion of the electronic document via a first reference link. As such, the method of the present invention facilitates annotation and review of an electronic document, especially in instances where a computer screen displaying a plurality of portions of the electronic documents have a plurality of annotations associated therewith.","As noted hereinabove, the method of the present invention, illustrated in  and A-B, includes the steps of receiving  at least a first input from the first person, the input corresponding to forming a displayable annotation box, and generating  and displaying  such an annotation box via at least the display terminal . In this regard, the system  of the present invention, illustrated in , includes a receiver , which is capable of collecting inputs or commands from the first person  concerning at least the creation or generation of at least a first displayable annotation. For example, in accordance with the method and system  of the present invention, the first person  viewing at least a first portion of an electronic document may select from an annotation tool palette (not shown) displayable to the first person , via the display terminal , a menu item for creating a displayable image of an annotation box or area, which \u201coverlays\u201d or \u201cfloats over\u201d a second portion of the electronic document being annotated. As such, the system  includes a first processing means  which is capable of receiving inputs from the first person  via the receiver  and processing such inputs to generate a displayable annotation box , illustrated in , which overlays a second portion  of the electronic document .","Such a first processing means  is generally capable of processing inputs to generate such an annotation box  by various techniques implemented in a computer program encoded in a computer memory. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, such a computer program may generally involve detecting whether a computer mouse down (e.g., actuated) is in the document, determining whether an annotation tool is selected, creating an annotation data structure, initializing such, and storing the initial bounds of the annotation. Further, for purposes of allowing the annotator to size the annotation box, the computer program may also involve initializing the previous mouse location, and, while the mouse is still down, getting the current mouse location and, where the current mouse location is different than the previous mouse location, sizing the annotation box by calculating the amount of horizontal and vertical deltas, getting the current bounds from the annotation data structure, adding the horizontal and vertical deltas to the current bounds, setting the current bounds in the annotation data structure, and drawing the new annotation box. Drawing the new annotation box may involve drawing the body of the annotation box, a drag bar, a link box, a zoom box and a sizer box, the functions of which will be described in more detail hereinbelow.","For purposes of providing an appropriately sized annotation box, the method of the present invention, illustrated in , may also include the step of resizing  or reconfiguring the size of the annotation box , which is illustrated in . As such, in one embodiment, illustrated in , an annotation box size processing means , associated with the first processing means , is capable of processing an input from the first person  directed to reconfiguring the size of the annotation box . As described hereinabove, in order to create such an annotation box , illustrated in , an input device, such as a computer mouse and associated displayable cursor , may be used by the first person  to select an annotation option in the tool palette (e.g., via \u201cclicking\u201d or actuating a button of the computer mouse) to generate, via the first processor , an image on display terminal  of an annotation box. Substantially as shown in , the first person  may then move cursor  via the computer mouse and \u201cclick\u201d on a first region  (e.g., sizer box) of the annotation box  to command the annotation box size processing means  and the first processing means , upon receipt and processing of such inputs, to reconfigure or size the annotation box . For example, in order to enlarge the size of the annotation box , in one embodiment, illustrated in , the inputs received from first person  include dragging the cursor  away from the first region  via the computer mouse. As such, the size of the annotation box  is varied by the annotation box size processing means  and the first processing means  in accordance with the distance the cursor  is moved relative to the first region  of the annotation box .","Such processing means ,  for generating and sizing an annotation box  are generally implemented within the computer memory  of a computer system, the computer memory  being encoded with a computer program which generally involves detecting whether a mouse down (e.g., actuated) is in the annotation sizer box (e.g., first region ), initializing the previous mouse location, and, while the mouse is still down, getting the current mouse location, and, if the current mouse location is different than the previous mouse location, calculating the amount of horizontal and vertical deltas, getting the current bounds from the annotation data structure, adding the horizontal and vertical deltas to the current bounds, setting current bounds in the annotation data structure and drawing the existing annotation box. Drawing the existing annotation box may include drawing the body of the annotation box, the drag bar, the link box, the zoom box and the sizer box.","According to the present invention, the first annotation box  and first annotation  displayable therein are positionable proximate the first portion  of the electronic document , such that the first annotation  and\/or first annotation box  does not overlay or block out the first portion  of the electronic document  to which the first annotation  refers. As such, the first annotation box  and first annotation  displayable therein are positionable over the second portion  of the first electronic document , wherein the first and second portions ,  of the electronic document  are displaced from each other, at different locations. In this regard, the method of the present invention, illustrated in , may also include the steps of receiving an input from the first person  concerning moving at least the first annotation box  from a first location  to a second location , and positioning based on the input, the first annotation box  and first annotation  contained therein at the second location , such that the first annotation box  and first annotation  contained therein are displayable to the first person  and\/or a viewer thereof proximate the first portion  of the electronic document . In order to position or move the first annotation box  and associated first annotation , a position processing means , illustrated in , cooperates with the first processing means  to process inputs from the first person  to determine the location to which the first person  desires to move the first annotation box .","Further, the first and position processing means ,  are capable of moving the image of the annotation box , and associated annotation  contained therein, from the first location  in the displayable electronic document , to the second location  in the displayable electronic document . In one embodiment, the first person  may input an appropriate instruction via the receiver  by utilizing a computer mouse and associated displayable cursor . More specifically, and as illustrated in , the first person  may manipulate the position of the cursor  via the computer mouse to a second region  (e.g., drag bar) of the annotation box  and \u201cclick\u201d on the second region  via the computer mouse to direct the first and position processing means ,  to move or drag with the cursor , as manipulated by the first person  via the computer mouse, and the annotation box  from the first location  to the second location  in the electronic document . Such dragging of an annotation box from one location to another location may be implemented in a computer program encoded in a computer memory . Such a computer program generally involves detecting a mouse down (e.g., actuated) in the annotation drag bar (e.g., second region ), initializing the previous mouse location, and, while the mouse is still down, getting the current mouse location, calculating the amount of horizontal and vertical deltas, getting the current bounds from the annotation data structure, offsetting the current bounds by the horizontal and vertical deltas, setting the current bounds in the annotation drag structure and drawing the annotation box after dragging. Such drawing may also include drawing the body of the annotation box, the drag bar, link box, zoom box, annotation text and sizer box.","In another embodiment, for purposes of facilitating the annotation of an electronic document  by a first person  or the review of an annotated electronic document by a viewer, the method of the present invention includes the step of collapsing  the annotation box, as illustrated in . In one embodiment, illustrated in , an annotation box zoom processing means  is capable of collapsing the first annotation box  from an enlarged state to a collapsed first annotation box such that none of the first annotation  associated therewith is displayed, and is capable of enlarging  the first collapsed annotation box from a collapsed state to an enlarged state, such that at least part of the first annotation  is displayed. As such, the annotation box zoom processing means  may generate a displayable image of a collapsed annotation box having the letter \u201cA\u201d contained therein to denote to the first person  and\/or the viewer of the annotated electronic document that the box is an enlargeable annotation box which possibly contains a displayable annotation  therein, substantially as illustrated in . In order to collapse such an annotation box, the annotation box zoom processing means  is capable of receiving and processing inputs from the first person  and\/or the viewer of the electronic document, via the receiver . In one embodiment, a computer mouse and associated displayable cursor  are used by the first person  to supply to the annotation box zoom processing means  such inputs concerning collapsing an annotation box. For example, after generation of a first annotation box  via the first processing means , and generation of an annotation  therein via a second processing means  (to be described in more detail hereinbelow), a first person  may move the cursor , via the computer mouse, to a third region  (e.g., zoom box) of the annotation box  and \u201cclick\u201d on the third region  to collapse the annotation box  into a collapsed annotation box , such that the area of the annotation box is reduced and at least a portion of the annotation  is concealed, as illustrated in .","The annotation box zoom processing means  may be implemented in a computer program encoded in a computer memory  within the system . Such a computer program for collapsing and\/or enlarging an annotation box involves detecting a mouse down (e.g., actuated) is in the annotation zoom box (e.g., third region ) and, if the annotation box is collapsed, inflating the annotation box by getting the original bounds from the annotation data structure (i.e., alternate bounds), getting the collapsed bounds from the annotation data structure (i.e., current bounds), determining a horizontal delta from the collapsed and original left bounds, determining a vertical delta from the collapsed and original top bounds, offsetting the original bounds by the horizontal and vertical deltas (e.g., in instances where the collapsed annotation box was moved), setting the original bounds in the annotation data structure, setting a variable (e.g., collapsed flag) to false in the annotation data structure and drawing enlarged annotation box. Such drawing of the enlarged annotation box may include drawing the body of the annotation box, the drag bar, the link box, the zoom box, the annotation text and the sizer box. In instances where the annotation box is to be collapsed from an enlarged state, the computer program may involve getting the original bounds from the annotation data structure (i.e., current bounds), setting the original bounds in the annotation data structure (i.e., alternate bounds), setting a variable (e.g., collapsed flag) to true in the annotation data structure, setting collapsed bounds in the annotation data structure (e.g., collapsed bounds is a constant width and height whose top left point equals the top left point of the original bounds), and drawing the collapsed annotation box. Such drawing of the collapsed annotation box may be accomplished by drawing the body of the collapsed annotation box, the drag bar, the zoom bar and the letter \u201cA\u201d.","For purposes of providing a displayable annotation within the borders of an annotation box, the method of the present invention includes the steps of receiving  at least a second input corresponding to text of such a first annotation concerning the first portion of the electronic document, and generating  a displayable first annotation from the second input, wherein the first annotation is displayable within the first annotation box. For purposes of facilitating annotation and\/or review of the electronic document, the method may also include the step of displaying  at least the first annotation  within the first annotation box , as illustrated in  and A-B. In order to create such annotations, the system  of the present invention also includes, in one embodiment of the invention illustrated in , a second processing means  for receiving a plurality of inputs from the first person  corresponding to a first annotation . More specifically, the second processing means  is capable of collecting, via the receiver , and processing a plurality of inputs from the first person  to generate a displayable image of the text of the first annotation , the first annotation  being relevant to a first portion  of the electronic document . In one embodiment of the present invention, after providing an appropriate input(s) to generate an image of a first annotation box , substantially as described hereinabove, the first person  may utilize a computer mouse and associated displayable cursor  to begin generating a first annotation  within the borders of a corresponding first annotation box . In particular, and substantially as illustrated in , the first person  may manipulate the cursor , via the computer mouse, to a fourth region  (e.g., text editing area) of the annotation box  to input or enter the first annotation  therein via another input device (e.g., keyboard, voice recognition system). The second processing means  collects and processes such inputs from the first person  to generate an image of the text of the annotation  within the fourth region  of the annotation box .","In one embodiment, the second processing means  is a computer program encoded in a computer memory . Such a computer program may generally involve detecting a key press (e.g., from a keyboard), getting the key press and, if the annotation is visible and not collapsed, and is selected, getting a link to the annotation text record from the annotation data structure, setting the key press in text record and drawing the text of the annotation, in accord with the keypress(es). If this is the first time entering text, the computer program may also involve setting up text style and size. Further, the computer program may perform the appropriate key function for special keys (e.g., delete, home, end, left arrow).","In order to facilitate the annotation of such electronic documents, and in particular, the review of such annotations by a reviewer (e.g., for purposes of editing the electronic document in accordance with the annotations), the method and system of the present invention contemplate relating or linking such annotations with the specific portions of the electronic document to which such annotations refer. In this regard, the method of the present invention includes the step of linking , via a first displayable link or referencer , illustrated in , A-B and A-B, at least a first annotation box  and\/or first annotation  contained therein to a first portion  of the electronic document . Such linking may be accomplished by utilizing a third processing means , illustrated in , which is capable of receiving  and processing, in accordance with a computer software program of the present invention, at least one input from a first person , via the receiver , to generate or form such a displayable electronic link or referencer  which extends between the first annotation box  and the first portion  of an electronic document  to which the first annotation  relates. As such, the method illustrated in  and  further include the step of displaying  the first reference link.","In order to generate such a link, a first person  may provide at least one input to establish such a displayable link  by utilizing an appropriate input device, such as a computer mouse and associated displayable cursor , is processed by the third processing means  via the receiver . In one embodiment, where a first person  wishes to create a displayable link  between a first portion  of the electronic document , located at a first position, and the first annotation box , located at a second position, the first person  may manipulate the computer mouse to move the displayable cursor  to a fifth region  (e.g., link box of the first annotation box ), and \u201cclick\u201d on the fifth region  of the annotation box , illustrated in . Such actuation of the mouse when the cursor  overlays the fifth region  is received and processed by the system  to generate, via the third processing means , at least a first end (e.g., tail) of the displayable link . Subsequently, a second link input may be received and processed by the third processing means  to create or establish a line forming the interior of the reference link . Such a second link input may correspond to the first person  causing, via the mouse, the cursor to drag or move away from the fifth region  of the first annotation box  and toward the first portion  of the electronic document , as shown in . Finally, a third link input may be received and processed by the third processing means  to establish or generate a second end (e.g., in the form of an arrow head, or end of a line) of the reference link , the second end being associated with the first portion  of the electronic document . Such a third link input may be manifested by the first person  letting up on (e.g., deactuating) the mouse. The third processing means  is thus capable of receiving or collecting, via the receiver , and processing such inputs, in accordance with a computer software program of the present invention, to generate a reference link, the length of which is determined in accordance with the inputs received from the first person . As such, the third processor , upon receipt of the inputs from the first person  corresponding to the first referencer, determines the positions of the ends of the first referencer, relative to the portion of the first electronic document being displayed via the display terminal , in order to generate  and display  an image of the first referencer. In this regard, the system and method of the present invention provide for the generation of a referencer link that extends between the first annotation box and the first portion of the electronic document to which the first annotation relates.","For purposes of generating or creating such a reference link, third processing means  includes a computer program encoded in a computer memory. Such a computer program involves drawing an outline of an arrow by detecting a mouse down in the annotation link box (e.g., fifth region ), initializing points of the arrow having an anchor point equal to the mouse down location, initializing a previous mouse location, getting the current mouse location, and, while the mouse is still down, getting the current mouse location, detecting whether the mouse has changed location, setting the final mouse location in the annotation data structure, setting a visibility flag (e.g., a variable) in the annotation data structure to true, creating the actual reference link and drawing the reference link (e.g., arrow). Creating the actual reference link in the shape of an arrow, for example, generally involves storing the arrow by using the final arrow location from the annotation data structure and a point within the link box (e.g., fifth region ) to create a structure or region in the shape of an arrow and storing the structure in the annotation data structure. Drawing the arrow (i.e., reference link) may involve drawing the body of the annotation box, the drag bar, the link box, the zoom box, the annotation text and, if the annotation arrow region or structure exists and is visible, drawing the arrow region, and drawing the sizer box.","In another embodiment, for purposes of providing a record of reference links that are selectively retrievable by the first person  or viewer of an annotated electronic document, the method of the present invention includes the step of storing , ,  the reference links between annotations and respective portions of the electronic document within a database or memory, as well as the annotation boxes and annotations associated therewith. As such, an internal reference link between each annotation and respective portion of the electronic document may be established. Storing the reference links may be conducted by the computer program described herein for creating the structure or region in the shape of the arrow and setting the region in the annotation data structure.","For purposes of facilitating review of an electronic document having a plurality of annotations, the method of the present invention may also include the step of concealing  at least the first reference link between the first annotation box and the first portion of the electronic document to which the first annotation associated with the first annotation box refers. Concealing the first reference link may include the steps of receiving another input, concealing from display the first reference link and providing an internal record of the first reference link. For example, as illustrated in , a person using a computer mouse device may manipulate the mouse to move a displayable cursor  associated therewith to the fifth region  (e.g., link box) of the annotation box , proximate an end of the reference link , and \u201cclick\u201d the mouse to command the system  to conceal or to delete the reference link  to form a new reference link, substantially as described hereinabove. A person may also again \u201cclick\u201d the mouse when the cursor  is on the fifth region  to reveal a concealed reference link. As such, a viewer of the electronic document can recall the first reference link such that the first reference link is displayable or revealable to a viewer.","In one embodiment, the third processing means  is capable of concealing  and revealing  the reference link  between at least the first annotation box  and the first portion  of the electronic document  to which the first annotation  associated with the first annotation box  relates, in accordance with a computer software program of the present invention. Such a computer program for concealing and\/or drawing such a reference link  is encoded in a computer memory, and generally involves detecting a mouse down in the annotation link box (e.g., fifth region ), calculating the bounds of the link box, and, if the current mouse location is within the bounds of the link box, toggling the visibility flag (e.g. a variable) in the annotation data structure. In this regard, toggling the flag by actuating and deactuating the mouse in the link box conceals and draws the reference link .","In order to accommodate instances where the first person  or a viewer of the annotated electronic document wishes to move the first annotation box , shown in , from a first location  to a second location , relative to the first portion  of the electronic document , while preserving the reference link  between the first annotation box  and the first portion  of the electronic document , the method of the present invention, illustrated in  and A-B, also includes the steps of receiving  another input and reconfiguring  the first reference link  to maintain the link between the first annotation box  and first portion  of the document . Such reconfiguring of the first reference link  is accomplished by a processing means  for reconfiguring the reference link, which includes a computer program encoded in a computer memory. Such a computer program is capable of maintaining a first reference link  between a first annotation box  and the first portion  of the electronic document  to which the first annotation  relates, even in instances where the first person  wishes to move the first annotation box , and associated first annotation , from a first location  to a second location .","In one embodiment, the computer program for maintaining at least the first reference link  between the first annotation box  and the first portion  of the electronic document  in instances where the first annotation box , and associated annotation  is moved from a first location  to a second location , generally involves detecting whether a mouse down (e.g., actuated mouse) is in the annotation drag bar (e.g., second region ), initializing the previous mouse location and, while the mouse is still down, getting the current mouse location, calculating the amount of horizontal and vertical deltas of the annotation box, getting the current bounds of the annotation box from the annotation data structure, offsetting the current bounds by the horizontal and vertical deltas, setting the current bounds in the annotation data structure, creating the actual reference link (e.g., an arrow) and drawing the annotation box with the reference link (e.g., arrow). Creating the actual arrow (i.e., reference link) generally involves storing the arrow by using the final arrow location from the annotation data structure and a point within the link box (e.g., fifth region ) to create a structure or region in the shape of an arrow and storing the structure in the annotation data structure. Drawing the arrow (i.e., reference link) may involve drawing the body of the annotation box, the drag bar, the link box, the zoom box, the annotation text and, if the annotation arrow region or structure exists and is visible, drawing the arrow region, and drawing the sizer box.","The foregoing discussion of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
