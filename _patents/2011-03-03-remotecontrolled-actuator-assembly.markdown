title: Remote-controlled actuator assembly
abstract: A remote-controlled actuator assembly includes a guide section () of an elongated shape, a distal end member () fitted to a tip end of the guide section for alteration in attitude, an operating tool () in the distal end member, and a restraining tool () for aligning the distal end member straight with the guide section. The distal end member is altered in attitude through advancing/retracting attitude altering members () in the guide section by attitude altering drive sources (), which are controlled by an attitude control unit (). An advance or retraction position detector () detects an advance/retraction position of the attitude altering members while the attitude altering members applying a preload to the distal end member restrained by the restraining tool. The attitude control unit uses the detection value as information on the advance/retraction position corresponding to an initial position-attitude of the distal end member.

Any of those remote controlled actuator assemblies controls by remote control an operating tool such as a machine tool or a holding tool that is fitted to a distal end of an elongated guide section of a linear or curved configuration. In the following description, conventional art and problems will be discussed with reference to remote controlled actuator assemblies in the medical field used for osteal treatment.","In orthopedics, the artificial joint replacement is well known, in which a joint, of which bone has been abraded by due to bone deterioration, is replaced with an artificial joint. The joint replacement surgery requires a living bone of a patient to be processed to enable an artificial joint to be implanted. In order to enhance the strength of postoperative adhesion between the living bone and the artificial joint, such processing is required to be performed precisely and accurately in conformity to the shape of the artificial joint.","By way of example, during the hip joint replacement surgery, a thigh bone is opened to secure access of an artificial joint into the femoral marrow cavity. In order to secure a strength of contact between the artificial joint and the bone, surfaces of contact of the artificial joint and the bore must be large and so the opening for insertion of the artificial joint is processed to represent an elongated shape extending deep into the bone. For such a processing, a remote controlled actuator assembly is used which is capable of rotating by remote control an operating tool fitted to a tip end of an elongated guide section. The surgical operation for artificial joint replacement generally accompanies skin incision and muscular scission. In other words, the human body must be invaded. In order to minimize the postoperative trace, it is quite often desirable that the elongated guide section referred to above is not necessarily straight, but is moderately curved.","To meet this desire, the following technique has hitherto been suggested. For example, the Patent Document 1 listed below discloses the guide section having its intermediate portion curved twice to displace an axial position of the distal end of the pipe relative to the longitudinal axis of the proximal end of the same pipe. To make the axial position of the distal end of the guide section displace relative to the longitudinal axis of the proximal end of the same guide section is also known from other publications. Also, the Patent Document 2 listed below discloses the guide section rotated by 180\u00b0.","[Patent Document 1] U.S. Pat. No. 4,466,429","[Patent Document 2] U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,231","Since such a conventional remote controlled actuator assembly is designed solely to control only the rotation of the machine tool by remote control, difficulties have been encountered in positioning the machine tool accurately in the distal deep site of the opening for insertion of the artificial joint or in processing a bone into a complex shape. One approach to overcoming such drawbacks was a configuration shown in  and  which includes a guide section  having a tip end to which a distal end member  is fitted for alteration in attitude, in which the distal end member  rotatably supports a machine tool  and in which the attitude of the distal end member  can be altered by remote control. More specifically, the guide section  has its interior a guide hole (not shown) having its opposite ends opening, within which an attitude altering member (not shown) is reciprocally movably inserted. The attitude of the distal end member  can be altered by applying an acting force via the attitude altering member to the distal end member  for alteration in attitude. A flexible attitude altering member such as a wire allows for such an acting force to be transmitted to the distal end member  for alteration in attitude, even when the guide section  and the guide hole in the interior of the guide section  are curved.","In such a remote controlled actuator assembly where an acting force is applied via an attitude altering member to the distal end member  for alteration in attitude, a preload applied in advance by the attitude altering member to the distal end member  keeps the attitude of the distal end member  stable. The preload is just enough to overcome possible external forces that the distal end member  may be subjected to. The alteration in attitude of the distal end member  is performed by advancing or retracting the attitude altering member according to the desired degree of alteration in attitude with respect to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member  and then applying the corresponding acting force to the distal end member.","In general, the initial position-attitude of the distal end member  is defined as the attitude of the distal end member  when the distal end member  is aligned straight with the guide section  as shown in FIG. B\u2014that is, when the center line CL of the guide section  coincides with the center line CL of the distal end member . However, it is not unusual that the center line CL of the guide section  does not completely coincide with the center line CL of the distal end member , since factors such as processing accuracy and assembly accuracy of components may lead, when the components are assembled, to different remote controlled actuator assemblies having slightly different straightness of the distal end member  with respect to the guide section . Therefore, for each remote controlled actuator assembly, a reference position of an attitude altering member corresponding to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member  must be determined and the alteration in attitude of the distal end member  must be controlled based on the determined reference position, in order to accurately alter the attitude of the distal end member  into a target attitude.","An object of the invention is to provide a remote controlled actuator assembly which is capable of accurately altering by remote control the attitude of a distal end member mounted to a tip end of an elongated guide section with the distal end member supporting an operating tool, and which can perform control of alteration in attitude of the distal end member based on the initial position-attitude of the distal end member while accommodating possibly different initial position-attitudes of distal end members among different remote controlled actuator assemblies.","Another object of the invention is to provide a restraining tool which is easy to use but can reliably restrain the distal end member to align the distal end member straight with the guide section.","A remote controlled actuator assembly of the present invention includes a guide section of an elongated shape, a distal end member fitted to a tip end of the guide section for alteration in attitude, an operating tool provided in the distal end member, an operating tool drive source for driving the operating tool, an attitude altering drive source for altering the attitude of the distal end member, and an attitude control unit for controlling the attitude altering drive source. The guide section has its interior accommodating a drive shaft for transmitting a drive force of the operating tool drive source to the operating tool and guide hole having its opposite ends opening. In such a case, attitude altering member is reciprocally movably inserted within the guide hole for undergoing a reciprocating or retracting motion so as to alter the attitude of the distal end member, the attitude altering member being selectively advanced or retracted by the attitude altering drive source. Advance or retraction position detector operable to detect an advance or retraction position of the attitude altering member is provided. The attitude control unit uses information on an advance or retraction position of the attitude altering member corresponding to an initial position-attitude of the distal end member and that information is a detection value obtained by the advance or retraction position detector while the distal end member is being restrained to align straight with the guide section, during which the attitude altering member keeps applying a preload to the distal end member.","According to the above described construction, the operating tool provided in the distal end member performs a certain operation. In such case, when the attitude altering member is selectively advanced and retracted one at a time by the attitude altering drive source, the attitude altering member works on the distal end member to allow the attitude of the distal end member, fitted to the tip end of the guide section for alteration in attitude, to alter. The attitude altering drive source is provided at a position distant from the distal end member and the alteration of the attitude of the distal end member is carried out by remote control. Since the attitude altering member is passed through the guide hole, the attitude altering member can work on the distal end member properly at all time without being displaced in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction thereof, and the operation to alter the attitude of the distal end member takes place accurately.","Factors such as processing accuracy and assembly accuracy of components may lead, when the components are assembled, to different remote controlled actuator assemblies having slightly different straightness of a distal end member with respect to a guide section. In other words, the initial position-attitude of the distal end member varies among different remote controlled actuator assemblies. To address this, the advance or retraction position detector detects an advance or retraction position of the attitude altering member, while the distal end member is restrained to align straight with the guide section and while the attitude altering member keeps applying a preload to the distal end member. Such a detection value obtained by the advance or retraction position detector is used as an advance or retraction position of the attitude altering member corresponding to an initial position-attitude of the distal end member, in order for the attitude control unit to perform control of the alteration in attitude of the distal end member. In this way, appropriate control of alteration in attitude of the distal end member can be performed while accommodating possibly different initial position-attitudes of distal end members among different remote controlled actuator assemblies.","In the present invention, a restraining tool may be provided which is removably fitted to an area extending from an outer periphery of a tip end portion of the guide section to an outer periphery of the distal end member, so as to restrain the distal end member such that the distal end member is aligned straight with the guide section.","For instance, the restraining tool may include an inner peripheral member configured to be placed on the area extending from an outer periphery of the tip end portion of the guide section to the outer periphery of the distal end member, and a tubular outer peripheral member configured to be placed on an outer periphery of the inner peripheral member. In such case, the inner peripheral member may include a plurality of split bodies circumferentially spaced apart from each other, and an outer peripheral surface of the inner peripheral member and an inner peripheral surface of the outer peripheral member may be in the form of tapers that match with each other and are formed with a male thread and a female thread, respectively, that threadingly engage with each other. A restraining tool according to this construction may be disposed so as to cover the area extending from an outer periphery of a tip end portion of the guide section to an outer periphery of the distal end member, and the outer peripheral member thereof may be rotated in such a direction that the male and female threads fasten with each other. This causes the outer peripheral member to axially move with respect to the inner peripheral member such that the outer peripheral member gets closer to the larger diameter side of the tapers. This results in the constriction of the diameter of the inner peripheral member, thereby causing the split bodies to be pressed against the tip end portion of the guide section as well as the distal end member. In this way, even when the center line of the distal end member is not aligned with the center line of the guide section, the distal end member can be restrained such that the center line of the distal end member and the center line of the guide section are aligned with each other, thereby keeping the distal end member straight with respect to the guide section.","In the present invention, preferably, the attitude altering drive source is driven by a predetermined magnitude of power to apply a predetermined preload via the attitude altering member to the distal end member while the restraining tool keeps restraining the distal end member, when the information on an advance or retraction position of the attitude altering member is obtained. A predetermined magnitude of power with which the attitude altering drive source is driven allows for performing, under fixed conditions, the detection of an advance or retraction position of the attitude altering member corresponding to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member, thereby resulting in highly accurate detection results.","In the present invention, preferably, a reference position memory is provided which is configured to store, as a reference position of the attitude altering member corresponding to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member, an advance or retraction position of the attitude altering member at which the attitude altering member stops due to a balance achieved between a force that acts on the distal end member from the attitude altering member and a reactive force from the distal end member. Also, preferably, an initial attitude controller is provided which is configured to perform control in such a way that the advance or retraction of the attitude altering member and the storage of the reference position of the attitude altering member in the reference position memory are carried out in successive actions. The provision of the reference position memory allows for storage of the reference position of the attitude altering member corresponding to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member. This allows for use of the reference position of the attitude altering member when altering the attitude of the distal end member, thereby enabling appropriate control of alteration in attitude of the distal end member based on the initial position-attitude thereof. Also, the provision of the initial attitude controller allows the operation of storing the reference position of the attitude altering member in the reference position memory to be automatically performed.","In the present invention, the distal end member may be fitted such that the attitude of the distal end member can be altered in an arbitrary direction with respect to the guide section, the guide hole as well as the attitude altering member inserted within the guide hole may be provided at three or more locations about a tilt axis of the distal end member, the attitude altering drive source may be provided separately with one for each of the attitude altering members, and the attitude of the distal end member can be altered and maintained in two axis-directions perpendicular to each other depending on the balance among the respective forces that the attitude altering members provided at three or more locations apply to the distal end member. A configuration in which the attitude of the distal end member can be altered and maintained in two axis-directions perpendicular to each other allows for the operating tool provided in the distal end member to be accurately positioned. Also, since the forces for altering and maintaining the attitude of the distal end member are provided by at least three attitude altering members, the attitude stability of the distal end member can be increased.","In such a configuration where the attitude of the distal end member can be altered by at least three attitude altering members in two axis-directions perpendicular to each other, preferably, for every combination of orders in which the attitude altering members provided at three or more locations can be advanced or retracted one by one, the attitude altering members are advanced or retracted one by one until an advance or retraction stop position is detected, the detected values for each of the attitude altering members are subject to a predetermined statistical processing procedure to obtain a statistically processed value for each of the attitude altering members, and the statistically processed value is used as a reference position of each of the attitude altering members corresponding to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member. The statistically processed value is, for example, an arithmetic average value of the detected values.","Such determination of the reference position of each of the attitude altering members minimizes possible deviation in the detected values among different orders in which the attitude altering members are operated, thereby providing more accurate value.","In the present invention according to any of the above constructions or configurations, the guide section may include a curve portion. In such a case, the attitude altering member may be flexible. This enables the attitude altering member to advance or retract in the guide hole, regardless of the presence of the curve portion in the guide section.","In the present invention, the restraining tool may be configured to restrain the distal end member such that the distal end member is aligned straight with the guide section, and may include: an inner peripheral member configured to be placed on an area extending from an outer periphery of a distal end portion of the guide section to an outer periphery of the distal end member; and a tubular outer peripheral member configured to be placed on an outer periphery of the inner peripheral member. In such case, the inner peripheral member may include a plurality of split bodies circumferentially spaced apart from each other, and an outer peripheral surface of the inner peripheral member and an inner peripheral surface of the outer peripheral member may be in the form of tapers that match with each other and are formed with a male thread and a female thread, respectively, that threadingly engage with each other. A restraining tool according to this construction may be disposed such that the split bodies of the inner peripheral member cover the area extending from an outer periphery of a tip end portion of the guide section to an outer periphery of the distal end member, and the outer peripheral member thereof may be rotated in such a direction that the male and female threads fasten with each other. This causes the outer peripheral member to axially move with respect to the inner peripheral member such that the outer peripheral member gets closer to the larger diameter side of the tapers. This results in the constriction of the diameter of the inner peripheral member, thereby causing the split bodies to be pressed against the tip end portion of the guide section as well as the distal end member. In this way, even when the center line of the distal end member is not aligned with the center line of the guide section, the distal end member can be restrained to align the center line of the distal end member with the center line of the guide section, thereby keeping, by simple procedures, the distal end member straight with respect to the guide section.","A remote controlled actuator assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in connection with  through . As shown in , the remote controlled actuator assembly includes an actuator body , a restraining tool  that is an accessory to the actuator body , and a controller  for controlling the actuator body . The actuator body  and the controller  are connected with each other via an electrical cable (not shown). Note that  shows an overall view of the remote controlled actuator assembly wherein the restraining tool  is not used, while  shows a fragmentary view of the remote controlled actuator assembly wherein the restraining tool  is used.","The actuator body  includes a distal end member  for holding an operating tool in the form of a rotary tool , a guide section  of an elongated, curved shape having a tip end to which the distal end member  is fitted for alteration in attitude, and a drive unit housing to which a base end of the guide section  is connected. The drive unit housing forms a drive unit  together with a built-in operating tool drive mechanism and a similarly built-in attitude altering drive mechanism . Although in the illustrated example the guide section  has an arcuate shape having a substantially constant curvature along its length, the guide section  may have a linear shape.","As shown in , the distal end member  includes a generally or substantially cylindrical housing  and a spindle  rotatably accommodated within such cylindrical housing  through a pair of bearings . The spindle  is of a tubular shape having a distal side opening and has a hollow defined therein, and a tool  is drivingly coupled with the spindle . Specifically, a shank portion of the tool  is inserted into the hollow of the spindle  and is then coupled with such spindle  by means of a stop pin  for rotation together with the spindle . The distal end member  of the structure described above is coupled with a distal end of the guide section  through a distal end member connecting unit . The distal end member connecting unit  supports the distal end member  for displacement in attitude and is comprised of a spherical bearing. More specifically, the distal end member connecting unit  includes a guided member in the form of an inner diameter reduced portion at a base end of the housing , and a guide member in the form of a collar integral with a constraint member  fixed to the tip of the guide section . The guided member and the guide member have respective guide faces F and F that are held in sliding contact with each other, and those guide faces F and F have respective centers of curvature lying at a point O on the center line or longitudinal axis CL of the distal end member , having their diameters being reduced towards the base end of the distal end member . Accordingly, not only can the distal end member  be immovably constrained relative to the guide section , but it can also be supported for displacement in attitude so that the attitude of the distal end member  can be altered in an arbitrary direction.","The guide section  includes a drive shaft  for transmitting a rotational force exerted by an operating tool drive source  (,  and ) accommodated within the drive unit housing . In the illustrated example, the drive shaft  is employed in the form of a wire capable of undergoing deformation to a certain extent. Material for the wire includes, for example, metal, resin or glass fiber. The wire may be either a single wire or a stranded wire. As best shown in , the spindle  and the drive shaft  are coupled together by means of a joint  such as a universal joint for transmitting rotation from the rotary shaft  to the spindle . The joint  is made up of a groove , defined in a closed base end of the spindle , and of a projection defined in a distal end of the drive shaft  and engageable in the groove . The center of joint between the groove and the projection is located at the same position as the centers of curvature O of the guide faces F and F. Note that the drive shaft  and the projection may be designed as members separate from each other.","The guide section  has an outer shell pipe , which forms an outer shell of the guide section , and the drive shaft  referred to above is positioned at a center of this outer shell pipe . The drive shaft  so positioned is rotatably supported by a plurality of rolling bearings  positioned spaced a distant apart from each other in a direction axially of the guide section . Between the neighboring rolling bearings , spring elements A for generating a preload on the inner rings of the corresponding rolling bearing  and spring elements B for generating the preload on the outer rings of the corresponding rolling bearings  are alternately disposed relative to each other. Those spring elements A and B may be employed in the form of, for example, compression springs. The constraint member  referred to previously is fixed to a pipe end portion of the outer shell pipe  by means of a fixing pin  and has its distal end inner peripheral portion supporting a distal end of the drive shaft  through a rolling bearing . It is, however, to be noted that the pipe end portion may be a member separate from the outer shell pipe  and may then be connected with the outer shell pipe  by means of, for example, welding.","As shown in , provided between an inner diametric surface of the outer shell pipe  and the drive shaft  are three guide pipes  each having its opposite ends opening and each having a curved shape similar to that of the outer shell pipe . The three guide pipes  are employed and arranged at respective circumferential locations spaced 120\u00b0 in phase from each other, and the attitude altering member (U, L, R) is reciprocally movably inserted in each of the guide holes , which are inner diametric holes of such guide pipes . Each of the attitude altering members  is in the form of a wire and pillar shaped pins connected to opposite ends of the wire . Material for the wire includes, similarly to that of the drive shaft , metal, resin or glass fiber. The wire may be either a single wire or a stranded wire. A shape memory alloy can be suitably employed therefor. One of the pillar shaped pins that is closer to the distal end member  has a tip end representing a spherical shape which is held in contact with a bottom surface of a radial groove portion formed in a base end surface of the housing . The groove portion and one of the attitude altering members  form a rotation preventing mechanism , in which the distal end of the attitude altering member  inserted in the groove portion comes in contact with the side surface of the groove portion , thereby preventing the distal end member  from rotating with respect to the guide section  about the center line CL of the distal end member .","Also, a plurality of reinforcement shafts  are arranged, separate from the guide pipes , between the inner diametric surface of the outer shell pipe  and the drive shaft  and on the same pitch circle C as that depicted by the guide pipes . Those reinforcement shafts  are employed for securing the rigidity of the guide section . The reinforcement shafts  have the same outer diameter as the guide pipes  and each of them has a curved shape similar to those of the guide pipes . The guide pipes  and the plural reinforcement shafts  are spaced an equal distance from each other. The guide pipes  and the plural reinforcement shafts  are held in contact with the inner diametric surface of the outer shell pipe  and an outer diametric surface of each of the rolling bearings  so as to support the respective outer diametric surfaces of the rolling bearings .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["4","4","41","41","4","4","4","4","41","4","41","41","4","42","41","22","22","22","22","22","22","22"],"i":["b ","a","aa","ab ","aa","a ","a ","ab ","a ","a ","b ","a","b ","c. "]},"As shown in , the attitude altering drive mechanism includes attitude altering drive sources (U, L, R) that correspond to respective attitude altering members (U, L, R) shown in . Each of the attitude altering drive sources  is attached to the interior wall . Each of the attitude altering drive sources  is in the form of, for example, an electrically-driven linear actuator. The movement of an output rod of each of the attitude altering drive sources  in directions that are left and right as viewed on  is transmitted via a force amplification and transmission mechanism  to the corresponding attitude altering member . The operational position of the output rod , that is, the advance or retraction position of the attitude altering member  is detected by an advance or retraction detector (U, L, R). The advance or retraction detector  is in the form of, for example, an optical rotation sensor that measures the amount of advance or retraction of the output rod from the amount of rotation of a to-be-detected portion disposed at a rotational member of the attitude altering drive source .","The force amplification and transmission mechanism  includes a pivot lever (U, L, R) pivotable about a support pin and is so designed and so configured as to allow a force of the output rod to work on a working point P(PU, PL, PR) of the corresponding lever , which is spaced a long distance from the support pin , and as to apply a force to a corresponding attitude altering member  at a force point P(PU, PL, PR), which is spaced a short distance from the support pin , wherefore the output of the corresponding attitude altering drive source  can be increased and then transmitted to the corresponding attitude altering member . The provision of the force amplification and transmission mechanism  enables a linear actuator having a small output to apply a large force to the attitude altering member , making it possible to reduce the size of the linear actuator. The drive shaft  referred to above is made to extend through an opening  defined in the pivot lever ","The restraining tool  is used to retrain the distal end member  such that the distal end member  is aligned straight with the guide section . As shown in  and , the restraining tool  includes an inner peripheral member  and an outer peripheral member . The inner peripheral member  is divided into a plurality of split bodies circumferentially spaced apart from each other. The inner diameter of the inner peripheral member  is chosen such that the inner peripheral member  fits to an outer periphery of the distal end member  and to an outer periphery of the guide section . When the inner peripheral member  is fitted in such a manner, a circumferential gap  will be created between the split bodies . An outer peripheral surface of each of the split bodies is in the form of a taper. The outer peripheral surface in the form of such a taper is formed with a male thread  extending over the split bodies . The outer peripheral member  is also in the form of a taper which matches with the outer peripheral surface of the inner peripheral member . The inner peripheral surface in the form of such a taper is formed with a female thread  that threadingly engages with the male thread .","With the threads ,  of the inner and outer peripheral members ,  being loosely engaged with each other, the restraining tool  is disposed so as to cover an area extending from an outer periphery of a tip end portion of the guide section  to an outer periphery of the distal end member , and the outer peripheral member  is rotated in such a direction that the threads ,  fasten with each other. This causes the outer peripheral member  to axially move with respect to the inner peripheral member  such that the outer peripheral member  gets closer to the larger diameter side of the tapered surfaces. This results in the constriction of the diameter of the inner peripheral member , thereby causing the split bodies to be pressed against the distal end portion of the guide section  and the distal end member . In this way, even when the center line CL of the distal end member  is not aligned with the center line CL of the guide section , the distal end member  can be restrained to align the center line CL of the distal end member  with the center line CL of the guide section , thereby keeping, by simple procedures, the distal end member  straight with respect to the guide section  such as shown in .","As shown in , the controller  is built-in with a computer  that performs a variety of controls. The computer  includes a rotation control unit  configured to control the operating tool drive source  and an attitude control unit  configured to control the attitude altering drive sources (U, L, R). The attitude control unit  includes an attitude altering controller and an initial attitude controller ","The rotation control unit  switches on\/off the operating tool drive source  by generating an output to a driver  in response to a rotation command signal from a rotation operating device . In this way, the spindle  is caused to rotate or to stop rotating. The rotation operating device  may be included in the controller  or disposed in or on the drive unit housing ","The attitude altering controller of the attitude control unit  drives the attitude altering drive sources  by generating an output to the drivers  in response to an attitude altering command signal from an attitude alteration operating device . The attitude alteration operating device  can perform an operation of altering the attitude of the distal end member  in two axis-directions perpendicular to each other\u2014namely, x-direction and y-direction of FIG. B\u2014and can also perform the setting of the degree of that alteration in attitude. The attitude alteration operating device  may be included in the controller  or disposed in or on the drive unit housing ","For example, to alter the attitude of the distal end member  such that the tip end of the distal end member  gets oriented downwardly in , the restraining tool  is removed and the attitude altering member U on the upper side as shown in  is advanced towards the distal, tip end side while the other two attitude altering members L, R are retracted, by generating an output to each of the attitude altering drive sources U, L, R. As a result, the housing  for the distal end member  is pressed by the upper attitude altering member U to allow the distal end member  to be altered in attitude along the guide surfaces F and F with the tip end side oriented downwardly. At this time, those attitude altering drive sources  are controlled so that the amount of advance or retraction of each of the attitude altering members  may become proper. On the other hand, when each of those attitude altering members  is retracted or advanced conversely to what has just been discussed, the housing  for the distal end member  is pressed by the attitude altering members L and R, which are shown on lower left and lower right sides, and, consequently, the distal end member  is altered in attitude along the guide surfaces F and F with the tip end side oriented upwardly.","Also, to alter the attitude of the distal end member  such that the tip end of the distal end member  gets oriented rightwards or towards a 180 degree inverted side (a rear side of the sheet of the drawing of ), the attitude altering member U on the upper side is held still, and the attitude altering member L on the left side is advanced towards the tip end side while the attitude altering member R on the right side is retracted, by generating an output to each of the attitude altering drive sources L, R. As a result, the housing  for the distal end member  is pressed by the attitude altering member L on the left side to allow the distal end member  to be altered in attitude along the guide surfaces F and F with the distal end member  oriented rightwards. On the other hand, when the attitude altering members L and R on the left and right sides are advanced and retracted conversely to what has just been discussed, the housing  for the distal end member  is pressed by the attitude altering member R on the right side, allowing the distal end member  to be altered in attitude so that the distal end member  can be guided along the guide surfaces F and F so as to be oriented leftwards.","The initial attitude controller of the attitude control unit , upon the completion of assembly of a remote controlled actuator assembly or upon the replacement of the distal end member , carries out an initial attitude control which includes detecting and storing a reference position that is an advance or retraction position of each of the attitude altering members  corresponding to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member . An initial position-attitude of the distal end member  is defined as the attitude of the distal end member  when the distal end member  is aligned straight with the guide section \u2014that is, when the center line CL of the guide section  coincides with the center line CL of the distal end member . A remote controlled actuator assembly should be designed such that the center line CL of the distal end member  coincides with the center line CL of the guide section  when all of the attitude altering drive sources  are in respective neutral positions with the tip end of each of the attitude altering members  being in contact with the housing  for the distal end member . However, it is not unusual that the center line CL of the guide section  does not completely coincide with the center line CL of the distal end member  as shown in , since factors such as processing accuracy and assembly accuracy of components may lead, when the components are assembled, to different remote controlled actuator assemblies having slightly different straightness of the distal end member  with respect to the guide section . Therefore, for each remote controlled actuator assembly, a reference position of each of attitude altering members  corresponding to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member  is determined to decide the output of each of the attitude altering drive sources  based on the determined reference position, so that the attitude of the distal end member  can be accurately altered into a target attitude.","The initial attitude controller is connected with an initial attitude controller operating device  and a reference position memory . The initial attitude controller operating device  is an operating device that causes an initial attitude control, which will be described in detail later, to be carried out. The reference position memory  is a rewritable memory.","To carry out an initial attitude control, firstly, the distal end member  is restrained by means of the restraining tool  such the distal end member  is aligned straight with respect to the guide section , as shown in . If the distal end member  is fixedly positioned at an angle with respect to the guide section  due to a preload between the distal end member  and the attitude altering members , the attitude altering members  are retracted to allow the distal end member  to be freely altered in attitude, before restraining the distal end member  by means of the restraining tool .","The initial attitude controller will be described in detail in connection with the flow charts shown in  and , using as an example a case in which the reference position of each of the attitude altering members U, L, R is obtained by advancing or retracting the attitude altering members U, L, R according to the combination of orders as illustrated in Table 1. The initial attitude controller starts by operating the initial attitude controller operating device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Combination","First","Second","Third"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A","Attitude altering","Attitude altering","Attitude altering"]},{"entry":[{},"member","member","member"]},{"entry":[{},"on the upper side","on the left side","on the right side"]},{"entry":["B","Attitude altering","Attitude altering","Attitude altering"]},{"entry":[{},"member","member","member"]},{"entry":[{},"on the upper side","on the right side","on the left side"]},{"entry":["C","Attitude altering","Attitude altering","Attitude altering"]},{"entry":[{},"member","member","member"]},{"entry":[{},"on the left side","on the upper side","on the right side"]},{"entry":["D","Attitude altering","Attitude altering","Attitude altering"]},{"entry":[{},"member","member","member"]},{"entry":[{},"on the left side","on the right side","on the upper side"]},{"entry":["E","Attitude altering","Attitude altering","Attitude altering"]},{"entry":[{},"member","member","member"]},{"entry":[{},"on the right side","on the upper side","on the left side"]},{"entry":["F","Attitude altering","Attitude altering","Attitude altering"]},{"entry":[{},"member","member","member"]},{"entry":[{},"on the right side","on the left side","on the upper side"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Firstly, a reference position of the attitude altering members U, L, R for the combination A is obtained (S). The detection procedures are described in ; the attitude altering member U on the upper side is advanced by the attitude altering drive source U with a given predetermined magnitude of power, thereby causing the attitude altering member U to push the distal end member  (S). The distal end member , which is retrained by the restraining tool , cannot be altered in attitude; and instead, a preload accumulates. As the preload reaches a certain magnitude and a balance is achieved between the reactive force from the distal end member  and the thrust force of that attitude altering member , that attitude altering member  gets prevented from advancing any longer (S). The value detected for this particular moment by the corresponding advance or retraction detector U is temporarily stored (S). Subsequently, the detection and the storage of a reference position of the attitude altering member L on the left side and of the attitude altering member R on the right side are carried out in a similar fashion (S through S). Then, the attitude altering members U, L, R are retracted for the next rounds of procedures (S).","In a similar manner to what has just been discussed for the combination A, a reference position of the attitude altering members U, L, R for the combinations B to F is detected and temporarily stored (S through S). Then, the six sets of detected values obtained for the attitude altering members U, L, R from the combinations A to F are subject to a statistical processing procedure to obtain statistically processed values for the respective attitude altering members U, L, R (S). The statistically processed values are stored in the reference position memory  (S). Each of the statistically processed values is, for example, an arithmetic average value of each set of the detected values. Each of the statistically processed values may be an average of the remaining values after the maximum and minimum values are removed. Also, each of the statistically processed values may be a median of each set of the detected values.","Such successive procedures or actions are automatically performed by the initial attitude controller . A given predetermined magnitude of power with which each of the attitude altering drive sources  is driven allows for performing, under fixed conditions, the detection of the advance or retraction position of each of the attitude altering members  corresponding to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member , thereby resulting in highly accurate detection results.","The values stored in the reference position memory  in the above discussed manner are used as the advance or retraction position of each of the attitude altering members  corresponding to the initial position-attitude of the distal end member , in order for the attitude altering controller to perform control of alteration in attitude of the distal end member . In this way, appropriate control of alteration in attitude of the distal end member  can be performed while accommodating possibly different initial position-attitudes of distal end members  among different remote controlled actuator assemblies.","An operation of the remote controlled actuator assembly will now be described.","When the tool rotating drive source  is driven by operating the rotation operating device , the rotational force thereof is transmitted to the spindle  through the drive shaft  to thereby rotate the tool  together with the spindle . The tool  then being rotated cuts a bone or the like. During such processing, according to the shape of the site to be processed and\/or the progression of the processing, the attitude of the distal end member  is altered in two axis-directions perpendicular to each other through the attitude altering members , by operating the attitude alteration operating device  and driving the attitude altering drive sources .","The attitude altering drive sources  are provided at a position distant from the distal end member  and the alteration of the attitude of the distal end member  is carried out by remote control. Since the attitude altering members  are inserted through the guide holes , the attitude altering members  can properly act on the distal end member  at all times without being accompanied by displacement in position in a direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction thereof and the attitude altering operation of the distal end member  can therefore be performed accurately. Also, since the center of the junction between the spindle  and the drive shaft  lies at the same position as the respective centers of curvature O of the guide faces F and F, no force tending to press and pull will not act on the drive shaft  as a result of the alteration of the attitude of the distal end member  and the distal end member  can be smoothly altered in attitude.","Also, even in the case that the distal end member  for holding the tool  becomes out of control due to, for example, the failure of the attitude altering drive mechanism and\/or the attitude control unit , the rotation preventing mechanism , which prevents the distal end member  from rotating with respect to the guide section  about the center line CL of the distal end member , in turn, prevents the distal end member  from undesirably rotating about the center line CL and damaging the neighboring portions of the processing cite and\/or from damaging and breaking itself.","The remote controlled actuator assembly of the foregoing construction is utilized in grinding the femoral marrow cavity during, for example, the artificial joint replacement surgery and during the surgery, it is used with the distal end member  in its entirety or a part thereof inserted into the body of a patient. Because of this, with such distal end member  as described above that can be altered in attitude by remote control, the bone can be processed in a condition with the tool  maintained in a proper attitude at all times and the opening for insertion of the artificial joint can be finished accurately and precisely.","There is the necessity that the drive shaft  and the attitude altering member  are provided within the guide section  of an elongated shape in a protected fashion. Hence, the drive shaft  is provided in the center portion of the outer shell pipe  and the guide pipes , in which the respective attitude altering members  are accommodated, and the reinforcement shafts  are arranged between the outer shell pipe  and the drive shaft  so as to be juxtaposed in the circumferential direction. Accordingly, it is possible to protect the drive shaft  and the attitude altering members  and, at the same time, the interior can be made hollow to thereby reduce the weight without sacrificing the rigidity. Also, the balance as a whole is good.","Since the outer diametric surfaces of the rolling bearings  supporting the drive shaft  are supported by the guide pipes  and the reinforcement shafts , the outer diametric surfaces of the rolling bearings  can be supported with no need to use any extra member. Also, since the preload is applied to the rolling bearings  by means of the spring elements A and B, the drive shaft  comprised of the wire can be rotated at a high speed. Because of that, the processing can be accomplished with the spindle  rotated at a high speed and a good finish of the processing can also be obtained and the cutting resistance acting on the tool  can be reduced. Since the spring elements A and B are disposed between the neighboring rolling bearings , the spring elements A and B can be provided with no need to increase the diameter of the guide section .","The restraining tool  may have a configuration different from that shown in  and . For instance, a restraining tool  as shown in  and  includes a pair of half members  each having a shape of a halved cylinder that is halved along the plane containing an axis of the cylinder. Each of the pair of the half members  has first and second ends, and the pair of the half members  are rotatably coupled with each other by a hinge  at their first ends, with their other second ends being fixable with each other by a bolt . The half members  are disposed so as to cover an area extending from an outer periphery of a tip end portion of the guide section  to an outer periphery of the distal end member  as shown in , and then their second ends are clampingly fastened with each other by the bolt . As a result, the half members  are caused to be pressed against the tip end portion of the guide section  and the distal end member . In this way, the distal end member  can be restrained to align the center line CL of the distal end member  with the center line CL of the guide section , thereby keeping the distal end member  straight with respect to the guide section . Devices other than the restraining tool  may be used to restrain the distal end member  so as to keep the distal end member  straight with respect to the guide section .","In the embodiments that have been discussed above, the operating tool was shown and described as a rotary tool . However, the operating tool may be other type of operating tools such as a holding tool. Also, the present invention is not limited to a remote controlled actuator assembly for medical use, but may also be applied to remote controlled actuator assemblies used for other fields such as a machining field.","Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings which are used only for the purpose of illustration, those skilled in the art will readily conceive numerous changes and modifications within the framework of obviousness upon the reading of the specification herein presented of the present invention.
