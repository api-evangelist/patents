No. 61\/886,317, filed Oct. 3, 2013, entitled \u201cCREST FACTOR REDUCTION OF INTER-BAND MULTI-STANDARD CARRIER AGGREGATED SIGNALS\u201d, the entirety of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This written description is directed to radio transmitters, and in particular, to crest factor reduction of carrier aggregated signals in radio transmitters of a communication system.","An absence of frequency spectrum bands that can support wide transmission bandwidths gives rise to intra-band or inter-band aggregation of multiple carriers according to specific sets of technical requirements. Such carrier aggregated signals have characteristics, such as high peak to average power ratio (PAPR), also commonly referred to as crest factor (CF), and wide bandwidth. The amplification of these carrier aggregated signals by a single power amplifier (PA) poses several challenges. A PA is required to maintain good power efficiency over multiple frequency bands. This has motivated recent research attempts to develop high efficiency, multiband and broadband devices such as Doherty PAs and envelope tracking systems. In addition, due to the high CF of the carrier aggregated signals, these PAs are often required to operate in the large back off region from their peak power to meet linearity requirements. Consequently, these PAs yield poor power efficiency.","Several techniques have been devised for crest factor reduction (CFR) of single band signals and consequently enhance PA efficiency and reduce the dynamic-range requirement imposed on digital to analog converters. These techniques can be divided into two categories: distortion-less methods (commonly called linear CFR techniques), such as selected mapping, partial transmit sequence, tone injection, tone reservation, and coding; and distortion-based methods (also called nonlinear CFR techniques) such as clipping\/windowing, companding, active constellation extension (ACE), and generalized ACE methods.","Linear techniques can achieve greater CF reduction than their nonlinear counterparts without altering signal quality. However, linear techniques usually require modifications to the receiver that may be incompatible with existing communication systems. Linear techniques have been applied to multicarrier\/single-standard signals through proper modulation and coding. However, the generalization of linear techniques to carrier aggregated signals is not possible due to the dissimilarity between the modulation schemes employed in each carrier.","The nonlinear CFR techniques are generally carefully applied to obtain the highest possible CF reduction while not exceeding the distortion threshold. These techniques, and in particular, the clipping\/windowing technique, have been applied to multi-carrier signals co-located in the same spectrum band. However application of clipping\/windowing techniques to carrier aggregated signals, especially when each carrier is located in different and widely spaced frequency bands, is very challenging because the clipping\/windowing techniques may require very high, and thus, impractical sampling rates.","A carrier aggregated signal over two bands, such as shown in , can be expressed as\n\n()=()+()=()()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere x(t) is the carrier aggregated signal, x(t) and x(t) are the mixed mode signals in each band, and {tilde over (x)}(t) and {tilde over (x)}(t) denote the baseband envelopes of x(t) and x(t) around the angular frequencies \u03c9and \u03c9, respectively. As shown in , the individual signals x(t) and x(t) have bandwidths B and B, respectively, and are separated by a frequency gap S.\n","The carrier aggregated signal can be represented as a broadband signal with an angular carrier frequency",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"x","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"msub":{"mi":"x","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u00b7","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"}}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"}],"mo":"-"},"mn":"2"}}}},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"}],"mo":"-"},"mn":"2"}}}}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"}}}}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"The classical clipping\/windowing nonlinear CFR technique can be applied to {tilde over (x)}(t).

A device  for implementing the classical clipping\/windowing method is shown in . As can be seen, in addition to the clipping  and filtering modules , the SISO CFR of  includes an up-sampler , a digital up-converter , a down-sampler  and a down-converter . As this technique is a nonlinear operation, inband distortions and out of band spectrum regrowth are induced. In order to achieve an acceptable adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR), the clipped signal is filtered. The clipping threshold is set so that the CF is reduced while conforming to error vector magnitude (EVM) and ACPR specifications.","The frequency spacing S between the two carriers is generally significantly greater than the bandwidths of x(t) and x(t), i.e. Band B, especially in the case of inter-band aggregation scenarios. Hence, f\u2032would need to be considerably larger than the frequencies fand fneeded to digitize {tilde over (x)}(t) and {tilde over (x)}(t), respectively (f\u22672\u00b7B, f\u22672\u00b7B) .","For example, assume a carrier aggregated signal is composed of a 15 MHz wide band code division multiple access (WCDMA) signal around 2.1 GHz and a 10 MHz long term evolution (LTE) signal centered in 2.4 GHz. For such a combination, the minimum theoretical sampling frequency f\u2032must be higher than 610 MHz. This sampling frequency is significantly higher than the sampling frequencies needed to represent the WCDMA and LTE signals individually. The direct application of the SISO clipping\/windowing to {tilde over (x)}(n\u2032) is thus seen to imply a high and impractical sampling rate. The high sampling rate requirement associated with the conventional clipping and windowing approach makes this solution sub-optimal in the context of inter-band carrier aggregated signals.","The present disclosure advantageously provides methods and systems for crest factor reduction of multi-standard carrier aggregated signals.

Sampling at the Nyquist rate based on the bandwidth associated with a carrier signal would result in sampling at a rate of about 30 MHz, which is substantially less than a sampling rate of 330 MHz, i.e., less than the sampling rate by an order of 10, based on spacing between carrier signals.

A better approach is to exploit the extra EVM margin offered by the simpler modulation scheme through unequal peak reduction factors, as given by equation (11).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00019","num":"00019"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mi":"If","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"S","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}},{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}}],"mo":"+"}}}},"mo":">","mi":"C"},{"mstyle":{"mtext":">"},"mo":"\u2062","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"_clipped"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}},{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b1","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["S","C"],"mo":"-"}}}],"mo":"-"}],"mo":"="}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"_clipped"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}}},{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b1","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["S","C"],"mo":"-"}}}],"mo":"-"}],"mo":"="}}}]}}],"mo":["\u2062","="],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"11"}}]}}}}},"In equation (11), aand aare the two peak reduction factors and satisfy the condition a+a=1.

It is shown that the achieved CFR of the test signal allows for significant improvement of the effective average power level by about 2 dB, and an increase in power efficiency by up to 5% when the test signal is applied to two amplifiers under test.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0122"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 6"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"EVM","EVM","EVM","Effective",{}]},{"entry":[{},"PAPR","(%)","(%)","(%)","average","Efficiency"]},{"entry":[{},"(dB)","Band 1","Band 2","Band 3","power","(%)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Single","11.3","0","0","0",{},"16"]},{"entry":["ended","9.5","1.3","1.4","1.7","+2 dB","20"]},{"entry":"PA"},{"entry":["Doherty","11.3","0","0","0",{},"40"]},{"entry":["PA","9.5","1.3","1.4","1.7","+2 dB","45"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A multiple input multiple output (MIMO) CFR technique suitable for inter-band multi-standard carrier aggregated signals over two and three bands has been described. Compared to the conventional SISO CFR approach, the proposed MIMO CFR allows for a significant decrease of the sampling rate which is made proportional to the maximum of the bandwidth of the two carriers rather than the spacing between them. The proposed CFR approach was demonstrated on a 300 MHz dual-band and a 200 MHz tri-band multi-standard carrier aggregated waveform composed of LTE and WCDMA signals. The CF of the aggregated signal was successfully reduced from 11.3 dB to 9.5 dB while minimizing impacts on EVM and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of the output signal. Note that although examples of CFR for only two and three bands are shown herein, embodiments are not limited to two and three bands.
