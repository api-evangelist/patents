title: Strength strand construction for a longitudinal section of a cable
abstract: An assembly including a span of microwave signals flexible coaxial line, or other form energy transmission media, is provided with generally coextensive, non-metallic longitudinal strength strands to render greater tensile strength to the assembly. Marginal axial end sections of a coaxial cable span are potted in respective polyurethane grip foundation having longitudinal grooves. The grip foundations are inserted into an open-mesh-sleeve type cable-end grip device. The strength strands are seated in the grooves and interlaced in and out of the openings in the open-mesh-sleeves of the grip devices. Co-adjacent marginal end portions of the strength strands are bundled beyond the interlacing, and knotted to the open-mesh-sleeves of the grip devices. In forming the knots the bundled marginal end portions of the strength strands are entwined and bound together and with a pair of the crossing strands of the open-mesh-sleeve.

This co-pending application is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a novel apparatus and method for providing tensile strength to longitudinal sections of cables, including cables in which a linear energy transmission medium has a surrounding arrangement of a damage resistant outer sheath with emollient liquid between the sheath and the transmission medium. It also relates to such providing tensile strength to forms of cable section assemblies having a layer of flexible molded material between the damage resistant sheath and the central core structure containing the transmission medium. An example of the latter type of cable section assembly is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464, issued 30 Jul. 2002, and especially therein in a discussion of a best mode of that invention for applications of that invention in which the cable section assemblies are used in environments in which they are extremely stressed (especially see the description therein at column 12, line 65 through column 18, line 4). This U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464 is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety. An aspect of the invention is also of special utility in providing tensile strength to cable section assemblies for microwave coaxial lines.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Submarines must be able to send and receive messages. Radio reception from a submerged submarine is maintained through a buoyant cable antenna (\u201cBCA\u201d) which comprises an antenna line train of components including at least at the trailing end thereof a detachably connected longitudinal sectional component. The BCA rises above the submarine and floats and streams at or near the ocean surface. When not in use, the BCA is coiled around a small diameter spool in the submarine, requiring considerable flexibility. When deployed from the submarine, the BCA and its components require a demanding structure due to the substantial stress placed on the BCA. For example, the BCA is subjected to severe mechanical shocks when towed in high sea conditions, e.g., the BCA must rise from various depths and may be subjected to waves of up to 35 feet at the ocean surface. Thus, tensile strength is critical to the BCA structure.","Prior art BCA cable section assemblies elements are known wherein the tensile strength was augmented by the provision at their respective ends of cable-end grips of the type affixing to core structures of the assembly by open-mesh-sleeves which tightened their constriction on the core structure by Chinese-finger-toy like tightening of the mesh sleeve around a grip foundation sleeve molded on the core structure. Also a prior attempt was made to increase the tensile strength and flexing damage resistance characteristics of BCA cable section assemblies was by potting the length of core structure in cured flexible polyurethane, which is moldingly bonded to the grip foundation gripped by the open-mesh-sleeves of the cable-end gripping device. However, the prior attempt using this approach did not provide a significantly improvement over the tensile strength and flexing damage avoidance capabilities provided by the grip sleeves and grip foundation alone.","Accordingly, there is an unsatisfied need for a cable section assembly of a BCA having an imbedded coaxial cable which has higher tensile strength and flexing damage resistance characteristics than heretofore available by application of the foregoing known prior art, and attempted approach of of improvement, of insertion of a moldingly bonded grip foundation into an open-mesh-sleeve type cable end grip.","There are additional prior art devices relating to various types of cable assemblies or reinforcing members which do not involve gripping by open-mesh-sleeves such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,352,391; 4,463,358; 4,491,939; 4,749,420 and 5,057,092. Thus, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,463,358 and 4,749,420 generally disclose basic buoyant cable antennas. Additionally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,352,391, 5,057,093 and 4,634,804 generally disclose the use of spaced elongated strengthening members. U.S. Pat. No. 4,491,939 generally discloses a cable using a Kevlar\u00ae member.","It is a primary object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method which provides higher tensile strength characteristics than have heretofore been available in prior art forms of structure of buoyant cable antenna (BCA) cable section asseblies.","It is a further primary object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method for providing high tensile strength characteristics to a BCA cable section assembly which contains a span of coaxial cable, one or more wire conductors, wire cable, a fiber optic cable, other forms of linearly extending energy transmission media, or electronic components serially distributed along it length which are interleaved between shorter spans of the coaxial cable.","It is another object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method for providing tensile strength to a BCA cable section assembly in a way which enables the component to be readily designed to be of a selected length, which in turn enables designing high tensile strength BCA cable section assemblies to selectively match the length of an existing tubular jackets for BCA's.","The invention is directed to strengthening an assembly which includes a span of coaxial cable or other forms of energy transmissive media, and which in one illustrative embodiment is employed as buoyant antenna cable (BCA) cable section assembly. In accordance with the invention, multiple longitudinal non-metallic high tensile strength strands, which are integrated into the span assembly by a specific construction and arrangement, provide increased tensile strength to the span assembly. The preferred material for the longitudinal strengthening strands is Kevlar\u00ae, an aromatic polyamide fiber manufactured and sold by E.I. DuPont de Nemours Company, which exhibits a high breaking strength in the longitudinal direction. Specifically, axially extending marginal end portions of the span of coaxial cable are placed into a conventional two-part cable encasement producing mold, into which is introduced a polyurethane forming polymer composition which is cured at room temperature to form a grip foundation molded and bonded to the cable around the marginal end portion. In individual molding processes such grip foundation are formed at each end of the span.","Each grip foundation has formed in its outer surface a set of at least three longitudinal grooves. Upon curing and removal from the mold, pairs of open-mesh-sleeve type cable-end grips, are slid over the axial end sections of the cable potted in the polymer grip casing. A corresponding set of at least three longitudinal Kevlar strands of the same length as the cable span are laid next to the cable spans and have their end portions interlaced in and out of adjacent openings in the open-mesh-sleeve of the cable-end grip device a significant number of times, each strand being interlaced along a respective groove in the grip foundations. The grooves in the grip foundation provide room for the Kevlar strands to be pass there through in the course of being interlaced through the mesh. The strands at each end of the set are gathered and tied to an intersection of mesh strands of the sleeve by a self-seizing knot at a position near the axially outer end of the open-mesh-sleeve. The tail ends of the strands beyond the knot are trimmed and tucked under the mesh and secured in place, e.g., by epoxy glue, in order that the ends do not protrude from the cylindrical envelope dimension of the cable section assembly.","Reference is now made to the drawings and more particularly to  which depict an illustrative embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention. Referring now more particularly to , this apparatus is a microwave coaxial line cable section assembly , which includes the microwave coaxial line , sheath (shown by phantom lines) which is for protection against damage to line  and for containing an emollient liquid (that serves as a damping medium reduces the magnitude of concussion shock to the assemble which transmitted to line ).  are directed to an interim manufacturing step subassembly of cable section assembly . An application of the embodiment of  involving vulnerability to damage by small diameter capstan mechanisms and by potential high magnitude of shock in heavy sea states is disclosed in the hereinabove identified and incorporated by reference U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464. Therein cable section assembly may be used as a component of the r.f. lead-in and tow cable section (designated , , therein) of a buoyant cable antenna (BCA) line (designated  therein) towed behind a submarine. It is to be understood that the concepts and teachings of the present invention also have applicability to embodiments like that shown in the hereinabove identifies copending application \u201cOuter Casing Structure and Fabrication Method for Cable Sections and Navy Buoyant Antennas\u201d wherein the annular space between an outer casing (designated  therein) an a energy transmission central core structure (designated as a conduit  and runs of elective wires  therein) is filled with a molded plastic element (designated  therein). The concepts and teachings of the present invention further have applicability to embodiments having molded plastic elements between the outer sheath and a central energy transmission structure wherein the central structure houses plastic encapsulated circuit boards, such as the embodiments disclosed in the hereinabove identified U.S. Patent Application No. 6,426,464 wherein the annular space between the outer sheath (designated  therein) and the protective tube (designated  therein) containing runs of electronic hook-up media (designated  therein) and between the sheath and the electronic circuit boards (designated  therein) contains plastic molded parts (designated  and  therein). (The application of this invention to the latter embodiment disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464 will be discussed of drawings later herein.) A typical length of a BCA longitudinal sectional component of a BCA line is of the order of ten feet. In operational use a BCA sectional component can be exposed to enormous tensile and flexional strains and stresses with considerable shock or concussion effects. For example, The sea surface whereat the BCA sectional component floats and streams at the speed of the towing submarine may can attain sea states having 35 foot wave.","Cable span assembly  serves a two-fold function namely (i) provision of the mechanical structural support needed to withstand the aforesaid stresses and (ii) provision of the instrumentalities for mechanical and electrical connection with an adjoining portion.","It is to be understood that as one of the last steps of manufacture of a BCA longitudinal sectional component, the cable span assembly  is fitted into a suitable jacket (shown by phanton lines) which serve to: (i) protect cable span assembly  from abrasion, (ii) seal off cable span assembly  from seawater, and (iii) where buoyancy is desired provide a housing which forms space to contain buoyant material.","In accordance with the present invention a set of at least three high tensile strength and high breaking point strength strands  (which  and  show without the complication of knotting; and which  show including the knotting) provide cable section assembly  with the tensile strength and resistance to damage by flexing needed to withstand the above discussed large scale stresses and strains. The mechanical construction and arrangement by which strength strands  provide this tensile strength and resistance to flexure damage will be understood as this description proceeds.","It is to be understood that although the foregoing illustrative embodiment discloses microwave coaxial cable as the object of the mechanical structure support by cable section assembly , the concept of the present invention also extends to use of the assembly as such support linearly extending energy transmission medium generally including conductor wires, wire cables, and fiber optic cables.","A preferred material to be employed as the high tensile strength, high breaking point set of strands  is an aromatic polyamide fiber widely commercial available and often identified by tradename Kelvar\u00ae of E.I. DuPont de Nemours Company. Kevlar\u00ae is the preferred material because it exhibits a high breaking strength in the longitudinal direction. Other aromatic polyamide fibers having tensile strength characteristics similar to Kevlar\u00ae may also be used in accordance with the invention.","Referring now collectively to , ,  and , in the construction of span assembly , an axially extending grip foundation  is molded and bonded to coaxial cable . It is to be understood that a minor image of the constructions of ,  and  are present at the opposite side of assembly . Illustrative of cable  is the RG-178, flexible coaxial cable for transmitting microwave signals manufactured by Times Microwave Systems. Referring to  cable  includes a moldingly bonded concentric arrangement of an central linear member , an intermediate layer portion , and an outer layer at least the latter of which has an affinity for moldingly bonding with thermo-setting molding compounds. The process of molding and bonding grip foundation  to cable line  may employ a 2-mold adapted to receive a span of the cable and to mold a grip foundation encasement around an axial section thereof. At each of the opposite end of cable line  an axially extending section of the line proximate to the respective ends of the line is placed in the mold, and the mold is filled with a thermo-setting polymer composition which is curable at room temperature. Stated another way, the selected axial section of the coaxial cable is potted in the polyurethane polymer grip foundation . A preferred polymer is TC-512, a polyurethane curing polymer composition manufactured and sold by BJB Enterprises of Garden Grove, Calif. When the polyurethane is cured, the coaxial cable line, or other form of transmission media  and the grip foundation  will have formed an integrably molded cable and grip foundation subassembly , , which has a length co-extensive with the open-mesh-sleeve of a cable-end grip device (cable-end-grip device assembly  and its component mesh-sleeve  shown in FIGS. , and  will be introduced and discussed in detail later herein). Subassembly  is then removed from the mold. Other thermo-setting polymers which may be employed include polysulfides and RTV silicones. In a preferred embodiment, grip foundation  has formed therein a set of at least three longitudinal grooves  (best shown in ) of a number corresponding to the number of strength strands in strength strands set . For the embodiment of a cable section assembly  containing microwave coaxial cable line wherein the outside diameter, and of an outside diameter of 0.65 inches this the number of grooves  on grip foundation  is three (3). However, additional grooves may be utilized to enable utilizing additional strength strands  and increasing the tensile strength of cable span assembly . Grooves  are preferably formed in the course of molding. In planes perpendicular to the axis of the coaxial cable line , groove  are equiangularly radially spaced and the grooves in the grip foundation at opposite ends of interim manufacturing step subassembly are in angular registry with one another about the cable axis. The grooves are of a depth to provide recessed spaces to receive the longitudinal strength strands . This is best seen in the cross-section of subassembly  in FIG. .","At each end of subassembly there is a cable-end grip device assembly , which comprises (i) an axially outwardly  disposed mechanical and electrical coupling subassembly , and (ii) an axially inwardly disposed open-mesh-sleeve . The aspect of subassembly 's mechanical attachment to coaxial cable line , and the aspect of electrical coupling performed by subassembly  are conventional and form no part of the invention. The open-mesh-sleeve component  of grip device assembly is also conventional. However, as will become apparent as this description proceeds its structure and the structural relationship between it and other elements of interim manufacturing step subassembly is an important aspect of the present invention. In attaching each grip assembly  at the ends of subassembly , the open-mesh-sleeve component  is slid over and receives the outer surface (sometimes hereinafter and in the appended claims called the \u201cgrip foundation surface\u201d)  within cylindrical interior of the mesh with a fit that any sliding motion in the direction of withdrawing the grip foundation  causes considerable sliding friction. Such sliding friction in turn causes the \u201cChinese-finger-toy\u201d phenomenon of causing radial constriction of the open-mesh-sleeve, in turn increasing the gripping force which assembly  exerts on grip foundation .","As best shown in  open-mesh-sleeve  is of the conventional type in which first and second pluralities of mesh forming strands are helically wound in opposite helical directions of winding in a construction known as a braided open-mesh-sleeve (i.e., the mesh strands alternatingly pass above and below successive mesh strands wound in the opposite direction). Note that in the embodiment of  the number of strands in each of the first and second pluralities of strands wound in respective opposite directions of helical winding is three (3).","As mentioned earlier herein, high tensile strength and high breaking point strength strands  augment the tensile strength and flexure damage resistance characteristics of interim manufacturing step subassembly . As particularly shown in  in conjunction with , the number of strands of the set, which corresponds to the number of axially extending grooves  in grip foundations  are laid along the respective grooves  at each end of assembly . In the embodiment of  there are three strands to a set. The spans of the individual strands extend between the grip foundation  generally coextensively with the total length of coaxial cable line . The end portions of the strands  include enough excess strand material to permit getting a purchase hold on the strand for purposes of the processes of knotting and making the strands taut, to be described later. Proximate to each end of each strength strand  is an axially extending portion that lies next to a groove  in the grip foundation . Except for knotting at its axially out end, this portion of each strand is interlaced in and out of successive openings in the associated open-mesh-sleeve. As best shown in  the interlacing taking place where mesh strands being wound in opposite helical directions cross. The grooves  provide enough space underneath the open-mesh-sleeves  to accommodate the interlacing.","Referring now to , as mentioned the interlacing of strength strands in and out of mesh sleeve 's openings terminates short of the axially outwardly end of mesh sleeve  to enable the knotting and strength strand tensioning processes hereinafter described. In an illustrative embodiment of a cable section assembly  for the aforesaid RG-178 coaxial cable line interlacing is terminated approximately two inches from the axially outer end of open-mesh-sleeve , and the strength strands are interlaced in and out of twelve openings in the mesh sleeve, i.e., six cycles of interlacing took place.","At each end of a subassembly the outer ends of the strands beyond termination of the interlacing are gathered and together knotted into a modified Diamond form self seizing knot , , at a location in the open-mesh-sleeve where two mesh strands winding in opposite directions of helical winding cross. It is to be appreciated that the modified Diamond self-seizing knot  conjointly binds together the strands of set , and two mesh strands respectively winding in opposite direction of helical winding. As an alternative to the modified Diamond knot, any of a number of other of known self-seizing process knotting process which can effect such conjunctive binding of strands. Using any suitable jig arrangement, or manually by two or more craftsmen working as a team, the coextensive spans of coaxial line  and the sets of strength strands are simultaneously drawn into taut conditions during the knotting process. Note that the ends of coaxial cable line  are made fast to the grip devices at opposite ends of cable section assembly  by action of the open-mesh-sleeve upon the grip foundation. The excess lengths of strength strands  are then trimmed, tucked under a nearby strand of open-mesh-sleeve , and secured in place, such as by epoxy glue. This is done in order that they do not protrude from subassembly 's dimensional envelope requirements for fitting in sheath .","After intermediate manufacturing step subassembly is fabricated, the completion of assembly of cable section assembly  is performed. Subassembly is fitted within sheath boa (phantom lines, FIG. ), using any of a number of known techniques and jig arrangements. A sealing relationship between the marginal end portions of sheath  and the axially outwardly disposed mechanical and electrical coupling subassemblies ,  of the cable-end grip devices  established is performed to seal against seawater entering the sheath, or to otherwise satisfy other requirements for hermetic sealing. This is done using any of a number of known constructions and techniques. Finally, the generally annularly cross-sectioned space along the length of the span of coaxial line  is filled with any suitably emollient liquid, and the penetrations made in the sheath in the performance of the filling are sealed.","At the time the ends of the sets of strength strands  were knotted to the open-mesh-sleeves , the generally co-extensive spans of the strength strands  and the coaxial cable line  were simultaneously in taut conditions. The self-siezing modified Diamond knots make fast the ends of the set of strands , to the grip devices  at opposite end of assembly , FIG. . As noted the ends of cable line  are also made fast to the grip devices by action of open-mesh-sleeves  upon grip foundations . Therefore, in cable section assembly , , the two gripping devices  upon tying knots  the assembly's opposite ends are constrained to a predetermined maximum distance of separation determined by the length of the spans of cable line  and the length of span of strands  between. This is fixed regardless of the tension across assembly  or forces of flexing upon assembly . Further, because axial sections of the strength strand laying adjacent to grooves  in grip foundations  are interlaced through openings in the open-mesh-sleeve , an increase in tensions across all the strands together, or across only one or tow of the strands (in the case of flexing) will cause open-mesh-sleeve  to constrict in the manner of a Chinese-finger-toy, increasing the gripping actions that make fast the ends of coaxial cable line  to the cable end gripping devices . This combination of effects of the strength strand construction and arrangement in accordance with the present invention provide a capability of cable section assembly  to cope with large surges in tensile stress, and a capability to cope with effects of repeated flexing during reeling of the cable section on small diametered reels.","The invention has been above described in connection with an embodiment of BCA longitudinal sectional component shown in  having a continuous coaxial cable extending between the grip assemblies  at the ends of the sectional component, with the void space between the jacket and the cable span core assembly  filled with emollient liquid.","However, it is to be understood that the concept of the invention extends to other embodiment of BCA sectional components wherein the spaces between the jacket and a cable span core assembly contain glass microballoon filled polyurethane buoyant material (not shown herein), and the core assembly comprises a pluarality of sections of coaxial cable (not shown herein) having interleaved therebetween electronic component units (not shown herein). The microballoon filled polyurethane material is relatively soft. A preferred microballoon filled polyurethane material to occupy the spaces between the jacket and the cable span core assembly is disclosed in said U.S. Pat. No. 5,606,329. Each of the electronic component units comprises an electronic circuit board (not shown herein) embedded on a polyurethane encapsulate (not shown herein) which is harder than the buoyant polyurethane material. An example of this type of encapsulant for of BCA sectional component is disclosed in the hereinabove identified and incorporated by reference U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,424. The above mentioned described (i) buoyant, filled polyurethane material (designated  therein), (ii) sections of coaxial cable (designated , , etc. therein), (iii) electronic circuit boards (designated , , etc. therein), and (iv) harder polyurethane encapsulate (designated , therein) may be seen in ,  and of U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464, respectively. A further structural feature which can be seen in FIG. 4 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464 is that the plural sections of coaxial cable are each encased in a flexible tubular conduit (designated  therein), which at each of its ends is moldingly bonded with the harder polyurethane encapsulate (designated , therein) of the adjacent electronic component unit or with an adjacent grip foundation (not shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464) which is also of such harder polyurethane material.","The following described modifications to the structure disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464 constitutes the best mode which the inventors contemplate in connection with a BCA longitudinal sectional component in which void spaces between the jacket and the cable span assembly are occupied with a soft, buoyant microballoon containing polyurethane type material instead of the emollient liquid. Three or more strength strands as described hereinabove in connection with the embodiment of  of the present invention, extend between the grip assemblies at the ends of the sectional component. However, instead of extending in the void space between the grip foundations they pass through flexible tubular conduits encasing the coaxial cable sections, and pass through and are moldingly embedded in a harder polyurethane encapsulate of the electronic component units interleaved between coaxial cable sections. In this best mode, the substrate upon which each grip foundation is molded as an extension of the outermost of these tubular conduits at the opposite ends of cable span assembly designated  therein. The strands are located in sectors of a transverse reference plane through the encapsulate where they will not interfere with the circuit board which is also embedded in each electronic component unit. In the tubular conduits adjacent to the grip subassemblies (designated  therein) at the ends of the sectional component, and more particularly at axial locations in these outermost tubular conduits adjacent to where the grip foundation starts, the ends of the strength strands are turned radially outward and brought out of the tubular conduit through radial openings in the wall of the tubular conduit. Outside the tubular conduit, the radially extending expanses of the strands are drawn taut and lie essentially in abutting relation to the inner annular end face of each grip foundation (described, but not shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464). At the circular corner edge between the annular end face of a grip foundation and the circumferential surface of the foundation, the strength strands are turned over the corner and extend axially outward in a groove as described in connection with  herein. These axially extending expanses are interlaced in the opens spaces of the open-mesh-sleeve, and ultimately gathered and bound together and with helically counter-rotating sleeve strands as described in connection with  herein. The advantage to confining the strength strands within the tubular conduits and bringing them out of the conduit in taut abutting relationship to the annular end face and the tautly turning them for interlacing in the longitudinal direction and attachment to the open-mesh-sleeve is that rips and tears in the soft microballoon containing material in annular spaces adjoining the end faces of the grip foundation under stressing and straining of the strength strands is avoided. Similarly, the advantage of passing the strength strands through the tubular conduits and moldingly potting them within the harder encapsulate of the electronic units between the coaxial cable sections is that tears and rips in the softer buoyant microballoon material in annular spaces between the electronic units under stressing and straining of the strength strands is avoided. For additional detail and information see column 12, line 65 through column 18, line 4, of the hereinabove referenced and incorporated by referenced U.S. Pat. No. 6,426,464.","It is to be understood that the form which the object of cable, span assembly 's support takes has little bearing on broader aspects of the invention. Instead it is to be appreciated that cable span assembly  can provide tensile and flexional strength support for any flexible linearly extending utilization object.","Obviously, many other modification and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teaching. It is therefore to understood that within the scope of the following claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["6","6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
