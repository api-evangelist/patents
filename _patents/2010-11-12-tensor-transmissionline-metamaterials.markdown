title: Tensor transmission-line metamaterials
abstract: Tensor transmission-line metamaterial unit cells are formed that allow the creation of any number of optic/electromagnetic devices. A desired electromagnetic distribution of the device is determined, from which effective material parameters capable of creating that desired distribution are obtained, for example, through a transformation optics/electromagnetics process. These effective material parameters are then linked to lumped or distributed circuit networks that achieve the desired distribution.

FA9550-08-1-0067 and FA9550-09-1-0696 awarded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Disclosure","The disclosure relates generally to subwavelength-structured composite materials (known as metamaterials) and, more particularly, to techniques for using transmission-line networks to design metamaterials with arbitrary material tensors.","2. Brief Description of Related Technology","The first negative refractive index medium was introduced in the early 2000s and was implemented and tested at microwave frequencies [R. A. Shelby, D. R. Smith, and S. Schultz, \u201cExperimental verification of a negative index of refraction,\u201d , vol. 292, pp. 77-79, April 2001]. The work, along with introduction of the \u201cperfect lens\u201d (negative refractive index superlens) by John B. Pendry initiated great interest in subwavelength-structured composite materials possessing tailored electromagnetic properties, materials known today as metamaterials. Soon after these initial experiments, a transmission-line (TL) approach to synthesizing negative refractive index metamaterials was developed [U.S. Pat. No. 6,859,114]. In that TL approach, a host transmission line is periodically loaded with reactive elements. For example, two dimensional isotropic and anisotropic transmission-line metamaterials could be realized that exhibit both negative and positive effective material parameters [Negative , G. V. Eleftheriades and K. G. Balmain, Eds. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley-IEEE Press, 2005]. While metamaterials could be developed, these TL-based metamaterials were limited in that they had diagonal material tensors in the Cartesian basis (a grid aligned with the rectangular unit cell dimensions).","Numerous theoretical devices have been proposed that are designed using transformation optics\/electromagnetics [J. B. Pendry, D. Schurig, and D. R. Smith, \u201cControlling electromagnetic fields,\u201d , vol. 312, pp. 1780-1782, June 2006], but few practical realizations have been reported. The few experimental structures reported have either used isotropic metamaterials or metamaterials with contoured unit cells that follow the geometry of the structure, to simplify the required material tensors so that only diagonal tensors are used. For example, in [D. Schurig, J. J. Mock, B. J. Justice, S. A. Cummer, J. B. Pendry, A. F. Starr, and D. R. Smith, \u201cMetamaterial electromagnetic cloak at microwave frequencies,\u201d 314, pp. 977-980, November 2006.], a cylindrical invisibility cloak was implemented with curved cells which allowed tensor materials that are diagonal in the cylindrical basis to be used. However, if one desires arbitrary control of electromagnetic fields, one must have the ability to design metamaterials with arbitrary material tensors (possessing diagonal and off-diagonal tensor elements). Arbitrary control over the medium in which an electromagnetic field exists translates to arbitrary control over the electromagnetic field itself","There have also been efforts to develop tensor impedance surfaces, which could be used, for example, to convert linearly polarized radiation to circular polarization. The surfaces have been referred to as artificial tensor impedance surfaces and in design contain trapezoidal metallic patches over a metal-backed dielectric substrate. Sievenpiper et al. [Fong, B. H.; Colburn, J. S.; Ottusch, J. J.; Visher, J. L.; Sievenpiper, D. F.; \u201cScalar and Tensor Holographic Artificial Impedance Surfaces,\u201d , vol. 58, no. 10, pp. 3212-3221, October 2010] have used parametric studies to form a database of metallic patch geometries and their corresponding surface impedance tensors. This cataloging, however, can be time consuming since no clear relationship between geometry and impedance tensor has been identified. In addition, methods of extending the technique to other frequency regimes have not been proposed.","The present techniques are able to address the shortcomings of the state of the art in a number of ways. For example, provided herein is a rectangular unit cell that can be used to implement arbitrary material tensors, for a particular electric field polarization. The tensor metamaterials proposed here directly relate circuit networks to tensor material parameters (permittivity and permeability). The techniques herein allow metamaterial discretization over a uniform or non-uniform grid, while permitting arbitrary material tensors with spatial gradients. Furthermore, the approach is transmission-line based (based on traveling-wave structures) and therefore promises broad bandwidths of operation and low losses. With regards to tensor impedance surfaces proposed by Sievenpiper et al., the present technique provides a more direct approach to tensor metamaterial synthesis. It does not require the lengthy parameter sweeps that have been employed to date to map different geometries to impedance tensors. Techniques herein are able to directly relate material tensors to circuit quantities. These circuit quantities can then be implemented using either distributed or lumped circuit elements.","Advantageously, this new approach to tensor metamaterials may be readily applied to the RF, microwave and millimeter-wave spectrum, and in some examples extended to higher frequencies, for example, by employing the concept of nano-circuit elements [N. Engheta, A. Salandrino, and A. Alu, \u201cCircuit elements at optical frequencies: Nanoinductors, nanocapacitors, and Nanoresistors,\u201d ., vol. 95, pp. 095504-095504, August 2005].","In accordance with an example, a method for forming an electromagnetic metamaterial with arbitrary material permittivity and\/or permeability tensors, comprises: directly mapping a material described by a 2\u00d72 effective permeability tensor and permittivity constant, or by a 2\u00d72 effective permittivity tensor and permeability constant, to a two-dimensional electrical network that can be described by an impedance tensor and scalar admittance, or an admittance tensor and a scalar impedance; and converting the two dimensional electrical network to a two-dimensional loaded transmission-line network, wherein the metamaterial comprises the loaded transmission-line network such that when excited with a specified excitation the metamaterial produces a desired electromagnetic field distribution.","In some examples the metamaterial comprises a plurality of unit cells that may be isotropic, while in other examples the unit cells may be anisotropic. While tensor TL metamaterial unit cells having 2\u00d72 tensor material parameters are given as an example, the unit cells may have a 2\u00d72 or 3\u00d73 material tensors. And the unit cells may be configured for p- or s-polarization.","In accordance with another example, a method for forming electromagnetic metamaterials with arbitrary material permittivity and\/or permeability tensors using loaded transmission-line networks, comprises: selecting a desired electromagnetic field distribution; determining the effective material parameters needed to achieve the desired electromagnetic field distribution for a specific excitation; and mapping the effective material parameters to a two-dimensional loaded transmission network forming a tensor transmission-line (TL) metamaterial, such that when excited the metamaterial produces the desired electromagnetic field distribution.","While the disclosed methods and apparatus are susceptible of embodiments in various forms, there are illustrated in the drawing (and will hereafter be described) specific embodiments of the invention, with the understanding that the disclosure is intended to be illustrative, and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments described and illustrated herein.","Below are example techniques for designing TL metamaterials with arbitrary full tensors. The ability to create metamaterials with arbitrary material tensors is important to controlling and directing electromagnetic fields. The ability to realize tensor metamaterials such as those described herein allows for the development of novel devices derived through transformation optics [J. B. Pendry, D. Schurig, and D. R. Smith, \u201cControlling electromagnetic fields,\u201d , vol. 312, pp. 1780-1782, June 2006]. In transformation optics, the path of electromagnetic waves is controlled through the spatial variation of a medium's effective material parameters. Specifically, the change in electromagnetic field from an initial spatial distribution to a desired spatial distribution is recorded as a coordinate transformation. This coordinate transformation can then be directly related to a change in the permittivity and permeability of the underlying medium. The electromagnetic devices designed using transformation optics often consist of materials with full tensors that vary arbitrarily in space. As a result, the ability to design tensor metamaterials is important to the development of many novel devices from DC to optical frequencies.","To form various desired electromagnetic devices, a circuit approach is provided that directly maps material parameter distributions (of polarization-specific transformation-designed electromagnetic devices) to two-dimensional loaded transmission-line networks. For example, the tensor TL metamaterials herein combine microwave network theory (circuits) with transformation optics\u2014a subject area that will be referred to as transformation circuits.","The present techniques allow one to control electromagnetic fields along a surface or radiating aperture. The resulting metamaterials, therefore, have uses across applications in particular in antenna design. Tensor TL metamaterials allow for the synthesis of arbitrary surface current distributions, which means arbitrary antenna aperture distributions. And because an antenna's far-field radiation pattern is a Fourier transform of its aperture distribution (current distribution), the present techniques will naturally allow the synthesis of planar\/conformal antennas with fixed, arbitrary radiation patterns; antennas may be produced having arbitrary far-field patterns as a result. The inclusion of tunable reactive elements (e.g., diode-based or MEMs-based varactors) into the tensor TL metamaterials further enables arbitrarily configurable antenna apertures.","In addition to antenna applications, the tensor TL metamaterials (transformation circuits) may be used in the design of antenna feeds, beamforming networks, interconnects, multiplexers, power dividers, couplers and other electromagnetic devices. By combining the spatial field manipulation offered by transformation circuits with traditional filter concepts one may form wireless devices that provide both focusing\/collimating and filtering functionality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","102","103","104"],"i":"Science"},"The various blocks, operations, and techniques described herein, including those of , may be implemented in a special-purpose machine for designing various optics and electromagnetic devices (e.g., antenna, beamforming networks, interconnects, multiplexers, power dividers, and couplers) by implementing the structures using tensor TL metamaterials. That machine may include at least one processor, a memory having stored thereon instructions that may be executed by that processor, an input device (such as a keyboard and mouse), and a display for depicting instructions and or characteristics of the device under design and\/or the tensor TL metamaterials. Further, that machine may include a network interface to allow for wired\/wireless communication of data to and from the machine, e.g., between the machine a separate machine or a separate storage medium. The blocks and operations herein may be executed in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination of hardware, firmware, and\/or software. When implemented in software, the software may be stored in any computer readable memory within or accessed by the machine, such as on a magnetic disk, an optical disk, or other storage medium, in a RAM or ROM or flash memory of a computer, processor, hard disk drive, optical disk drive, tape drive, etc. Likewise, the software may be delivered to a user or a system via any known or desired delivery method including, for example, on a computer readable disk or other transportable computer storage mechanism or via communication media. When implemented in hardware, the hardware may comprise one or more of discrete components, an integrated circuit, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), etc.","Described below are example tensor TL unit cells that can be used to construct TL metamaterials capable of possessing arbitrary 2\u00d72 permeability tensors and permittivity values for s-polarized electromagnetic radiation, and arbitrary 2\u00d72 permittivity tensors and permeability values for p-polarized radiation. An analysis of a 2-branch TL metamaterial unit cell network is provided in ; then a 3-branch TL metamaterial unit cell network (full 2\u00d72 tensor) is provided in ); and for greater flexibility a 4-branch TL metamaterial unit cell network is described in ). The 4-branch metamaterial unit cell shows circuit elements along two orthogonal directions and each diagonal. The analysis shows that metamaterials may be designed with permeability or permittivity profiles that are tensors, meaning that no longer are transmission-line based metamaterials limited to having diagonal permeability and permittivity profiles in the Cartesian basis (a grid aligned with the rectangular unit cell dimensions).","The present techniques include the ability to represent and analyze transmission-line metamaterials using tensors. The techniques also allow for the design of transmission-line (TL) metamaterials with arbitrary 2\u00d72 material tensors. While examples are discussed below of TL metamaterials based on a shunt node configuration, these techniques may be extended to series node transmission-line geometries as well, for example for p-polarized electromagnetic waves.","A tensor TL metamaterial represented by a diagonal tensor is shown in . This 2-branch structure is in general anisotropic since Zand Zmay be different. Two different choices of unit cell for this TL metamaterial are shown in and . is the standard transmission-line metamaterial unit cell that has been proposed earlier [Negative , G. V.

Therefore, depending on the desired frequency dependence of the parameters, one may want to choose an impedance on one diagonal as opposed to the other. For example, at a certain frequency of operation, an inductance on the y=x diagonal can be chosen to give the same zor zentry as capacitance on the y=\u2212x diagonal. The resulting frequency variation of the two choices, however, would be quite different: \u03c9 vs. 1\/\u03c9.","The diagonal impedances (Zand Z) lead to off-diagonal tensor impedance elements (Zand Z). These diagonal impedances allow a net current in one direction (for example, I, which is representative of magnetic field intensity component H) to give rise to series voltage drops in both the x and y directions (Vand V, which are proportional to the magnetic flux density components Band B). Therefore, by properly selecting the values of Z, Z, Z, and Z, one can design a metamaterial with arbitrary magnetic anisotropy (2\u00d72\u03bc tensor) and permittivity constant. A different choice of tensor TL metamaterial unit cell with four branches (two diagonal impedances), which also possesses a full 2\u00d72  tensor is shown in ). A similar analysis can be performed on it as well.","For the foregoing analysis, it was assumed that there was very little, if any, spatial dispersion (i.e., phase delays) across the unit cell in the x and y directions. To derive accurate dispersion equations that take into account spatial dispersion, a Bloch analysis of the TL metamaterial shown in ) was performed. Bloch analysis is only performed on the TL metamaterial in ), because the dispersion equations for the unit cells in ) and () can be derived from it.","An infinite structure having the unit cells depicted in ) can be analyzed by applying Bloch boundary conditions to the voltages at the edges of the unit cell.
