{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to underwater weapons systems, and more particularly to an underwater weapon system having a rotating gun system mounted in a vehicle housing.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Underwater gun systems are being developed for use as anti-mine and anti-torpedo applications. The basic systems include an underwater gun, underwater projectiles, a ship-mounted turret supporting the underwater gun, a targeting system and a combat system. The underwater gun shoots the underwater projectiles which are specially designed for neutralization of undersea targets at ranges of 200 meters or more. The undersea targets are identified and localized with the targeting system, and the combat system provides the control commands to direct the ship-mounted turret to aim the gun towards the target.","Currently, underwater gun systems are mounted onboard a conventional ship by means of a retractable gun turret that deploys a rotating gun using a large hydraulic actuator. The gun is stored in a bay having a hatch on the bottom of the ship that can be opened to allow the turret and gun to be deployed therethrough. When deployed, the gun turret is not readily faired thereby causing drag that results in substantial hydrodynamic loads on the deployed turret and the host ship. Furthermore, for the gun system to respond in a rapid fashion to an unexpected threat, the gun system must be continuously deployed thereby subjecting the host ship to long-term hydrodynamic loads while also reducing the value of having a retractable system. Still further, the space required onboard the host ship is considerable, e.g., the length required for a retractable turret can exceed ten meters for a gun that fires 30 millimeter caliber rounds.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide an underwater weapon system that can be continuously deployed without substantially impacting the operation of a ship that the weapon system is tasked to protect.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an underwater weapon system that can be maneuvered to engage an underwater target in any direction relative thereto.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","To obtain the objects described, an underwater weapon system having a vehicle housing is defined by a first portion and a second portion spaced apart from one another. Each vehicle housing portion has an exterior configured to provide hydrodynamic position control. The first and second vehicle housing portions are used cooperatively to alter a position of the vehicle housing in the water as the vehicle housing moves therethrough (e.g., via towing or attached propulsors).","A gun system is rotatably mounted to and between the first and second vehicle housing portions at an axis of rotation. The gun system includes a gun and ammunition sealed within a waterproof housing with a muzzle of the gun protruding from the waterproof housing. As a result, the muzzle can discharge ammunition therefrom into the water between the first and second vehicle housing portions. The gun system is also rotatable relative to the first and second vehicle housing portions to a position where the muzzle is positioned to fire ammunition towards an underwater target.","Referring now to the drawings, simultaneous reference will be made to  wherein one embodiment of an underwater weapon system in accordance with the present invention is shown and is referred generally by numeral . As explained below, the underwater weapon system  is a towable system designed to be pulled behind a host vessel (not shown). However, as will also be explained below, the present invention can be implemented as a self-propelled system and is not limited to use as a towed system.","The underwater weapon system  has first and second housing portions  and  that can be mated to form a vehicle housing that can be maneuvered through the water. The housing portions  and  are separated from one another and have a gun system  coupled thereto and therebetween such that the gun system  is rotatable relative to the housing portions  and  about an axis of rotation  defined by dashed line. More specifically, the gun system  is coupled to each of housing portions  and  by a hub  that will typically be motorized to permit controlled rotation of the gun system.","The gun system  has a waterproof housing  that encases an underwater gun  with a length of a muzzle  extending from the waterproof housing . The waterproof housing  also encases ammunition  for the underwater gun . It is to be understood that the ammunition  includes both the stowage of the ammunition (i.e., a magazine) and a supplying structure for the ammunition (i.e., a feed system) to the gun . Such a gun magazine and feed systems are well known in the art and will, therefore, not be described further herein.","The underwater gun  includes the muzzle  that protrudes from the waterproof housing  with the muzzle encompassing a bore axis . Thus, the gun system  rotating about the hub  provides for the rotation of the muzzle \/bore axis . The underwater gun  can be positioned such that its bore axis  is aligned with the axis of rotation  of the gun system . However, in some situations, it may be desirable to have the bore axis  offset from the axis of rotation . In either case, the gun system  is rotatable about the hub  to a position that points the bore axis  towards an underwater target.","The gun system  can be rotated in its plane of rotation depicted by dashed line . However, to fire at targets out of plane , the underwater weapon system  must be able to rotate itself through the plane  as indicated by two-headed directional arrow . Such a rotation of the underwater weapon system  is made possible by the combination of: (i) wings  and  extending out, respectively, from the housing portions  and , and (ii) movable control surfaces  and  extending out, respectively, from the housing portions. The particular shape, size and number of wings \/ and control surfaces \/ can be varied without departing from the scope of the present invention.","In operation, as the underwater weapon system  moves through the water, the control surfaces \/ and wings \/ cooperate to allow the underwater weapon system  to rotate through plane .","In addition, the shape of the housing portions  and  can be configured to contribute to the maneuverability of the underwater weapon system . For example, each of the housing portions  and  can themselves define wings that are transverse to the wings  and . Furthermore, the housing portions  and  can be formed as mirror-images relative to the plane  so that a hydrodynamically balanced vehicle housing is defined thereby.","With the gun system  able to rotate about the hub  while the underwater weapon system  is able to rotate through the plane , the gun  can engage targets at any spherical position relative to the underwater weapon system.","In terms of the towed embodiment depicted in , a swiveling tow couple  is mounted to underwater weapon system . The tow couple  provides a point of attachment for a tow cable  (e.g., a strength and, if needed, a signal\/power carrying cable) coupled to a host ship (not shown) while simultaneously allowing the underwater weapon system  to freely rotate through the plane . Accordingly, the tow couple  includes a frame  attached partially to each of the housing portions  and , and a swivel  rotatably coupled to the frame  by coupling means such as a pin . The swivel  is aligned such that its axis of rotation is coincident with the plane .","While the wings  and  contribute to the hydrodynamic maneuverability of the underwater weapon system , the wings can also be configured to provide support platforms for sensors used by targeting and\/or combat systems that can be included onboard the underwater weapon system. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, each of the wings  and  can be V-shaped with: (i) forward-facing surfaces A\/A disposed at a substantially forward facing angle relative to the plane , and (ii) rearward-facing surfaces B\/B disposed at a substantially rearward facing angle relative to the plane . Active or passive sonar arrays (not shown in  for clarity of illustration) can be placed on each of the surfaces A\/B and A\/B, respectively, thereby forming forward and aft looking sonar on both sides of the underwater weapon system .","Referring now to  for the operation of the underwater weapon system , the outputs from sonar arrays  and  (mounted on surfaces A, B, A and B) are supplied to an on-board processor  for target identification and localization. Such processing is well understood in the art and will, therefore, not be addressed further herein.","Once a target has been identified\/localized, the processor  sends control signals to the movable control surfaces  and . In this way, the housing portions  and  can rotate through the plane  to a desired position as they are towed through the water. At the same time, the processor  sends control signals to the motorized hub  in order to rotate it about the axis  until the muzzle \/bore axis  achieves a desired aim point. Once the gun  is aimed, the magazine A and feed system B of the ammunition  supply underwater projectiles to the gun .","As mentioned above, the present invention is not limited to use as a towable vehicle. Accordingly,  illustrates another embodiment of the present invention in which propulsors  are coupled to each of the vehicle housing portions  and . The number of propulsors used and their positioning relative to the vehicle housing portions  and  are not limitations of the present invention. It is noted that the tow couple  () can be eliminated in this embodiment of the present invention.","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. The underwater weapon system integrates a continuously-deployed underwater gun into a towable or self-propelled platform that can be maneuvered such that the gun can be aimed at any target in a spherical region about the gun. This provides a host ship with \u201con demand\u201d protection without impacting the host ship's hydrodynamics.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1 and a"],"b":["1","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
