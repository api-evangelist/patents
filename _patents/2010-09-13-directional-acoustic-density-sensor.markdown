title: Directional acoustic density sensor
abstract: The invention as disclosed is a fiber optic interferometric directional acoustic density sensor that increases the directionality of a vector sensor that is much smaller in size than the wave length of an acoustic wave. This is accomplished through the use of second order directionality by measuring the acoustic fluctuations of fluid density at a point, wherein the acoustic density fluctuations are determined according to the principles of fluid compressibility and conservation of mass using a density fluctuation measuring apparatus that restricts two of the three vector components of the particle velocity of the acoustic wave and that employs a laser interferometer to measure the fluid density fluctuation along the remaining vector component.

In particular, the present invention is directed to increasing the directionality of a sensor having a size much less than the wave length of an acoustic wave, by measuring the acoustic fluctuations of fluid density at a point.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Conventional vector sensors measure particle velocity, v (v, v, v), associated with an acoustic wave. The measurements of a vector quantity (velocity) instead of a scalar quantity (pressure) allows for directional sensing even if the size of the vector sensor is much smaller than the size of the wavelength of the acoustic wave. The directionality pattern of a vector sensor is proportional to cos(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the directional angle of the vector sensor. Vector sensor directionality is equivalent to the dipole-type or first order sensor that is realized by measuring particle velocity at a point, (which is the vector sensor sensing approach for underwater sensors), or by measuring the gradient of the acoustic pressure at two closely spaced (less than the wavelength of an acoustic wave) points as it is commonly done in air acoustics where this type of sensor is called an acoustic intensity probe. The two approaches of obtaining vector sensor directionality as described above are in fact mathematically equivalent according to a linearized equation of momentum conservation as expressed in Eq. (1) below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c1","mn":"0"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"v"},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"t"}]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":["\u25bd","p"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mo":"=","mn":"0"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"0 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c1","mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"v"},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"t"}]}},{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"p"},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"x"}]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"There continues to be a need to increase the directionality of a vector sensor. One approach to further increase the directionality of a vector sensor while still maintaining a sensor size that is much smaller than the wavelength of an acoustic wave, is to utilize a second order or quadruple-type sensor arrangement measuring the diversion of the velocity, div v. This can be accomplished by measuring the components of the velocity, v (v, v, v), at closely spaced points (at least two points) along the corresponding axis yielding the directionality, which is proportional to cos(\u03b8). The benefit of the increased directionality, however, when measured using this approach comes at a cost of the number of vector sensors necessary and at a cost of a reduction in sensitivity. Two vector sensors for each axis (a minimum of six sensors) are required to measure the diversion of the velocity and there is a significant reduction in sensor sensitivity proportional to kd<<1, where k is the wave-number and d is the spacing between the two vector sensors.","A more advantageous means to achieve a second order directionality is to measure the acoustic fluctuations of fluid density at a point rather than directly measuring the diversion of the velocity.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to increase the directionality of a vector sensor having a size much less than the wave length of an acoustic wave.","The above object is accomplished with the present invention through the use of second order directionality by measuring the acoustic fluctuations of fluid density at a point, wherein the acoustic density fluctuations are determined according to the principles of fluid compressibility and conservation of mass using a density fluctuation measuring apparatus that restricts two of the three vector components of the particle velocity of the acoustic wave and that employs a laser interferometer to measure the fluid density fluctuation along the remaining vector component.","Acoustic density fluctuations are determined by fluid compressibility and conservation of mass and are respectively described by the following two linearized equations:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03c1","msub":{"mi":"\u03c1","mn":"0"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"B"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"p"}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}},"mi":"and"},"mo":"\u2062","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":"\u03c1","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"\u03c1"},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"t"}]}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["v","x"]}},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"x"}]}},"mo":["-","-"],"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["v","y"]}},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"y"}]},{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["v","z"]}},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"z"}]}]}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}]}}}},"where \u03c1=\u03c1\u2212\u03c1is the density disturbance due to an acoustic wave and B is the fluid bulk modulus.

In a preferred embodiment there is a measuring cell  (the measuring cell  is rectangular, as previously illustrated in ) with acoustically rigid walls (i.e., the walls do not move or flex in any way due to the incident acoustic wave). Measuring cell  is filled with water or another fluid medium. In an alternative embodiment the measuring cell  has a circular cross-section. Inside of measuring cell  there are two laser beams a and b that originate from the same coherent optical light source . The light from light source  is split with beam splitter  into two perpendicular beams: beam a is along the cell axis x (measuring beam) and beam b, perpendicular to the axis x (reference beam). The in-fluid lengths of both beams are equal. Both beams are collected into one end of separate optical fiber cables  with beam to fiber couplers  at the ends of the cables  that collect the beams. The optical fiber cables  are connected at their other end to a mixing cell  that is equipped with a photodiode . The two laser beams a and b are mixed in a mixing cell . The lengths of fibers  are tuned to create constructive or destructive interference inside the mixing cell . The mixing cell  is joined to a data acquisition and digital processing unit  that is programmable. Because the light index of refraction, n, is highly sensitive to the density fluctuations of the medium, any difference in density fluctuations along beam a (as opposed to beam b) can be detected by the data acquisition and digital processing unit  with high precision.","If the incident acoustic wave travels perpendicular to axis x, that is cos(\u03b8)=0, the density change along both beams a and b will be the same and determined only by the first (scalar) term of Eq. (8). Consequently, there is no difference in the density fluctuations along the beams. This results in zero output of the interferometer. The maximum difference will be achieved if the acoustic wave travels along axis x, that is, cos(\u03b8)=1. In this scenario, the density change along beam a will be twice as high as along beam b. For an arbitrary direction of the incident acoustic wave, the change in density will be proportional to the second term in Eq. (8).","The interferometer apparatus  will measure phase difference, \u0394\u03c6, between the reference beam b and measuring beam
