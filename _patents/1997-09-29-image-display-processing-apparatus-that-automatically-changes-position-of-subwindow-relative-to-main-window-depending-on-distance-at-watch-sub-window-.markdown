Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to an image display processing apparatus, an image display processing method, and an information providing medium and, more particularly, to an image display processing apparatus, an image display processing method, and an information providing medium that allow efficient arrangement of a three-dimensional virtual reality space image and a plurality of windows for displaying accompanying information associated with this space by effective use of a display screen.","2. Description of Related Art","A cyberspace service named Habitat (trademark) is known in the so-called personal computer communications services such as NIFTY-Serve (trademark) of Japan and CompuServe (trademark) of US in which a plurality of users connect their personal computers via modems and public telephone network to the host computers installed at the centers of the services to access them in predetermined protocols. Development of Habitat started in 1985 by Lucas Film of the US, operated by Quantum Link, one of US commercial networks, for about three years. Then, Habitat started its service in NIFTY-Serve as Fujitsu Habitat (trademark) in February 1990. In Habitat, users can send their alter egos called avatars (the incarnation of a god figuring in the Hindu mythology) into a virtual city called Populopolis drawn by two-dimensional graphics to have a chat (namely, a realtime conversation based on text entered and displayed) with each other. For further details of Habitat, refer to the Japanese translation of \u201cCyberspace: First Steps,\u201d Michael Benedikt, ed., 1991, MIT Press Cambridge, Mass., ISBN0-262-02327-X, the translation being published Mar. 20, 1994, by NTT Publishing, ISBN4-87188-265-9C0010, pp. 282-307.","In order to implement the above-mentioned cyberspace system by use of the infrastructure of the Internet through which information can be transferred all over the world, standardization of a three-dimensional graphics description language called VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) is proceeding.","In WWW (World Wide Web) of the Internet, document data can be described in HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and the resultant HTML file can be stored in a WWW server. This HTML file can be transferred on demand by a client terminal and can be displayed by use of the HTML browser of that client terminal.","Like this HTML file, three-dimensional graphics data can be described in VRML and the resultant VRML file can be stored in a WWW server. This VRML file can be transferred on demand by a client terminal and can be displayed by use of the VRML browser of that client terminal.","If, when a user who uses (mainly looks at) a three-dimensional virtual reality space through the above-mentioned VRML browser for example and is moving his or her avatar, meets an avatar of another user, the user can chat with another user.","For example, a chat service called Worlds Chat (trademark) developed by Worlds Inc. of US and made commercially available from April 1995 is used to make chat. This Worlds Chat supports chat in a three-dimensional virtual reality space based on the company's own standard, allowing a user to freely move in a virtual space of a fictitious space station to chat realtime in the form of text with another user in the space station.","In order to move avatars for enjoyment in such a three-dimensional virtual reality space, as many windows as possible must be displayed.","In the ordinary system, however, the display positions of windows are arranged to predetermined positions by a user with a mouse or the like, so that many windows cannot be efficiently displayed in a single limited screen. If a plurality of windows are displayed in such a single limited screen, the displayed windows overlap each other, thereby disabling the user to recognize an image of a window hidden under another.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to efficiently and quickly arrange a plurality of windows in a single screen.","In carrying out the invention and according to one aspect thereof, there are provided an image display processing apparatus described in claim , the image display processing apparatus for displaying in a single display window a main window for displaying main information and a sub window for displaying accompanying information associated with said main information comprising a display position moving means for moving a display position of said sub window to a user-specified position; and an automatic arrangement changing means for automatically changing, if a separated distance of said sub window displayed at a display position moved by said display position moving means to said main window is within a preset predetermined value, arrangement of said sub window to a position adjacent to said main window.","The above-mentioned novel constitution allows efficient arrangement a plurality of windows by effective use of a display screen.","It should be noted that the information providing medium herein denotes not only package media such as a floppy disk and a CD-ROM in which computer programs are stored but also a transmission medium by which a computer program is downloaded via a network such as the Internet for example.","In the following description, an object \u201cavatar\u201d representing user's alter ego can move around inside a virtual reality space, enter in and walk off it. The avatar can change (or update) its states inside a virtual reality space. Therefore, such an object is hereafter referred to as an update object appropriately. On the other hand, an object representative of a building constituting a town in the virtual reality space is used commonly by a plurality of users and does not change in its basic state. Even if the building object changes, it changes autonomously, namely it changes independent of the operations made at client terminals. Such an object commonly used by a plurality of users is appropriately called a basic object hereafter.","This invention will be described in further detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings. The basic idea and concept of a virtual society is described by Hiroaki Kitano, Sony Computer Science Laboratories, as follows in his home page \u201cKitano Virtual Society (V1.0) (http:\/\/www.csl,sony.co.jp\/person\/kita no\/VS\/concept.j.html.1995)\u201d:","\u201cIn the beginning of the 21st century, a virtual society would emerge in a network spanning all the world. People in every part of the world will make a society in which millions or hundred millions of people live in a shared space created in the network. A society that will emerge beyond the current Internet, CATV, and the so-called information super highway is a virtual society that I conceive. In the virtual society, people can not only perform generally the same social activities as those in the real world\u2014enjoy shopping, have a chat, play games, do work, and the like\u2014but also perform things that are possible only in the virtual society (for example, moving from Tokyo to Paris in an instant). Such a \u201csociety\u201d would be implemented only by state-of-the-art technologies such as cyberspace constructing technologies that support a broadband network, high-quality three-dimensional presentation capability and bidirectional communications of voice, music and moving picture signals, and a large-scale distributed system that allows a lot of people to share the constructed space.\u201d","For further details, look at the above mentioned home page.","The three-dimensional virtual reality space that implements the above-mentioned virtual society is a cyberspace system. The actual examples of the infrastructures for constructing this cyberspace system includes, at this point of time, the Internet, which is a world-wide computer network connected by a communications protocol called TCP\/IP (Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) and the intranet implemented by applying the Internet technologies such as WWW (World Wide Web) to the in-house LAN (Local Area Network). Further, use of a broadband communication network based on FTTH (Fiber To The Home) in the future is proposed in which the main line system and the subscriber system are all constituted by fiber optics.","Meanwhile, for an information providing system available on the Internet, WWW developed by CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland is known. This technology allows a user to browse information including text, image and voice for example in the hyper text form. Based on HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), the information stored in a WWW server terminal is sent asynchronously to terminals such as personal computers.","The WWW server is constituted by server software called an HTTP demon and an HTML file in which hyper text information is stored. The hyper text information is described in a description language called HTML (Hyper Text Makeup Language). In the description of a hyper text by HTML, a logical structure of a document is expressed in a format specification called a tag enclosed by \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d. Description of linking to other information is made based in link information called an anchor. A method in which a location at which required information is stored by the anchor is URL (Uniform Resource Locator).","A protocol for transferring a file described in HTML on the TCP\/IP network is HTTP. This protocol has a capability of transferring a request for information from a client to the WWW server and the requested hyper text information stored in the HTML file to the client.","Used by many as an environment for using WWW is client software such as Netscape Navigator (trademark) called a WWW browser.","It should be noted that demon denotes a program for executing control and processing in the background when performing a job in the UNIX environment.","Recently, a language for describing three-dimensional graphics data, called VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) and a VRML viewer for drawing a virtual reality space described in this VRML on a personal computer or a workstation have been developed. VRML allows to extend WWW, set hyper text links to objects drawn by three-dimensional graphics, and follow these links to sequentially access WWW server terminals. The specifications of VRML version 1.0 were made public in May 26, 1995. Then, in Nov. 9, 1995, a revised version in which errors and ambiguous expressions are corrected was made public. The specifications are available from URL=http:\/\/www.vr ml.org\/Specifications\/VRML1.0\/.","Storing three-dimensional information described in the above-mentioned VRML in a WWW server terminal allows the construction of a virtual space expressed in three-dimensional graphics on the Internet. Further, use of the VRML viewer by using personal computers and the like interconnected by the Internet can implement the display of a virtual space based on three-dimensional graphics and the walk-through capability.","In what follows, examples in which the Internet is used for a network will be described. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that FTTH may be used instead of the Internet to implement the virtual space.","It should be noted that Cyberspace is a coinage by William Gibson, a US science fiction writer, and was used in his \u201cNeuromancer\u201d (1984) that made him famous. Strictly speaking, however, the word Cyberspace first appeared in his \u201cBurning Chrome\u201d (1982). In these novels, there are scenes in which the hero attaches a special electrode on his forehead to connect himself to a computer to directly reflect on his brain a virtual three-dimensional space obtained by visually reconfiguring data on a computer network spanning all over the world. This virtual three-dimensional space was called Cyberspace. Recently, the term has come to be used as denoting a system in which a virtual three-dimensional space is used by a plurality of users via a network.","Now, referring to , there is shown an example of a constitution of a cyberspace (a three-dimensional virtual reality space provided via a network) system according to the present invention. As shown, in this preferred embodiment, host computers (or simply hosts) A through C, a plurality (three in this case) of client terminals - through -, and any number (one in this case) of service provider terminal  are interconnected via a world-wide network  (a global communication network sometimes referred to as an information transmission medium herein) like the Internet  by way of example.","The host A constitutes a system of so-called WWW (World Wide Web) for example. Namely, the host A has information (or a file) to be described later. And, each piece of information (or each file) is related with a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) for uniformly specify that information. Specifying a URL allows access to the information corresponding to it.","To be more specific, the host A stores three-dimensional image data for providing three-dimensional virtual reality spaces (hereinafter appropriately referred to simply as virtual reality spaces) such as virtual streets in Tokyo, New York, and other locations for example. It should be noted that these three-dimensional image data do not change in their basic state; that is, these data include static data consisting of only basic objects such as a building and a road to be shared by a plurality of users. If the basic state changes, it only reflects an autonomous change in the state of a merry-go-round or a neon light. The static data are considered to be data that are not subject to update. The host A has an information server terminal  (a basic server terminal). The information server terminal  is adapted, when it receives a URL via the network , to provide the information corresponding to the received URL, namely a corresponding virtual reality space (in this case, a space consisting of only basic objects).","It should be noted that, in , there is only one host, namely the host A, which has an information server terminal for providing the virtual reality space (consisting of only basic objects) of a specific area. It is apparent that such a host may be installed in plural.","The host B has a shared server terminal . The shared server terminal  controls update objects that constitute a virtual reality space when put in it. The update objects are avatars for example representing users of the client terminals. Thus, the shared server terminal  allows a plurality of users to share the same virtual reality space. It should be noted, however, that the host B controls only the update objects located in a virtual reality space for only a specific area (for example, Tokyo) of the virtual reality spaces controlled by the host A. That is, the host B is dedicated to the virtual reality space of a specific area. Also, it should be noted that the network  is connected with, in addition to the host B, a host, not shown, having a shared server terminal for controlling update objects located in virtual reality spaces of other areas such as New York and London, stored in the host A.","The host C, like the host A, constitutes a WWW system for example and stores data including IP (Internet Protocol) addresses for addressing hosts (shared server terminals) that control update objects like the host B. Therefore, the shared server terminal addresses stored in the host C are uniformly related with URLs as with the case of the host A as mentioned above. In addition, the host C has a mapping server terminal  (a control server terminal). Receiving a URL via the network , the mapping server terminal  provides the IP address of the shared server terminal corresponding to the received URL via the network . It should be noted that  shows only one host, namely the host C, which has the mapping server terminal  for providing shared server terminal addresses. It will be apparent that the host C can be installed in plural.","The client terminal  (-, - or -) receives a virtual reality space from the information server terminal  via the network  to share the received virtual reality space with other client terminals (including the service provider terminal ), under the control of the shared server terminal . Further, the client terminal  is also adapted to receive specific services (information) using the virtual reality space from the service provider terminal .","The service provider terminal , like the client terminal , receives a virtual reality space to share the same with the client terminal  (if there is another service provider terminal, it also shares this space). Therefore, as far as the capability of this portion is concerned, the service provider terminal  is the same as the client terminal .","Further, the service provider terminal  is adapted to provide specific services to the client terminal . It should be noted that  shows only one service provider terminal . It will be apparent that the service provider terminal may be installed in plural.","The following briefly describes a WWW system constituted by the host A and the host C. Referring to , WWW is one of the systems for providing information from hosts X, Y, and Z to unspecified users (client terminals) via the network  (the Internet in the case of WWW). The information that can be provided in this system include not only texts but also graphics, images (including still images and moving pictures), voices, three-dimensional images and hypertext which combines all these types of information.","In WWW, a URL, or a form for uniformly represent these pieces of information is determined. Specifying a specific URL, each user can obtain the information corresponding to the specified URL. As shown in , each URL is composed of a protocol type for representing a service type (http in the preferred embodiment of , which is equivalent to a command for retrieving a file corresponding to a file name to be described later and send the retrieved file), a host name indicating a destination of the URL (in the embodiment of , www.csl.sony.co.jp), and a file name of data to be sent (in the embodiment of , index.html) for example.","Each user operates the client terminal to enter a URL for desired information. When the URL is entered, the client terminal references a host name, for example, contained in the URL. A link with a host (in the embodiment of , the host X for example connected to the Internet) addressed by the host name is established. Then, at the client terminal, the URL is sent to the linked host, namely the host X, via the Internet, requesting the host X for sending the information specified in the URL. In the host X, an HTTP demon (httpd) is operating on the information server terminal (the WWW server terminal). Receiving the URL, the information server terminal sends back the information specified in the URL to the client terminal via the Internet.","The client terminal receives the information from the information server terminal to display the received information on its monitor as required. Thus, the user can get the desired information.","Therefore, only storing in the host such data for describing elements (objects) for constituting a virtual reality space as shapes of basic objects (for example, a rectangular prism and a cone) and locations and attributes (color and texture for example) of these basic objects allows to provide the virtual reality space (consisting of only basic objects in this case) to unspecified users. Namely, as long as the Internet is used for the network  and www is used, virtual reality spaces can be provided to unspecified users world-wide with ease and at a low cost because the Internet itself already spans almost all over the world and the description of the elements constituting each virtual reality space to be stored in hosts does not require to make changes to information servers (WWW server terminals) constituting WWW. It should be noted that the service for providing the description of the elements constituting a virtual reality space is upward compatible with existing services provided by WWW.","Storing in a specific host (a mapping server terminal) the IP addresses of other hosts as information also allows to provide the host IP addresses to unspecified users world-wide with ease.","It should be noted that it is difficult for a plurality of users to share the same virtual reality space if only the description (the data of three-dimensional image for providing the virtual reality space of a specific area) of elements constituting the virtual reality space is stored in a host constituting WWW. Namely, in WWW, the information corresponding to a URL is only provided to a user and therefore no control for information transfer is performed. Hence, it is difficult to transfer between users the above-mentioned change information of update objects by using www without changing its design. Therefore, in the cyberspace system of , the host B having the shared server terminal  and the host C having the mapping server  are installed to allow a plurality of users to share the same virtual reality space, details of which will be described later.","Next,  shows an example of the constitution of the information server terminal  that operates on the host A of FIG. . As shown in , the information server terminal  has a CPU  which performs a variety of processing operations according to a program stored in a ROM . In the information server , the above-mentioned HTTP demon is operating in the background. A RAM  stores data and program necessary for the CPU  to perform the variety of processing operations. A communication device  is adapted to transfer specific data with the network . A storage device  composed of a hard disc, an optical disc, and magneto-optical disc stores the data of the three-dimensional images for providing a virtual reality space of a specific area such as Tokyo or New York for example along with URLs as mentioned above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["11","1","21","22","23","21","24","15"]},"A display device  has a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) or an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) for example and is connected to interface  to monitor images of the virtual reality space (composed of not only basic objects but also update objects) of an area controlled by the shared server terminal . The interface  is also connected with a microphone  and a loudspeaker  to supply a specific voice signal to the client terminal  and the service provider terminal  and monitor a voice signal coming from these terminals.","The shared server terminal  has an input device  on which a variety of input operations are performed via the interface . This input device has at least a keyboard and a mouse ","A storage device  composed of a hard disc, an optical disc, and a magneto-optical disc stores data of the virtual reality space of an area controlled by the shared server terminal . It should be noted that the data of the virtual reality space are the same as those stored in the storage device  of the information server terminal  (of FIG. ).

A microphone  is used to output a voice signal to the shared server terminal . A loudspeaker  outputs the voice signal coming from the shared server terminal . An input device  is operated to perform a variety of input operations.","A keyboard of the input device  is operated when entering text (including an URL) composed of specific characters and symbols. A mouse is operated when entering specific positional information. A viewpoint input device and a movement input device are operated when changing the state of the avatar as an update object of the client terminal . That is, the viewpoint input device is used to enter the viewpoint of the avatar of the client terminal , thereby moving the viewpoint of the avatar vertically, horizontally or in the depth direction. The movement input device is used to move the avatar in the forward and backward direction or the right and left direction at a specific velocity. It is apparent that the operations done through the viewpoint and movement input devices may also be done through the above-mentioned keyboard and the mouse ","A storage device  composed of a hard disc, an optical disc, and magneto-optical disc stores avatars (update objects) representing users. Further, the storage device  stores a URL (hereinafter appropriately referred to as an address acquisition URL) for acquiring an IP address of a shared server terminal for managing update objects to be located in the virtual reality space of each area stored in the information server terminal  (if there is an information server terminal other than the information server terminal , that information server terminal is included). The address acquisition URL is stored as associated with a URL (hereinafter appropriately referred to as a virtual reality space URL) corresponding to the data of the virtual reality space of that area. This setup allows to obtain the address acquisition URL for acquiring the IP address of the shared server terminal for controlling the virtual reality space of that area when the virtual reality space URL for the data of the virtual reality space for that area has been entered.","Interface  constitutes the data interface with a display device , a microphone , a loudspeaker , an input device , and the storage device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["14","1","51","60","41","50","51","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["10","1","11","13","1","13","2"]},"Avatar C sees an image as shown in  for example from the position and viewpoint in the virtual reality space. Namely, data associated with the basic objects constituting the virtual reality space are provided to the client terminal - from the information server terminal  to be stored in a RAM  (or a storage device ). Then, from the RAM  (or the storage device ), data are read out of a virtual reality space that can be seen when the same is seen from specific viewpoint and position and the read data are supplied to the display device . Then, when the viewpoint and position of avatar C are changed by operating a viewpoint input device and a movement input device , data corresponding the change are read from the RAM  (or the storage device ) to be supplied to the display device , thereby changing the virtual reality space (the three-dimensional image) being displayed on the display device .","Further, data associated with another user's avatar (an update object) (avatar D of ) that can be seen when the virtual reality space is seen from the current viewpoint and position are supplied to the client terminal - from the shared server terminal . Based on the supplied data, the display on the display device  is changed. Namely, in the state of , since avatar C is looking in the direction of avatar D, avatar D is displayed in the image (the virtual reality space) displayed on the display device  of the client terminal - as shown in FIG. .","Likewise, an image as shown in  is displayed on the display device  of the client terminal - to which avatar D corresponds. This displayed image is also changed by moving the viewpoint and position of avatar D. It should be noted that, in , avatar D is looking in the direction of avatar C, so that avatar C is displayed in the image (the virtual reality space) on the display device  of the client terminal - as shown in FIG. .","The service provider terminal  controls a part of the sharable virtual reality space provided by the information server terminal  and the shared server terminal . In other words, the service provider purchases a part of the virtual reality space from administrators (information providers who provide information of the virtual reality space) of the information server terminal  and the shared terminal . This purchase is performed in the real space. Namely, upon request by a specific service provider for the purchase of the virtual reality space, the administrators of the information server terminal  and the shared server terminal  allocate a part of the requested virtual reality space to that specific service provider.","For example, assume that the owner (service provider) of the service provider terminal  lease a room in a specific building in the virtual reality space and use the room as a shop for electric appliances. The service provider provides information about commodities, for example televisions, to be sold in the shop. Based on the information, the server terminal administrator creates three-dimensional images of the televisions by computer graphics and place the created images at specific positions in the shop. Thus, the images to be placed in the virtual reality space have been completed.","Similar operations are performed by other service providers to form the virtual reality space as a big town for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["14","72","73","71","14","71","59","14"],"i":"d "},"Now, assume that avatar C of the client terminal - has come in this electric appliances shop as shown in FIG. . At this moment, an image as shown in  for example is displayed on the display device  of the client terminal -, in correspondence to the position and viewpoint of avatar C. If avatar F is located behind the service counter , an image as shown in  is displayed on a display device  of the service provider terminal . As shown in , the image viewed from avatar C shows avatar F, while the image viewed from avatar F shows avatar C.","As shown in , the image viewed from avatar C shows a cursor  to be used when a specific image is specified from the client terminal -. Likewise, as shown in , a cursor  is shown for the service provider terminal  to specify a specific image.","Moving avatar C around the television  or  by operating the movement input device of the client terminal - displays on the display device  the image corresponding to avatar C's moved position and viewpoint. This allows the user to take a close look at the televisions as if they were exhibited in a shop of the real world.","Also, when the user moves the cursor  by operating a mouse and then click on avatar F, a conversation request signal is transmitted to the service provider terminal  corresponding to avatar F. Receiving the conversation request signal, the service provider terminal  can output, via a microphone , a voice signal to a loudspeaker  of the client terminal - corresponding to avatar C. Likewise, entering a specific voice signal from a microphone  of the client terminal - can transmit user's voice signal to a speaker  of the service provider terminal . Thus, the user and service provider can make conversation in a usual manner.","It is apparent that the conversation can be requested from avatar F (the service provider terminal ) to avatar C (the client terminal -).","When the cursor  is moved on the client terminal - and the image of the television  for example is clicked, the information (the provided information) describing the television  is provided in more detail. This can be implemented by linking the data of the virtual reality space provided by the information server terminal  with the description information about the television. It is apparent that the image for displaying the description information may be either three-dimensional or two-dimensional.","The specification of desired images can be performed also from the service provider terminal . This capability allows the service provider to offer the description information to the user in a more active manner.","If the service provider specifies avatar C with the cursor  by operating the mouse , the image corresponding to the position and viewpoint of avatar C, namely, the same image as displayed on the display device  of the client terminal - can be displayed on the display device  of the service provider terminal . This allows the service provider to know where the user (namely avatar C) is looking at and therefore promptly offer information needed by the user.","The user gets explanations about the products, or gets the provided information or description information. If the user wants to buy the television  for example, he can buy the same actually. In this case, the user requests the service provider terminal  for the purchase via avatar F. At the same time, the user transmits his credit card number for example to the service provider terminal  (avatar F) via avatar C. Then, the user asks the service provider terminal for drawing an amount equivalent to the price of the television purchased. The service provider of the service provider terminal  performs processing for the drawing based on the credit card number and make preparations for the delivery of the purchased product.","The images provided in the above-mentioned virtual reality space are basically precision images created by computer graphics. Therefore, looking at these images from every angle allows the user to make observation of products almost equivalent to the observation in the real world, thereby providing surer confirmation of products.","Thus, the virtual reality space contains a lot of shops, movie houses and theaters for example. Because products can be actually purchased in the shops, spaces installed at favorable locations create actual economic values. Therefore, such favorable spaces themselves can be actually (namely, in the real world) purchased or leased. This provides complete distinction from the so-called television shopping system ordinarily practiced.","The following describes the operations of the client terminal  (or the service provider terminal ), the information server terminal , the mapping server terminal , and the shared server terminal  with reference to the flowcharts of .","Now, referring to , there is shown an example of processing by the client terminal  (or the service provider terminal ). In step S, the CPU  checks whether a virtual reality space URL has been entered or not. If no virtual reality space URL has been found, the processing remains in step S. If a virtual reality space URL has been found in step S, namely, if a virtual reality space URL corresponding to a desired virtual reality space entered by the user by operating the keyboard has been received by the CPU  via interface , the process goes to step S. In step S, a WWW system is constituted as described with reference to FIG.  and the virtual reality space URL is transmitted from the communication device  via the network  to the information server terminal of a specific host (in this case, the information server terminal  of the host A for example) that has the information server terminal, thereby establishing a link.","Further, in step S, an address acquisition URL related to the virtual reality space URL is read from the storage device  to be transmitted from the communication device  via the network  to the mapping server terminal of a specific host (in this case, mapping server terminal  of the host C for example) that constitutes the WWW system, thereby establishing a link.","Then, the process goes to step S. In step S, data (three-dimensional image data) of the virtual reality space or the IP address of the shared server terminal  corresponding to the virtual reality space URL received in step S or the address acquisition URL is received by the communication device .","Namely, in step S, the virtual reality space URL is transmitted to the information server terminal . When this virtual reality space URL is received by the information server terminal , the data of the corresponding virtual reality space are transmitted to the client terminal  via the network  in step S of  to be described. Thus, in step S, the data of the virtual reality space transmitted from the information server terminal  are received. It should be noted that the received virtual reality space data are transferred to the RAM  to be stored there (or first stored in the storage device  to be transferred to the RAM ).","Also, in step S, the address acquisition URL is transmitted to the mapping server terminal . When the address acquisition URL is received by the mapping server terminal , the IP address of the shared server terminal corresponding to the URL is transmitted to the client terminal  via the network  in step S of  to be described. Thus, in step S, the IP address of the shared server terminal  transmitted from the mapping server  is received.","As described above, the address acquisition URL related to the entered virtual reality space URL corresponds to the IP address of the shared server terminal that controls the update object placed in the virtual reality space corresponding to that virtual reality space URL. Therefore, for example, if the entered virtual reality space URL: corresponds to a virtual reality space of Tokyo and the shared server terminal  owned by the host B controls the update objects placed in the Tokyo virtual reality space, the IP address of the shared server terminal  is received in step S. Consequently, the user can automatically get the location (the IP address) of the shared server terminal that controls the virtual reality space of a desired area even if the user does not know which shared server terminal controls the update objects in a virtual reality space in which area.","It should be noted that, in steps S and S, the processing of transmitting the virtual reality space URL and the address acquisition URL and receiving the virtual reality space data and the IP address is actually performed by transmitting the virtual reality space URL, receiving the data of the corresponding virtual reality space, transmitting the address acquisition URL, and then receiving the corresponding IP address in this order by way of example.","When the virtual reality space data and the shared server terminal IP address are received in step S, the process goes to step S. In step S, a connection request is transmitted from the communication device  via the network  to the shared server terminal (in this case, the shared server terminal  for example) corresponding to the IP address (the shared server terminal IP address) received in step S. This establishes a link between the client terminal  and the shared server terminal . Further, in step S, after the establishment of the link, the avatar (namely, the update object) representing oneself stored in the storage device  is transmitted from the communication device  to the shared server terminal .","When the shared server terminal  receives the user's avatar, the same is then transmitted to the client terminals of other users existing in the same virtual reality space (in this case, that of Tokyo as mentioned above). Then, on the client terminals of other users, the transmitted avatar is placed in the virtual reality space, thus implementing the sharing of the same virtual reality space among a plurality of users.","It should be noted that, rather than providing the user's avatar from the client terminal  to the shared server terminal , a predetermined avatar may also be allocated from the shared server terminal  to each user who accessed the same. Also, in the client terminal , the avatar of the user himself who uses this terminal can be placed and displayed in the virtual reality space, however, the user cannot see himself in the real world, so that it is desirable for the user's avatar not be displayed on that user's client terminal in order to make the virtual reality space as real as possible.","When the processing of step S has been completed, the process goes to step S. In step S, the data of the virtual reality space that can be seen when the same is seen from specific viewpoint and position are read from the RAM  by the CPU  to be supplied to the display device . Thus, the specific virtual reality space is shown on the display device .","Then, in step S, the communication device  determines whether update information of another user's avatar has been sent from the shared server terminal .","As described above, the user can update the position or viewpoint of his own avatar by operating the viewpoint input device or the movement input device . If the update of the position or viewpoint of the avatar is instructed by using this capability, the CPU  receives the instruction via the interface . According to the instruction, the CPU  performs processing for outputting positional data or viewpoint data corresponding to the updated position or viewpoint as update information to the shared server terminal . In other words, the CPU  controls the communication device  to transmit the update information to the shared server terminal .","Receiving the update information from the client terminal, the shared server terminal  outputs the update information to other client terminals in step S of  to be described. It should be noted the shared server terminal  is adapted to transmit the avatar received from the client terminal that requested for access to client terminals of other users, this avatar being transmitted also as update information.","When the update information has come as mentioned above, it is determined in step S that update information of the avatar of another user has come from the shared server terminal . In this case, this update information is received by the communication device  to be outputted to the CPU . The CPU  updates the display on the display device  according to the update information in step S. That is, if the CPU  receives the positional data or viewpoint data from another client terminal as update information, the CPU  moves or changes (for example, the orientation of the avatar) the avatar of that user according to the received positional data or viewpoint data. In addition, if the CPU  receives the avatar from another client terminal, the CPU  places the received avatar in the currently displayed virtual reality space at a specific position. It should be noted that, when the shared server terminal  transmits an avatar as update information, the shared server terminal also transmits the positional data and viewpoint data of the avatar along with the update information. The avatar is displayed on the display device  according to these positional data and viewpoint data.","When the above-mentioned processing has come to an end, the process goes to step S.","Meanwhile, if, in step S, no update information of the avatar of another user has come from the shared server terminal , the process goes to step S, skipping step S. In step S, the CPU  determines whether the position or viewpoint of the avatar of the user of the client terminal  has been updated or not by operating the viewpoint input device or the movement input device ","In step S, if the CPU  determines that the avatar position or viewpoint has been updated, namely, if the viewpoint input device or the movement input device has been operated by the user, the process goes to step S. In step S, the CPU  reads data of the virtual reality space corresponding to the position and viewpoint of the avatar of the user based on the entered positional data and viewpoint data, makes calculations for correction as required, and generates the image data corresponding to the correct position and viewpoint. Then, the CPU  outputs the generated image data to the display device . Thus, the image (virtual reality space) corresponding to the viewpoint and position entered from the viewpoint input device and the movement input device is displayed on the display device .","Further, in step S, the CPU  controls the communication device  to transmit the viewpoint data or the positional data entered from the viewpoint input device or the movement input device to the shared server terminal , upon which process goes to step S.","Here, as described above, the update information coming from the client terminal  is received by the shared server terminal  to be outputted to other client terminals. Thus, the avatar of the user of the client terminal  is displayed on the other client terminals.","On the other hand, in step S, if CPU  determines that the avatar's position or viewpoint has not been updated, the process goes to step S by skipping steps S and S. In step S, the CPU  determines whether the end of the update data input operation has been instructed by operating a predetermined key on the keyboard; if the end has not been instructed, the process goes back to step S to repeat the processing.","Referring to the flowchart of , there is shown an example of the processing by the information server terminal . First, the communication device  determines in step S , whether a virtual reality space URL has come from the client terminal  via the network . If, in step S , the communication device  determines that no virtual reality space URL has come, the process goes back to step S. If the virtual reality space URL has come, the same is received by the communication device , upon which the process goes to step S. In step S, the data of the virtual reality space related to the virtual reality space URL received by the communication device  are read by the CPU  to be transmitted via the network  to the client terminal  that transmitted the virtual reality space URL. Then, the process goes back to step S to repeat the above-mentioned processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0133"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["12","12","94","31","13","15","31","94","32","32","94","95","91","15","13","31"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0134"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 15"],"b":["11","11","24","41","13","15","43","42","13","11","4","13","24","42"]},"In step S, a connection control table stored in the RAM  is updated by the CPU . Namely, it is necessary for the shared server terminal  to recognize the client terminal  with which the shared server terminal  is linked, in order to transmit update information coming from the client terminal  to other client terminals. To do so, when the communication link with client terminals has been established, the shared server terminal  registers the information for identifying the linked client terminals in the connection control table. That is, the connection control table provides a list of the client terminals currently linked to the shared server terminal . The information for identifying the client terminals include the source IP address transmitted from each client terminal as the header of TCP\/IP packet and a nickname of the avatar set by the user of each client terminal.","Then, the process goes to step S, in which the communication device  determines whether the update information has come from the client terminal . If, in step S, no update information has been found, the process goes to step S by skipping step S. If the update information has been found, namely, if the client terminal  has transmitted, in step S of , positional data and viewpoint data as the update information to the shared server terminal  (or, in step S of , the client terminal  has transmitted the avatar as the update information to the shared server terminal  after transmission of the connection request), the update information is received by the communication device , upon which the process goes to step S. In step S, the CPU  references the connection control table stored in the RAM  to transmit the update information received by the communication device  to other client terminals than the client terminal which transmitted that update information. At this moment, the source IP address of each client terminal controlled by the connection control table is used.","It should be noted that the above-mentioned update information is received by the client terminal  in step S of  as described above.","Then, the process goes to step S, in which the CPU  determines whether the end of processing has been instructed by the client terminal . If the end of processing has not been instructed, the process goes back to S by skipping step S. If the end of processing has been instructed, the process goes to step S. In step S, the link with the client terminal  from which the instruction has come is disconnected by the communication device . Further, from the connection control table, the information associated with the client terminal  is deleted by the CPU , upon which the process goes back to step S.","Thus, the control of the update objects is performed by the shared server terminal  and the control (or provision) of the basic objects is performed by the information server terminal  constituting the WWW of the Internet used world-wide, thereby easily providing virtual reality spaces that can be shared by unspecified users world-wide. It should be noted that the specifications of the existing www system need not be modified to achieve the above-mentioned objective.","Provision of the virtual reality space data by use of the WWW system need not create any new web browser because the transfer of these data can be made using related art web browsers such as the Netscape Navigator (trademark) offered by Netscape Communications, Inc. for example.","Moreover, because the IP address of the shared server terminal  is provided by the mapping server terminal , the user can share a virtual reality space with other users without knowing the address of the shared server terminal.","In what follows, a procedure of communications between the client terminal , the information server terminal , the shared server terminal , and the mapping server terminal  will be described with reference to FIG. . When the user desires to get a virtual reality space, the user enters the URL (the virtual reality space URL) corresponding to the virtual reality space of the desired area. Then, the entered URL is transmitted from the client terminal  to the information server terminal  (httpd). Receiving the URL from the client terminal , the information server terminal  transmits the data (three-dimensional scene data representing only basic objects) of the virtual reality space associated with the URL to the client terminal . The client terminal  receives and display these data.","It should be noted that, at this stage of processing, no link is established between the client terminal  and the shared server terminal , so that the client terminal  does not receive update information; therefore, a virtual reality space composed of only basic objects, namely a virtual reality space shown only a still street for example, is shown (that is, no update objects such as avatars of other users are displayed).","Further, the address acquisition URL related to the virtual reality space URL is transmitted from the client terminal  to the mapping server terminal . The mapping server terminal  receives the address acquisition URL to transmit the IP address (the IP address of a shared server terminal controlling update objects located in the virtual reality space of the area related to the virtual reality space URL, for example, the shared server terminal ) related to the received address acquisition URL to the client terminal .","Here, it is possible that the IP address related to the address acquisition URL transmitted by the client terminal  is not registered in the mapping server terminal . Namely, a shared server terminal for controlling the update objects located in the virtual reality space of the area related to the virtual reality space URL may not be installed or operating for example. In such a case, the IP address of the shared server terminal cannot be obtained, so that a virtual reality space composed of only basic objects, a virtual reality space showing only a still street for example, is displayed. Therefore, in this case, sharing of a virtual reality space with other users is not established. Such a virtual reality space can be provided only by storing the virtual reality space data (namely, basic objects) in an information server terminal (a WWW server terminal) by the existing www system. This denotes that the cyberspace system according to the present invention is upward compatible with the existing WWW system.","Receiving the IP address (the IP address of the shared server terminal ) from the mapping server terminal , the client terminal  transmits a connection request to a shared server terminal corresponding to the IP address, namely the shared server terminal  in this case. Then, when a communication link is established between the client terminal  and the shared server terminal , the client terminal  transmits the avatar (the three-dimensional representation of the user) representing itself to the shared server terminal . Receiving the avatar from the client terminal , the shared server terminal  transmits the received avatar to the other client terminals linked to the shared server terminal . At the same time, the shared server terminal  transmits the update objects (shapes of shared three-dimensional objects), the other users' avatars, located in the virtual reality space of the area controlled by the shared server terminal , to the client terminal .","In the other client terminals, the avatar of the user of the client terminal  is placed in the virtual reality space to appear on the monitor screens of the other client terminals. In the client terminal , the avatars of the other client terminals are placed in the virtual reality space to appear on its monitor screen. As a result, all the users of the client terminals linked to the shared server terminal  share the same virtual reality space.","Then, when the shared server terminal  receives the update information from other client terminals, transmits the received update information to the client terminal . Receiving the update information, the client terminal  changes the display (for example, the position of the avatar of another user is changed). When the state of the avatar of the user of the client terminal  is changed by that user, the update information reflecting that change is transmitted from the client terminal  to the shared server terminal . Receiving this update information, the shared server terminal  transmits the same to the client terminals other than the client terminal . Thus, on these other client terminals, the state of the avatar of the user of the client terminal  is changed accordingly (namely, the state of the avatar is changed as the same has been changed by the user of the client terminal  on the same).","Subsequently, the processing in which the client terminal  transmits the update information about the avatar of its own and receives the update information from the shared server terminal  to change the display based on the received update information continues until the connection with the shared server terminal  is disconnected.","Thus, the sharing of the same virtual reality space is established by transferring the update information via the shared server terminal  among the users. Therefore, if the shared server terminal  and the client terminal  are located remotely, there occurs a delay in the communication between these terminals, deteriorating the response in the communication. To be more specific, if the shared server terminal  is located in US for example and users in Japan are accessing the same, update information of user A in Japan is transmitted to user B in Japan via US, thereby taking time until a change made by user A is reflected in user B.","To overcome such a problem, rather than installing only one shared server terminal in the world, a plurality of shared server terminals are installed all over the world. And the IP addresses of the plurality of shared server terminals are registered in the mapping server terminal  to make the same provide the IP address of the shared server terminal in the geographical proximity to the client terminal .","To be more specific, as shown in , shared server terminals W and W for controlling the update objects placed in a virtual reality space (a three-dimensional space) such as an amusement park are installed in Japan and US respectively by way of example When the users in Japan and US have received the data of the amusement park's virtual reality space, each user transmits an address acquisition URL related to a virtual reality space URL corresponding to the amusement park's virtual reality space to the mapping server terminal  (the same address acquisition URL is transmitted from all users). At this moment, the users in Japan transmit the IP address of the shared server terminal W installed in Japan to the mapping server terminal , while the users in US transmit the IP address of the shared server terminal W installed in US to the mapping server terminal .","Here, the mapping server terminal  identifies the installation locations of the client terminals that transmitted the address acquisition URLs to the mapping server terminal in the following procedure.","In the communication in TCP\/IP protocol, a source IP address and a destination IP address are described in the header of a TCP\/IP packet.","An IP address is made up of 32 bits and normally expressed in a decimal notation delimited by dots in units of eight bits. For example, an IP is expressed in 43.0.35.117. This IP address provides an address which uniquely identifies a source or destination terminal connected to the Internet. Because an IP address expressed in four octets (32 bits) is difficult to remember, a domain name is used. The domain name system (DNS) is provided to control the relationship between the domain names assigned to the terminals all over the world and their IP addresses. The DNS answers a domain name for a corresponding IP address and vice versa. The DNS functions based on the cooperation of the domain name servers installed all over the world. A domain name is expressed in \u201chanaya@ip d.sony.co.jp\u201d for example, which denotes a user name, @, a host name, an organization name, an organization attribute, and country name (in the case of US, the country name is omitted) in this order. If the country name of the first layer is \u201cjp\u201d, that terminal is located in Japan. If there is no country name, that terminal is located in US.","Using a domain name server  as shown , the mapping server terminal  identifies the installation location of the client terminal that transmitted the address acquisition URL to the mapping server terminal.","To be more specific, the mapping server terminal asks the domain name server  controlling the table listing the relationship between the source IP addresses of the requesting client terminal and the domain names assigned with the IP addresses for the corresponding domain name. Then, the mapping server terminal identifies the country in which a specific client terminal is installed based on the first layer of the domain name of the client terminal obtained from the domain name server .","In this case, since the client terminal used by each user and its shared server terminal are located in geographical proximity to each other, the above-mentioned problem of a delay, or the deterioration of response time is solved.","In this case, the virtual reality space provided to the users in Japan and US is the same amusement park's virtual reality space as mentioned above. However, since the shared server terminals that control the sharing are located in both countries, the sharing by the users in Japan is made independently of the sharing by the users in US. Namely, the same virtual reality space is shared among the users in Japan and shared among the users in US. Therefore, in this case, the same virtual reality space is provided from the information server terminal , but separate shared spaces are constructed among the users in both countries, thereby enabling the users to make a chat in their respective languages.","However, it is possible for the users of both countries to share the same virtual reality space by making connection between the shared server terminals W and W to transfer update information between them.","The deterioration of response also occurs when the excess number of users access the shared server terminal . This problem can be overcome by installing a plurality of shared server terminals for controlling the update objects placed in the virtual reality space in the same area in units of specific areas, for example, countries or prefectures and making the mapping server terminal  provide the addresses of those shared server terminals which are accessed less frequently.","To be more specific, a plurality of shared server terminals W, W, W, and so on are installed and the mapping server terminal  is made to provide the IP address of the specific shared server terminal W for example for specific URLs. Further, in this case, communication is performed between the mapping server terminal  and the shared server terminal W for example to make the shared server terminal W transmit the number of client terminals accessing the shared server terminal W to the mapping server terminal . Then, when the number of client terminals accessing the shared server terminal W has exceeded a predetermined level (100 terminals for example, which do not deteriorate the response of the shared server terminal W) and if the mapping server terminal  has received another URL, the mapping server terminal  provides the IP address of another shared server terminal W for example (it is desired that the W be located in the proximity to the shared server terminal W).","It should be noted that, in this case, the shared server terminal W may be put in the active state in advance; however, it is also possible to start the shared server W when the number of client terminals accessing the shared server W has exceeded a predetermined value.","Then, communication is performed between the mapping server terminal  and the shared server terminal W. When the number of client terminals accessing the shared server terminal W has exceeded a predetermined value, and the mapping server terminal  has received another URL, the mapping server terminal  provides the IP address of the shared server terminal W (however, if the number of client terminals accessing the shared server terminal W has dropped below the predetermined level, the mapping server terminal  provides the IP address of the W).","This setup protects each of the shared server terminals W, W, W and so on from application of excess load, thereby preventing the deterioration of response.","It should be noted that the above-mentioned capability can be implemented by controlling by the mapping server terminal  the IP addresses of shared server terminals to be outputted for specific URLs, so that the client terminal  and the software operating on the same need not be modified.","The present embodiment has been described by taking the user's avatar for example as the update object to be controlled by the shared server terminal ; it is also possible to make the shared server terminal control any other update objects than avatars. It should be noted, however, that the client terminal  can also control update objects in some cases. For example, an update object such as a clock may be controlled by the client terminal  based on the built-in clock of the same, updating the clock.","Further, in the present embodiment, the hosts A through C, the client terminals - through -, and the service provider terminal  are interconnected via the network , which is the Internet; however, in terms of using the existing WWW system, the host A having the information server terminal  or the host C having the mapping server terminal  may only be connected with the client terminal  via the Internet. Further, if the user recognizes the address of the shared server terminal  for example, the host A having the information server terminal  and the client terminal  may only be interconnected via the Internet.","In addition, in the present embodiment, the information server terminal  and the mapping server terminal  operate on different hosts; however, if the WWW system is used, these server terminals may be installed on the same host. It should be noted that, if the WWW system is not used, the information server terminal , the shared server terminal , and the mapping server terminal  may all be installed on the same host.","Still further, in the present embodiment, the data of the virtual reality spaces for each specific area are stored in the host A (namely, the information server terminal ); however, these data may also be handled in units of a department store or an amusement park for example.","In the above-mentioned preferred embodiments of the invention, the basic objects are supplied to each client terminal  via the network ; however, it is also possible to store the basic objects in an information recording medium such as a CD-ROM and distribute the same to each user in advance. In this case, each client terminal  is constituted as shown in FIG. . To be more specific, in the embodiment of , a CD-ROM drive  is connected to the interface  to drive a CD-ROM  in which a virtual reality composed of basic objects is stored. The other part of the constitution is the same as that of FIG. .","Thus, provision of the data of basic objects from the CD-ROM  eliminates the time for transferring the data via the network , increasing processing speed.","Alternatively, the data of basic objects supplied from the information server terminal  may be stored in the storage device  only for the first time to be subsequently read for use.","Namely, the basic object data can be stored in the storage device  of the information server terminal  (for the cases  through ), the storage device  of the client terminal  (for the cases  through ) or the CD-ROM  of the client terminal  (for the cases  through ).","On the other hand, the update object data can be stored in the storage device  of the information server terminal  (for the case ) or the storage device  of the shared server terminal  (for the cases  through ). In the case in which the update object data are stored in the shared server terminal , that shared server terminal may be the shared server terminal - in Japan (for the case ,  or ) or the shared server terminal - in US (for the case ,  or ) as shown in  for example. In this instance, the URL of the update object data is stored on the mapping server terminal .","If the update object data are stored on the information server terminal , the URL of the update object data is the default URL controlled by the information server terminal  (in the case of ).

The browser implements such movements through the following interface:","By Keyboard:","Each of the arrow keys, not shown, on the keyboard generates the following corresponding movement: \u2192 rotate right; \u2190 rotate left; \u2191 move forward; and \u2193 move backward.","By Mouse:","Operate the mouse all with its left button.","(1) Keep the left button of the mouse pressed in the window of CyberPassage and move the mouse to the right for rotate right; to the left for rotate left; up for forward; and down for backward. The velocity of movement depends on the displacement of the mouse.","(2) With the Ctrl (Control) key, not shown, on the keyboard kept pressed, click an object on screen to get to the front of the clicked object.","The following precautions are needed:\n\n","Jumping Eye:","While navigating through a three-dimensional space, the user may be lost at occasions. If this happens, the user can jump up to have an overhead view around.","(1) Click \u201cJump\u201d button on the right of screen, and the user enters the jumping eye mode and jump to a position from which the user look down the world.","(2) Click \u201cJump\u201d button again, and the user goes down to the original position.","(3) Alternatively, click any place in the world, and the user gets down to the clicked position.","Selecting an Object:","When the mouse cursor is moved around on the screen, the shape of the cursor is transformed into a grabber (hand) on an object. In this state, click the left button of the mouse, and the action of the grabbed object can be called.","Loading a VRML File:","A VRML file can be loaded as follows:\n\n","Click the object in the virtual space for which \u201cURL\u201d is displayed on the mouse cursor.","Operating Toolbar Buttons:","Buttons in the toolbar shown in  for example may be used to execute frequently used functions.\n\n","Scouter Mode:","Each object placed in a virtual world may have a character string as information by using the E-VRML capability.","(1) Click \u201cScouter\u201d button on the right of screen, and the user enters the scouter mode.","(2) When the mouse cursor moves onto an object having an information label, the information label is displayed.","(3) Click \u201cScouter\u201d button again, and the user exits the scouter mode.","Moving an object around:","With \u201cAlt\u201d (Alternate) key, not shown, on the keyboard pressed, press the left button of the mouse on a desired object, and the user can move that object to a desired position with the mouse. This is like moving a coffee cup for example on s desk with the hand in the real world. In the virtual reality, however, objects that can be moved are those having movable attributes. It should be noted that a moved object may be restored to the position before movement only once by using \u201cUndo\u201d button.","Connecting to a Multi-User Server Terminal:","This browser provides a multi-user capability. The multi-user capability allows the sharing of a same VRML virtual space among a plurality of users. Currently, the applicant hereof is operating Community Place Bureau in the Internet on an experimental basis. By loading a world called chatroom the server terminal can be connected to share a same VRML virtual space with other users, walking together, turning off a room light, having a chat, and doing other activities.","This capability is started as follows:","(1) Make sure that the user's personal computer is linked to the Internet.","(2) Load the Chatroom of the sample world into CyberPassage Browser.

It should be noted that chat can be made throughout these three worlds commonly.","(1) Chat Room","This is a room in which chat is made mainly. Some objects in this room are shared among multiple users. There are objects which are made gradually transparent every time the left button of the mouse is pressed, used to turn off room lights, and hop when clicked, by way of example. Also, there are hidden holes and the like.","(2) Play With a Ball!!","When a ball in the air is clicked, the ball flies toward the user who clicked the ball. This ball is shared by all users sharing that space to play catch.","(3) Share Your Drawing","A whiteboard is placed in the virtual space. When it is clicked by the left button, the shared whiteboard is displayed. Dragging with the left button draws a shape on the whiteboard, the result being shared by the users sharing the space.","Use of Community Place Bureau allows the users using Community Place Browser to enter together a world described in VRML 1.0. To provide a three-dimensional virtual reality space for enabling this capability, a file described in VRML 1.0 must be prepared. Then, the Bureau (Community Place Bureau being hereinafter appropriately referred to simply as the Bureau) is operated on an appropriate personal computer. Further, a line telling the personal computer on which Bureau is operating is added to the VRML 1.0 file. The resultant VRML file is read into Community Place Browser (hereinafter appropriately referred to simply as the Browser), the Browser is connected to the Bureau.","If this connection is successful, the users in the virtual world can see each other and talk each other. Further, writing an appropriate script into the file allows each user to express emotions through a use of action panel (\u201cAction\u201d part in a multi-user window  of  to be described).","Community Place Browser provides interface for action description through use of TCL. This interface allows each user to provide behaviors to objects in the virtual world and, if desired, make the resultant objects synchronize between the Browsers. This allows a plurality of users to play a three-dimensional game if means for it are prepared.","To enjoy a multi-user virtual world, three steps are required, preparation of a VRML file, start of the Bureau, and connection of the Browser.","Preparing a VRML file:","First, a desired VRML. 1.0 file must be prepared. This file is created by oneself or a so-called freeware is used for this file. This file presents a multi-user virtual world.","Starting the Bureau:","The operating environment of Community Place Bureau is as follows:\n\n","This Bureau can be started only by executing the downloaded file. When the CyberPassage Bureau is executed, only a menu bar indicating menus is displayed as shown in FIG. . Just after starting, the Bureau is in stopped state. Selecting \u201cstatus\u201d by pulling down \u201cView\u201d menu displays the status window that indicates the current the Bureau state. At the same time, a port number waiting for connection is also shown.","Immediately after starting, the Bureau is set such that it waits for connection at TCP port No. 5126. To change this port number, pull down \u201coptions\u201d menu and select \u201cport\u201d. When entry of a new port number is prompted, enter a port number 5000 or higher. If the user does not know which port number to enter, default value (5126) can be used.","To start the Bureau from the stopped state, pull down \u201crun\u201d menu and select \u201cstart\u201d. The server terminal comes to be connected at the specified port. At this moment, the state shown in \u201cstatus\u201d window becomes \u201crunning\u201d.","Thus, after completion of the bureau preparations, when the Browser comes to connect to the Bureau, it tells the position of the Browser to another Browser or transfers information such as conversation and behavior.","The \u201cstatus\u201d window of the Bureau is updated every time connection is made by the user, so that using this window allows the user to make sure of the users existing in that virtual world.","Connection of the Browser:","Connection of the Browser requires the following two steps. First, instruct the Browser to which Bureau it is to be connected. This is done by writing an \u201cinfo\u201d node to the VRML file. Second, copy the user's avatar file to an appropriate direction so that you can be seen from other users.","Adding to a VRML file:","When writing a line specifying the Bureau to be connected to the VRML file, a name of the personal computer on which the Bureau is operating and the port number must be specified in the following format:DEF VsServer Into {string\u201cserver name:port number\u201d}.","The server terminal name is a machine name as used in the Internet on which the Bureau is operating (for example, fred.research.sony.com) or its IP address (for example, 123.231.12.1). The port number is one set in the Bureau.","Consequently, the above-mentioned format becomes as follows for example:\n\n","In the example of , the IP address of the shared server terminal - is 43.0.35.117, so that the above-mentioned format becomes as follows:\n\n","This is added below the line shown below of the prepared VRML file:\n\n","Copying an Avatar File:","When Community Place Browser gets connected to Community Place Bureau, the former notifies the latter of its avatar. When a specific avatar meets another, the Bureau notifies the other Browsers of the meeting information to make the specific avatar be displayed on the other Browsers. For this reason, it is required to copy the VRML file of the specific avatar to an appropriate place in advance.","The following further describes the operation of the browser (Community Place Browser).","In the following description, the description format of VRML 2.0 (The Virtual Reality Modeling Language Specification Version 2.0) publicized on Aug. 4, 1996 is presupposed. Also, in the following description, it is supposed that the browser correspond to VRML 2.0 and be capable of decoding a file described in this VRML 2.0 and displaying its three-dimensional virtual reality space.","The details of the VRML 2.0 specifications are publicized at: URL=http:\/\/www.vrml.org\/Specifications\/VRML2.0\/.","Further, the details of the Japanese version of the VRML 2.0 specifications are publicized at: URL=http:\/\/www.webcity.co.jp\/info\/andoh\/VRML\/vrml2. 0\/spec-jp\/index.html.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0303","num":"0322"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 28"],"b":["45","13","211","212","211","212","212","13"]},"First, in step S, the user moves the cursor onto the multiuser window  by operating the mouse and clicks it. Then, the user performs a so-called drag operation for moving the cursor to a desired position. When the cursor has reached the desired display position, the user clears dragging.","Next, in step S, it is determined whether horizontal distance L of the multiuser window  to the main window  is smaller than a preset predetermined reference value L. To be more specific, as shown in , the reference value Las the horizontal separated distance and a reference value HR as a vertical separated distance are preset between the main window  and the multiuser window . If the distance L is found larger than this reference value L, then, in step S, the multiuser window  is displayed at the position at which the drag operation has been cleared.","If, in step S, the distance L between the main window  and the multiuser window  is found equal to or smaller than the reference value L, then, in step S, it is determined whether distance H between the top side of the main window  and the top side of the multiuser window  is larger than preset reference value H. If the distance H is found larger than the reference value H, then, in step S, processing for displaying the multiuser window  is performed such that the distance L becomes 0.","To be more specific, as shown in , the multiuser window  indicated by a dashed line is automatically horizontally moved to the left to a position indicated by a solid line at which the right side of the main window  touches the left side of the multiuser window  and is displayed there. This displays the main window  and the multiuser window  without unnecessary interval between the main window  and the multiuser window  in the horizontal direction. Consequently, the space efficiency in the horizontal direction is enhanced.","On the other hand, if, in step S, the distance H between the top side of the main window  and the top side of the multiuser window  is found equal to or smaller than the reference value H, then, in step S, the multiuser window  is displayed such that not only the distance L but also the distance H becomes 0.","For example, as shown in , if a drag operation is cleared at a position indicated by a dashed line, the multiuser window  is automatically moved further to a position indicated by a solid line in the upper left direction. And, the right side of the main window  is made touch the left side of the multiuser window  and the top side of the main window  and the top side of the multiuser window  are positioned on the same horizontal line. This enhances the space efficiency in not only the horizontal direction but also the vertical direction.","For example, as shown in , if dragging of the multiuser window  is cleared at a position slightly separated from the main window  and if distances L and R between the multiuser window  and the main window  are smaller than the reference values Land Hrespectively, the multiuser window  is automatically moved further in the upper left direction and displayed as shown in FIG. .","To be more specific, if the drag operation is cleared after the multiuser window  has been moved to a distance within the reference values Land H(each of these values may be 10 pixels for example), it is determined that the user has an intention of touching the multiuser window  to the main window  and the display position of the multiuser window  is automatically adjusted correctly without requiring the user to finely adjust the display position. This allows the user to perform prompt window moving operations.","If the distances L and H are found larger than the reference values Land H, it is determined that the user has no intention of arranging the multiuser window  in contact with the main window  and hence intends to display the multiuser window  at that position separated away from the main window . Consequently, the multiuser window  is displayed at that position. This does not prevent the user from moving the multiuser window  to any desired position.","So far, the description has been made by use of the main window  and the multiuser window  for example. It will be apparent that windows are not restricted to these two windows. The present invention is applicable when a main window for displaying main information and a sub window for displaying information accompanying the main information are displayed in a single screen.","The invention has been described about an example in which the Internet is used as the network  and WWW is used. It will be apparent that the present invention can also be implemented by use of a broadband communication network other than the Internet or a system other than WWW.","As described and according to the image display processing apparatus described in claim , the image display processing method described in claim , and the information providing medium described in claim , if the display position of a sub window for displaying information accompanying main information displayed in a main window is moved by user and if the separated distance of the sub window to be displayed at this moved position to the main window is within a preset predetermined value, the sub window is automatically moved to a position adjacent to the main window. This novel constitution allows efficient arrangement of a plurality of windows by effective use of a display screen.","While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described using specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention in conjugation with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["11","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"],"b":"14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 1"],"b":["13","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 1"],"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 1"],"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 1"],"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 1"],"b":["13","10","11","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 1"],"b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 1"],"b":["13","1","1","11","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 25"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 32"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
