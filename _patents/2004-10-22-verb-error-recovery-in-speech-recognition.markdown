title: Verb error recovery in speech recognition
abstract: A computer implemented method and system for speech recognition are provided. The method and system generally maintain a set of verbs for speech recognition commands. Upon recognizing utterance of a verb of the set in combination with an invalid object or objects for the verb, the method and system generate an indication relative to the verb and invalid object. The indication can include informing the user that the system is unsure how to execute the command associated with the verb with the invalid object. The method and system can then receive a user input to specify how the verb and invalid object should be treated.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to computerized speech recognition. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and methods to improve the manner in which speech recognition systems react to recognition errors and\/or ambiguity.","Speech recognition is a technology that has a number of useful applications that allow people to interface with computing systems using their voices. These applications include: allowing a user to dictate text into a document; allowing a user to issue commands to one or more computer programs via speech; improving automated telephony systems; and many other applications. Such systems are useful in large centralized-server applications, such as computerized telephony processing systems; user interaction with desktop computing products; and even improved interaction and control of mobile computing devices.","Speech recognition is known and is being actively researched as perhaps the future of human interaction with computing devices. While speech recognition technology has progressed rapidly, it has not been perfected. Speech recognition requires substantial computing resources and has not achieved 100% recognition accuracy. This is partly due to inherent ambiguities in human language, and also due, in part, to varying domains over which user speech may be applied.","Current desktop speech recognition systems typically listen for up to three classes of speech. The first class is free form dictation where the recognized text is simply inserted into the document that currently has focus. An example of dictation might be, \u201cJohn, have you received the report that I sent you yesterday?\u201d The second class of speech is commands in the form of simple names of menus or buttons. Examples of this class of speech include \u201cFile,\u201d \u201cEdit,\u201d View,\u201d \u201cOK\u201d et cetera. When a command word is recognized, the items they represent will be selected or \u201cclicked\u201d by voice (i.e. the File menu would open when \u201cFile\u201d is recognized). The third class is commands in the form of verb-plus-object command pairs. Examples of this class of speech include: \u201cDelete report,\u201d \u201cClick OK,\u201d and \u201cStart Calculator.\u201d The \u201cStart Calculator\u201d command, when properly recognized, will launch the application called calculator.","By listening for all three classes, the user need not indicate before they speak whether they want to enter text by voice or give a command by voice. The speech recognition system determines this automatically. Thus, if a user utters \u201cDelete Sentence,\u201d the current sentence will be deleted. Additionally, if the user says, \u201cThis is a test,\u201d the words \u201cThis is a test\u201d will be inserted into the current document. While this intuitive approach vastly simplifies the user experience, it is not without limitation. Specifically, when a user intends to give a verb-plus-object command, and either the command or object is erroneous or the recognition fails, the verb-plus-object will be treated as dictation and be inserted into a document.","The erroneous insertion of an attempted verb-plus-object command into a document creates a compound error situation. Specifically, the user must now undo the erroneously injected text, and the re-speak their command. The fact that the user has to follow more than one step when the verb-plus-object command is misrecognized is what turns the misrecognition error into a \u201ccompound error.\u201d Compound errors quickly frustrate a user and can easily color the user's impression of speech recognition. Thus, a speech recognition system that could reduce or even eliminate such errors would improve users' experience with speech recognition in general.","A computer implemented method and system for speech recognition are provided. The method and system generally maintain a set of verbs for speech recognition commands. Upon recognizing utterance of a verb of the set in combination with an invalid object for the verb, the method and system generate an indication relative to the verb and invalid object. The indication can include informing the user that the system is unsure how to execute the command associated with the verb with the invalid object. The method and system can then receive a user input to specify how the verb and invalid object should be treated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

In one embodiment, the system does this by providing the user with an indication that the system heard the right verb, but was unsure of the subject. It can then provide the user with a choice of inserting the phrase as text, if that is what the user wants to do.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","302"]},"At block , the system listens for speech and converts speech into recognized text. Block  can operate in accordance with any suitable speech recognition technology known today, or developed in the future. After speech is converted to text in block , control then passes to block  where the system determines if the recognized text is a simple command. If the recognized speech is a simple command, such as \u201cFile\u201d the command is executed, such as clicking the File menu by voice, and control returns to block  via line .","At block , the system determines if the recognized text is a verb plus at least one valid object. A simple example is where the recognized text is a valid verb-plus-object, such as \u201cStart Calculator\u201d then the system will launch the calculator application. However, embodiments of the present invention are equally applicable to situations where additional text follows the valid object. For example, a commands such as \u201cSelect the word <text> and turn it <formatting style>\u201d includes a verb \u201cSelect\u201d followed by a valid object \u201cthe word\u201d which is followed by a specifier <text> telling the system which text is meant as \u201cthe word.\u201d Further, the command has multiple parts since it includes a second verb \u201cturn\u201d followed by another valid object \u201cit.\u201d Embodiments of the present invention include any speech recognition command beginning with a verb followed by at least one valid object. Thus, embodiments of the present invention are applicable to commands containing verb-object-verb-object (select fred and turn it bold); verb-object-object (change fred into fried); and verb-object-adjective (turn that red) as well as any other command beginning with a verb followed by a valid object. Once the system has acted on the verb plus at least one object, control returns to block  along line .","At block  the system determines if the recognized text is a verb from the set of verbs chosen in block , plus a non-valid object. If that is the case, control passes to block . At block , the system provides an indication to the user that the system is unsure of how the recognized verb should be acted upon due to the non-valid object. However, the system could also simply provide the user with a standard misrecognition message such as \u201cWhat was that?\u201d In one embodiment, if the user says, \u201cStart adding\u201d instead of \u201cStart Calculator\u201d and \u201cadding\u201d is a non-valid object for the verb \u201cStart\u201d the system will indicate to the user that it is not sure what is to be \u201cStarted.\u201d The system can then indicate that if the user wishes to insert the text as dictation, they must say \u201cInsert start . . . .\u201d The feedback may also indicate that if the user desires, a list of valid objects for the recognized verb can be displayed. Once the user feedback has been given, the method optionally passes to block , where the system awaits a user response to the feedback. In some embodiments, the method may pass directly from block  to block  if user input and resultant system action are not required. In optional block , the user response could be in the form of pressing a button, uttering a command, or any other suitable interaction. Once the user provides an input relative to the feedback, control optionally passes to block , where the appropriate action, based upon the user input, is taken. For example, if the user has indicated that the verb plus non-valid object was dictation, then the text will be entered as dictation. After the user input has been acted upon in block , control returns to block  along line .","Finally, if the recognized text is not a simple command, verb-plus-object, nor verb-plus non-valid object, then the recognized text is simply inserted into the current document as dictation as indicated at block .","While steps ,  and  have been described sequentially, such description was simple provided for clarity. It is expressly contemplated that the order of evaluation can be changed in accordance with embodiments of the invention.","By providing inductive feedback to a user in response to recognition of a selected verb in combination with an invalid object, a simple process transforms what would otherwise be a compound error into a pleasant user experience. Moreover, a user who is not familiar with the speech recognition system can be more easily guided without becoming overly frustrated. This improved user experience may facilitate user adoption of speech recognition technology as well as improve the efficiency of a user's interaction with a speech recognition system.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
