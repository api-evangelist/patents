{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIOR FOREIGN APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from Chinese patent application number 201110461369.9, filed Dec. 30, 2011, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","One or more aspects of the present invention relate to data analysis technology, and more specifically, to a method and apparatus for control flow analysis.","Control flow analysis is an important aspect in performance analysis of a computer program. The basis for the control flow analysis is call relations between the respective functions of the computer program. Those skilled in the art can understand that the functions mentioned here refer to code units which can realize certain functions independently, and can be named methods etc in some situations. A calling function transfers a parameter to a called function, the called function calculates the parameter and returns a result of the calculation to the calling function. Generally, the function calling relation is recorded to be represented as a function call tree. In the function call tree, a parent node represents the calling function and the child node represents the called function. The use of the function call tree to represent the calling relation between the functions facilitates determining the function which is called frequently and the function which has excessive CPU time overhead, thereby determining the performance bottleneck of the program and further improving the performance of the program. For example, for the function which is called frequently, a more complicated optimization algorithm can be used to perform optimization or the frequency of calling that function can be reduced.","Nowadays, programs usually contain complicated business logic and thus the corresponding function call tree per se is very huge. For example, applications of a business level usually contain more than one hundred thousand invocations and more than 200 invocation levels. Since such applications are very complicated, they have many \u201cnoise calling\u201d for auxiliary software modules in addition to actual business logics. The analysis for the huge function call tree needs a large amount of time and efforts. In addition, modern applications are generally based on a complicated framework and the business logics used are usually packaged within the framework, and thus it is difficult to separate these packaged business logics from the framework so as to perform more accurate analysis.","Therefore, a need exists for simplifying the function call tree such that the function call tree can be better used for control flow analysis to find possible performance bottlenecks.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a method, apparatus and computer program product for control flow analysis.","A method for control flow analysis according to an embodiment of the present invention includes, for instance: acquiring an original function call tree of a program, wherein nodes of the original function call tree represent functions and a parent\/child relation between the nodes represents a calling relation; generating a corresponding function dominator tree from the calling relation, wherein nodes of the function dominator tree represent the functions and a parent\/child relation between the nodes represents a dominator relation, wherein a first function dominates a second function if all the invocations to the second function are originated by the first function; and simplifying the original function call tree according to the function dominator tree so as to obtain a simplified function call tree.","An apparatus for control flow analysis according to an embodiment of the present invention includes, for instance: acquiring means configured to acquire an original function call tree of a program, wherein nodes of the original function call tree represent functions and a parent\/child relation between the nodes represents a calling relation; generating means configured to generate a corresponding function dominator tree from the calling relation, wherein nodes of the function dominator tree represent the functions and a parent\/child relation between the nodes represents a dominator relation, wherein a first function dominates a second function if all the invocations to the second function are originated by the first function; and simplifying means configured to simplify the original function call tree according to the function dominator tree so as to obtain a simplified function call tree.","According to embodiments of the present invention, the call tree for control flow analysis can be simplified.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.

Such propagated signal may be in a plurality of forms, including but not limited to electromagnetic signal, optical signal or any suitable combinations of above.

Obviously, a method which analyzes nodes on the call tree one-by-one to determine whether the nodes should be removed from the call tree is not realistic. A relatively realistic method is setting a filter standard by an analyst, and filtering the call tree according to the filter standard. For example, in order to remove the node of a library function of a Java software development kit (SDK) in the call tree, the filter standard can be set as \u201cremoving the node having the name beginning with the character of java\/\u201d. Furthermore, for example, the node with called times less than a certain threshold can be removed from the call tree, that is, the filter standard is set as \u201cremoving the node with called times less than a threshold\u201d. To use the filter method, the analyst is to have a very profound understanding of the program. If the filter standard is not appropriately set, the effect of simplifying the function call tree cannot be realized or the key nodes may be removed from the call tree which will result in the loss of key information. Furthermore, converting the actual filter requirement into an executable filter standard calls for a very high demand for the analyst. For example, not all the names of the library node of the Java software development kit (SDK) begin with the character of \u201cjava\/\u201d.","In the following, a method for performing control flow analysis according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to . In the following description, a function corresponds to a node.","At step , an original function call tree of a program is acquired, wherein a node of the original function call tree represents a function, and a parent\/child relation between the nodes of the original function call tree represents a calling relation.","Those skilled in the art may acquire the original function call tree of the program through a plurality of means; for example, the original function call tree may be acquired from source codes or object codes through a method of static analysis, or the original function call tree may be acquired through a method of dynamic analysis during execution of the program. In one method of dynamic analysis, operations such as stack-in, skip etc. are to be performed when the calling function performs a call, and operations such as stack-out, skip are to be performed thereby the calling can be identified.","An illustrated original function call tree is shown in ). In a path at the bottom, function B calls function C, function C calls function E, function E calls function G, and function G calls function H. A calling function may call a plurality of called functions, and these different callings are represented as different paths on the original function call tree. For example, the case that function A calls function C, function C calls function D and the case that function A calls function C, function C calls function E are different two paths.","Function A and function B are not called by any other functions.","At step , the original function call tree of the program is converted into a function call directed graph.","Converting a tree structure into a directed graph structure is commonly-used technical means in the art, and thus will not be described in details here. It should be noted that when the original function call tree is converted into the function call directed graph, a same function on the different paths of the original function call tree only corresponds to one node of the function call directed graph, but different calling relations related to the function on the original function call tree correspond to different directional sides on the function call directed graph.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3(","FIG. 3(","FIG. 3("],"i":["b","a","a"]},"Function A calls function C, and function C calls function D;","Function A calls function C, and function C calls function E;","Function B calls function C, and function C calls function E.","In ), function C only corresponds to one node C, but has four directional sides related to node C.","The following are examples of the pseudo code for performing step  according to an embodiment of the present invention:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"PROCEDURE CALL_TREE_TO_CALL_GRAPH"]},{"entry":[{},"BEGIN"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003FOR each node as CALLER on call tree DO"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003FOR each child as CALLEE of CALLER DO"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003add {CALLER, CALLEE} as edge into call graph"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003ENDFOR"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003ENDFOR"]},{"entry":[{},"END"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"At step , the function call directed graph is converted into a function dominator tree, wherein the parent\/child relation in the function dominator tree represents a dominator relation.","In the function dominator tree, a parent node dominates a child node. The dominator relation is defined as follows, for example:","If function X must be called before calling function Y from entry to a program, function X dominates function Y. In other words, if all the calls to function Y are originated by function X, function X dominates function Y. The \u201corigination\u201d here refers to the case that function X calls function Y directly as well as the case that function X calls a third function and the third function calls function Y. If function X dominates function Y, and function X does not dominate other functions dominating function Y, function X dominates function Y directly.","It can be seen from ) that function A and function B are not called by any other functions, thus function A and function B are not dominated by any functions. If function C is to be called, it may be called through function A or it may be called through function B, thus both function A and function B do not dominate function C, and function C is not dominated by any functions either. Therefore, on the function dominator tree, function C is at the same level as function A and function B.","It also can be seen from ) that, if function D, function E, function F, function G or function H is to be called, function C must be gone through, therefore, function C dominates function D, function E, function F, function G and function H, wherein function C dominates function D and function E directly.","Regarding function H, it may be called through a path of function C\u2192function D\u2192function F\u2192function H, and it may also be called through a path of function C\u2192function E\u2192function G\u2192function H. Therefore, function H is dominated by function C, but is not dominated by any one of function D, function E, function F or function G.","Regarding function D and function F, since function D must be gone through when function F is called but function F is not necessarily gone through when function D is called, function D dominates function F but function F does not dominate function D.","Similarly, dominator relations between other functions can be derived thereby the function dominator tree as shown in ) can be obtained.","It can be seen from the above description that the function dominator tree is based on the calling relation between the functions. The information on the calling relation is recited in the original function call tree.

These functions have different dominator properties as shown in ) and ), wherein function A and function B are not called by any other functions and such functions can be called weak dominator functions. Function C is called as strong dominator function which is characterized by that (1) function C dominates at least one other function; (2) function C is called by a plurality of other functions (function A and function B); and (3) there has no strong dominator function which dominates all of these plurality of other functions.","Function H does not dominate other functions, thus the above condition (1) is not satisfied, so function H is not the strong dominator function. Even function H dominates other functions, it is not the strong dominator function because of the following reasons: although function H is called by function F and function G, that is, the above condition (2) is satisfied, the strong dominator function C dominates function F and function G, that is, the above condition (3) is not satisfied.","Function F does not dominate other functions, thus the above condition (1) is not satisfied, so function F is not the strong dominator function. If function F dominates other functions, the above condition (1) is satisfied. If furthermore, function F is called by a plurality of other functions, for example, function F is called by function D and function E, the above condition (2) is satisfied. If function C dominating all of function D and function E is not the strong dominator function, the above condition (3) is satisfied. In this way, function F can become the strong dominator function. Similarly, function G can become the strong dominator function under the case that varying conditions are satisfied.","As described above, in a method of dynamic analysis, calling is detected by capturing actions such as stack-in, stack-out, skip etc. These actions such as stack-in, stack-out, skip etc. may occur within some basic function packages. The basic function package envelops codes for performing some general functions and generally has been optimized. An Application Programming Interface (API) is a typical basic function package. General applications realize general functions by calling a particular API and do not need to understand detailed implementation inside the API. API has been optimized during envelopment, thus there has little optimization space left. In addition, some API is provided in form of object code, thus it is hard to perform optimization. The feature of the strong dominator function is identical with the feature of entry function of the basic function package, thus identifying the strong dominator function from the function dominator tree can identify the entry function of the basic function package. In the subsequent analysis, the analysis to the inside of API can be omitted, thereby analysis may be more focused on the application per se.","In particular, the original function call tree may be traversed, if a node corresponds to the strong dominator function, all the child nodes of the node are removed so as to obtain a simplified function call tree. The removing here may be merging the child nodes to the node corresponding to the strong dominator function, or may be deleting the child nodes. In the former embodiment, if required, the node corresponding to the strong dominator function may be spread to obtain information inside the basic function package. ) shows the simplified function call tree obtained by simplifying the original function call tree of ).","Examples of the pseudo code for performing step  according to an embodiment of the present invention are as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"PROCEDURE SIMPLIFY_CALL_TREE"},{"entry":"BEGIN"},{"entry":"\u2002CALL BUILD_DOMINATOR_TREE"},{"entry":"\u2003NAME_LIST = \u03a6"},{"entry":"\u2002\u2009FOR each tree in DOMINATOR_TREE, DO"},{"entry":"\u2003N = tree root node"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003CALL GET_STRONG_DOMINATORS(N, NAME_LIST)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002ENDFOR"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002\/* Many options the implementation could have: aggressive grouping,"},{"entry":"conservative grouping, and so on *\/"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002CALL GROUP_NODES"},{"entry":"END"},{"entry":"\/* Reference implementation of getting strong dominators. *\/"},{"entry":"\/* Strong dominator with two attributes *\/"},{"entry":"\/* (1) It dominates other methods, which works for dominator method"},{"entry":"only. *\/"},{"entry":"\/* (2) It's called by at least two different methods.*\/"},{"entry":"PROCEDURE GET_STRONG_DOMINATORS (N, NAME_LIST)"},{"entry":"\u2002IF N has children THEN"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002IF N has more than one incoming edges in CALL_GRAPH THEN"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002add N to NAME_LIST"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002ELSE"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002FOR each child of N, as C, DO"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003CALL GET_STRONG_DOMINATORS(C, NAME_LIST)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002ENDFOR"},{"entry":"\u2003ENDIF"},{"entry":"\u2002ENDIF"},{"entry":"END"},{"entry":"\/* Reference implementation of conservative grouping. *\/"},{"entry":"PROCEDURE GROUP_NODES"},{"entry":"BEGIN"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002FOR each leaf node on CALL_TREE DO"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002build CALL_STACK from the top to leaf node"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002FOR each node in CALL_STACK from leaf node to top DO"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\/* Group the deepest node only *\/"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003IF NAME_LIST contains node's name THEN"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003add node to TO_GROUP_LIST"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003BREAK;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003ENDIF"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002ENDFOR"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002ENDFOR"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2002FOR each node in TO_GROUP_LIST DO"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002group node"},{"entry":"ENDFOR"},{"entry":"END"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"According to a method of the present invention, the call tree can be simplified and such simplification embodies not only on nodes count of the call tree, but also on level depth of the call tree.
