title: Unbroken primary connection switching between communications services
abstract: A method allows a user of a mobile terminal to switch from a communication service currently active between that mobile terminal and another mobile terminal to a different communication service in such a manner that the end to end connection between terminals appears unbroken to the user. The user initiates the switch by inputting an appropriate command at the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal then transfers a request to the other mobile terminal. The request invokes a user interface on the other mobile terminal and prompts the user of the other mobile terminal to indicate whether or not they agree to switch from the currently active communication service to the other communication service. After receiving the user's response to the prompt, the other mobile terminal sends back a reply indicating the user's response. Signaling to perform the switch is initiated in response to the reply. The active communication service is terminated at the first and second mobile terminal at substantially the same time that the second communication service is initiated at the first and second mobile terminal.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the field of wireless communications. In particular, the invention relates to the user interaction with a mobile terminal when switching between communication services.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","In the development of wireless communications, there is a trend towards supporting various communication services in addition to a conventional voice call. Some communications services, such as short message service (SMS), multimedia message service (MMS), e-mail, network operator messages, push services, etc., are not continuous services and can be provided in secondary connections which are simultaneous with the primary connection and which do not require disconnection of the primary connection. Depending on the particular air interface, multiple simultaneous connections may be possible to\/from a wireless communication terminal. For example, GSM wireless communication networks can provide a primary circuit switched (CS) connection for a voice\/data call and a simultaneous secondary connection which can send and receive SMS messages during the call to a mobile terminal with a headset.","Some communications services, such as voice, instant messaging (such as chat), and video messaging, can only be provided through primary connections because the user interaction in the service is expected to be substantially continuous without any lengthy interruption. GSM and other conventional wireless communication networks can only provide one primary connection at a time to a mobile terminal. Thus, the primary connection for one communication service must be ended before the primary connection for another communication service is initiated. Furthermore, a communication service, such as a chat session, may be automatically terminated by an incoming phone call and cannot be resumed after the incoming phone call has ended.","A Wideband Code Division Multiplex Access (WCDMA) air interface has been proposed in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project which can provide several simultaneous primary connections to a single wireless communication terminal. However, even though multiple primary connections may be available over a WCDMA air interface, the user experience at the terminal when switching between primary connections may not be fluent or otherwise satisfactory, especially when a user wishes to continue communicating with the same person but through a different type of communication service. A person may desire to switch from a voice service to a chat service because they no longer wish to speak out loud. A person may desire to switch from a voice service to a video service so that they can see something, such a person's face, or to switch from a video service to a voice service so that something will not be seen.","Even if multiple primary connections are available in a wireless communication network, the user interaction necessary to switch between communication services consists of performing two separate methods, the first method consisting of those steps necessary to terminate the first communication service and the second method consisting of those steps necessary to activate the second communication service. Although the network allows different types of communication services, there is still a disadvantage that the user interaction is cumbersome at least because different methods and several steps are necessary to switch between the communication services. The lack of immediacy in switching is a concern because the user may believe that he has lost contact with the other person if there is a long period of time without contact while the switching occurs.","There are now numerous communication services which carry various forms and combinations of multimedia content such as video, web content, graphics and text. As used in this application, the term \u201cmultimedia\u201d refers to any content having a visual element. The mobile terminals of wireless communication networks, particularly phones of cellular networks, are now capable of transporting data, including multimedia data in various communication services. Many types of mobile terminals are being used, such as cellular phones, cordless telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), palm-held computers and laptop computers. The strong push in current wireless technology development is to use mobile terminals for varied applications and to allow users of such devices to seamlessly integrate events and needs in their lives while maintaining adequate communications power to receive and transmit all of the data and information which has an impact on them.","An advanced mobile terminal supported by so-called third generation (3G) and fourth generation (4G) networks and using the latest innovations in computers, software, displays and other technologies may access and receive a variety of many different communication services. Unfortunately, the manner and duration (apparent to the user) of the procedure necessary for switching among the communication services may vary widely and unpredictably. These communication services may be provided by different information sources in other networks and may be based on and built upon a variety of data transfer techniques. This introduces more delay and uncertainty into mobile terminal switching among different communication services.","For at least these reasons, present methods of switching between different communication services at a mobile terminal have disadvantages. Accordingly, there is a need for effective solutions that allow for easy and substantially immediate mobile terminal switching between different communication services without it appearing to the user that the connection is broken at any time.","To overcome limitations in the prior art described above, and to overcome other limitations that will be apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, it is therefore an object of the following described preferred and exemplary embodiments to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages. In particular, an object of the preferred and exemplary embodiments is to provide a solution which facilitates mobile terminal switching among various communication services which appears, to the users of the mobile terminals, to be substantially immediate and the end-to-end connection unbroken.","In the preferred and exemplary embodiments, a method allows a user of a mobile terminal to switch from a communication service currently active between the mobile terminal and another mobile terminal to a different communication service in such a manner that the end to end connection between appears unbroken to the user. The user initiates the switch by inputting an appropriate command at the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal then transfers a request to the other mobile terminal. The request invokes a user interface on the other mobile terminal and prompts the user of the other mobile terminal to indicate whether or not they agree to switch from the currently active communication service to the other communication service. After receiving the user's response to the prompt, the other mobile terminal sends back a reply indicating the user's response. Signaling to perform the switch is initiated in response to the reply. The active communication service is terminated at the first and second mobile terminal at substantially the same time that the second communication service is initiated at the first and second mobile terminal.","A particular aspect of the preferred and exemplary embodiments involves a software application on the mobile terminal which carries out a method of switching between communication services in which the new communication service is substantially immediately presented to the users on the mobile terminals when the previous communication service is terminated without particular requests needing to be made by the user. Preferably, the user can make a simple selection on a displayed user interface to switch from a currently active communication service to one of a number of available communication services.","This and other features of the preferred and exemplary embodiments of the invention will become apparent and better understood from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the detailed description and drawings are designed solely for the purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims.","In the following description of the various preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration various preferred embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Attention now is directed to , which shows a block diagram of a preferred and exemplary wireless communication network according to a 3GPP all IP reference model and in which a method of switching between communication services at mobile terminals may be carried out according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. It will be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to a variety of different types of communications services, but is most advantageously applied to multimedia communication services requiring a primary connection on a wireless communication network.","According to , an Internet Protocol (IP) terminal device or terminal equipment  is connected to a third generation (3G) mobile terminal  which provides a bi-directional radio connection to an Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN)  of the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Service, (UMTS) System. The mobile terminal is preferably capable of receiving any one or more of various communication services and providing corresponding received data to the user. The UTRAN  comprises at least one Radio Network Controller (RNC, not shown) for providing a switching function to e.g. a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network comprising a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)  having a switching and mobility mangement function in the GPRS core network of the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Service (UMTS) system. Furthermore, the SGSN  is connected to a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)  which provides an access function to a multimedia IP-based network , such as the Internet.","Additionally, the RNC of the UTRAN  may establish a connection to a circuit switched (CS) terminal equipment  via a fixed network or PSTN\/ISDN network  and a Media Gateway (MGW)  arranged for adapting the PS multimedia connection of the UMTS network (including the SGSN  and the GGSN ) to the CS connection of the PSTN\/ISDN . Similarly, the packet switched (PS) multimedia connection can be adapted to a CS connection of a CS mobile network such as the UMTS release 1999 CS domain or a GSM network. In particular, the MGW  may allow a PS H.323 or a Session Initiation Protocol, (SIP) system defined by 3GPP for use in the IP multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) to interoperate with PSTN\/ISDN terminals such as the CS terminal equipment  which may be a H.324 (H.324\/I) compliant terminal. The gateway functionality of the MGW  is addressed e.g. in the ITU-T recommendation H.246 for the case of an interworking of H-series multimedia terminals with H-series multimedia terminals and voice\/voice-band terminals on PSTN and ISDN.","The MGW  is connected to a Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF)  which is connected via a Transmission Signaling Gateway (T-SGW, not shown) to the PSTN\/ISDN . The MGCF  may be connected via a Call State Control Function (CSCF)  to a Home Subscriber Server (HSS)  comprising a subscriber multimedia profile database .","The preferred embodiments of the invention are concerned with improving the switching between a variety of communication services. For example, users on a call may want to make silent comments in a chat session or drawings that are forwarded for display on the mobile terminal  of the other user. To accomplish this, a software application\/user interface is preferably stored in mobile terminal . Having the application resident on the mobile terminal  increases the speed of switching between the communication services, and allows the user interface to be well designed with suitable graphical elements for the characteristics of mobile terminal .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","2","200","201","200","202","205","2","202","205","201"]},"A example of the user interfaces on the mobile terminals in a preferred embodiment of the method of switching between communications services is shown in . In the example, Eric having a voice call communication service with Susan wants to switch to a video call communication service with Susan. Eric enters a command on his mobile terminal  to send a request to Susan's terminal indicating his desire to switch from a voice call to a video call. In the example of a mobile terminal having a software application\/user interface to provide display  as shown In , Eric makes the request by simply selecting the tab corresponding to the desired service.","Various information may be contained in the request message transmitted by the mobile terminal , such as details of the mobile terminal related to carrying out the suggested service (video format type, etc). The request may be logged in the receiving mobile terminal. It is a design choice when to remove request entries; for example a request can be removed when that session is completed, plus some predetermined time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00041","num":"00041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","301","301","80","301"]},"It is particularly preferable that the user interface, including prompt, be available on Susan's terminal substantially immediately after the request is made at Eric's terminal. Susan can then respond to the prompt by simply pressing YES button - or NO button - or taking any other action appropriate for the user interface utilized on her terminal for the request to indicate whether or not she agrees to switch the communication service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00043","num":"00043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 4","FIGS. 2-4"],"b":"400"},"The method of switching communication service may utilize software application in a network element (e.g., MGCF a) to adapt the existing resources by releasing part of the used connection resources. Alternatively, the MGCF may reserve new resources and release earlier reserved resources. Another alternative is that the MGCF a reserves an additional portion of the required network connection resources in respect to an earlier used network connection in such a way that newly reserved and earlier provisional network connection resources are used together to satisfy the connection resource needs to support the newly switched service requirements.","The software application carrying out the above method of switching communication services may itself be able to perform one or more of the communication services or there may be one or more other software applications on mobile terminal  to perform one or more of the communication services. For example, there may be one software application to perform the video call service, another software application to perform the chat session, etc. Alternatively, a software application may perform more than one communication service. In any event, such software applications may interact with the software application carrying out the above method of switching communication services through application programming interfaces (APIs) or similar methods. Alternatively, each of such software applications may be revised or developed to include user interface commands for each one of the communication service change request. The mobile terminal  may have any one of a variety of different software application managers for managing the software applications resident on the mobile terminal  or downloaded to the mobile terminal . Such a software manager may be terminal and implementation dependent.","Once stored in the mobile terminal , the software application for carrying out the method of switching communications services can be launched at any time as long as a primary connection is active. The launch can be user activated or activated automatically whenever a primary connection is opened. However, it is preferred that some elements of user interface do not have to always be present. For example, as shown in , a clock or timer in the upper right of the display, the function buttons on the left side (for printing, navigation, etc.) and the right side of the display (volume control, adding member, ending call, etc.) may be constant. The various windows , , and  are present and absent according to the state of communications. Furthermore, the tabs -, the Yes button -, the NO button -, and the function buttons for diverting a call are also present according to the state of communications. As indicated in , there may be a background, either fixed or at the user's preference, on the display when the elements are not present.","It is preferred that once the software application performing the method for switching communication services is launched, it remains in the background until the method is invoked, for example, a change in communication service is requested. Preferably, neither user has to provide complicated inputs. It is a particular feature of the preferred embodiments that the software application utilizes previously obtained information and requires only one single action by the appropriate user at the various steps in the method. This can be done as shown in , for example, by providing a plurality of tabs - each corresponding to an available communication service which may be requested and YES and NO buttons - and - for the reply to the request. In order to switch to a particular service according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the user merely selects one of the tabs -, and in order to reply, the user selects one of the YES and NO buttons - and -.

However, the communication service may be changed several times during a single end to end mobile terminal session.  illustrate an example of a session in which the communication service is changed several times. service or vise versa between two mobile terminals in the communication network system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00050","num":"00050"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["2","2","610","601","602","603"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00051","num":"00051"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIG. 9","FIG. 10"],"b":["701","801","802","802","901","1001"]},"As indicated by element  in , Eric may request a whiteboard service during the call by selecting tab . After making a drawing, such as the map shown in , Eric may request a share view (step ) communication service. Assuming that the request for a change to the share view communication service is accepted by Susan, the display on her terminal may become as shown in , including the map shown in window . As indicated in , Eric may at the appropriate time activate the end share button  to discontinue the shared view and return to the original call.","Some example implementations of steps - of  are provided above with respect to  and to . As indicated therein, the software application carrying out the method of switching communication services preferably sends the request and reply upon a simple input by the user and without any further actions necessary by the user. Any one of several available signaling methods (such as GPRS, SMS, etc.) may be employed in the network and in the terminals to transfer the initial request to change communication services from the first terminal to the second terminal and to transfer the reply from the second terminal to the first terminal if the invention is implemented software in the mobile terminals only and no extra support is required in the network (e.g., MGCF a).","As indicated at step  of , the method includes signaling to set up a change in communication resources of the services applying the information received originally from user command therefore at step  and possibly, information available in the network (e.g., MGCF a or any other entity) and an affirmative reply at step . As indicated at step  of , this signaling enables the switching of communication services on the displays of the terminals to appear to be substantially immediate. Exemplary, but non-limiting, implementations of steps  and  will now be discussed.","In a preferred embodiment, the request to change communication services is combined with a message or other information specific to the request and is synchronized with the request to be presented at substantially the same time that the prompt is provided to the receiving user. The presentation of this message or other information in a synchronized manner gives an impression of continuity to the receiving user.","The communication services may be established generally as described in published patent application W002052825, where there would be a circuit switched connection from the caller's terminal to the switch and the call leg from the switch to called party is a packet switched connection and the invention is implemented in the software of a mobile terminal. However, when a communication service is switched according to steps -, the software application at Eric's terminal provides a SETUP message including instructions to, for example, MGCF  in FIG. . In MGCF , a SIP INVITE message is sent to Susan's mobile terminal. Feedback is signaled by sending a session progress message from Susan's mobile terminal to MGCF  to Eric's mobile terminal. Then, the physical call connection resources for the first communication service that are not required any more are released (disconnected) and the resources required for the second communication service are reserved. Next, alerting is signaled to Eric's mobile terminal and to Susan's mobile terminal. Preferably, the alert is not a ringing tone to be played, but instead some content (such as text or picture) drawn on the display of the mobile terminal. The presentation of this content is preferably synchronized with the availability of the second communication service in the manner described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/026,912 filed on Dec. 27, 2001, and assigned to the same assignee (Nokia Corporation) as this application, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application in its entirety. Preferably, the resources for the first communication service are disconnected only after a second CONNECT message is sent to the mobile terminals. Otherwise, during a very busy traffic hour, the connection from MGCF  to the mobile terminals may drop and the call connection may be released.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00057","num":"00057"},"figref":"FIGS. 14-15"},"The method of switching communication services may require new software application in a network (e.g., MGCF a) to adapt the existing resources by releasing part of the used connection resources. Alternatively, (MGCF a) may reserve new resources and release earlier reserved resources. This is illustrated in detail in FIG. . The method starts with set up message sending (step ) from a first mobile terminal as result of its user wanting to establish a video call including audio a second mobile terminal. The MGCF  receives the originally sent set up message and it may retrieve the media profile of the calling mobile terminal (step ) that is applied for configuring the video call connection and is mapped from the Logical Link Control (LLC) Protocol from the Bearer Control Protocol H.324 to Session Description Protocol (SDP). The SDP is a session connection that may comprise one or more Radio Transfer Protocol (RTP) sessions and configured according to service requiring settings and consisting as many RTP sessions as required to satisfy the connection resource requirements. The MGCF a sends a SIP INVITE message to the called terminal (step ). The Session to be established, the second mobile terminal is signaled backwards to MGCF (step ) in a SESSION PROGRESS message and the MGCF a signals a CALL PROCEEDING message to the first mobile terminal (step ). When the first terminal has received the backward signaling from the second mobile terminal, it understands that the IP bearer is established from end to end between the first and second mobile terminals. The (first) (calling) mobile terminal is marked to include a user interface. UI A receives an alerting signaling (such as an audio indication) from the network (step ) that is originally signaled from the second mobile terminal (marked to include user interface, UI B) (step ). When the second mobile terminal (e.g., Eric) answers the initiated video call of the first mobile terminal owned by Susan, an OK SIP message is sent at step  to MGCF and the network element MGCF sends CONNECT message of LLC to first mobile terminal (Susan). Now finally local channels from the first mobile terminal of Susan is established via MGCF  (step ) and MGCF  acknowledges the multimedia connection to be created to the second mobile terminal (the Eric's phone) by sending ACK SIP message (step ).","Now assume after a moment Susan wants to change from video call to audio for instance battery, because of power getting low or money being spent or for any other reason. She selects, from her user interface, a request to switch to an audio alternative. A setup message is sent from the first mobile terminal (step ), including audio e.g. G.723 request to the MGCF. Now the audio profile may be retrieved from Home Subscriber Server, (HSS) (step ) and used in configuring the mapping the Logical Link Control audio connection setup request to Service Description Protocol of an audio connection. The MGCF a sends a SIP INVITE message of audio IP bearer request (step ) to the second mobile terminal (Eric). The session going to be established to the second (called) mobile terminal is signaled backwards first to the network element MGCF (step ) in SESSION PROGRESS message and MGCF  signals CALL PROCEEDINGS message to the first mobile terminal (step ).

The the first (calling) mobile terminal marked to include user interface, UI A receives alerting signaling audio indication from the network (step ) that is originally signaled from the second mobile terminal (marked to include user interface, UI B) (step ). When the called mobile terminal user (e.g., Eric) switches from the video call to the audio an OK SIP message is sent (step ) to MGCF  and the network element MGCF  sends CONNECT message of LLC to first mobile terminal (Susan) (step ). Now finally local channels from the first mobile terminal of Susan is established as H.245 type audio connection via network element MGCF  (step ) and MGCF  acknowledges an audio to be created to the second mobile terminal (the Eric's phone) by sending ACK SIP message (step ). The second mobile terminal may disconnect video connection (including the audio connection) immediately after having sent the SIP OK message of the audio connection (step ). Alternatively, an old audio part of the video connection is maintained concerning the RTP audio connections and only the moving picture part of the multimedia connection is disconnected (step ). The old video connection (including the audio as well) H.324 is disconnected (step ) between MGCF and first mobile terminal after the audio connection H.245 is established (step ).
