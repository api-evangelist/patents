{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/187,745, filed Aug. 7, 2008, which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/863,905, filed Jun. 7, 2004, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/476,189, filed Jun. 6, 2003.","The instant application contains a \u201clengthy\u201d Sequence Listing which has been submitted via CD-R in lieu of a printed paper copy, and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said CD-R, recorded on Oct. 30, 2004, are labeled \u201cCopy 1\u201d and \u201cCopy 2\u201d, respectively, and each contains only one identical 6.71 MB file (44463295.APP).","The present invention relates to polynucleotide sequences isolated from plants that encode transcription factors, together with polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides. In particular, this invention relates to polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences isolated from and and the use of such polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences for regulating gene transcription and gene expression.","During transcription, a single-stranded RNA complementary to the DNA sequence to be transcribed is formed by the action of RNA polymerases. Initiation of transcription in eucaryotic cells is regulated by complex interactions between cis-acting DNA motifs, and trans-acting protein factors. Among the cis-acting regulatory regions are sequences of DNA, termed promoters. A promoter is located close to the transcription initiation site and comprises a nucleotide sequence that associates with an RNA polymerase, either directly or indirectly. Promoters usually consist of proximal (e.g. TATA box) and more distant elements (e.g. CCAAT box). Enhancers are cis-acting DNA motifs which may be situated 5-prime and\/or 3-prime from the initiation site.","Both promoters and enhancers are generally composed of several discrete, often redundant, elements each of which may be recognized by one or more trans-acting regulatory proteins, known as transcription factors. Regulation of the complex patterns of gene expression observed both spatially and temporally, in all developing organisms, is thought to arise from the interaction of enhancer- and promoter-bound, general and tissue-preferred transcription factors with DNA (Izawa T, Foster R and Chua N H, 1993230:1131-1144; Menkens A E, Schindler U and Cashmore A R, 199513:506-510). Developmental decisions in organisms as diverse as and are regulated by transcription factors. These DNA-binding regulatory molecules have been shown to control the expression of genes responsible for the differentiation of different cell types, for example, the differentiation of leaf trichomes and xylem tissue in (Kirik V, Schnittger A, Radchuk V, Adler K, Hulskamp M and Baumlein H, 2001235(2):366-77, Baima S, Possenti M, Matteucci A, Wisman E, Altamura M M, Ruberti I and Morelli G., 2001 126(2):643-55, formation of endoderm from embryonic cells in and the initiation of gene expression in response to environmental and phytohormonal stress in plants (Yanagisawa S and Sheen J, 199810:75-89).","Transcription factors generally bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and either activate or repress transcription initiation. The specific mechanisms of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated. At least three types of separate domains have been identified within transcription factors. One is essential for sequence-specific DNA recognition, one for the activation\/repression of transcriptional initiation, and one for the formation of protein-protein interactions (such as dimerization). Studies indicate that many plant transcription factors can be grouped into distinct classes based on their conserved DNA binding domains (Katagiri F and Chua N H, 1992, 8:22-27; Menkens A E, Schindler U and Cashmore A R, 1995, 13:506-510; Martin C and Paz-Ares J, 1997, 13:67-73). Each member of these families interacts and binds with distinct DNA sequence motifs that are often found in multiple gene promoters controlled by different regulatory signals.","Several transcription factor families have been identified in plants. For example, nucleotide sequences encoding the following transcription factors families have been identified: Alfin-like, AP2 (APETALA2) and EREBPs (ethylene-responsive element binding proteins), ARF, AUX\/IAA, bHLH, bZIP, C2C2 (Zn), C2C2 (Co-like), C2C2 (Dof), C2C2 (GATA), C2C2 (YABBY), C2H2 (Zn), C3H-type, CCAAT, CCAAT HAP3, CCAAT HAP5, CPP (Zn), DRAP1, E2F\/DP, GARP, GRAS, HMG-BOX, HOMED BOX, HSF, Jumanji, LFY, LIM, MADS Box (SEQ ID NO: 3668), MYB, NAC, Polycomb-like, RAV-like, SBP, TCP, TFIID, Transfactor, Trihelix, TUBBY, and WRKY (SEQ ID NO: 3670).","Because transcription factors regulate transcription and orchestrate gene expression in plants and other organisms, control of transcription factor gene expression provides a powerful means for altering plant phenotype. The multigenic control of plant phenotype presents difficulties in determining the genes responsible for phenotypic determination. One major obstacle to identifying genes and gene expression differences that contribute to phenotype in plants is the difficulty with which the expression of more than a handful of genes can be studied concurrently. Another difficulty in identifying and understanding gene expression and the interrelationship of the genes that contribute to plant phenotype is the high degree of sensitivity to environmental factors that plants demonstrate.","There have been recent advances using genome-wide expression profiling. In particular, the use of DNA microarrays has been useful to examine the expression of a large number of genes in a single experiment. Several studies of plant gene responses to developmental and environmental stimuli have been conducted using expression profiling. For example, microarray analysis was employed to study gene expression during fruit ripening in strawberry, Aharoni et al., 129:1019-1031 (2002), wound response in , Cheong et al., 129:661-7 (2002), pathogen response in , Schenk et al., 97:11655-60 (2000), and auxin response in soybean, Thibaud-Nissen et al., 132:118. Whetten et al., 47:275-91 (2001) discloses expression profiling of cell wall biosynthetic genes in L. using cDNA probes. Whetten et al. examined genes which were differentially expressed between differentiating juvenile and mature secondary xylem. Additionally, to determine the effect of certain environmental stimuli on gene expression, gene expression in compression wood was compared to normal wood. A total of 156 of the 2300 elements examined showed differential expression. Whetten, supra at 285. Comparison of juvenile wood to mature wood showed 188 elements as differentially expressed. Id. at 286.","Although expression profiling and, in particular, DNA microarrays provide a convenient tool for genome-wide expression analysis, their use has been limited to organisms for which the complete genome sequence or a large cDNA collection is available. See Hertzberg et al., 98:14732-7 (2001a), Hertzberg et al., 25:585 (2001b). For example, Whetten, supra, states, \u201cA more complete analysis of this interesting question awaits the completion of a larger set of both pine and poplar ESTs.\u201d Whetten et al. at 286. Furthermore, microarrays comprising cDNA or EST probes may not be able to distinguish genes of the same family because of sequence similarities among the genes. That is, cDNAs or ESTs, when used as microarray probes, may bind to more than one gene of the same family.","Methods of manipulating gene expression to yield a plant with a more desirable phenotype would be facilitated by a better understanding of transcription factor gene expression in various types of plant tissue, at different stages of plant development, and upon stimulation by different environmental cues. The ability to control plant architecture and agronomically important traits would be improved by a better understanding of how cell cycle gene expression effects formation of plant tissues, how cell cycle gene expression causes plant cells to enter or exit cell division, and how plant growth and transcription factor gene are connected. Among the large number of transcription factor genes, the expression of which can change during development of a plant, only a fraction are likely to effect phenotype.","Accordingly, there exists a need for transcription factors that can be used for regulating gene expression in plants.","Accordingly, there is a need for transcription factor genes and polynucleotides that can be used for regulating gene expression in plants. Additionally, there is a need for tools and methods which can correlate changes in transcription factor gene expression to phenotype. There is also a need for polynucleotides useful in such methods. There is a further need for methods. There is a further need for methods of identifying transcription factor genes and gene products that impact plant phenotype, and that can be manipulated to obtain a desired phenotype.","In one aspect, the invention provides an isolated polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid sequence that codes for a polypeptide that is capable of at least one of (i) binding to a nucleic acid molecule or (ii) regulating expression of a gene in a plant.","In one embodiment, the polynucleotide is a transcription factor that functions in a plant cell.

Plant Transcription Factor Genes and Proteins","ABI3\/VP1: The maize Vp1 gene and abi3 gene of are believed to be orthologs based on similarities of the mutant phenotypes and amino acid sequence conservation. VP1 fully restores abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity to abi3 mutants during seed germination and suppresses the early flowering phenotype of abi3. VP1 mediates a novel interaction between ABA and auxin signaling that results in developmental arrest and altered patterns of gene expression. (Suzuki M, et al., 2001 28:4:409-18.) Auxin and abscisic acid are important in many plant developmental processes, including leaf and root development (Brady S M, Sarkar S F, Bonetta D and McCourt P, 200334(1):67-75).","AP2: The AP2 (APETALA2) and EREBPs (ethylene-responsive element binding proteins) are the prototypic members of a family of transcription factors unique to plants, whose distinguishing characteristic is that they contain the so-called AP2 DNA-binding domain. AP2\/EREBP genes form a large multigene family, and they play a variety of roles throughout the plant life cycle. AP2\/EREBP genes are key regulators of several developmental processes, including floral organ identity determination and leaf epidermal cell identity. In , the homeotic gene APETALA2 (AP2) has been shown to control three salient processes during development: (1) the specification of flower organ identity throughout floral organogenesis (Jofuku et al., 6:1211-1225, 1994); (2) establishment of flower meristem identity (Irish and Sussex, 2:8:741-753, 1990); and (3) the temporal and spatial regulation of flower homeotic gene activity (Drews et al., 65:6:991-1002, 1991). DNA sequence analysis suggests that AP2 encodes a theoretical polypeptide of 432 aa, with a distinct 68 aa repeated motif termed the AP2 domain. This domain has been shown to be essential for AP2 functions and contains within the 68 aa, an eighteen amino acid core region that is predicted to form an amphipathic \u03b1-helix (Jofuku et al., 6:1211-1225, 1994). Ap2-like domain-containing transcription factors have been also been identified in both (Okamuro et al., 94:7076-7081, 1997) and in tobacco with the identification of the ethylene responsive element binding proteins (EREBPs) (Ohme-Takagi and Shinshi, 7:2:173-182, 1995). In , these RAP2 (related to AP2) genes encode two distinct subfamilies of AP2 domain-containing proteins designated AP2-like and EREBP-like (Okamuro et al., 94:7076-7081, 1997). In vitro DNA binding has not been shown to date using the RAP2 proteins. Based upon the presence of two highly conserved motifs YRG and RAYD (SEQ ID NO: 3672) within the AP2 domain, it has been proposed that binding DNA binding occurs in a manner similar to that of AP2 proteins.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1223","num":"1222"},"i":["Agrobacterium","Agrobacteria ","Agrobacterium tumefaciens ","Agrobacterium rhizogenes "]},"Alfin-like: Alfin1 is a transcription factor that functions in roots. Alfin1 overexpression also improves salt tolerance and root growth of the transgenic plants (Winicov I., 2000, 210(3):416-22).","Angiosperm: vascular plants having seeds enclosed in an ovary. Angiosperms are seed plants that produce flowers that bear fruits. Angiosperms are divided into dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants.","ARF: Auxin response factors (\u201cARFs\u201d) are a recently discovered family of transcription factors that bind with specificity to auxin response elements (AuxREs) in promoters of primary or early auxin-responsive genes. ARFs have an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain related to the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain in the maize transactivator VIVIPAROUS1. Some ARFs contain transcriptional activation domains, while others contain repression domains. ARFs appear to play a pivotal role in auxin-regulated gene expression of primary response genes (Guilfoyle T J, Ulmasov T and Hagen G., 199854(7):619-27). ARF genes in have been shown to be important in controlling both axis formation in the embryo and auxin-dependent cell expansion (Hardtke C S, Ckurshumova W, Vidaurre D P, Singh S A, Stamatiou G, Tiwari S B, Hagen G, Guilfoyle T J and Berleth T., 2004, 131(5):1089-100). Auxin responses are important in meristem and wood development in plants (Uggla C, Magel E, Moritz T and Sundberg B, 2001125(4):2029-39).","ARID: Dead ringer (Dri) is a founding member of a recently defined ARID family of DNA binding proteins whose members share a conserved DNA binding domain termed the A\/T-rich interaction domain. This family includes the B-cell-specific factor Bright and the factor Eyelid (Osa). dri is developmentally regulated, and is expressed in a restricted set of cells including some neural cells and differentiating cells of the gut and salivary gland ducts. It is unlikely that Dri is a general transcription co-factor or chromatin modifier, as is Eyelid, since transcription of only a small number of the genes are disrupted in dri mutant embryos (Valentine, 1998 and Shandala, 1999).","The ARID domain can be found in many genomes of plants, and at least one ARID gene family can be clearly traced from plant to metazoans (Rbbp2 family) by the conservation of the order of multiple conserved domains.","Dri has been shown to be a sequence-specific DNA binding protein. The in vitro sequence specificity of Dri is strikingly similar to that of many homeodomain proteins. Dri preferentially binds the PuATTAA sequence. It is therefore likely that the phenotypes exhibited by dri mutant embryos result from disruption to the expression of regulatory genes. ARID proteins have been implicated in the control of cell growth, differentiation, and development (Wilsker D, Patsialou A, Dallas P B and Moran E., 200213(3):95-106).","AUX\/IAA: Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) is indispensable for plant growth and development. The hormone rapidly and specifically activates within minutes transcription of a select set of early genes that are thought to mediate the various auxin effects, which include effects on meristem and wood development. The concept of early genes or primary response genes has successfully been used in several biological systems to access and explore upstream and downstream segments of signal transduction pathways. Molecular and genetic studies conducted by a number of groups indicate that Aux\/IAA proteins play a central role in auxin responses (Tiwari S B, Hagen G and Guilfoyle T., 200315(2):533-43, Moyle R, Schrader J, Stenberg A, Olsson O, Saxena S, Sandberg G and Bhalerao R P., 200231(6):675-85).","bZIP: The basic\/leucine zipper (bZIP) is a conserved family of transcription factors defined by a basic\/leucine zipper (bZIP) motif (Landschultz et al., 240:1759-1764 (1988); McKnight, 264:54-64 (1991); Foster et al., 8:2::192-200 (1994)). Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is mediated by both the bZIPs and other families of transcription factors, through the concerted action of sequence-specific transcription factors that interact with regulatory elements residing in the promoter regions of the corresponding gene. The bZIP bipartite DNA binding structure consists of a region enriched in basic amino acids (basic region) adjacent to a leucine zipper that is characterized by several leucine residues regularly spaced at seven amino acid intervals (Vinson et al., 246:911-916, 1989). Whereas the basic region directly contacts the DNA, the leucine zipper mediates homodimerisation and heterodimerisation of protein monomers through a parallel interaction of the hydrophobic dimerization interfaces of two -helices, resulting in a coiled-coil structure (O'Shea et al., 243:538-542 (1989); 254:539-544 (1991); Hu et al., 250:1400-1403 (1990); Rasmussen et al., 88:561-564 (1991)).","Dof proteins are a relatively new class of transcription factor and are thought to mediate the regulation of some patterns of plant gene expression in part by combinatorial interactions between bZIP proteins and other types of transcription factors binding to closely linked sites. Such an example of this combinatorial interaction has been observed between bZIP and Dof transcription factors (Singh, 118:1111-1120 (1998)). These Dof proteins possess a single zinc-finger DNA binding domain that is highly conserved in plants (Yanagisawa, 1:213 (1996)). Specific binding of the Dof protein to bZIP transcription factors has been demonstrated and it has been proposed that this specific interaction results in the stimulation of bZIP binding to DNA target sequences in plant promoters (Chen et al., 10:955-966 (1996)). Examples of such Dof\/bZIP interactions have been reported in the literature, including for example, the glutathionine S-transferase-6 gene (GST6) promoter which has been shown to contain several Dof-binding sites closely linked to the ocs element, a recognized bZIP binding site (Singh, 118:1111-1120 (1998)).","The bZIP family of G-box binding factors from (including GBF1, GBF2 and GBF3, for example) interact with the palindromic G-box motif (CCACGTGG). However, it has been demonstrated that the DNA binding specificity of such transcription factors, for example GBF1, may be influenced by the nature of the nucleotides flanking the ACGT core (Schindler et al., 11:1274-1289 (1992a). In vivo transient and transgenic plant expression studies have shown that these ACGT elements are necessary for maximal transcriptional activation and have been identified in a multitude of plant genes regulated by diverse environmental, physiological, and environmental cues. Classification of these transcription factors based upon their ability to bind to the ACGT core motif yielded a relatively diverse group of proteins, including, for example the CamV 35S promoter as-1-binding protein which exhibits DNA binding site requirements distinct from those proteins interacting with the G-box (Tabata et al., 10:1459-1467 (1991)). Thus, in addition to defining the individual classes of bZIP proteins on the basis of their DNA binding specificity, such proteins can also be classified according to their heterodimerisation characteristics (Cao et al., 5:1538-1552, 1991; Schindler et al., 11:1261-1273 (1992b)).","Environmentally inducible promoters require the presence of two cis-acting elements, critical for promoter activity, one of which is the moderately conserved G-box (CCACGTGG) (deVetten et al., 4:10:1295-1307 (1992)). A mutation in one of the two elements abolishes or severely reduces the ability of the promoter to respond to environmental changes. The sequence of the second cis-acting element, positioned near the G-box, is not conserved among different environmentally-inducible promoters, but may be similar among promoters induced by the same signal. The spacing between the G-box and the second cis-acting element appears to be critical, suggesting a direct interaction between the respective binding factors (deVetten and Ferl, 26:9:1055-1068 (1994)); Ramachandran et al., 4:5:642-646, 1994)).","Basic helix-loop-helix zipper proteins represent an additional class of bZIP transcription factors described in the literature and includes, for example, the Myc proteins. These proteins contain two regions characteristic of transcription factors: an N-terminal transactivation domain consisting of several phosphorylation sites, and a C-terminal basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) leucine zipper motif known to mediate dimerization and sequence specific DNA binding via three distinct domains: the leucine zipper, helix-loop-helix, and basic regions (Toledo-Ortiz G, Huq E and Quail P H., 200315(8):1749-70). It is predicted that this family of TFs has a range of different roles in plant cell and tissue development as well as plant metabolism, including specifying epidermal cell fate in roots (Bernhardt C, Lee M M, Gonzalez A, Zhang F, Lloyd A and Schiefelbein J., 2003130(26):6431-9), fruit development (Liljegren S J, Roeder A H, Kempin S A, Gremski K, Ostergaard L, Guimil S, Reyes D K and Yanofsky M F, 2004116(6):843-53), the formation of ER bodies (Matsushima R, Fukao Y, Nishimura M and Hara-Nishimura I., 2004, Plant Cell. May 21 [Epub ahead of print]) and be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis (Ramsay N A, Walker A R, Mooney M and Gray J C, 200352(3):679-88).","CCAAT: The CCAAT-box element identified by Gelinas et al. (313[6000]:323-325, 1985) has been shown to occur between 80 bp and 300 bp from the transcription start site and may operate in either orientation, with possible cooperative interactions with multiple boxes (Tasanen et al., 267:16:11513-11519 (1992)); or other conserved motifs (Muro et al., 267:18:12767-12774 (1992)); Rieping and Schoffl, 231:2:226-232 (1992)). CCAAT-box related motifs have been identified in a number of promoters in a variety of organisms including yeast (Hahn et al., 240:4850:317-321 (1988)), rat (Maity et al., 87:14:5378-5382 (1990)); Vuorio et al., 265:36:22480-22486 (1990)); and plants (Rieping and Schoffl, 231:2:226-232 (1992)); Kehoe et al., 6:8:1123-1134 (1994)). In both yeast and vertebrates, a protein complex has been shown to bind to the CCAAT-motif. In yeast the complex consists of three proteins, known as HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5 (Pinkham and Guarente, 5:12:3410-3416 (1985)).","In there exists an analagous \u201cDR1\u201d transcription factor. The identification of a Dr1-like protein in strongly argues for the ubiquity of this protein among eukaryotic genera and for a conserved mechanism to regulate transcription initiation that involves Dr1. Kuromori & Yamamoto, Cloning of cDNAs from that encode putative protein phosphatase 2C and a human Dr1-like protein by transformation of a fission yeast mutant, 22:24:5296-301 (1994)).","CAATT binding factors have been implicated with plant fertility in (Levesque-Lemay M, Albani D, Aldcorn D, Hammerlindl J, Keller W and Robert L S, 200321(8):804-8. Epub 2003 Mar. 4), and embryogenesis (Lee H, Fischer R L, Goldberg R B and Harada J J. 2003100(4):2152-6).","C2C2 Co-like: The vegetative and reproductive (flowering) phases of development are clearly separated. The onset of flowering is promoted by long photoperiods, but the constans (co) mutant flowers later than wild type under these conditions (Putterill J, Robson F, Lee K, Simon R and Coupland G, 199580(6):847-57; Valverde F, Mouradov A, Soppe W, Ravenscroft D, Samach A and Coupland G, 2004 303(5660):1003-6). Some transgenic plants containing extra copies of CO flowered earlier than wild type, suggesting that CO activity limits flowering time. Double mutants were constructed containing co and mutations affecting gibberellic acid responses, meristem identity, or phytochrome function, and their phenotypes suggested a model for the role of CO in promoting flowering. CO interaction with phytohormone response and meristem identity means that CO-like genes may function to regulate genes in a variety of plant developmental processes.","Despite promoting flowering in response to long days and rice promoting flowering in response to short days, the network controlling this response has been found to be highly conserved in these distantly related plants and controlled by Constans (Simpson G G. 2003, 25(9):829-32).","C2C2 GATA: Many light-responsive promoters, common in plants, contain GATA motifs and a number of nuclear proteins have been defined that interact with these elements. Type-IV zinc-finger proteins have been extensively characterised in animals and fungi and are referred to as GATA factors by virtue of their affinity for promoter elements containing this sequence (Lowry J A and Atchley W R. 200050(2):103-15).","Proteins containing a domain structure containing the C\u2014X2-C\u2014X20-C\u2014X2-C motif (SEQ ID NO: 3673), a CCT domain, and an uncharacterized conserved domain were found exclusively in plants, indicating that they belong to a novel family of plant-specific GATA-type transcription factors. The overexpression of one such factor ZIM in resulted in the elongation of hypocotyls and petiols (Shikata M, Matsuda Y, Ando K, Nishii A, Takemura M, Yokota A and Kohchi T., 200455(397):631-9).","C2C2 YABBY: The expression of these genes is precisely correlated with abaxial cell fate in mutants in which abaxial cell fates are found ectopically, reduced or eliminated. Members of this gene family are responsible for the specification of abaxial cell fate in lateral organs of , such as leaves and floral organs Siegfried K R, Eshed Y, Baum S F, Otsuga D, Drews G N and Bowman J L, 1999, 126(18):4117-28). Yabby also plays a role in other plants, for example it regulates midrib formation by promoting cell proliferation in the central region of the rice leaf (Yamaguchi T, Nagasawa N, Kawasaki S, Matsuoka M, Nagato Y and Hirano H Y. 200416(2):500-9).","C2H2 (Zn): C2H2 zinc finger protein genes encode nucleic acid-binding proteins involved in the regulation of gene activity. AtZFP1 (zinc finger protein 1) is one member of a small family of C2H2 zinc finger-encoding sequences previously characterized from . The genomic sequence corresponding to the AtZFP1 cDNA has been determined. Molecular analysis demonstrates that AtZFP1 is a unique, intronless gene which encodes a 1100 nucleotides mRNA highly expressed in roots and stems (Chrispeels H E, Oettinger H, Janvier N and Tague B W. 200042(2):279-90).","Plant C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors have been identified as playing important roles in floral organogenesis (Yun J Y, Weigel D and Lee I. 200243(1):52-7), flowering time (Kozaki A, Hake S and Colasanti J. 200432(5):1710-20), leaf initiation, lateral shoot initiation, gametogenesis and seed development (Sagasser M, Lu G H, Hahlbrock K and Weisshaar B, 2002, 16(0:138-49).","C3H-type (Zn): C3H type zinc finger proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of cell division in human tumors and may have similar functions in plants.","CPP(ZN): A novel type of DNA-binding protein (CPP1) has been identified interacting with the promoter of the soybean leghemoglobin gene Gmlbc3. The DNA-binding domain of CPP1 contains two similar Cys-rich domains with 9 and 10 Cys, respectively. The cpp1 gene is induced late in nodule development and the expression is confined to the distal part of the central infected tissue of the nodule. A constitutively expressed cpp1 gene reduces the expression of a Gmlbc3 promoter-gusA reporter construct in roots. These data therefore suggest that CPP1 might be involved in the regulation of the leghemoglobin genes in the symbiotic root nodule (Cvitanich C, Pallisgaard N, Nielsen K A, Hansen A C, Larsen K, Pihakaski-Maunsbach K, Marcker K A and Jensen E O, 200097(14):8163-8).","Desired Polynucleotide: a desired polynucleotide of the present invention is a genetic element, such as a promoter, enhancer, or terminator, or gene or polynucleotide that is to be transcribed and\/or translated in a transformed cell that comprises the desired polynucleotide in its genome. If the desired polynucleotide comprises a sequence encoding a protein product, the coding region may be operably linked to regulatory elements, such as to a promoter and a terminator, that bring about expression of an associated messenger RNA transcript and\/or a protein product encoded by the desired polynucleotide. Thus, a \u201cdesired polynucleotide\u201d may comprise a gene that is operably linked in the 5\u2032- to 3\u2032-orientation, a promoter, a gene that encodes a protein, and a terminator. Alternatively, the desired polynucleotide may comprise a gene or fragment thereof, in a \u201csense\u201d or \u201cantisense\u201d orientation, the transcription of which produces nucleic acids that may affect expression of an endogenous gene in the plant cell. A desired polynucleotide may also yield upon transcription a double-stranded RNA product upon that initiates RNA interference of a gene to which the desired polynucleotide is associated. A desired polynucleotide of the present invention may be positioned within a T-DNA, such that the left and right T-DNA border sequences flank or are on either side of the desired polynucleotide. The present invention envisions the stable integration of one or more desired polynucleotides into the genome of at least one plant cell. A desired polynucleotide may be mutated or a variant of its wild-type sequence. It is understood that all or part of the desired polynucleotide can be integrated into the genome of a plant. It also is understood that the term \u201cdesired polynucleotide\u201d encompasses one or more of such polynucleotides. Thus, a T-DNA of the present invention may comprise one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more desired polynucleotides.","Dicotyledonous plant (dicot): a flowering plant whose embryos have two seed halves or cotyledons, branching leaf veins, and flower parts in multiples of four or five. Examples of dicots include but are not limited to, , teak, mahogany, cotton, tobacco, , tomato, potato sugar beet, broccoli, cassava, sweet potato, pepper, poinsettia, bean, alfalfa, soybean, carrot, strawberry, lettuce, oak, maple, walnut, rose, mint, squash, daisy, geranium, avocado, and cactus.","DRAP1: NC2 (Dr1-Drap1) is a bifunctional basal transcription factor that differentially regulates gene transcription through DPE or TATA box motifs. Purified recombinant dNC2 activates DPE-driven promoters and represses TATA-driven promoters. A mutant version of dNC2 can activate DPE promoters but is unable to repress TATA promoters. Thus, the activation and repression functions are distinct. Rice (Song W, Solimeo H, Rupert R A, Yadav N S and Zhu Q, 200214(1):181-95).","E2F\/DP: E2F\/DP complexes play a pivotal role in the regulation of the G1\/S transition in animals. Recently, plant E2F and DP-related homologs have been cloned. Plant E2F homologs exhibit an overall domain organization similar to that of their animal counterparts, although phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that they form a separate subgroup. They are predominantly produced in actively dividing cells with highest transcript levels in early S phase cells (Mariconti L, Pellegrini B, Cantoni R, Stevens R, Bergounioux C, Cella R and Albani D, 2002277(12):9911-9). In tobacco high expression of E2F promotes endoreduplication by accelerating S phase entry in terminally differentiated cells with limited mitotic activity and enhanced E2F activity modulates cell cycle in a cell type-specific manner and affects plant morphology depending on a balance between activities for committing to S phase and M phase (Kosugi S and Ohashi Y. 2003132(4):2012-22). In known promoters, E2F binding regions are found in the promoters of cell division related genes (Egelkrout E M, Mariconti L, Settlage S B, Cella R, Robertson D and Hanley-Bowdoin L. 200214(12):3225-36; Stevens R, Mariconti L, Rossignol P, Perennes C, Cella R and Bergounioux C. 2002277(36):32978-84).","EIL: Overexpression of EIN3 or EIL1 in wild-type plants resulted in a constitutive ethylene phenotype and increased ERF1 expression. These results indicate that EIN3 is a transcription factor that acts as a positive regulator of the ethylene signal-transduction pathway (Chao Q, Rothenberg M, Solano R, Roman G, Terzaghi W and Ecker J R, 199789(7):1133-44). Ethylene is important in many plant processes, including maturation and wood formation.","Endogenous refers to a gene that is native to a plant genome.","Fiber composition: as used herein, fiber composition refers to trait that can be modified to change the structure, appearance, or use of fiber. While not limiting, traits that determine fiber composition include fiber length, coarseness, strength, color, cross-sectional, and fiber density. For example, it is known that fiber length imparts strength, whereas fiber coarseness determines texture and flexibility.","Foreign: \u201cforeign,\u201d with respect to a nucleic acid, means that that nucleic acid is derived from non-plant organisms, or derived from a plant that is not the same species as the plant to be transformed or is not derived from a plant that is not interfertile with the plant to be transformed, does not belong to the species of the target plant. According to the present invention, foreign DNA or RNA represents nucleic acids that are naturally occurring in the genetic makeup of fungi, bacteria, viruses, mammals, fish or birds, but are not naturally occurring in the plant that is to be transformed. Thus, a foreign nucleic acid is one that encodes, for instance, a polypeptide that is not naturally produced by the transformed plant. A foreign nucleic acid does not have to encode a protein product.","GARP: GARP transcription factors are represented by the family of Response Regulator (ARR) genes that mediate responses to cytokinin and ethylene. The ARR family can be divided into two groups, Type A and Type B, which differ in their sequence and domain structure. Type A genes are responsive to cytokinin, while Type B genes are induced by ethylene and osmotic stress. Both Type A and Type B family genes have a two-component signal transduction system. comprising a histidyl-aspartyl phosphorelay and a response regulator receiver. Stock et al., 69:183-215 (2000).","Gene: A gene is a segment of a DNA molecule that contains all the information required for synthesis of a product, polypeptide chain or RNA molecule, that includes both coding and non-coding sequences.","Genetic element: a \u201cgenetic element\u201d is any discreet nucleotide sequence such as, but not limited to, a promoter, gene, terminator, intron, enhancer, spacer, 5\u2032-untranslated region, 3\u2032-untranslated region, or recombinase recognition site.","Genetic modification: stable introduction of DNA into the genome of certain organisms by applying methods in molecular and cell biology.","Gymnosperm: as used herein, refers to a seed plant that bears seed without ovaries. Examples of gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, ginkgos, and ephedras.","GRAS: Sequence analysis of the products of the GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR) gene family indicates that they share a variable amino-terminus and a highly conserved carboxyl-terminus that contains five recognizable motifs. The importance of the GRAS gene family in plant biology has been established by the functional analyses of SCR, GAI and RGA. These genes appear to have a function in patterning, particularly radial patterning, which is important in the development of stems, roots and floral organs (Pysh, et al., 18:111-119 (1999)). GRAS proteins exert important roles in very diverse processes such as signal transduction, meristem maintenance and development (Bolle C., 2004, 218(5):683-92).","Homeotic transcription factors: In animals, homeotic transcription factors have, in animals, been implicated in a number of developmental processes including, for example, the control of pattern formation in insects and vertebrate embryos and the specification of cell differentiation in many tissues (Ingham, 335:25-34 (1988)); McGinnis and Krumlauf, 68:283-302 (1992)). Homeodomain secondary structures are characterized by a distinctive helix-turn-helix motif initially identified in bacterial DNA binding domains. This helix-turn-helix sequence\/structure motif spans approximately 20 amino acids and is characterized by two short helices separated by a sharp 90 degree bend or turn (Harrison and Aggarwal, 59:933-969 (1990)). This helix has been shown to bind in the major groove of the DNA helix.","Plant homeobox genes have been identified in a number of plant species including , maize, parsley and soybean. Expression pattern analysis of maize homeobox gene family members suggests that these transcription factors may be involved in defining specific regions in the vegetative apical meristem, potentially involved in the initiation of leaf structures (Jackson et al., 120:405-413 (1994). Such observations imply that the plant homeobox genes, as for the animal homeobox genes, may be involved in the determination of cell fate.","Homeodomain-zipper (HD-zip) represents an additional family of homeodomain proteins. These homeodomain-zipper proteins (HD-zip) possess both the characteristic homeodomain linked to an additional leucine zipper dimerization motif. This family includes, for example, Athb-1 and Athb-2 (Sessa et al., 12:3507-3517 (1993) and Athb-4 (Carabelli et al., 4:469-479 (1993).","HSF: Heat shock factors (HSF) are the transcriptional activators of the heat shock response. The conversion of constitutively expressed HSF to a form that can bind DNA requires the trimerization of the protein, involving leucine zipper interactions as shown for yeast, , chicken and human HSFs. Like other metazoan HSFs, the endogenous HSF displays heat shock-inducible DNA-binding activity in gel retardation assays (Hubel A, Lee J H, Wu C and Schoffl F, 1995248(2):136-41). Overexpression of heat shock protein in plants results in plants exhibiting a thermotolerance (Sanmiya K, Suzuki K, Egawa Y and Shono M. 2004, 557(1-3):265-8; Sung D Y and Guy C L. 2003132(2):979-87).","Introduction: as used herein, refers to the insertion of a nucleic acid sequence into a cell, by methods including infection, transfection, transformation or transduction.","Jumonji: There is an absence of literature regarding jumonji transcriptional regulators in plants. In animals, however, there is a small amount of literature covering this family. Overexpression has been shown to decrease cell proliferation and suggests a role during regulation of cell proliferation signaling (Ohno T, Nakajima K, Kojima M, Toyoda M and Takeuchi T, 2004317(3):925-9; Kitajima K, Kojima M, Kondo S and Takeuchi T, 200129(4):507-14). The jumonji protein contains an ARID domain and a jmjC domain. Frequently, jumonji proteins are associated with a small N-terminal jmjN domain and\/or a C-terminal ZnC5HC2 domain and\/or a PHD Zn finger (Toyoda M, Kojima M, Takeuchi T. 2000274(2):332-6).","Juvenility: describes a physiological difference between a young tree and a mature tree. In the present invention, juvenility refers to differences in microfibril angle, wood density, cellulose yield, regenerability, and reproductive ability between a young tree and a mature tree. For example, it has been shown that as a plant tissue matures, the tissue loses its ability to regenerate.","Lignin: as used herein, refers to a polymeric composition composed of phenylpropanoid units, including polymerized derivatives of monolignols coniferyl, coumaryl, and sinapyl alcohol. Lignin quality refers to the ability of a lignin composition to impart strength to cell wall matrices, assist in the transport of water, and\/or impede degradation of cell wall polysaccharides. Lignin composition or lignin structure may be changed by altering the relative amounts of each of monolignols or by altering the type of lignin. For example, guaiacyl lignins (derived from ferulic acid) are prominent in softwood species, whereas guaiacyl-syringyl lignins (derived from ferulic acid and sinapic acid) are characteristic of hardwood species. The degradation of lignin from softwoods, such as pine, requires substantially more alkali and longer incubations, compared with the removal of lignin from hardwoods. Additionally, lignin composition may be regulated by either up-regulation or down-regulation of enzymes involved lignin biosynthesis. For example, key lignin biosynthsesis enzymes include 4-coumaric acid: coenzyme A ligase (4CL), Cinnamyl Alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), and Sinapyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase (SAD).","LIM: The LIM domain is a specialized double-zinc finger motif found in a variety of proteins, in association with domains of divergent functions, such as the homeodomain (see the sunflower pollen-specific SF3 transcription factor: Baltz et al., 2:713-721 (1992) or forming proteins composed primarily of LIM domains: Dawid et al., 144:156-162 (1998). LIM domains interact specifically with other LIM domains and with many different protein domains. LIM domains are thought to function as protein interaction modules, mediating specific contacts between members of functional complexes and modulating the activity of some of the constituent proteins. Nucleic acid binding by LIM domains, while suggested by structural considerations, remains an unproven possibility. However, it is possible that together with the homeodomain, the LIM domain could bind to the regulatory regions of developmentally controlled genes, as has been proposed for the paired box, a conserved sequence motif first identified in the paired (PRD) and gooseberry (GSB) homeodomain proteins from (Triesman et al., 5:594-604 (1991). The PRD box is also able to bind DNA in the absence of the homeodomain. LIM-domain proteins can be nuclear, cytoplasmic, or can shuttle between compartments. In the animal systems, several important LIM proteins have been shown to be associated with the cytoskeleton, having a role in adhesion-plaque and actin-microfilament organization. Among nuclear LIM proteins, the LIM homeodomain proteins form a major subfamily with important functions in cell lineage determination and pattern formation during animal development. In plants, a LIM protein has been demonstrated to control a number of genes in the lignin biosynthesis pathway, critically important for developing wood (Kawaoka A, Ebinuma H 2001 Transcriptional control of lignin biosynthesis by tobacco LIM protein. 57:1149-1157, Kawaoka et al. 22: 289-301 (2000).","MADS: MADS box (SEQ ID NO: 3668) transcription factors interact with a conserved region of DNA known as the MADS box. All MADS box (SEQ ID NO: 3668) transcription factors contain a conserved DNA-binding\/dimerization region, known as the MADS domain (SEQ ID NO: 3668), which has been identified throughout the different kingdoms (Riechmann and Meyerowitz, 378:10:1079-1101 (1997). Many of the MADS box (SEQ ID NO: 3668) genes isolated from plants are expressed primarily in floral meristems or floral organs, and are believed to play a role in either specifying inflorescence and floral meristem identity or in determining floral organ identity. One class of regulatory genes responsible for floral meristem identity and the pattern of meristem development includes the genes APETALA1 (AP1), APETALA2 (AP2), CAULIFLOWER(CAL), LEAFY (LFY) and AGAMOUS (AG) from . Both LFY and AP1 have been shown to encode putative transcription factors (Weigel et al., 69:843-859 (1992), with AP1 and AG each encoding putative transcription factors of the MADS box domain family (Yanofsky et al., 346:35-39 (1990). Mutations in the Lfy gene have been shown to result in a partial conversion of flowers into inflorescence shoots. MADS box (SEQ ID NO: 3668) genes are required for anther and pollen maturation (Schreiber D N, Bantin J and Dresselhaus T. 2004134(3):1069-79), the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in plants (Murai K, Miyamae M, Kato H, Takumi S and Ogihara Y. 200344(12):1255-65) an flowering time (Trevaskis B, Bagnall D J, Ellis M H, Peacock W J and Dennis E S. 2003100(22):13099-104).","Monocotyledonous plant (monocot): a flowering plant having embryos with one cotyledon or seed leaf, parallel leaf veins, and flower parts in multiples of three. Examples of monocots include, but are not limited to turfgrass, maize, rice, oat, wheat, barley, sorghum, orchid, iris, lily, onion, and palm. Examples of turfgrass include, but are not limited to spp. (bentgrass species including colonial bentgrass and creeping bentgrasses), (kentucky bluegrass), spp. (ryegrass species including annual ryegrass and perennial ryegrass), (tall fescue) commutata (fine fescue), (common bermudagrass varieties including Tifgreen, Tifway II, and Santa Ana, as well as hybrids thereof); (kikuyugrass), (st. augustinegrass), (zoysiagrass), and ","Myb: The Myb family of transcription factors is a group of functionally diverse transcriptional activators found in both plants and animals that is characterized by a conserved amino-terminal DNA-binding domain containing either two (in plant species) or three (in animal species) imperfect tandem repeats of approximately 50 amino acids (Rosinski and Atchley, 46:1:74-83 (1998) Stober-Grasser et al., 7:3:589-596 (1992). Comparisons between the amino acid sequences of representative plant and mammalian MYB proteins indicate that there is a greater conservation between the same repeat from different proteins, than between the R2 and R3 repeats from the same protein (Martin and Paz-Ares, 13:2:67-73 (1997). More than 100 MYB genes have been reported from (Romero et al., 14:3:273-284 (1998), Myb genes such at AtmybL2 have been isolated that include only one of the typical two or three tryptophan repeats found in other myb-like proteins (Kirik & Baumlein, 183(1-2):109-13 (1996)). A myb-like gene has been previously isolated from developing xylem, and when ectopically expressed in transgenic plants, the plants showed accelerated lignification (Patzlaff A, McInnis S, Courtenay A, Surman C, Newman L J, Smith C, Bevan M W, Mansfield S, Whetten R W, Sederoff R R, Campbell M M. 200336(6):743-54). A pine myb gene Pt MYB1 may regulate transcription from cis-acting AC elements in pine xylem (Patzlaff A, Newman L J, Dubos C, Whetten R W, Smith C, McInnis S, Bevan M W, Sederoff R R and Campbell M M. 200353(4):597-608).","DNA-binding studies have demonstrated that there are differences, but also frequent overlaps, in binding specificity among plant MYB proteins, in line with the distinct but often related functions that are beginning to be recognized for these proteins. Studies involving the eight putative base-contacting residues in MYB DNA binding domains have revealed that at least six are fully conserved in all plant MYB proteins identified to date and the remaining two are conserved in at least 80% of these proteins (Martin and Paz-Ares, 13:2:67-73 (1997). Mutational analysis involving residues that do not contact bases have indicated that the sequence-specific binding capacity of MYBs is affected and this may account for some of the differences in the DNA-binding specificity between plant MYB proteins (Solano et al., 272:5:2889-2895 (1997). This large-sized gene family may contribute to the regulatory flexibility underlying the developmental and metabolic plasticity displayed by plants.","NAC: NAC proteins are characterized by their conserved N-terminal NAC domains that can bind both DNA and other proteins. The NAC domain consists of a twisted beta-sheet surrounded by a few helical elements. NAC proteins are involved in developmental processes, including formation of the shoot apical meristem, floral organs and lateral shoots, as well as in plant hormonal control and defense (Ernst H A, Olsen A N, Larsen S AND Lo Leggio L. 20045(3):297-303). Auxin plays a key role in lateral root formation, but the signaling pathway for this process is poorly understood. NAC1, a new member of the NAC family, is induced by auxin and mediates auxin signaling to promote lateral root development. NAC1 is a transcription activator consisting of an N-terminal conserved NAC-domain that binds to DNA and a C-terminal activation domain. This factor activates the expression of two downstream auxin-responsive genes, DBP and AIR3.","NIN-like: The NIN protein was discovered via a mutant phenotype conferring arrested nodule development. It was demonstrated that the NIN protein is required for the formation of infection threads and nodule primordia. NIN protein has sequence similarity to transcription factors, and a predicted DNA-binding\/dimerization domain similar to other plant proteins involved in nitrogen related processes (Schauser L, Roussis A, Stiller J and Stougaard J. 19991999 402(6758):191-5). The NIN-like family of transcription factors is characterized by the RWP-RK domain (SEQ ID NO: 3669) (Borisov A Y, Madsen L H, Tsyganov V E, Umehara Y, Voroshilova V A, Batagov A O, Sandal N, Mortensen A, Schauser L, Ellis N, Tikhonovich I A and Stougaard J. 2003131(3):1009-17). An N-terminal Octicosapeptide (OPR) is found in 11 out of 19 of the plant NIN-like proteins.","Operably linked: combining two or more molecules in such a fashion that in combination they function properly in a plant cell. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a structural gene when the promoter controls transcription of the structural gene.","Phenotype: phenotype is a distinguishing feature or characteristic of a plant, which may be altered according to the present invention by integrating one or more \u201cdesired polynucleotides\u201d and\/or screenable\/selectable markers into the genome of at least one plant cell of a transformed plant. The \u201cdesired polynucleotide(s)\u201d and\/or markers may confer a change in the phenotype of a transformed plant, by modifying any one of a number of genetic, molecular, biochemical, physiological, morphological, or agronomic characteristics or properties of the transformed plant cell or plant as a whole. Thus, expression of one or more, stably integrated desired polynucleotide(s) in a plant genome, may yield a phenotype selected from the group consisting of, but not limited to, increased drought tolerance, enhanced cold and frost tolerance, improved vigor, enhanced color, enhanced health and nutritional characteristics, improved storage, enhanced yield, enhanced salt tolerance, enhanced heavy metal tolerance, increased disease tolerance, increased insect tolerance, increased water-stress tolerance, enhanced sweetness, improved vigor, improved taste, improved texture, decreased phosphate content, increased germination, increased micronutrient uptake, improved starch composition, and improved flower longevity.","Plant tissue: a \u201cplant\u201d is any of various photosynthetic, eukaryotic, multicellular organisms of the kingdom Plantae characteristically producing embryos, containing chloroplasts, and having cellulose cell walls. A part of a plant, i.e., a \u201cplant tissue\u201d may be treated according to the methods of the present invention to produce a transgenic plant. Many suitable plant tissues can be transformed according to the present invention and include, but are not limited to, somatic embryos, pollen, leaves, stems, calli, stolons, microtubers, and shoots. Thus, the present invention envisions the transformation of angiosperm and gymnosperm plants such as turfgrass, wheat, maize, rice, barley, oat, sugar beet, potato, tomato, tobacco, alfalfa, lettuce, carrot, strawberry, cassava, sweet potato, geranium, soybean, oak, pine, fir, acacia, , walnut, and palm. According to the present invention \u201cplant tissue\u201d also encompasses plant cells. Plant cells include suspension cultures, callus, embryos, meristematic regions, callus tissue, leaves, roots, shoots, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen, seeds and microspores. Plant tissues may be at various stages of maturity and may be grown in liquid or solid culture, or in soil or suitable media in pots, greenhouses or fields. A plant tissue also refers to any clone of such a plant, seed, progeny, propagule whether generated sexually or asexually, and descendents of any of these, such as cuttings or seed. Of particular interest are conifers such as pine, fir and spruce, monocots such as Kentucky bluegrass, creeping bentgrass, maize, and wheat, and dicots such as cotton, tomato, lettuce, , tobacco, and geranium.","Plant transformation and cell culture: broadly refers to the process by which plant cells are genetically modified and transferred to an appropriate plant culture medium for maintenance, further growth, and\/or further development. Such methods are well known to the skilled artisan.","POLYCOMB: Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play an important role in developmental and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in fruit fly () and mammals. Recent evidence has shown that homologs of PcG proteins are also important for the regulation of plant development. Recent studies in plants have shown that PcG proteins regulate diverse developmental processes and, as in animals, they affect both homeotic gene expression and cell proliferation (Reyes J C and Grossniklaus U. 200314(1):77-84). PcG proteins have also been shown to repress expression of introduced and endogenous genes in fruit fly. All examples of polycomb-based repression likely operate through formation of a repressive chromatin structure (Hsieh T F, Hakim O, Ohad N and Fischer R L. 2003, 8(9):439-45).","Progeny: a \u201cprogeny\u201d of the present invention, such as the progeny of a transgenic plant, is one that is born of, begotten by, or derived from a plant or the transgenic plant. Thus, a \u201cprogeny\u201d plant, i.e., an \u201cF1\u201d generation plant is an offspring or a descendant of the transgenic plant produced by the inventive methods. A progeny of a transgenic plant may contain in at least one, some, or all of its cell genomes, the desired polynucleotide that was integrated into a cell of the parent transgenic plant by the methods described herein. Thus, the desired polynucleotide is \u201ctransmitted\u201d or \u201cinherited\u201d by the progeny plant. The desired polynucleotide that is so inherited in the progeny plant may reside within a T-DNA construct, which also is inherited by the progeny plant from its parent. The term \u201cprogeny\u201d as used herein, also may be considered to be the offspring or descendants of a group of plants.","Promoter: promoter is intended to mean a nucleic acid, preferably DNA, that binds RNA polymerase and\/or other transcription regulatory elements. As with any promoter, the promoters of the current invention will facilitate or control the transcription of DNA or RNA to generate an mRNA molecule from a nucleic acid molecule that is operably linked to the promoter. As stated earlier, the RNA generated may code for a protein or polypeptide or may code for an RNA interfering, or antisense molecule.","A plant promoter is a promoter capable of initiating transcription in plant cells whether or not its origin is a plant cell. Exemplary plant promoters include, but are not limited to, those that are obtained from plants, plant viruses, and bacteria such as or which comprise genes expressed in plant cells. Examples of promoters under developmental control include promoters that preferentially initiate transcription in certain tissues, such as xylem, leaves, roots, or seeds. Such promoters are referred to as tissue-preferred promoters. Promoters which initiate transcription only in certain tissues are referred to as tissue-specific promoters. A cell type-specific promoter primarily drives expression in certain cell types in one or more organs, for example, vascular cells in roots or leaves. An inducible or repressible promoter is a promoter which is under environmental control. Examples of environmental conditions that may effect transcription by inducible promoters include anaerobic conditions or the presence of light. Tissue specific, tissue preferred, cell type specific, and inducible promoters constitute the class of non-constitutive promoters. A constitutive promoter is a promoter which is active under most environmental conditions, and in most plant parts.","Polynucleotide is a nucleotide sequence, comprising a gene coding sequence, or a fragment thereof, (comprising at least 15 consecutive nucleotides, preferably at least 30 consecutive nucleotides, and more preferably at least 50 consecutive nucleotides), a promoter, an intron, an enhancer region, a polyadenylation site, a translation initiation site, 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 untranslated regions, a reporter gene, a selectable marker or the like. The polynucleotide may comprise single stranded or double stranded DNA or RNA. The polynucleotide may comprise modified bases or a modified backbone. The polynucleotide may be genomic, an RNA transcript (such as an mRNA) or a processed nucleotide sequence (such as a cDNA). The polynucleotide may comprise a sequence in either sense or antisense orientations.","An isolated polynucleotide is a polynucleotide sequence that is not in its native state, e.g., the polynucleotide is comprised of a nucleotide sequence not found in nature or the polynucleotide is separated from nucleotide sequences with which it typically is in proximity or is next to nucleotide sequences with which it typically is not in proximity.","RAY-like: RAV-like transcription factors are unique to higher plants. RAV stands for Related to ABI3\/VP1 and have been placed in the AP2 EREBP transcription factor family because they contain the AP2 domain. However, they also contain a domain homologous to the B3 domain. The AP2 domain binds to 5\u2032-CAACA-3\u2032 and the B3 domain binds to 5\u2032-CACCTG-3\u2032. This dual binding is autonomous and achieves high affinity and specificity of binding (Kagaya Y, Ohmiya K and Hattori T. 199927(2):470-8). Interestingly, some RAV-like proteins, such as those found in , contain only the B3 domain.","Regenerability: as used herein, refers to the ability of a plant to redifferentiate from a de-differentiated tissue.","SBP: The SPL gene family represents a group of structurally diverse genes encoding putative transcription factors found apparently only in plants. The distinguishing characteristic of the SPL gene family is the SBP-box encoding a conserved protein domain of 76 amino acids in length, the SBP-domain, which is responsible for the interaction with DNA. SBP genes appear to have a function in differentiation of plant organs, both in vegetative and floral organs (Unte U S, Sorensen A M, et al. 200315(4):1009-19; Cardon et al.; Gene 237:91-104 (1999); Moreno et al.; Genes Dev. 11:616-628 (1997); Cardon et al.; Plant J. 12:367-377 (1997)). SBP box genes have been isolated from trees and implicated in the regulation of flower development (Lannenpaa M, Janonen I, Holtta-Vuori M, Gardemeister M, Porali I and Sopanen T. 2004120(3):491-500).","Seed: a \u201cseed\u201d may be regarded as a ripened plant ovule containing an embryo, and a propagative part of a plant, as a tuber or spore. Seed may be incubated prior to -mediated transformation, in the dark, for instance, to facilitate germination. Seed also may be sterilized prior to incubation, such as by brief treatment with bleach. The resultant seedling can then be exposed to a desired strain of ","Selectable\/screenable marker: a gene that, if expressed in plants or plant tissues, makes it possible to distinguish them from other plants or plant tissues that do not express that gene. Screening procedures may require assays for expression of proteins encoded by the screenable marker gene. Examples of such markers include the beta glucuronidase (GUS) gene and the luciferase (LUX) gene. Examples of selectable markers include the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) gene encoding kanamycin and geneticin resistance, the hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT or APHIV) gene encoding resistance to hygromycin, acetolactate synthase (als) genes encoding resistance to sulfonylurea-type herbicides, genes (BAR and\/or PAT) coding for resistance to herbicides which act to inhibit the action of glutamine synthase such as phosphinothricin (Liberty or Basta), or other similar genes known in the art.","Sequence identity: as used herein, \u201csequence identity\u201d or \u201cidentity\u201d in the context of two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences includes reference to the residues in the two sequences which are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified region. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g. charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. Where sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences which differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have \u201csequence similarity\u201d or \u201csimilarity.\u201d Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., according to the algorithm of Meyers and Miller, 4: 11-17 (1988) e.g., as implemented in the program PC\/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif., USA).","As used herein, percentage of sequence identity means the value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.","\u201cSequence identity\u201d has an art-recognized meaning and can be calculated using published techniques. See CMB, Lesk, ed. (Oxford University Press, 1988), B: IAGP, Smith, ed. (Academic Press, 1993), CAOSD, PI, Griffin & Griffin, eds., (Humana Press, 1994), SAIMB, Von Heinje ed., Academic Press (1987), SAP, Gribskov & Devereux, eds. (Macmillan Stockton Press, 1991), and Carillo & Lipton, 48: 1073 (1988). Methods commonly employed to determine identity or similarity between two sequences include but are not limited to those disclosed in GTHC, Bishop, ed., (Academic Press, 1994) and Carillo & Lipton, supra. Methods to determine identity and similarity are codified in computer programs. Preferred computer program methods to determine identity and similarity between two sequences include but are not limited to the GCG program package (Devereux et al., 12: 387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, FASTA (Atschul et al., 215: 403 (1990)), and FASTDB (Brutlag et al., 6: 237 (1990)).","TCP: The TCP family has been termed after its first characterised members (TB1, CYC and PCFs). They are expressed in rapidly growing floral primordia. This, together with the proposed involvement of cyc and tb1 in influencing meristem growth, suggests that many members of the TCP family may affect cell division (Cubas P, Lauter N, Doebley J and Coen E. 199918(2):215-22).","Transcription factor: Transcription factor refers to a polypeptide sequence that regulates the expression of a gene or genes by either directly binding to one or more nucleotide sequences associated with a gene coding sequence or indirectly affecting the activity of another polypeptide(s) that binds directly to one or more nucleotide sequences associated with a gene coding sequence. A transcription factor may activate (up-regulate) or repress (down-regulate) expression of a gene or genes. A transcription factor may contain a DNA binding domain, an activation domain, or a domain for protein-protein interactions. In the present invention, a transcription factor is capable of at least one of (1) binding to a nucleic acid sequence or (2) regulating expression of a gene in a plant. Additionally, the inventive polynucleotide sequences and the corresponding polypeptide sequences function as transcription factors in any plant species, including angiosperms and gymnosperms.","Transcription and translation terminators: The expression DNA constructs of the present invention typically have a transcriptional termination region at the opposite end from the transcription initiation regulatory region. The transcriptional termination region may be selected, for stability of the mRNA to enhance expression and\/or for the addition of polyadenylation tails added to the gene transcription product. Translation of a nascent polypeptide undergoes termination when any of the three chain-termination codons enters the A site on the ribosome. Translation termination codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA.","Transfer DNA (T-DNA): an T-DNA is a genetic element that is well-known as an element capable of integrating a nucleotide sequence contained within its borders into another genome. In this respect, a T-DNA is flanked, typically, by two \u201cborder\u201d sequences. A desired polynucleotide of the present invention and a selectable marker may be positioned between the left border-like sequence and the right border-like sequence of a T-DNA. The desired polynucleotide and selectable marker contained within the T-DNA may be operably linked to a variety of different, plant-specific (i.e., native), or foreign nucleic acids, like promoter and terminator regulatory elements that facilitate its expression, i.e., transcription and\/or translation of the DNA sequence encoded by the desired polynucleotide or selectable marker.","Transformation of plant cells: A process by which a nucleic acid is stably inserted into the genome of a plant cell. Transformation may occur under natural or artificial conditions using various methods well known in the art. Transformation may rely on any known method for the insertion of nucleic acid sequences into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, including -mediated transformation protocols, viral infection, whiskers, electroporation, microinjection, polyethylene glycol-treatment, heat shock, lipofection and particle bombardment.","Transgenic plant: a transgenic plant of the present invention is one that comprises at least one cell genome in which an exogenous nucleic acid has been stably integrated. According to the present invention, a transgenic plant is a plant that comprises only one genetically modified cell and cell genome, or is a plant that comprises some genetically modified cells, or is a plant in which all of the cells are genetically modified. A transgenic plant of the present invention may be one that comprises expression of the desired polynucleotide, i.e., the exogenous nucleic acid, in only certain parts of the plant. Thus, a transgenic plant may contain only genetically modified cells in certain parts of its structure.","Trihelix: GT factors have either one or two trihelix DNA binding domains, distantly related to Myb DNA binding domains. Trihelix domains were discovered in proteins that bind to GT elements found in the promoters of many light responsive genes. To date, DNA-binding proteins characterized by the trihelix motif have been described only in plants, and may therefore be involved in plant-specific processes. Smalle et al.; 95, 3318-3322 (1998). Trihelix genes have been shown to be important for light regulated gene expression (Nagano Y, Inaba T, Furuhashi H and Sasaki Y. 2001276(25):22238-43; Wang R, Hong G and Han B, 2004, 324:105-15). Light responsiveness is important in many plant developmental processes.","TUB: TUB and TUBBY are transcription factors originally characterized in mouse, where they are important in nervous-system function and development (Carroll K, Gomez C and Shapiro L, 20045(1):55-63). Though similar sequences have been found in plants their function is unknown. 11 Tubby-like sequences have been identified in and one of this has been shown to possibly participate in the ABA signaling pathway (Lai C P, Lee C L, Chen P H, Wu S H, Yang C C and Shaw J F. 2004134(4):1586-97).","Variant: a \u201cvariant,\u201d as used herein, is understood to mean a nucleotide or amino acid sequence that deviates from the standard, or given, nucleotide or amino acid sequence of a particular gene or protein. The terms, \u201cisoform,\u201d \u201cisotype,\u201d and \u201canalog\u201d also refer to \u201cvariant\u201d forms of a nucleotide or an amino acid sequence. An amino acid sequence that is altered by the addition, removal or substitution of one or more amino acids, or a change in nucleotide sequence, may be considered a \u201cvariant\u201d sequence. The variant may have \u201cconservative\u201d changes, wherein a substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties, e.g., replacement of leucine with isoleucine. A variant may have \u201cnonconservative\u201d changes, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan. Analogous minor variations may also include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted, or deleted may be found using computer programs well known in the art such as Vector NTI Suite (InforMax, MD) software. \u201cVariant\u201d may also refer to a \u201cshuffled gene\u201d such as those described in Maxygen-assigned patents. For instance, a variant of the present invention may include variants of sequences and desired polynucleotides that are modified according to the methods and rationale disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,970, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Wood composition, as used herein, refers to trait that can be modified to change the structure, appearance, or use of wood. While not limiting, traits that determine wood composition include cell wall thickness, cell length, cell density, microfibril angle, tensile strength, tear strength, wood color, and length and frequency of cell division.","Wood pulp refers to fiber generated from wood having varying degrees of purification. Wood pulp can be used for producing paper, paper board, and chemical products.","The invention provides methods of obtaining wood, wood pulp, paper, and oil from a plant transformed with a construct of the present invention. Methods for transforming and selecting a transgenic plant are are known in the art. For example, pine can be cultured and grown as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002\/0100083. can be cultured and grown as in, for example, Rydelius, et al., Growing for Pulp and Energy, presented at the Mechanization in Short Rotation, Intensive Culture Forestry Conference, Mobile, Ala., 1994. Wood, wood pulp, paper, and oil can be obtained from the plant by any means known in the art.","As noted above, the wood and wood pulp obtained in accordance with this invention may demonstrate improved characteristics including, but not limited to any one or more of lignin composition, lignin structure, wood composition, cellulose polymerization, fiber dimensions, ratio of fibers to other plant components, plant cell division, plant cell development, number of cells per unit area, cell size, cell shape, cell wall composition, rate of wood formation, aesthetic appearance of wood, formation of stem defects, rate of growth, rate of root formation ratio of root to branch vegetative development, leaf area index, and leaf shape include increased or decreased lignin content, increased accessibility of lignin to chemical treatments, improved reactivity of lignin, increased or decreased cellulose content increased dimensional stability, increased tensile strength, increased shear strength, increased compression strength, increased shock resistance, increased stiffness, increased or decreased hardness, decreased spirality, decreased shrinkage, and differences in weight, density, and specific gravity.","Phenotype can be assessed by any suitable means. The plants can be evaluated based on their general morphology. Transgenic plants can be observed with the naked eye, can be weighed and their height measured. The plant can be examined by isolating individual layers of plant tissue, namely phloem and cambium, which is further sectioned into meristematic cells, early expansion, late expansion, secondary wall formation, and late cell maturation. See, e.g., Hertzberg, supra. The plants also can be assessed using microscopic analysis or chemical analysis.","Microscopic analysis includes examining cell types, stage of development, and stain uptake by tissues and cells. Fiber morphology, such as fiber wall thickness and microfibril angle of wood pulp fibers can be observed using, for example, microscopic transmission ellipsometry. See Ye and Sundstr\u00f6m, 80:181 (1997). Wood strength, density, and grain slope in wet wood and standing trees can be determined by measuring the visible and near infrared spectral data in conjunction with multivariate analysis. See, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002\/0107644 and 2002\/0113212. Lumen size can be measured using scanning electron microscopy. Lignin structure and chemical properties can be observed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as described in Marita et al., 12939 (2001).","The biochemical characteristic of lignin, cellulose, carbohydrates and other plant extracts can be evaluated by any standard analytical method known including spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, HPLC, mass spectroscopy, and tissue staining methods.","WRKY (Zn): The WRKY (SEQ ID NO: 3670) proteins are a superfamily of transcription factors with up to 100 representatives in . Family members appear to be involved in the regulation of various physiological programs that are unique to plants, including, GA signaling, pathogen defense, senescence and trichome development (Zhang Z L, Xie Z, Zou X, Casaretto J, Ho T H, Shen Q J. 2004134(4):1500-13; Kim C Y and Zhang S., 200438(1):142-51; Robatzek S and Somssich I E. 2002, 16(9):1139-49; Johnson C S, Kolevski B and Smyth D R. 200214(6):1359-75). In spite of the strong conservation of their DNA-binding domain, the overall structures of WRKY (SEQ ID NO: 3670) proteins are highly divergent and can be categorized into distinct groups, which might reflect their different functions.","Zinc finger: Zinc finger domains of the type CysHisappear to represent the most abundant DNA binding motif in eukaryotic transcription factors, with several thousand being identified to date (Berg and Shi, 271:5252:1081-1085 (1996). A structural role for zinc in transcription factors was initially proposed in 1983 for the transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) (Hanas et al., 258[23]:14120-14125, 1983). The CysHisZinc finger domains are characterized by tandem arrays of sequences of C-x(2,4)-C-x(3)-[LIVMFYWC]-x(8)-H-x(3,5)-H (SEQ ID NO: 3674) (where X represents a variable amino acid). Structurally, the zinc finger consists of two antiparallel a strands followed by an \u03b1-helix (Lee et al., 245:4918:635-637 (1989). This structural arrangement allows for the cysteine and histidine side chains to coordinate the zinc with the three other conserved residues forming the hydrophobic core adjacent to the metal coordination unit (Berg and Shi, 271:5252:1081-1085 (1996). Many proteins possessing a CysHisdomain have been shown to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Crystal structure analysis of the mouse transcription factor Zif268 bound to a specific DNA target indicates that the zinc fingers in the protein\/DNA complex reside in the major groove of the double helix and interacts with the DNA bases through amino acid side chains referred to as the contact residues (Pavletich and Pabo, 252:5007:809-817 (1991). The orientations of the zinc finger domains with respect to the DNA are usually identical, with each domain contacting a contiguous 3-base pair subsite, the majority of which are directed to one strand. There are few interdomain interactions and the DNA recognition by each zinc finger appears to be largely independent of the other domains (Berg and Shi, 271:5252:1081-1085 (1996).","Plant C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors have been identified as playing important roles in floral organogenesis, leaf initiation, lateral shoot initiation, lateral organ development, gametogenesis and seed development. In some cases the same gene can be involved in several different developmental processes, such as AtZFP1 (Chrispeels H E, Oettinger H, Janvier N and Tague B W. 200042(2):279-90; Dinneny J R, Yadegari R, Fischer R L, Yanofsky M F and Weigel D. 2004, 131(5):1101-10; Weissig H, Narisawa S, Sikstrom C, Olsson P G, McCarrey J R, Tsonis P A, Del Rio-Tsonis K and Millan J L. 2003547(1-3):61-8; He Y, Gan S. 200454(1):1-9).","It is understood that the present invention is not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, vectors, and reagents, etc., described herein, as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.

Nucleotide sequences determined by automation are typically at least about 95% identical, more typically at least about 96% to at least about 99.9% identical to the actual nucleotide sequence of the sequenced DNA molecule. The actual sequence can be more precisely determined by other approaches including manual DNA sequencing methods well known in the art. As is also known in the art, a single insertion or deletion in a determined nucleotide sequence compared to the actual sequence will cause a frame shift in translation of the nucleotide sequence such that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by a determined nucleotide sequence may be completely different from the amino acid sequence actually encoded by the sequenced DNA molecule, beginning at the point of such an insertion or deletion.","Each \u201cnucleotide sequence\u201d set forth herein is presented as a sequence of deoxyribonucleotides (abbreviated A, G, C and T). However, by \u201cnucleotide sequence\u201d of a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide is intended, for a DNA molecule or polynucleotide, a sequence of deoxyribonucleotides, and for an RNA molecule or polynucleotide, the corresponding sequence of ribonucleotides (A, G, C and U) where each thymidine deoxynucleotide (T) in the specified deoxynucleotide sequence in is replaced by the ribonucleotide uridine (U).","The present invention is also directed to fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein. By a fragment of an isolated DNA molecule having the polynucleotide sequences shown in of SEQ ID NO: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592 is intended DNA fragments at least 15 nucleotides, and more preferably at least 20 nucleotides, still more preferably at least 30 nucleotides in length, which are useful as diagnostic probes and primers is discussed in more detail below. Of course larger nucleic acid fragments of up to the entire length of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention are also useful diagnostically as probes, according to conventional hybridization techniques, or as primers for amplification of a target sequence by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as described, for instance, in Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 3rd. edition, edited by Sambrook & Russel., (2001), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. By a fragment at least 20 nucleotides in length, for example, is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence of the as shown in of SEQ ID NO: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592. The nucleic acids containing the nucleotide sequences listed in of SEQ ID NO: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592 can be generated using conventional methods of DNA synthesis which will be routine to the skilled artisan. For example, restriction endonuclease cleavage or shearing by sonication could easily be used to generate fragments of various sizes. Alternatively, the DNA fragments of the present invention could be generated synthetically according to known techniques.","In another aspect, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a portion of the polynucleotide in a nucleic acid molecule of the invention described above. By a polynucleotide which hybridizes to a \u201cportion\u201d of a polynucleotide is intended a polynucleotide (either DNA or RNA) hybridizing to at least about 15 nucleotides, and more preferably at least about 20 nucleotides, and still more preferably at least about 30 nucleotides, and even more preferably more than 30 nucleotides of the reference polynucleotide. These fragments that hybridize to the reference fragments are useful as diagnostic probes and primers. A probe, as used herein is defined as at least about 100 contiguous bases of one of the nucleic acid sequences set forth in of SEQ ID NO: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592. For the purpose of the invention, two sequences hybridize when they form a double-stranded complex in a hybridization solution of 6\u00d7SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5\u00d7Denhardt's solution and 100 \u03bcg of non-specific carrier DNA. See Ausubel et al., section 2.9, supplement 27 (1994). Sequences may hybridize at \u201cmoderate stringency,\u201d which is defined as a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. in a hybridization solution of 6\u00d7SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5\u00d7Denhardt's solution and 100 \u03bcg of non-specific carrier DNA. For \u201chigh stringency\u201d hybridization, the temperature is increased to 68\u00b0 C. Following the moderate stringency hybridization reaction, the nucleotides are washed in a solution of 2\u00d7SSC plus 0.05% SDS for five times at room temperature, with subsequent washes with 0.1\u00d7SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 60\u00b0 C. for 1 h. For high stringency, the wash temperature is increased to 68\u00b0 C. For the purpose of the invention, hybridized nucleotides are those that are detected using 1 ng of a radiolabeled probe having a specific radioactivity of 10,000 cpm\/ng, where the hybridized nucleotides are clearly visible following exposure to X-ray film at \u221270\u00b0 C. for no more than 72 hours.","The present application is directed to such nucleic acid molecules which are at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to a nucleic acid sequence described in of SEQ ID NO: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592. Preferred, however, are nucleic acid molecules which are at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to the nucleic acid sequence shown in of SEQ ID NO: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592. Differences between two nucleic acid sequences may occur at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.","As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule is at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence refers to a comparison made between two molecules using standard algorithms well known in the art and can be determined conventionally using publicly available computer programs such as the BLASTN algorithm. See Altschul et al., 25:3389-3402 (1997).","Polynucleotides may be analyzed using the BLASTX algorithm, which compares the six-frame conceptual translation products of a nucleotide query sequence (both strands) against a protein sequence database. The similarity of polypeptide sequences may be examined using the BLASTP algorithm. The BLASTN, BLASTX and BLASTP programs are available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) National Library of Medicine, Building 38A, Room 8N805, Bethesda, Md. 20894, USA. The BLASTN algorithm Version 2.0.4 [Feb. 24, 1998] and Version 2.0.6 [Sep. 16, 1998], set to the default parameters described in the documentation and distributed with the algorithm, are preferred for use in the determination of polynucleotide variants according to the present invention. The BLASTP algorithm, is preferred for use in the determination of polypeptide variants according to the present invention. The computer algorithm FASTA is available from the University of Virginia by contacting David Hudson, Assistance Provost for Research, University of Virginia, PO Box 9025, Charlottesville, Va. Version 2.0u4 [February 1996], set to the default parameters described in the documentation and distributed with the algorithm, may be used in the determination of variants according to the present invention. The use of the FASTA algorithm is described in Pearson and Lipman, 85:2444-2448, 1988; and Pearson, 183:63-98, 1990.","The following running parameters are preferred for determination of alignments and similarities using BLASTN that contribute to the E values and percentage identity for polynucleotide sequences: Unix running command: blastall -p blastn -d embldb -e 10 -G0 -E0 -r 1-v 30-b 30-i queryseq -o results; the parameters are: -p Program Name [String]; -d Database [String]; -e Expectation value (E) [Real]; -G Cost to open a gap (zero invokes default behavior) [Integer]; -E Cost to extend a gap (zero invokes default behavior) [Integer]; -r Reward for a nucleotide match (blastn only) [Integer]; -v Number of one-line descriptions (V) [Integer]; -b Number of alignments to show (B) [Integer]; -i Query File [File In]; and -o BLAST report Output File [File Out] Optional.","The following running parameters are preferred for determination of alignments and similarities using BLASTP that contribute to the E values and percentage identity of polypeptide sequences: blastall -p blastp -d swissprotdb -e 10-G 0 -E 0 -v 30 -b 30 -i queryseq -o results; wherein the parameters are: -p Program Name [String]; -d Database [String]; -e Expectation value (E) [Real]; -G Cost to open a gap (zero invokes default behavior) [Integer]; -E Cost to extend a gap (zero invokes default behavior) [Integer]; -v Number of one-line descriptions (v) [Integer]; -b Number of alignments to show (b) [Integer]; -I Query File [File In]; -o BLAST report Output File [File Out] Optional.","The \u201chits\u201d to one or more database sequences by a queried sequence produced by BLASTN, FASTA, BLASTP or a similar algorithm, align and identify similar portions of sequences. The hits are arranged in order of the degree of similarity and the length of sequence overlap. Hits to a database sequence generally represent an overlap over only a fraction of the sequence length of the queried sequence.","The BLASTN, FASTA and BLASTP algorithms also produce \u201cExpect\u201d values for alignments. The Expect value (E) indicates the number of hits one can \u201cexpect\u201d to see over a certain number of contiguous sequences by chance when searching a database of a certain size. The Expect value is used as a significance threshold for determining whether the hit to a database, such as the preferred EMBL database, indicates true similarity. For example, an E value of 0.1 assigned to a polynucleotide hit is interpreted as meaning that in a database of the size of the EMBL database, one might expect to see 0.1 matches over the aligned portion of the sequence with a similar score simply by chance. By this criterion, the aligned and matched portions of the polynucleotide sequences then have a probability of 90% of being the same. For sequences having an E value of 0.01 or less over aligned and matched portions, the probability of finding a match by chance in the EMBL database is 1% or less using the BLASTN or FASTA algorithm.","According to one embodiment, \u201cvariant\u201d polynucleotides and polypeptides, with reference to each of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, preferably comprise sequences having the same number or fewer nucleic or amino acids than each of the polynucleotides or polypeptides of the present invention and producing an E value of 0.01 or less when compared to the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention. That is, a variant polynucleotide or polypeptide is any sequence that has at least a 99% probability of being the same as the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention, measured as having an E value of 0.01 or less using the BLASTN, FASTA, or BLASTP algorithms set at parameters described above.","Alternatively, variant polynucleotides of the present invention hybridize to the polynucleotide sequences recited in of SEQ ID NO: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592, or complements, reverse sequences, or reverse complements of those sequences, under stringent conditions.","The present invention also encompasses polynucleotides that differ from the disclosed sequences but that, as a consequence of the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode a polypeptide which is the same as that encoded by a polynucleotide of the present invention. Thus, polynucleotides comprising sequences that differ from the polynucleotide sequences recited in of SEQ ID NO: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592; or complements, reverse sequences, or reverse complements thereof, as a result of conservative substitutions are contemplated by and encompassed within the present invention. Additionally, polynucleotides comprising sequences that differ from the polynucleotide sequences recited in of SEQ ID NO: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592, or complements, reverse complements or reverse sequences thereof, as a result of deletions and\/or insertions totaling less than 10% of the total sequence length are also contemplated by and encompassed within the present invention. Similarly, polypeptides comprising sequences that differ from the polypeptide sequences recited in of SEQ ID NO: 821-1640, 3593-3596, as a result of amino acid substitutions, insertions, and\/or deletions totaling less than 10% of the total sequence length are contemplated by and encompassed within the present invention. In certain embodiments, variants of the inventive polypeptides possess biological activities that are the same or similar to those of the inventive polypeptides. Such variant polypeptides function as transcription factors and are thus capable of modifying gene expression in a plant. Similarly, variant polynucleotides may encode polypeptides that function as transcription factors.","In addition to having a specified percentage identity to an inventive polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence, variant polynucleotides and polypeptides preferably have additional structure and\/or functional features in common with the inventive polynucleotide or polypeptide. Polypeptides having a specified degree of identity to a polypeptide of the present invention share a high degree of similarity in their primary structure and have substantially similar functional properties. In addition to sharing a high degree of similarity in their primary structure to polynucleotides of the present invention, polynucleotides having a specified degree of identity to, or capable of hybridizing to an inventive polynucleotide preferably have at least one of the following features: (i) they contain an open reading frame or partial open reading frame encoding a polypeptide having substantially the same functional properties as the polypeptide encoded by the inventive polynucleotide; or (ii) they have domains in common.","Promoters","The polynucleotides of the present invention can be used for specifically directing the expression of polypeptides or proteins in the tissues of plants. The nucleic acids of the present invention can also be used for specifically directing the expression of antisense RNA, or RNA involved in RNA interference (RNAi) such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), in the tissues of plants, which can be useful for inhibiting or completely blocking the expression of targeted genes. As used herein, vascular plant tissue refers to xylem, phloem or vascular cambium tissue. Preferably, the promoters of the invention are either \u201cxylem-preferred,\u201d \u201ccambium-preferred\u201d or \u201cphloem-preferred\u201d and direct expression of an operably linked nucleic acid segment in the xylem, cambium or phloem, respectively. As used herein, \u201ccoding product\u201d is intended to mean the ultimate product of the nucleic acid that is operably linked to the promoters. For example, a protein or polypeptide is a coding product, as well as antisense RNA or siRNA which is the ultimate product of the nucleic acid coding for the antisense RNA. The coding product may also be non-translated mRNA. The terms polypeptide and protein are used interchangeably herein. Xylem-preferred, for example, is intended to mean that the nucleic acid molecules of the current invention are more active in the xylem than in any other plant tissue. Most preferably, the nucleic acids of the current invention are promoters that are active specifically in the xylem, cambium or phloem, meaning that the promoters are only active in the xylem, cambium or phloem tissue of plants, respectively. In other words, a \u201cxylem-specific\u201d promoter, for example, drives the expression of a coding product such that detectable levels of the coding product are expressed only in xylem tissue of a plant. However, because of solute transport in plants, the coding product that is specifically expressed in the xylem, phloem or cambium may be found anywhere in the plant and thus its presence is not necessarily confined to xylem tissue. A vascular-preferred promoter, on the other hand can be preferentially active is any of the xylem, phloem or cambium tissues, or in at least two of the three tissue types. A vascular-specific promoter, is specifically active in any of the xylem, phloem or cambium, or in at least two of the three.","As used herein, promoter is intended to mean a nucleic acid, preferably DNA, that binds RNA polymerase and\/or other transcription regulatory elements. As with any promoter, the promoters of the current invention will facilitate or control the transcription of DNA or RNA to generate an mRNA molecule from a nucleic acid molecule that is operably linked to the promoter. The RNA may code for a protein or polypeptide or may code for an RNA interfering, or antisense molecule. As used herein, \u201coperably linked\u201d is meant to refer to the chemical fusion, ligation, or synthesis of DNA such that a promoter-nucleic acid sequence combination is formed in a proper orientation for the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed into an RNA segment. The promoters of the current invention may also contain some or all of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) of the resulting mRNA transcript. On the other hand, the promoters of the current invention do not necessarily need to possess any of the 5\u2032 UTR.","A promoter, as used herein, may also include regulatory elements. Conversely, a regulatory element may also be separate from a promoter. Regulatory elements confer a number of important characteristics upon a promoter region. Some elements bind transcription factors that enhance the rate of transcription of the operably linked nucleic acid. Other elements bind repressors that inhibit transcription activity. The effect of transcription factors on promoter activity may determine whether the promoter activity is high or low, i.e. whether the promoter is \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cweak.\u201d","In a preferred embodiment the promoters described herein are selected from the group consisting of CAD (Cinnamyl alcohol Dehydrogenase), 4CL (4-coumaric acid: coenzyme A ligase), SAD (Sinapyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase), LIM, and Pine cellulose synthase.","In another embodiment, a constitutive promoter may be used for expressing the inventive polynucleotide sequences. Examples of constitutive plant promoters which may be useful for expressing the TF sequence include: the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, which confers constitutive, high-level expression in most plant tissues (Odel et al. 313:810 (1985)); the nopaline synthase promoter (An et al. 88:547 (1988)); and the octopine synthase promoter (Fromm et al., 1: 977 (1989)).","In another embodiment, a variety of inducible plant gene promoters can be used for expressing the inventive polynucleotide sequences. Inducible promoters regulate gene expression in response to environmental, hormonal, or chemical signals. Examples of hormone inducible promoters include auxin-inducible promoters (Baumann et al. 11:323-334 (1999)), cytokinin-inducible promoter (Guevara-Garcia 38:743-753 (1998)), and gibberellin-responsive promoters (Shi et al. 38:1053-1060 (1998)). Additionally, promoters responsive to heat, light, wounding, pathogen resistance, and chemicals such as methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid, may be used for expressing the inventive polynucleotide sequences.","DNA Constructs","The present invention provides DNA constructs comprising the isolated nucleic acid molecules and polypeptide sequences of the present invention. In one embodiment, the DNA constructs of the present invention are Ti-plasmids derived from ","In developing the nucleic acid constructs of this invention, the various components of the construct or fragments thereof will normally be inserted into a convenient cloning vector, e.g., a plasmid that is capable of replication in a bacterial host, e.g., . Numerous vectors exist that have been described in the literature, many of which are commercially available. After each cloning, the cloning vector with the desired insert may be isolated and subjected to further manipulation, such as restriction digestion, insertion of new fragments or nucleotides, ligation, deletion, mutation, resection, etc. to tailor the components of the desired sequence. Once the construct has been completed, it may then be transferred to an appropriate vector for further manipulation in accordance with the manner of transformation of the host cell.","A recombinant DNA molecule of the invention typically includes a selectable marker so that transformed cells can be easily identified and selected from non-transformed cells. Examples of such markers include, but are not limited to, a neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) gene (Potrykus et al., 199:183-188 (1985)), which confers kanamycin resistance. Cells expressing the nptII gene can be selected using an appropriate antibiotic such as kanamycin or G418. Other commonly used selectable markers include the bar gene, which confers bialaphos resistance; a mutant EPSP synthase gene (Hinchee et al., 6:915-922 (1988)), which confers glyphosate resistance; and a mutant acetolactate synthase gene (ALS), which confers imidazolinone or sulphonylurea resistance (European Patent Application 154,204, 1985).","Additionally, vectors may include an origin of replication (replicons) for a particular host cell. Various prokaryotic replicons are known to those skilled in the art, and function to direct autonomous replication and maintenance of a recombinant molecule in a prokaryotic host cell.","In a preferred embodiment, the present invention utilizes the pWVR8 vector shown in .","In another embodiment, pART27 is suitable for use in the present invention. See Gleave, A. P. 20:1203-1027 (1992).","The vectors will preferably contain selectable markers for selection in plant cells. Numerous selectable markers for use in selecting transfected plant cells including, but not limited to, kanamycin, glyphosate resistance genes, and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance for culturing in and other bacteria.","For secretion of the translated protein into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the periplasmic space or into the extracellular environment, appropriate secretion signals may be incorporated into the expressed polypeptide. The signals may be endogenous to the polypeptide or they may be heterologous signals.","In one embodiment, a DNA construct of the current invention is designed in a manner such that a polynucleotide sequence described herein is operably linked to a tissue-specific promoter. Preferably, the polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide involved in cellulose or lignin biosynthesis in plants. Polynucleotides encoding many of the enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis include, but are not limited to, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H), phenolase (PNL), O-methyl transferase (OMT), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) and peroxidase (POX) from pine. U.S. Pat. No. 6,204,434. Other enzymes include coniferin \u03b2-glucosidase (CBG), and caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT). U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,514, WO 94\/23044, and Dharmawardhana et al., 40: 365-72 (1999).","In another embodiment, the coding sequence operably linked to the promoter may code for a gene product that inhibits the expression or activity of enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis. For example, of particular interest for control of lignin biosynthesis is an antisense gene encoding a 4CL, CAD, Lim, TED2, or a COMT.","In a further embodiment, the DNA constructs of the current invention are designed such that the polynucleotide sequences of the current invention are operably linked to DNA or RNA that encodes antisense RNA or interfering RNA, which corresponds to genes that code for polypeptides of interest, resulting in a decreased expression of targeted gene products. Preferably the gene products targeted for suppression are enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis. The use of RNAi inhibition of gene expression is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,506,559, and the use of RNAi to inhibit gene expression in plants is specifically described in WO 99\/61631, both of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The use of antisense technology to reduce or inhibit the expression of specific plant genes has been described, for example in European Patent Publication No. 271988. Reduction of gene expression led to a change in the phenotype of the plant, either at the level of gross visible phenotypic difference, for example a lack of lycopene synthesis in the fruit of tomato leading to the production of yellow rather than red fruit, or at a more subtle biochemical level, for example, a change in the amount of polygalacturonase and reduction in depolymerisation of pectins during tomato fruit ripening (Smith et. al., 334:724-726 (1988); Smith et. al., 14:369-379 (1990)). Thus, antisense RNA has been demonstrated to be useful in achieving reduction of gene expression in plants.","In one embodiment an inventive polynucleotide sequence is capable of being transcribed inside a plant to yield an antisense RNA transcript is introduced into the plant, e.g., into a plant cell. The inventive polynucleotide can be prepared, for example, by reversing the orientation of a gene sequence with respect to its promoter. Transcription of the exogenous DNA in the plant cell generates an intracellular RNA transcript that is \u201cantisense\u201d with respect to that gene.","The invention also provides host cells which comprise the DNA constructs of the current invention. As used herein, a host cell refers to the cell in which the coding product is ultimately expressed. Accordingly, a host cell can be an individual cell, a cell culture or cells as part of an organism. The host cell can also be a portion of an embryo, endosperm, sperm or egg cell, or a fertilized egg.","Accordingly, the present invention also provides plants or plant cells, comprising the DNA constructs of the current invention. Preferably the plants are angiosperms or gymnosperms. The expression construct of the present invention may be used to transform a variety of plants, both monocotyledonous (e.g. grasses, corn, grains, oat, wheat and barley), dicotyledonous (e.g., , tobacco, legumes, alfalfa, oaks, , maple), and Gymnosperms (e.g., Scots pine; see Aronen, 595, 1996), white spruce (Ellis et al., 11:84-89, 1993), and larch (Huang et al., 27:201-207, 1991).","In a preferred embodiment, the inventive expression vectors are employed to transform woody plants, herein defined as a tree or shrub whose stem lives for a number of years and increases in diameter each year by the addition of woody tissue. Preferably the target plant is selected from the group consisting of and pine species, most preferably from the group consisting of and its hybrids, and . Also preferred, the target plant is selected from the group consisting of -","In particular, the transgenic plant may be of the species grandis or its hybrids, L (loblolly pine), , or , or . Beyond the ordinary meaning of plant, the term \u201cplants\u201d is also intended to mean the fruit, seeds, flower, strobilus etc. of the plant.

The second or subsequent generation plant may or may not be produced by sexual reproduction, i.e., fertilization. Furthermore, the plant can be a gametophyte (haploid stage) or a sporophyte (diploid stage).","In one embodiment, the present invention provides isolated polynucleotides encoding, or partially encoding, plant transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of gene expression.

Following overnight incubation, GUS foci were counted.","Expression Profiling of Transcription Factor Polynucleotides","The present invention also provides methods and tools for performing expression profiling of transcription factor polynucleotides. Expression profiling is useful in determining whether polynucleotides are transcribed or translated, comparing transcript levels for particular polynucleotide in different tissues, genotyping, estimating DNA copy number, determining identity of descent, measuring mRNA decay rates, identifying protein binding sites, determining subcellular localization of gene products, correlating polynucleotide expression to a phenotype or other phenomenon, and determining the effect on other polynucleotides of the manipulation of a particular gene. Expression profiling is particularly useful for identifying polynucleotide expression in complex, multigenic events. For this reason, expression profiling is useful in correlating polynucleotide expression to plant phenotype and formation of plant.","Only a small fraction of the genes of a plant's genome are expressed at a given time in a given tissue sample, and all of the expressed genes may not affect the plant phenotype. To identify polynucleotides capable of affecting a phenotype of interest, the present invention provides methods and tools for determining, for example, a polynucleotide expression profile at a given point in plant development and a gene expression profile a given tissue sample. The invention also provides methods and tools for identifying transcription factor polynucleotides whose expression can be manipulated to alter plant phenotype or to alter the biological activity of transcription factor transcription factor polynucleotides transcription and translation products. In support of these methods, the invention also provides methods and tools that distinguish expression of different polynucleotides of the same family.","As used herein, \u201cpolynucleotide expression,\u201d refers to the process of transcription of a DNA sequence into an RNA sequence, followed by translation of the RNA into a protein, which may or may not undergo post-translational processing. Thus, the relationship between phenotype and\/or developmental stage and polynucleotide expression can be observed by detecting, quantitatively or qualitatively, changes in the level of an RNA or a protein. As used herein, the term \u201cbiological activity\u201d includes, but is not limited to, the activity of a protein gene product, including enzyme activity.","The present invention provides oligonucleotides that are useful in these expression profiling methods. Each oligonucleotide is capable of hybridizing under a given set of conditions to a transcription factor polynucleotide or polynucleotide product. In one aspect of the invention, a plurality of oligonucleotides is provided, wherein each oligonucleotide hybridizes under a given set of conditions to a different cell cycle gene product. Examples of oligonucleotides of the present invention include SEQ ID NOs 2742-3587. Each of the oligos of SEQ ID Nos 2742-3587 hybridizes under standard conditions to a different gene product of one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-494, 496-820, and 1641-1972, 3588-3592. The oligonucleotides of the invention are useful in determining the expression of one or more cell cycle genes in any of the above-described methods.","1. Cell, Tissue, Nucleic Acid, and Protein Samples","Samples for use in methods of the present invention may be derived from plant tissue. Suitable plant tissues include, but are not limited to, somatic embryos, pollen, leaves, stems, calli, stolons, microtubers, shoots, xylem, male strolbili, pollen cones, vascular tissue, apical meristem, vascular cambium, xylem, root, flower, and seed.","According to the present invention \u201cplant tissue\u201d is used as described previously herein. Plant tissue can be obtained from any of the plants types or species described supra.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, samples can be obtained from plant tissue at different developmental stages, from plant tissue at various times of the year (e.g. spring versus summer), from plant tissues subject to different environmental conditions (e.g. variations in light and temperature) and\/or from different types of plant tissue and cells. In accordance with one embodiment, plant tissue is obtained during various stages of maturity and during different seasons of the year. For example, plant tissue can be collected from stem dividing cells, differentiating xylem, early developing wood cells, differentiated early wood cells, and differentiated late wood cells. As another example, polynucleotide expression in a sample obtained from a plant with developing wood can be compared to gene expression in a sample obtained from a plant which does not have developing wood.","Differentiating xylem includes samples obtained from compression wood, side-wood, and normal vertical xylem. Methods of obtaining samples for expression profiling from pine and are known. See, e.g., Allona et al., 95:9693-8 (1998) and Whetton et al., 47:275-91, and Kirst et al., IUFROBC, S6.8 (June 2003, Umea, Sweden).","In one embodiment of the invention, polynucleotide expression in one type of tissue is compared to polynucleotide expression in a different type of tissue or to polynucleotide expression in the same type of tissue in a difference stage of development. Polynucleotide expression can also be compared in one type of tissue which is sampled at various times during the year (different seasons). For example, polynucleotide expression in juvenile secondary xylem can be compared to polynucleotide expression in mature secondary xylem. Similarly, polynucleotide expression in cambium can be compared to polynucleotide expression in xylem. Furthermore, gene expression in apical meristems can be compared to gene expression in cambium.","In another embodiment of the invention, a sample is obtained from a plant having a specific phenotype and polynucleotide expression in that sample is compared to a sample obtained from a plant of the same species that does not have that phenotype. For example, a sample can be obtained from a plant exhibiting a fast rate of growth and gene expression can be compared with that of a sample obtained from a plant exhibiting a normal or slow rate of growth. Differentially expressed polynucleotides identified from such a comparison can be correlated with growth rate and, therefore, useful for manipulating growth rate.","In a further embodiment, a sample is obtained from clonally propagated plants. In one embodiment the clonally propagated plants are of the species or . Individual ramets from the same genotype can be sacrificed at different times of year. Thus, for any genotype there can be at least two genetically identical trees sacrificed, early in the season and late in the season. Each of these trees can be divided into juvenile (top) to mature (bottom) samples. Further, tissue samples can be divided into, for example, phloem to xylem, in at least 5 layers of peeling. Each of these samples can be evaluated for phenotype and polynucleotide expression.","Where cellular components may interfere with an analytical technique, such as a hybridization assay, enzyme assay, a ligand binding assay, or a biological activity assay, it may be desirable to isolate the polynucleotide expression products from such cellular components. Polynucleotide expression products, including nucleic acid and amino acid gene products, can be isolated from cell fragments or lysates by any method known in the art.","Nucleic acids used in accordance with the invention can be prepared by any available method or process, or by other processes as they become known in the art. Conventional techniques for isolating nucleic acids are detailed, for example, in Tijssen, LTBMB: HWNAP, chapter 3 (Elsevier Press, 1993), Berger and Kimmel, 152:1 (1987), and GBRL & LTTRNA IP, Form No. 3786 (2000). Techniques for preparing nucleic acid samples, and sequencing polynucleotides from pine and are known. See, e.g., Allona et al., supra and Whetton et al., supra, and U.S. Application No. 60\/476,222.","A suitable nucleic acid sample can contain any type of nucleic acid derived from the transcript of a transcription factor gene or polypeptide, i.e., RNA or a subsequence thereof or a nucleic acid for which an mRNA transcribed from a transcription factor gene served as a template. Suitable nucleic acids include cDNA reverse-transcribed from a transcript, RNA transcribed from that cDNA, DNA amplified from the cDNA, and RNA transcribed from the amplified DNA. Detection of such products or derived products is indicative of the presence and\/or abundance of the transcript in the sample. Thus, suitable samples include, but are not limited to, transcripts of a gene or a polynucleotide, cDNA reverse-transcribed from the transcript, cRNA transcribed from the cDNA, DNA amplified from the genes, and RNA transcribed from amplified DNA. As used herein, the category of \u201ctranscripts\u201d includes but is not limited to pre-mRNA nascent transcripts, transcript processing intermediates, and mature mRNAs and degradation products thereof.","It is not necessary to monitor all types of transcripts to practice the invention. For example, the expression profiling methods of the invention can be conducted by detecting only one type of transcript, such as mature mRNA levels only.","In one aspect of the invention, a chromosomal DNA or cDNA library (comprising, for example, fluorescently labeled cDNA synthesized from total cell mRNA) is prepared for use in hybridization methods according to recognized methods in the art. See Sambrook et al., supra.","In another aspect of the invention, mRNA is amplified using, e.g., the MessageAmp kit (Ambion). In a further aspect, the mRNA is labeled with a detectable label. For example, mRNA can be labeled with a fluorescent chromophore, such as CyDye (Amersham Biosciences).","In some applications, it may be desirable to inhibit or destroy RNase that often is present in homogenates or lysates, before use in hybridization techniques. Methods of inhibiting or destroying nucleases are well known. In one embodiment of the invention, cells or tissues are homogenized in the presence of chaotropic agents to inhibit nuclease. In another embodiment, RNase is inhibited or destroyed by heat treatment, followed by proteinase treatment.","Protein samples can be obtained by any means known in the art. Protein samples useful in the methods of the invention include crude cell lysates and crude tissue homogenates. Alternatively, protein samples can be purified. Various methods of protein purification well known in the art can be found in Marshak et al., SPPC: A LCM(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1996).","2. Detecting Level of Polynucleotide Expression","For methods of the invention that comprise detecting a level of polynucleotide expression, any method for observing polynucleotide expression can be used, without limitation. Such methods include traditional nucleic acid hybridization techniques, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods, and protein determination. The invention includes detection methods that use solid support-based assay formats as well as those that use solution-based assay formats.","Absolute measurements of the expression levels need not be made, although they can be made. The invention includes methods comprising comparisons of differences in expression levels between samples. Comparison of expression levels can be done visually or manually, or can be automated and done by a machine, using for example optical detection means. Subrahmanyam et al., 97: 2457 (2001); Prashar et al., 303: 258 (1999). Hardware and software for analyzing differential expression of genes are available, and can be used in practicing the present invention. See, e.g., GenStat Software and GeneExpress\u00ae GX Explorer\u2122 Training Manual, supra; Baxevanis & Francis-Ouellette, supra.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, nucleic acid hybridization techniques are used to observe polynucleotide expression. Exemplary hybridization techniques include Northern blotting, Southern blotting, solution hybridization, and S1 nuclease protection assays.","Nucleic acid hybridization typically involves contacting an oligonucleotide probe and a sample comprising nucleic acids under conditions where the probe can form stable hybrid duplexes with its complementary nucleic acid through complementary base pairing. For example, see PCT application WO 99\/32660; Berger & Kimmel, 152: 1 (1987). The nucleic acids that do not form hybrid duplexes are then washed away leaving the hybridized nucleic acids to be detected, typically through detection of an attached detectable label. The detectable label can be present on the probe, or on the nucleic acid sample. In one embodiment, the nucleic acids of the sample are detectably labeled polynucleotides representing the mRNA transcripts present in a plant tissue (e.g., a cDNA library). Detectable labels are commonly radioactive or fluorescent labels, but any label capable of detection can be used. Labels can be incorporated by several approached described, for instance, in WO 99\/32660, supra. In one aspect RNA can be amplified using the MessageAmp kit (Ambion) with the addition of aminoallyl-UTP as well as free UTP. The aminoallyl groups incorporated into the amplified RNA can be reacted with a fluorescent chromophore, such as CyDye (Amersham Biosciences)","Duplexes of nucleic acids are destabilized by increasing the temperature or decreasing the salt concentration of the buffer containing the nucleic acids. Under low stringency conditions (e.g., low temperature and\/or high salt) hybrid duplexes (e.g., DNA:DNA, RNA:RNA or RNA:DNA) will form even where the annealed sequences are not perfectly complementary. Thus, specificity of hybridization is reduced at lower stringency. Conversely, at higher stringency (e.g., higher temperature and\/or lower salt and\/or in the presence of destabilizing reagents) hybridization tolerates fewer mismatches.","Typically, stringent conditions for short probes (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotide bases) will be those in which the salt concentration is at least about 0.01 to 1.0 M at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30\u00b0 C. Stringent conditions can also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide.","Under some circumstances, it can be desirable to perform hybridization at conditions of low stringency, e.g., 6\u00d7SSPE-T (0.9 M NaCl, 60 mM NaHPO, pH 7.6, 6 mM EDTA, 0.005% Triton) at 37\u00b0 C., to ensure hybridization. Subsequent washes can then be performed at higher stringency (e.g., 1\u00d7SSPE-T at 37\u00b0 C.) to eliminate mismatched hybrid duplexes. Successive washes can be performed at increasingly higher stringency (e.g., down to as low as 0.25\u00d7SSPE-T at 37\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C.) until a desired level of hybridization specificity is obtained.","In general, standard conditions for hybridization is a compromise between stringency (hybridization specificity) and signal intensity. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, the hybridized nucleic acids are washed at successively higher stringency conditions and read between each wash. Analysis of the data sets produced in this manner will reveal a wash stringency above which the hybridization pattern is not appreciably altered and which provides adequate signal for the particular oligonucleotide probes of interest. For example, the final wash may be selected as that of the highest stringency that produces consistent results and that provides a signal intensity greater than approximately 10% of the background intensity.","a. Oligonucleotide Probes","Oligonucleotide probes useful in nucleic acid hybridization techniques employed in the present invention are capable of binding to a nucleic acid of complementary sequence through one or more types of chemical bonds, usually through complementary base pairing via hydrogen bond formation. A probe can include natural bases (i.e., A, G, U, C or T) or modified bases (7-deazaguanosine, inosine, etc.). In addition, the nucleotide bases in the probes can be joined by a linkage other than a phosphodiester bond, so long as it does not interfere with hybridization. Thus, probes can be peptide nucleic acids in which the constituent bases are joined by peptide bonds rather than phosphodiester linkages.","Oligonucleotide probes can be prepared by any means known in the art. Probes useful in the present invention are capable of hybridizing to a nucleotide product of cell cycle genes, such as one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-235 and 698-717. Probes useful in the invention can be generated using the nucleotide sequences disclosed in SEQ ID NOs: 1-235 and 698-717. The invention includes oligonucleotide probes having at least a 2, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, or 100 nucleotide fragment of a corresponding contiguous sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-235 and 698-717. The invention includes oligonucleotides of less than 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, or 0.05 kb in length. In one embodiment, the oligonucleotide is 60 nucleotides in length.","Oligonucleotide probes can be designed by any means known in the art. See, e.g., Li and Stormo, 17: 1067-76 (2001). Oligonucleotide probe design can be effected using software. Exemplary software includes ArrayDesigner, GeneScan, and ProbeSelect. Probes complementary to a defined nucleic acid sequence can be synthesized chemically, generated from longer nucleotides using restriction enzymes, or can be obtained using techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR methods are well known and are described, for example, in Innis et al. eds., PCR P: A GMA, Academic Press Inc. San Diego, Calif. (1990). The probes can be labeled, for example, with a radioactive, biotinylated, or fluorescent tag. Optimally, the nucleic acids in the sample are labeled and the probes are not labeled. Oligonucleotide probes generated by the above methods can be used in solution or solid support-based methods.","The invention includes oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to a product of the coding region or a 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) of a transcription factor polynucleotide. In one embodiment, the oligonucleotide probe hybridizes to the 3\u2032UTR of any one of SEQ ID Nos 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592. The 3\u2032 UTR is generally a unique region of the gene, even among members of the same family. Therefore, the probes capable of hybridizing to a product of the 3\u2032 UTR can be useful for differentiating the expression of individual genes within a family where the coding region of the genes likely are highly homologous. This allows for the design of oligonucleotide probes to be used as members of a plurality of oligonucleotides, each capable of uniquely binding to a single gene. In another embodiment, the oligonucleotide probe comprises any one of SEQ ID NOs: 2742-3587. In another embodiment, the oligonucleotide probe consists of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 2742-3587.","b. Oligonucleotide Array Methods","One embodiment of the invention employs two or more oligonucleotide probes in combination to detect a level of expression of one or more transcription factor polynucleotides, such as the genes of SEQ ID NOs: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592. In one aspect of this embodiment, the level of expression of two or more different polynucleotide is detected. The two or more polynucleotide may be from the same or different transcription factor gene families discussed above. Each of the two or more oligonucleotides may hybridize to a different one of the polynucleotides.","One embodiment of the invention employs two or more oligonucleotide probes, each of which specifically hybridize to a polynucleotide derived from the transcript of a polynucleotide provided by SEQ ID NOs: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592. Another embodiment employs two or more oligonucleotide probes, at least one of which comprises a nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs:1973-2304, 3593-3666. Another embodiment employs two or more oligonucleotide probes, at least one of which consists of SEQ ID Nos 1973-2304, 3593-3666.","The oligonucleotide probes may comprise from about 5 to about 60, or from about 5 to about 500, nucleotide bases, such as from about 60 to about 100 nucleotide bases, including from about 15 to about 60 nucleotide bases.","One embodiment of the invention uses solid support-based oligonucleotide hybridization methods to detect gene expression. Solid support-based methods suitable for practicing the present invention are widely known and are described, for example, in PCT application WO 95\/11755; Huber et al., 299: 24 (2001); Meiyanto et al., 31: 406 (2001); Relogio et al., 30:e51 (2002). Any solid surface to which oligonucleotides can be bound, covalently or non-covalently, can be used. Such solid supports include filters, polyvinyl chloride dishes, silicon or glass based chips, etc.","One embodiment uses oligonucleotide arrays, i.e. microarrays, which can be used to simultaneously observe the expression of a number of polynucleotides, genes or gene products. Oligonucleotide arrays comprise two or more oligonucleotide probes provided on a solid support, wherein each probe occupies a unique location on the support. The location of each probe may be predetermined, such that detection of a detectable signal at a given location is indicative of hybridization to an oligonucleotide probe of a known identity. Each predetermined location can contain more than one molecule of a probe, but each molecule within the predetermined location has an identical sequence. Such predetermined locations are termed features. There can be, for example, from 2, 10, 100, 1,000, 2,000 or 5,000 or more of such features on a single solid support. In one embodiment, each oligonucleotide is located at a unique position on an array at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, or at least 10 times.","Oligonucleotide probe arrays for detecting gene expression can be made and used according to conventional techniques described, for example, in Lockhart et al., 14: 1675 (1996), McGall et al., 93: 13555 (1996), and Hughes et al., 19:342 (2001). A variety of oligonucleotide array designs is suitable for the practice of this invention.","In one embodiment the one or more oligonucleotides include a plurality of oligonucleotides that each hybridize to a different polynucleotide expressed in a particular tissue type. For example, the tissue can be developing wood.","In one embodiment, a nucleic acid sample obtained from a plant can be amplified and, optionally labeled with a detectable label. Any method of nucleic acid amplification and any detectable label suitable for such purpose can be used. For example, amplification reactions can be performed using, e.g. Ambion's MessageAmp, which creates \u201cantisense\u201d RNA or \u201caRNA\u201d (complementary in nucleic acid sequence to the RNA extracted from the sample tissue). The RNA can optionally be labeled using CyDye fluorescent labels. During the amplification step, aaUTP is incorporated into the resulting aRNA. The CyDye fluorescent labels are coupled to the aaUTPs in a non-enzymatic reaction. Subsequent to the amplification and labeling steps, labeled amplified antisense RNAs are precipitated and washed with appropriate buffer, and then assayed for purity. For example, purity can be assay using a Nanoprop spectrophotometer. The nucleic acid sample is then contacted with an oligonucleotide array having, attached to a solid substrate (a \u201cmicroarray slide\u201d), oligonucleotide sample probes capable of hybridizing to nucleic acids of interest which may be present in the sample. The step of contacting is performed under conditions where hybridization can occur between the nucleic acids of interest and the oligonucleotide probes present on the array. The array is then washed to remove non-specifically bound nucleic acids and the signals from the labeled molecules that remain hybridized to oligonucleotide probes on the solid substrate are detected. The step of detection can be accomplished using any method appropriate to the type of label used. For example, the step of detecting can accomplished using a laser scanner and detector. For example, on can use and Axon scanner which optionally uses GenePix Pro software to analyze the position of the signal on the microarray slide.","Data from one or more microarray slides can analyzed by any appropriate method known in the art.","Oligonucleotide probes used in the methods of the present invention, including microarray techniques, can be generated using PCR. PCR primers used in generating the probes are chosen, for example, based on the sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592, to result in amplification of unique fragments of the transcription factor polynucleotides (i.e., fragments that hybridize to only one polynucleotide of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592 under standard hybridization conditions). Computer programs are useful in the design of primers with the required specificity and optimal hybridization properties. For example, Li and Stormo, supra at 1075, discuss a method of probe selection using ProbeSelect which selects an optimum oligonucleotide probe based on the entire gene sequence as well as other gene sequences to be probed at the same time.","In one embodiment, oligonucleotide control probes also are used. Exemplary control probes can fall into at least one of three categories referred to herein as (1) normalization controls, (2) expression level controls and (3) negative controls. In microarray methods, one or more of these control probes may be provided on the array with the inventive transcription factor-related oligonucleotides.","Normalization controls correct for dye biases, tissue biases, dust, slide irregularities, malformed slide spots, etc. Normalization controls are oligonucleotide or other nucleic acid probes that are complementary to labeled reference oligonucleotides or other nucleic acid sequences that are added to the nucleic acid sample to be screened. The signals obtained from the normalization controls, after hybridization, provide a control for variations in hybridization conditions, label intensity, reading efficiency and other factors that can cause the signal of a perfect hybridization to vary between arrays. In one embodiment, signals (e.g., fluorescence intensity or radioactivity) read from all other probes used in the method are divided by the signal from the control probes, thereby normalizing the measurements.","Virtually any probe can serve as a normalization control. Hybridization efficiency varies, however, with base composition and probe length. Preferred normalization probes are selected to reflect the average length of the other probes being used, but they also can be selected to cover a range of lengths. Further, the normalization control(s) can be selected to reflect the average base composition of the other probes being used. In one embodiment, only one or a few normalization probes are used, and they are selected such that they hybridize well (i.e., without forming secondary structures) and do not match any test probes. In one embodiment, the normalization controls are mammalian genes.","Expression level controls probes hybridize specifically with constitutively expressed genes present in the biological sample. Virtually any constitutively expressed gene provides a suitable target for expression level control probes. Typically, expression level control probes have sequences complementary to subsequences of constitutively expressed \u201chousekeeping genes\u201d including, but not limited to certain photosynthesis genes.","\u201cNegative control\u201d probes are not complementary to any of the test oligonucleotides (i.e., the inventive transcription factor-related oligonucleotides), normalization controls, or expression controls. In one embodiment, the negative control is a mammalian gene which is not complementary to any other sequence in the sample.","The terms \u201cbackground\u201d and \u201cbackground signal intensity\u201d refer to hybridization signals resulting from non-specific binding or other interactions between the labeled target nucleic acids (i.e., mRNA present in the biological sample) and components of the oligonucleotide array. Background signals also can be produced by intrinsic fluorescence of the array components themselves.","A single background signal can be calculated for the entire array, or a different background signal can be calculated for each target nucleic acid. In a one embodiment, background is calculated as the average hybridization signal intensity for the lowest 5 to 10 percent of the oligonucleotide probes being used, or, where a different background signal is calculated for each target gene, for the lowest 5 to 10 percent of the probes for each gene. Where the oligonucleotide probes corresponding to a particular cell cycle gene hybridize well and, hence, appear to bind specifically to a target sequence, they should not be used in a background signal calculation. Alternatively, background can be calculated as the average hybridization signal intensity produced by hybridization to probes that are not complementary to any sequence found in the sample (e.g., probes directed to nucleic acids of the opposite sense or to genes not found in the sample). In microarray methods, background can be calculated as the average signal intensity produced by regions of the array that lack any oligonucleotides probes at all.","c. PCR-Based Methods","In another embodiment, PCR-based methods are used to detect polynucleotide expression. These methods include reverse-transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including real-time and endpoint quantitative reverse-transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (Q-RTPCR). These methods are well known in the art. For example, methods of quantitative PCR can be carried out using kits and methods that are commercially available from, for example, Applied BioSystems and Stratagene\u00ae. See also Kochanowski, QPCR P(Humana Press, 1999); Innis et al., supra.; Vandesompele et al., 3: RESEARCH0034 (2002); Stein, 59: 1235 (2002).","Polynucleotide expression can also be observed in solution using Q-RTPCR. Q-RTPCR relies on detection of a fluorescent signal produced proportionally during amplification of a PCR product. See Innis et al., supra. Like the traditional PCR method, this technique employs PCR oligonucleotide primers, typically 15-30 bases long, that hybridize to opposite strands and regions flanking the DNA region of interest. Additionally, a probe (e.g., TaqMan\u00ae, Applied Biosystems) is designed to hybridize to the target sequence between the forward and reverse primers traditionally used in the PCR technique. The probe is labeled at the 5\u2032 end with a reporter fluorophore, such as 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) and a quencher fluorophore like 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA). As long as the probe is intact, fluorescent energy transfer occurs which results in the absorbance of the fluorescence emission of the reporter fluorophore by the quenching fluorophore. As Taq polymerase extends the primer, however, the intrinsic 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 nuclease activity of Taq degrades the probe, releasing the reporter fluorophore. The increase in the fluorescence signal detected during the amplification cycle is proportional to the amount of product generated in each cycle.","The forward and reverse amplification primers and internal hybridization probe is designed to hybridize specifically and uniquely with one nucleotide derived from the transcript of a target gene. In one embodiment, the selection criteria for primer and probe sequences incorporates constraints regarding nucleotide content and size to accommodate TagMan\u00ae requirements.","SYBR Green\u00ae can be used as a probe-less Q-RTPCR alternative to the Taqman\u00ae-type assay, discussed above. ABI P7900 SDSUGAB, chap. 1-8, App. A-F. (2002).","A device measures changes in fluorescence emission intensity during PCR amplification. The measurement is done in \u201creal time,\u201d that is, as the amplification product accumulates in the reaction. Other methods can be used to measure changes in fluorescence resulting from probe digestion. For example, fluorescence polarization can distinguish between large and small molecules based on molecular tumbling (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,867).","d. Protein Detection Methods","Proteins can be observed by any means known in the art, including immunological methods, enzyme assays and protein array\/proteomics techniques.","Measurement of the translational state can be performed according to several protein methods. For example, whole genome monitoring of protein\u2014the \u201cproteome\u201d\u2014can be carried out by constructing a microarray in which binding sites comprise immobilized, preferably monoclonal, antibodies specific to a plurality of proteins having an amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID Nos: 821-1640, 1973-2304, 3593-3666, or proteins encoded by the polynucleotides of SEQ ID NOs: 1-494, 496-820, 1641-1972, 3588-3592 or conservative variants thereof. See Wildt et al., 18: 989 (2000). Methods for making polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are well known, as described, for instance, in Harlow & Lane, A: A LM(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988).","Alternatively, proteins can be separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis systems. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is well-known in the art and typically involves isoelectric focusing along a first dimension followed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis along a second dimension. See, e.g., Hames et al., GEP: A PA(IRL Press, 1990). The resulting electropherograms can be analyzed by numerous techniques, including mass spectrometric techniques, western blotting and immunoblot analysis using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and internal and N-terminal micro-sequencing.","3.

The assays are used to identify transcription factors that are active during tracheary differentiation and lignification by determining whether a promoter responds to trans-acting factors in plant cells that are either induced in tracheary element (TE) forming cells (endogenous factors) and\/or introduced by transformation (transient assay after introduction of plasmid DNA into the cells). The assay comprises the isolation of mesophyll cells and their culture either in TE-inducing or maintenance medium. See Examples 6-9. Control promoterless constructs or constructs comprising promoters that are active during TE formation (linked to reporter genes) are introduced into the cells or protoplasts prepared from the cells. As described above in Example 8, the transfected protoplasts are harvested by centrifugation and assayed for viability and transgene expression. To correct for experimental variation that may arise from differences in transfection, the protoplasts are co-transfected with a transfection marker, which is also detected by flow cytometry. This system uses fluorescence analysis technologies to capture the data and informatics software to analyze the results. In this way the impact of an introduced gene or gene product can be monitored. Transcriptional repression or activation of a vascular-preferred Pine or promoter can be attributed to the candidate transcription factor gene and may be used to support sequence data.","Four color flow cytometry can also be used in the TE assay. The pine ubiquitin promoter is constitutively expressed at a high level in plants, therefore pine ubquitin expressing DsRedExpress can be used as the co-transfection marker in the cell-based assay system. In protoplasts, high level of expression of the pine ubiquitin promoter is also found. Pine ubquitin::DsRedExpress can be used as a co-transfection marker for transfections that involve the two-color (green and red) TE assay.","To correlate a transcription factor with transcriptional regulation of a wood quality trait, a cell-based assay is performed in two steps. First, the transcription factor is tested for activity in combination with promoters individually fused to a fluorescent reporter gene. The promoters used include COMT (306 bp), Homeobox 8 (691 bp), Pine Ubiquitin (2 kb+Intron), 4CL, CAD, The COMT and Homeobox 8 promoters are vascular-specific, whereas the Pine Ubiquitin promoter (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,380,459 B1) is a constitutive promoter. A transcription factor that generates a \u201chit\u201d (e.g. upregulated transcription or downregulated transcription) against one of these two promoters will be screened further.","A transcription factor that either activates or represses transcription from one of the above-mentioned promoters will be used for screening vascular specific activity of other candidate vascular specific or vascular preferred promoters. Table 5 lists some candidate vascular-specific promoters that can be used with the inventive transcription factors. (those skilled in the art will recognize that any vascular-preferred promoters may be suitable for use in this assay).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1487","num":"1486"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Vascular-Specific Promoters"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Size",{},{}]},{"entry":["Promoter","(bp)","Function","Expression"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{"i":"Eucalyptus "},"784","Syringyl lignin","Vascular-specific"]},{"entry":["Sinapyl Alcohol",{},"production","activity, expressed in"]},{"entry":["Dehydrogenase",{},{},"leaf and stem veins"]},{"entry":[{"i":"Eucalyptus "},"1400","Enzymatic role in","Expression correlates"]},{"entry":["4-coumaric",{},"phenylpropanoid","with lignification and"]},{"entry":["acid: coenzyme A",{},"metabolism","formation of TE"]},{"entry":"ligase 4"},{"entry":[{"i":"Eucalyptus "},"894","Key enzyme in lignin","Vascular specific"]},{"entry":["Cinnamyl alcohol",{},"biosynthesis","promoter expression"]},{"entry":["dehydrogenase",{},{},"in stem, root and leaf"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"tissue."]},{"entry":[{"i":"Eucalyptus "},"970","Conversion of","Vascular specific"]},{"entry":["Quinone",{},"oxygen to hydroxyl","promoter"]},{"entry":["oxidoreductase",{},"groups"]},{"entry":[{"i":"Eucalyptus "},"898","Transcription Factor:","Vascular specific"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Regulates","promoter"]},{"entry":[{},{},"transcription of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"lignin biosynthesis"]},{"entry":[{},{},"genes"]},{"entry":["Pine Cellulose","674","Cellulose synthesis","Vascular specific"]},{"entry":["synthase",{},{},"promoter"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The pFOR293 vector contains a gene encoding a protein similar to the Ethylene Response Element\/AP2 class of proteins, SEQ ID NO: 474, which was isolated from a cDNA library made from developing xylem fibers.

While any promoter can be used, this example uses vascular-preferred promoters. Based on the expression level of a reporter gene, a transcription factor can be identified as a transcriptional activator or repressor, relative to a wild-type construct that does not contain a transcription factor sequence. A transcriptional activator causes an increase in reporter gene expression, relative to a wild-type construct. A transcriptional repressor causes a decrease in reporter gene expression, relative to a wild-type construct. Tables 11-12 displays transcription factors having transcriptional activity with a specific promoter. Transcriptional activity is quantified as a value between one and five, wherein a value of five represents an upward maximum of transcriptional activity.

For example, the construct pFOR 434 comprises the Homeobox 8 promoter, which is strongly activated by a MYB transcription factor (SEQ ID NO: 315). Accordingly, the Homeobox 8 promoter can be operably linked to a gene in the lignin biosynthesis pathway. In the presence of the MYB transcription factor, expression of the resulting gene product derived from Homeobox 8 promoter-lignin biosynthesis gene construct should be higher than the expression product of the same construct in the absence of the MYB transcription factor.","For example, ferulate-5-hydroxylase (F5H) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of syringyl lignin monomers.

See Yahiaoui et al., 49: 295-306 (1998) and references cited therein. Expression of an RNAi molecule corresponding to a portion of CAD results in a decrease in enzyme activity and a corresponding increase in the proportion of cinnamyl aldehydes in the lignin of a transgenic plant.","By use of the inventive polynucleotides of the present invention, a DNA vector can be constructed having a transcription factor sequence that binds to a vascular-specific promoter operably linked to a gene encoding an RNA interference (RNAi) molecule corresponding to a portion of the coding region of CAD.

Seeds were collected and germinated under aseptic conditions in gelled nutrient media. The morphology of the seedlings was compared with that of wild type seedlings and seedlings that had arisen from transformation with pART9.

In particular, 15 of the 20 seedlings examined showed more branching of the primary root, and 5 of the 20 seedlings examined showed unusually vigorous growth, which may be associated with greater root surface area and nutrient absorption. Such a phenotype is potentially valuable in transgenic plants, including forest tree species and plants grown in low-nutrient or arid conditions.","Based on the data from the above examples, plant gene expression can be regulated using an inventive polynucleotide sequence, e.g. a DNA construct having one of the inventive polynucleotide sequences in a sense or antisense orientation.

There may be insertions, deletions, base substitutions, or unspliced or improperly spliced introns. If such features exist, it is often possible to identify them so that they can be changed. The consensus sequence pinusRadiata001720, equivalent to EST number 011005PRAA002374HT, will be used as an example, although similar curation can be performed on any other sequences that have homology to sequences in the public databases.","After determination of the DNA sequence, BLAST analysis showed that it was related to the gene SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE or SVP (gene At2g22540 on the publicly available genome sequence). However, instead of coding for an approximately 240 amino acid polypeptide, pinusRadiata001720 was predicted to code for a product of only 157 amino acid residues. This suggested an error in the DNA sequence. To identify where the genuine coding region might be, the DNA sequence from position 600 to the end of the EST was translated in each of the three reading frames and the predicted sequences were aligned with the SVP amino acid sequence. It was found that the DNA segment from position 924 to 1170 coded for a sequence with similarity to the carboxyl terminus of SVP. Therefore, it appears that an unspliced intron is present in the EST.","Unspliced introns are a relatively minor issue with regard to use of a cloned sequence for overexpression of the gene of interest. The RNA resulting from transcription of the cDNA can be expected to undergo normal processing to remove the intron. Antisense and RNAi constructs are also expected to function to suppress the gene of interest. On other occasions, it may be desirable to identify the precise limits of the intron so that it can be removed. When the sequence in question has a published sequence that is highly similar, it may be possible to find the intron by aligning the two sequences and identifying the locations where the sequence identity falls off, aided by the knowledge that introns start with the sequence GT and end with the sequence AG.","For pinusRadiata001720, there is plausible similarity to SVP up to position 552, where there is a possible EXON|intron junction CAAAA|gtggg (SEQ ID NO: 3677). A second candidate junction is at position 582, where the sequence is TACCA|gtacc (SEQ ID NO: 3678). In both these cases, the putative intron junction falls between the second and third nucleotides of a codon. The likely site of the 3\u2032-end of the intron is position 925, where the predicted intron|EXON junction is acaag|TGGAA (SEQ ID NO: 3679) and again falls between the second and third bases of a codon. When there is some doubt about the site of the intron because highly similar sequences are not available, as is the case for pinusRadiata001720, the intron location can be verified experimentally. For example, DNA oligomers can be synthesized flanking the region where the suspected intron is located. For pinusRadiata001720, a sense primer could be synthesized based on sequence in the region from position 400 to 500 and an antisense primer could be synthesized based on sequence in the region from position 1000 to 1100. RNA from radiata pine is isolated and used as a template to make cDNA using reverse transcriptase. The selected primers are then used in a PCR reaction to amplify the correctly spliced DNA segment (predicted size of approximately 350 bp smaller than the corresponding segment of the original consensus) from the population of cDNAs. The amplified segment is then subjected to sequence analysis and compared to the pinusRadiata001720 sequence to identify the differences.","The same procedure can be used when an alternate splicing event (partial intron remaining, or partial loss of an exon) is suspected. When an EST has a small change, such as insertion or deletion of a small number of bases, computer analysis of the EST sequence can still indicate its location when a translation product of the wrong size is predicted or if there is an obvious frameshift. Verification of the true sequence is done by synthesis of primers, production of new cDNA, and PCR amplification as described above.","Example 25 illustrates how transcription factor polynucleotides important for wood development in can be determined and how oligonucleotides which uniquely bind to those genes can be designed and synthesized for use on a microarray.","Open pollinated trees of approximately 16 years of age are selected from plantation-grown sites, in the United States for loblolly pine, and in New Zealand for radiata pine.

Both the spatial continuum of wood development across a section (phloem, cambium, developing xylem, maturing xylem) at a particular season and tree trunk position and the relationships of season and tree trunk position are considered when making associations of gene expression to the relevance in wood development.","Example 28 demonstrates how one can correlate transcription factor gene expression with agronomically important wood phenotypes such as density, stiffness, strength, distance between branches, and spiral grain.","Mature clonally propagated pine trees are selected from among the progeny of known parent trees for superior growth characteristics and resistance to important fungal diseases. The bark is removed from a tangential section and the trees are examined for average wood density in the fifth annual ring at breast height, stiffness and strength of the wood, and spiral grain. The trees are also characterized by their height, mean distance between major branches, crown size, and forking.","To obtain seedling families that are segregating for major genes that affect density, stiffness, strength, distance between branches, spiral grain and other characteristics that may be linked to any of the genes affecting these characteristics, trees lacking common parents are chosen for specific crosses on the criterion that they exhibit the widest variation from each other with respect to the density, stiffness, strength, distance between branches, and spiral grain criteria. Thus, pollen from a plus tree exhibiting high density, low mean distance between major branches, and high spiral grain is used to pollinate cones from the unrelated plus tree among the selections exhibiting the lowest density, highest mean distance between major branches, and lowest spiral grain. It is useful to note that \u201cplus trees\u201d are crossed such that pollen from a plus tree exhibiting high density are used to pollinate developing cones from another plus tree exhibiting high density, for example, and pollen from a tree exhibiting low mean distance between major branches would be used to pollinate developing cones from another plus tree exhibiting low mean distance between major branches.","Seeds are collected from these controlled pollinations and grown such that the parental identity is maintained for each seed and used for vegetative propagation such that each genotype is represented by multiple ramets. Vegetative propagation is accomplished using micropropagation, hedging, or fascicle cuttings. Some ramets of each genotype are stored while vegetative propagules of each genotype are grown to sufficient size for establishment of a field planting. The genotypes are arrayed in a replicated design and grown under field conditions where the daily temperature and rainfall are measured and recorded.","The trees are measured at various ages to determine the expression and segregation of density, stiffness, strength, distance between branches, spiral grain, and any other observable characteristics that may be linked to any of the genes affecting these characteristics. Samples are harvested for characterization of cellulose content, lignin content, cellulose microfibril angle, density, strength, stiffness, tracheid morphology, ring width, and the like. Samples are also examined for gene expression as described in Example 4. Ramets of each genotype are compared to ramets of the same genotype at different ages to establish age:age correlations for these characteristics.","Example 29 demonstrates how the stage of plant development and responses to environmental conditions such as light and season can be correlated to transcription factor gene expression using microarrays prepared as in Example 25. In particular, the changes in gene expression associated with wood density are examined.","Trees of three different clonally propagated hybrid genotypes are grown on a site with a weather station that measures daily temperatures and rainfall. During the spring and subsequent summer, genetically identical ramets of the three different genotypes are first photographed with north-south orientation marks, using photography at sufficient resolution to show bark characteristics of juvenile and mature portions of the plant, and then felled as in Example 35. The age of the trees is determined by planting records and confirmed by a count of the annual rings. In each of these trees, mature wood is defined as the outermost rings of the tree below breast height, and juvenile wood as the innermost rings of the tree above breast height. Each tree is accordingly sectored as follows:","NM\u2014NORTHSIDE MATURE","SM\u2014SOUTHSIDE MATURE","NT\u2014NORTHSIDE TRANSITION","ST\u2014SOUTHSIDE TRANSITION","NJ\u2014NORTHSIDE JUVENILE","SJ\u2014SOUTHSIDE JUVENILE","Tissue is harvested from the plant trunk as well as from juvenile and mature form leaves. Samples are prepared simultaneously for phenotype analysis, including plant morphology and biochemical characteristics, and gene expression analysis. The height and diameter of the tree at the point from which each sector was taken is recorded, and a soil sample from the base of the tree is taken for chemical assay. Samples prepared for gene expression analysis are weighed and placed into liquid nitrogen for subsequent preparation of RNA samples for use in the microarray experiment. The tissues are denoted as follows:","P\u2014phloem","C\u2014cambium","X1\u2014expanding xylem","X2\u2014differentiating and lignifying xylem","Thin slices in tangential and radial sections from each of the sectors of the trunk are fixed as described in Ruzin, Plant Microtechnique and Microscopy, Oxford University Press, Inc., New York, N.Y. (1999) for anatomical examination and confirmation of wood developmental stage. Microfibril angle is examined at the different developmental stages of the wood, for example juvenile, transition and mature phases of wood. Other characteristics examined are the ratio of fibers to vessel elements and ray tissue in each sector. Additionally, the samples are examined for characteristics that change between juvenile and mature wood and between spring wood and summer wood, such as fiber morphology, lumen size, and width of the S2 (thickest) cell wall layer. Samples are further examined for measurements of density in the fifth ring and determination of modulus of elasticity using techniques well known to those skilled in the art of wood assays. See, e.g., Wang, et al., Non-destructive Evaluations of Trees, Experimental Techniques, pp. 28-30 (2000).","For biochemical analysis, 50 grams from each of the harvest samples are freeze-dried and analyzed, using biochemical assays well known to those skilled in the art of plant biochemistry for quantities of simple sugars, amino acids, lipids, other extractives, lignin, and cellulose. See, e.g., Pettersen & Schwandt, J. Wood Chem. & Technol. 11:495 (1991).","In the present example, the phenotypes chosen for comparison are high density wood, average density wood, and low density wood. Nucleic acid samples are prepared as described in Example 3, from trees harvested in the spring and summer. Gene expression profiling by hybridization and data analysis is performed as described in Examples 3 and 4.","Using similar techniques and clonally propagated individuals one can examine cell cycle gene expression as it is related to other complex wood characteristics such as strength, stiffness and spirality.","Example 30 demonstrates the ability of the oligonucleotide probes of the invention to distinguish between highly homologous members of a family of transcription factor genes. Hybridization to a particular oligonucleotide on the array identifies a unique HMG-box gene that is expressed more strongly in a genotype having a higher density wood than in observed in other genotypes examined. The HMG-box gene is also expressed more strongly in mature wood than in juvenile wood and more strongly in summer wood than in spring wood. This gene is not found to be expressed at high levels either in leaves or buds.","The gene expression pattern is confirmed by RT-PCR. This gene, the putative \u201cdensity-related\u201d gene, is used for in situ hybridization of fixed radial sections. The density-related HMG-box gene hybridizes most strongly to the vascular cambium in regions of the stem where the xylem is comprised primarily of fibers with few vessel elements and few xylem ray cells.","These results suggest that the HMG-box gene product functions in radial cell division, which occurs in the cambium and results in diameter growth, rather than in axial cell division such as may be important in the apex or leaves. Such a gene would be difficult to identify by cDNA microarrays or other traditional hybridization means because the highly conserved regions present in the gene would result in confusing it with genes encoding enzymes having similar catalytic functions, but acting in axial or radial divisions. Furthermore, from the sequence similarity-based annotation suggesting a function of this gene product in cell division and the observation of this microarray hybridization pattern, confirmed by RT-PCR and in silico hybridization, this gene product functions specifically in developing secondary xylem to guide the cell division patterns of fibers, such that higher expression of this gene results in greater fiber production relative to vessel element or ray production. The fiber content is correlated with a principal components analysis (PCA) variable that accounts for at least 10% of the variation in basic density.","Example 31 describes microarrays for identifying gene expression differences that contribute to the phenotypic characteristics that are important in commercial wood, namely wood appearance, stiffness, strength, density, fiber dimensions, coarseness, cellulose and lignin content, extractives content and the like.","As in Examples 25-26, woody trees of genera that produce commercially important wood products, in this case and , are felled from various sites and at various times of year for the collection and isolation of RNA from developing xylem, cambium, phloem, leaves, buds, roots, and other tissues. RNA is also isolated from seedlings of the same genera.","All contigs are compared to both the ESTs made from RNA isolated from samples containing developing wood and the sequences of the ESTs made from RNA of various tissues that do not contain developing wood. Contigs containing primarily ESTs that show more hybridization in silico to ESTs made from RNA isolated from samples containing developing wood than to ESTs made from RNA isolated from samples not containing developing wood are determined to correspond to possible novel genes particularly expressed in developing wood. These contigs are then used for BLAST searches against public domain sequences. Those contigs that hybridize with high stringency to no known genes or genes annotated as having only a \u201chypothetical protein\u201d are selected for the next step. These contigs are considered putative novel genes showing wood-preferred expression.","The longest cDNA clones containing sequences hybridizing to the putative novel genes showing wood-preferred expression are selected from cDNA libraries using techniques well known to those skilled in the art of molecular biology. The cDNAs are sequenced and full-length gene-coding sequences together with untranslated flanking sequences are obtained where possible. Stretches of 45-80 nucleotides (or oligonucleotides) are selected from each of the sequences of putative novel genes showing wood-preferred expression such that each oligonucleotide probe hybridizes at high stringency to only one sequence represented in the ESTs made from RNA isolated from trees or seedlings of the same genus.","Oligomers are then chemically synthesized and placed onto a microarray slide as described in Example 34. Each oligomer corresponds to a particular sequence of a putative novel gene showing wood-preferred expression and to no other gene whose sequence is represented among the ESTs made from RNA isolated from trees or seedlings of the same genus.","Sample preparation and hybridization are carried out as in Example 35. The technique used in this example is more effective than use of a microarray using cDNA probes because the presence of a signal represents significant evidence of the expression of a particular gene, rather than of any of a number of genes that may contain similarities to the cDNA due to conserved functional domains or common evolutionary history. Thus, it is possible to differentiate homologous genes, such as those in the same family, but which may have different functions in phenotype determination.","Thus hybridization data, gained using the method of Example 30, enable the user to identify which of the putative novel genes actually has a pattern of coordinate expression with known genes, a pattern of expression consistent with a particular developmental role, and\/or a pattern of expression that suggests that the gene has a promoter that drives expression in a valuable way.","The hybridization data thus using this method can be used, for example, to identify a putative novel gene that shows an expression pattern particular to the tracheids with the lowest cellulose microfibril angle in developing spring wood (early wood).","Example 32 is directed to generation of a transgenic high throughput cottonwood plant (). Transgenic plants are transformed with the following plasmids: 35S(I)GUS; pFOR090; pFOR126; pFOR188; pFOR200; pFOR238, and pFOR292. Control plants were not transformed. Plants are transformed using as described in Horsch et al., Science 227:1229-31 (1985). Seedlings are grown until of suitable size to transfer into soil. Height and diameters are measured on all plants and from these data, a mean seedling volume index is calculated. This volume index is usually more closely correlated with seedling biomass than height or volume measures alone.","Plants containing the pFor238 plasmid shows reduced early growth of the transformed cottonwood (Table 1). In 5 of the 6 lines growth is severely reduced compared to the Gus controls or the non-transformed controls. In the remaining line, growth is no better than the controls. The mean growth rates of all lines in the pFOR090, pFOR188, pFOR126, and pFOR292 are similar to the controls. However, some individual lines exhibit increased growth rates as compared to the controls.
