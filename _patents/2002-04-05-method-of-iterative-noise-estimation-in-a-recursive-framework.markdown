title: Method of iterative noise estimation in a recursive framework
abstract: A method and apparatus estimate additive noise in a noisy signal using an iterative technique within a recursive framework. In particular, the noisy signal is divided into frames and the noise in each frame is determined based on the noise in another frame and the noise determined in a previous iteration for the current frame. In one particular embodiment, the noise found in a previous iteration for a frame is used to define an expansion point for a Taylor series approximation that is used to estimate the noise in the current frame.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to noise estimation. In particular, the present invention relates to estimating noise in signals used in pattern recognition.","A pattern recognition system, such as a speech recognition system, takes an input signal and attempts to decode the signal to find a pattern represented by the signal. For example, in a speech recognition system, a speech signal (often referred to as a test signal) is received by the recognition system and is decoded to identify a string of words represented by the speech signal.","Input signals are typically corrupted by some form of noise. To improve the performance of the pattern recognition system, it is often desirable to estimate the noise in the noisy signal.","In the past, two general frameworks have been used to estimate the noise in a signal. In one framework, batch algorithms are used that estimate the noise in each frame of the input signal independent of the noise found in other frames in the signal. The individual noise estimates are then averaged together to form a consensus noise value for all of the frames. In the second framework, a recursive algorithm is used that estimates the noise in the current frame based on noise estimates for one or more previous or successive frames. Such recursive techniques allow for the noise to change slowly over time.","In one recursive technique, a noisy signal is assumed to be a non-linear function of a clean signal and a noise signal. To aid in computation, this non-linear function is often approximated by a truncated Taylor series expansion, which is calculated about some expansion point. In general, the Taylor series expansion provides its best estimates of the function at the expansion point. Thus, the Taylor series approximation is only as good as the selection of the expansion point. Under the prior art, however, the expansion point for the Taylor series was not optimized for each frame. As a result, the noise estimate produced by the recursive algorithms has been less than ideal.","In light of this, a noise estimation technique is needed that is more effective at estimating noise in pattern signals.","A method and apparatus estimate additive noise in a noisy signal using an iterative technique within a recursive framework. In particular, the noisy signal is divided into frames and the noise in each frame is determined based on the noise in another frame and the noise determined in a previous iteration for the current frame. In one particular embodiment, the noise found in a previous iteration for a frame is used to define an expansion point for a Taylor series approximation that is used to estimate the noise in the current frame.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

To do this, the present invention uses a recursive algorithm to estimate the noise at each frame of a noisy signal based in part on a noise estimate found for at least one neighboring frame. Under the present invention, the noise estimate for a single frame is iteratively determined with the noise estimate determined in the last iteration being used in the calculation of the noise estimate for the next iteration. Through this iterative process, the noise estimate improves with each iteration resulting in a better noise estimate for each frame.","In one embodiment, the noise estimate is calculated using a recursive formula that is based on a non-linear relationship between noise, a clean signal and a noisy signal of:\n\n(+exp\u2514()\u2518)\u2003\u2003EQ. 1\n\nwhere y is a vector in the cepstra domain representing a frame of a noisy signal, x is a vector representing a frame of a clean signal in the same cepstral domain, n is a vector representing noise in a frame of a noisy signal also in the same cepstral domain, C is a discrete cosine transform matrix, and I is the identity matrix.\n","To simplify the notation, a vector function is defined as:\n\n()=(+exp\u2514\u2518)\u2003\u2003EQ. 2\n","To improve tractability when using Equation 1, the non-linear portion of Equation 1 is approximated using a Taylor series expansion truncated up to the linear terms, with an expansion point \u03bc,n. This results in: \n\n\nwhere G is the gradient of g(z) and is computed as: \n\n","The recursive formula used to select the noise estimate for a frame of a noisy signal is then determined as the solution to a recursive-Expectation-Maximization optimization problem.

Under one embodiment, \u03bcand \n\n\nfor each mixture component m are determined from a set of clean input training feature vectors that are grouped into mixture components using one of any number of known techniques such as a maximum likelihood training technique.\n","Under the present invention, the noise estimate of the current frame, n, is calculated several times using an iterative method shown in the flow diagram of FIG. .","The method of  begins at step  where the distribution parameters for the clean signal mixture model are determined from a set of clean training data. In particular, the mean, \u03bc, covariance, \n\n\nand mixture weight, c, for each mixture component m in a set of M mixture components is determined.\n","At step , the expansion point, n, used in the Taylor series approximation for the current iteration, j, is set equal to the noise estimate found for the previous frame. In terms of an equation:\n\nn=n\u2003\u2003EQ. 12\n","Equation 12 is based on the assumption that the noise does not change much between frames. Thus, a good beginning estimate for the noise of the current frame is the noise found in the previous frame.","At step , the expansion point for the current iteration is used to calculate \u03b3. In particular, \u03b3(m) is calculated as: \n\n\nwhere p(y|m,n) is determined as \n\n\nwith \n\n","After \u03b3(m) has been calculated, Sis calculated at step  using: \n\n\nand Kis calculated at step  using: \n\n","Once sand Khave been determined, the noise estimate for the current frame and iteration is determined at step  as: \n\n\nwhere \u03b1 is an adjustable parameter that controls the update rate for the noise estimate. In one embodiment \u03b1 is set to be inversely proportional to a crude estimate of the noise variance for each separate test utterance.\n","At step , the Taylor series expansion point for the next iteration, n, is set equal to the noise estimate found for the current iteration, n.
