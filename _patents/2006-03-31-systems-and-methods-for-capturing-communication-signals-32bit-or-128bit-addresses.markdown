{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present disclosure is generally related to recording various types of communication signals.","Call centers typically record interactions between employees and between employees and customers to monitor quality of performance. Typically, recording components used for such recording are specific to the types of interactions. For example, a company that records time division multiplexing (TDM) audio has a TDM recorder. If that company also records IP audio, the company also has an IP recorder that is separate and independent from the TDM recorder. In addition, if that company would like to record agent desktop screen, the company would need a screen capture recorder that is also separate and independent from the TDM and IP recorders. Each separate and independent recorder is operative to only receive and record a single specific type of interaction.","Typically, a company has multiple servers that are the source of information to the recorder. The recorder uses the information to determine whether to record the corresponding types of interactions. The multiple servers include, but are not limited to, computer-telephone integration (CTI) servers, customer relationship management (CRM) servers, e-mail servers, dialers, and session initiation protocol (SIP) proxy servers, for example. Typically, these servers may be integrated to different independent recorders. Each recorder is limited to the information provided by its respective server. In addition, analytical applications that evaluate the performance of a call center communicate with the recorders to access the various types of desirable recorded interactions. Hence, accessing a deployment of hybrid recorders can be difficult and may need different applications and hardware devices.","Currently, many companies use a 32-bit address scheme as part of their communication network, which limits the address space to 4,294,967,296 possible unique addresses.","Systems and methods for capturing communication signals are provided. An exemplary method comprises the steps of: installing a first type of tapping devices to obtain 32-bit communication signals; installing a recording system that is coupled to the first type of tapping devices; receiving the 32-bit communication signals from the first type of tapping devices via the recording system; responsive to receiving the 32-bit communication signals, converting the 32-bit communication signals into an 128-bit communication format via the recording system; and recording the converted 128-bit communication signals via the recording system.","Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the present invention will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.","Disclosed herein are systems and methods for capturing communication signals. In particular, embodiments of such a system incorporate a recording system that includes multiple interfaces that facilitate receiving and recording of various types of communication signals. The recording system can be deployed at a centralized location, e.g., within a company premises, and\/or embedded into a network as a service on the network and\/or as intelligence in the network infrastructure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","103","106","103","109","113","109","116","119","123","126","129","133","139","129","133","139","143","100","103","146","146"]},"A Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system  can be connected to the PSTN . The VoIP system  receives and transmits communication signals via gateway\/router . If the gateway  receives the communication signals from the PSTN , the gateway  converts the communication signals to digital communication signals. Additionally or alternatively, the gateway  can receive digital communication signals from an Internet Protocol Wide Area Network (IP WAN) . In either or both situations, the gateway  sends the digital communication signals to a network\/switch , which distributes the signal to VoIP phones , , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["203","203","203","206","129","133","139","143","209","126","213","109","216","109","146","223","156","159","226","229","163","166","239","236","233","169","203"]},"The recording system  can further receive various types of external contact center events  from the multiple servers , , . The recording system enables continued use of the multiple servers , ,  by receiving the various types of external contact center events  and determine whether to record communication signals based on the received events. Additionally or alternatively, the recording system  can receive and store data from media servers with recorder capabilities (\u201cmedia server\/recorder\u201d). The recording system  includes interfaces that communicate with the media servers\/recorder to manage the data stored in the media server\/recorder, such as archive, data management, and search and mine. In other words, the recording system  can integrate with the media server\/recorder as a cluster of subsystems. Additionally or alternatively, the recording system  receives and stores data stored in the media server\/recorder.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["203","303","173","176","179","303","319","323","303","309","306"]},"An event interface application  of the recording controller  receives the external contact center events. An administration application  of the recording controller  processes the external contact center events . After the processing is completed, the recorder controller  determines whether to record corresponding communication signals associated with the external contact center events . If the recorder controller  determines to record the corresponding communication signals, the recorder controller  transmits start\/stop commands  and contact attributes  to a capture engine  or an archive . The recorder controller  can selectively record one to one hundred percent of the communication signals. The recorder controller  can use a business rule engines (not shown) to further selectively record audio\/video that prioritizes events above random recordings. The recorder controller  can record on demand, allocate optimum recording of a media channel, and monitor post-call activities.","Retrieve, record and administration applications , ,  of the capture engine  receive and process the commands  and attributes  from the recorder controller . Specifically, the retrieve application  facilitates retrieving stored communication signals (e.g., meta data) from the capture engine  and transmitting the meta data to an application enterprise datastore . Call center applications  can access the information in the datastore  for analysis and optimization of the performance of the call center.","The record application  instructs the capture engine  to start\/stop recording communication signals that the capture engine  receives from various types of communication interfaces. The communication interfaces facilitate receiving and storing TDM audio , IP audio , screen data , IM chat (not shown), e-mail (not shown), video conference (not shown), and\/or other multimedia data. The communication interfaces also facilitates tapping into the switches of the network (e.g., extension taps, TDM trunk taps, IP trunk taps, and IP extension taps) and communicating with the soft phones , ,  and media server  to receive communication signals. The capture engine  can transmit audio, video, and meta data to a recorder local storage . The capture engine  is a single platform with extendable interface types. The capture engine  has as many as  concurrent channels and is self-sufficient in a closed box with fault tolerance feature, minimum connection lost, and passive tap sense driven recording.","Additionally or alternatively, the recorder controller  can instruct the capture engine  to transmit stored communication signals to the archive  and instruct the archive  to store the communication signals to a local disk , tape , and DVD . The recorder controller  can further instruct the archive  to retrieve stored communication signals from the local disk , tape , and DVD . The archive  then transmits the stored communication signals to the capture engine , which transmits the signals to a desirable location. The archive  has a fault-tolerant storage of contact data and meta data. The archive  can manage multiple local storage media or integrate to a third party server. The archive  further supports the retrieval of contact data for playback applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["326","326","326","403","406","409","413","416","419","423","406","409","413","416","419"]},"The local storage interface  receives and stores audio\/video data in a storage medium. The media channel framework  further outputs meta data to call center applications  for optimization of call centers or other applications that utilize the stored communication signals. The capture engine  further includes a workflow engine  that processes consolidation , compression , archive , disk management , and other processes of stored data in the capture engine . The capture engine  is capable of content segment recording, which can support content level security at an application layer.","A company premises may have a hybrid environment that includes both communication devices operative to communicate with signals with 32-bit or 128-bit packet header, such as 32-bit and 128-bit soft phones, gateways, routers, recording system, and switches, for example. In particular, the recording system includes the TDM terminated interface , IP terminated interface , and VoIP filtering  that can receive and record the communication signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["503","406","409","413"]},"In block , the recording system receives external contact center events associated with corresponding types of communication signals in the company premises.

In block , the recording system records the received communication signals via the determined communication interfaces.","In some embodiments, various applications are able to access and analyze all the various types of communication signals in the company premises in a recording system with one repository. This reduces steps that would otherwise be present if the various types of communication signals are recorded in multiple recording systems. For example, if two types of communication signals are recorded in the recording system instead of two servers, then applications that analyze the two types of the communication signals can communicate, access, and search in one recording system instead of two recording systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["603","606","609","613","616","619"]},"Theoretically, the recording system can have various interfaces to receive and record Ntypes of communication signals in case the company installs corresponding Ntypes of tapping devices. In this regard, the recording system can obtain Ntypes of tap points to receive and record the Ntypes of communication signals.

Other types of communication signals further include IP data  between the gateway  and the call manager\/switch  by way of IP trunk taps and IP data  from the switch by way of IP extension taps. In addition, other types of communication signals include IP data  from IP phones ,  by way of IP monitoring, media data  from the media application server , and video conference data  from the IP phone , as shown in . Alternatively or additionally, some embodiments of a recording system can record communication signals with a 32-bit address, 64-bit, or 128-bit address.","Theoretically, the company can transition to N(generally more advanced) types of communication signals using the recording system without using a separate and independent system. That is, the company does not need to install a separate recording system to record the Ntypes of communication signals. For example, this is particularly useful when the company transitions from an 32-bit to an 128-bit address environment. The recording system may already have the interfaces that support receiving and recording the 32-bit and 128-bit address communication signals.","Another potential advantage can occur when a company installs an advance communication platform. For example, the company upgrades from a TDM communication platform to an IP communication platform (or to any other advanced multimedia platform). The single recording device can receive and record various types of communication signals in either the TDM or IP communication platforms, or both. The recording system can be an integrated recording platform and can include 10-10,000 concurrent recording channels that support receiving and recording the various types of communication signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["726","703","706","709","713","703","716","719","723","719","713","703","723","709","713","719","723","726"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["803","806","803","803","803","803","803","803","803"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["903","906","909","903","906","903","906","903","903","906","903"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"1003"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 12","FIG. 13"],"b":"1103"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1203","1206","1209","1213"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1303","1306","1309"]},"In block , responsive to determining that the communication signals are to be recorded, the recording system determines whether the communication signals are either 32-bit or 128-bit communication format.

In blocks  and , the recording system allocates resources to record the received communication signals and converts the 32-bit communication format to the 128-bit communication format, or vice versa. In block , the recording system records the received communication signals via the determined communication interfaces.","An example of a conversion of 32-bit and 128-bit communication signals is converting the 32-bit source and destination addresses into 128-bit source and destination addresses.  illustrates an embodiment of look-up tables that a recording system can use to identify IP communication devices. Look-up tables ,  include lists of source and destination addresses of the 32-bit and 128-bit communication device, respectively. For example, the recording system may need to convert 128-bit source and destination addresses into 128-bit source and destination addresses. Once the single recording device determines that the communication signals are in 32-bit format, the single recording device uses the look-up tables ,  to convert the 32-bit addresses to 128bit addresses.","Additionally or alternative, the single recording device can include a translation application (not shown) that converts 32-bit address to 128-bit communication format, or vice versa. For example, once the single recording device determines that the communication signals are in 32-bit format, the single recording device uses the translation application to convert the 32-bit addresses to 128bit addresses, such as shown in . The translation application can insert the 32-bit address in a 32-bit section  of a 128-bit address . A 96-bit section  of the 128-bit address  is unused and can be a string of zeros, for example.","Alternatively or additionally, the 96-bit section  can include 80 zeros (0's) and 16 ones (1's).","In some embodiments, the recording system has the capability to transition a company from using an existing communication system to an advanced communication system. For example, if a company wants to transition from using a traditional TDM telephony technology to a VoIP technology, then the recording system can continue to record telephony communication signals and begin to record VoIP communication signals. The company can record in a hybrid environment of the telephony and VoIP technologies using the recording system. Alternatively, the company can completely transition to record VoIP technology. In addition, the recording system can record multimedia communication signals if the company later decides to use multimedia technology. The company does not need to purchase another system to handle the various types of communication signals. Applications that utilize the recorded communication signals to for example, analyze the optimization of the contact center can access the recorded communication signals from the recording system and continue to function in the same manner. Also, retrieval ability of the recordings from both previous method of recording and new method or recording is seamless. This is added value to the company that is not provided in the industry at this time.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementations, merely set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the invention.
