title: Portable dual field gradient force multichannel flow cytometer device with a dual wavelength low noise detection scheme
abstract: Systems and methods for combining dielectrophoresis, magnetic forces, and hydrodynamic forces to manipulate particles in channels formed on top of an electrode substrate are discussed. A magnet placed in contact under the electrode substrate while particles are flowing within the channel above the electrode substrate allows these three forces to be balanced when the system is in operation. An optical detection scheme using near-confocal microscopy for simultaneously detecting two wavelengths of light emitted from the flowing particles is also discussed.

No. 61\/167,235, filed Apr. 7, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was developed under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Aspects of the disclosure relate to a microfluidic system in which magnetic and electric forces are used in combination to manipulate magnetic particles for high throughput multichannel optical interrogation. Other aspects of the disclosure relate to a coincident two wavelength detection technique with noise rejection. More specifically, aspects of the disclosure relate to methods and related systems for using magnetic forces (magnetophoresis (MEP)) to pull particles to the surface of a chip where arrays of microelectrodes generate dielectrophoretic (DEP) forces that cause particles to align into single file streams while being slightly repelled above the chip surface. This dual force technique may also be used to fractionate particles based on size. In addition, the two wavelength detection technique employed with this system uses near-confocal microscopy and customized software to simultaneously detect two wavelengths of light emitted through the fluorescence of a target analyte bound to the particles.","Miniaturized particle manipulation systems may be used for many flow cytometry detection applications, including sensing radioactive particles, nerve agents, organics and explosives, chemical warfare agents, and biological substances. See J. A. Rust et al., 61, 225 (2006); F. Arduini et al., 388, 1049 (2007); S. K. Sharma at al., 61, 2404 (2005); P. R. Lewis at al. 6, 784 (2006); and T. M. Chinowsky et al., 22, 2268 (2007).","In addition, Bromage et al. developed a portable confocal microscope capable of high-resolution microscopy for numerous detection applications. See T. G. Bromage et al., 2003, In A. Mendez-Vilas (Ed.), . Formatex: Badajoz. pp. 742-752. These field-deployable biodetection systems would also be useful in screening infectious disease and bioterrorism threats in industrial environments such as food and beverage processing facilities. See L. M. Wein and Y. Liu. 102, 9984 (2005). However, many of the current systems suffer from the inability to (1) detect trace quantities of substances, and (2) handle complex raw samples. In this regard, advances in sample preparation technology are crucial for the development of robust detector systems that are field-deployable.","Dielectrophoresis (DEP) has been utilized by numerous labs to focus particles in microfluidic systems; however, these systems typically generate single streams of focused particles similar to commercial sheath-flow flow cytometers. See H. Morgan, at al., 150 (2) (2003) 76-81; C. Lin, at al., 13 (6) (2004) 923-932; C. Yu et al., 14 (3) (2005) 480-487; and D. Holmes et al., 21 (8) (2006) 1621-1630. Morgan et al. utilized two closely spaced (10 \u03bcm) electrode chips to provide 3D focusing of particles, but it is difficult to generate single-file streams of particles with the device. See H. Morgan, et al., 150 (2) (2003) 76-81. Holmes et al. generated single-file particle focusing a similar system configuration, but the chip format used in this design still produces only one stream of focused particles. See D. Holmes et al., 21 (8) (2006) 1621-1630.","Meanwhile, magnetic forces have been utilized extensively for their high selectivity and ease of use in sample preparation. See M. A. M. Gijs, 1, 22 (2004). Target analytes can be bound to magnetic particles through designed surface chemistries, enabling highly selective forces to be applied only to these analytes due to the fact that most substances are transparent to magnetic fields. See N. Pamme and C. Wilhelm, 6, 974 (2006). This is particularly important for handling complex sample matrices containing substances that can interfere with downstream analysis techniques.","Labs are developing immunomagnetic sample preparation methods for detection systems. See M. R. Blake and B. C. Weimer, 63, 1643 (1997); T. M. Straub et al., 62 (3) (2005) 303-316; and H. Gu et al., 9 (2006) 941-949. Chandler et al. demonstrated an automated system for detecting bacteria in animal carcasses using PCR and DNA microarrays. See D. P. Chandler et al., 70 (1) (2001) 143-154. The system developed by Chandler et al. utilizes an electromagnet and a ferromagnetic porous material for generating large magnetic field gradients to trap magnetic particle chaperones bound to target analytes. Mulvaney et al. utilized a similar scheme, but with a giant magnetoresistance sensor for detection. See S. P. Mulvaney et al., 23 (2) (2007) 191-200.","However, non-optical detection schemes such as surface plasmon resonance and electrochemical detection often suffer from lower sensitivity and higher background noise, while more sensitive techniques such as PCR and microarrays have slower throughput, are susceptible to contamination, and are difficult to scale-down and integrate. See T. M. Chinowsky et al., 22 (9-10) (2007) 2268-2275; and F. Arduini et al., 388, 1049 (2007). Recent work in microfluidic ELISA systems have shown both high sensitivity and rapid processing time; however, the reagents used in these systems require physical isolation prior to the interrogation step, a requirement that significantly increases device complexity. See M. Hermann et al., 6 (2006) 555-560; and M. Herrmann et al., 7 (2007) 1546-1552.","The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements or to delineate the scope of the invention. The following summary merely presents some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description provided below.","In an illustrative aspect of the disclosure, a microfluidic particle manipulation system is presented to create a balance of forces between the strong magnetic forces that act over large distances to pull magnetic particles to a microfluidic chip surface and the short range repulsive dielectrophoretic forces that cause particles to line up in single file streams while slightly levitating above the chip surface. This device may allow multiple streams of single file particles to be optically interrogated, improving conventional flow cytometer throughput while eliminating the need for large volumes of liquid for sheath-flow focusing of particles.","in another illustrative embodiment, a microfluidic particle manipulation system is presented to fractionate different sizes of particles for sample preparation applications.","In yet another illustrative embodiment, an optical system with noise rejection that uses a bench-top microscope for simultaneous detection of two optical wavelengths emitted from target analytes bound to particles within the microfluidic chip is presented.","Of course, the systems, devices, and methods of the above-referenced embodiments may also include other additional elements, steps, computer-executable instructions, or computer-readable data structures. In this regard, other illustrative embodiments are disclosed and claimed herein as well.","The details of these and other embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102","102","106","108","102","128","102","128","102","110","108","104"]},"In one illustrative embodiment, microfluidic chips  for DEP manipulation of FMPs  were fabricated on 4 inch Pyrex wafers to minimize stray capacitance between electrodes  at high frequencies (MHz). To create the electrodes , standard photolithography was performed on the substrates, followed by evaporation of a 20 nm Ti adhesion layer and a 100 nm layer of gold or platinum. Photoresist was then removed with sonication in acetone and a brief oxygen plasma treatment, leaving the metal microelectrode structures . Nonspecific adhesion of particles to the chip surface was largely eliminated by coating chips with Parylene C. See D. Feili et al., 120 (1) (2005) 101-109. To prepare for parylene deposition, chips were treated with an adhesion promoter (1% 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate in a 25\/75 water\/isopropanol mixture). Acetic acid was added to the adhesion promoter to adjust the pH to 4-5. After treatment, the chips were rinsed in water, dried, and then coated with \u02dc1 \u03bcm of Parylene C (PDS2010, Specialty Coating Systems, Inc., Indianapolis, Ind.). It should be noted that numerous other fabrication techniques may be used to create microfluidic chips , including, but not limited to, laser drilling and patterning, molding, and\/or sputtering. In addition, other materials, such as silicon and plastics, may be used for the substrate and other materials, such as silver, may be used for the electrodes . In fact, even the dimensions and shapes of the various components of detection system  may be varied from those of the specific embodiment discussed above.","Meanwhile, fluidic manifold  may also be made from a variety of materials, including various polymers, glass, or silicon. In one illustrative embodiment, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), an inert polymer compatible with aqueous and solvent environments, was used to create fluidic manifold . The top half of the manifold may contain a fluidic inlet  and outlet  that may be coupled to a glass observation window  through two o-rings  to provide liquid-sealed junctions. The observation window  may be aliened with a hole in the top of the manifold  that allows a microscope objective  to interrogate the microfluidic device . On the other side of the observation window  may lie a laser-cut elastomer gasket  that confines the liquid sample between the window  and a 20\u00d720 mmglass DEP chip  (0.5-1.0 mm thick Pyrex). As before, numerous other fabrication schemes, materials, and dimensions may be used to integrate the fluidic manifold  with channel structure . For instance, anodic or glass-glass thermal bonding may be used to seal window  to chip  depending on the material choice.","The bottom half of the manifold  may contain a through-hole with a fixed nut  and screw  on the underside of the manifold  to attach a magnet  to microfluidic device . In other embodiments, other attachment schemes such as the use of adhesives, thin film depositions, or clamps, may also be used to attach magnet  to device . In one embodiment, an NdFeB rod magnet  ( 1\/16 inch diameter, United Nuclear Scientific, Sandia Park, N. Mex.) may be fixed to the tip of the screw  so that when the screw  is tightened, the magnet  may move up and interface to the back of the chip . This may pull magnetic particles  down to the surface of chip  due to the strong magnetic field gradient produced by the edges of the permanent magnet . See M. A. M. Gijs, 1, 22 (2004); and T. B. Jones, , Cambridge University Press, New York City, N.Y., 1995. p. 36, 65.","As with DEP, the magnetophoretic (MEP) force decays sharply with distance; thus when the screw  is loosened, the magnet  may move away from the chip  and magnetic particle pelleting may cease. One advantage of MEP is that most substances are transparent to magnetic fields, and thus particles may be suspended in any liquid (blood, buffer, milk, etc.) while still achieving high selectivity for capturing only the magnetic particles . Manifold  may be coupled to capillary fittings (not shown) to inject samples into inlet .","Electronic circuits (not shown) may be used to drive the electrodes  and provide processing for signals through detector . In one illustrative embodiment, the DEP chip  is powered by a voltage source through a small printed circuit board on the top of the manifold . In this case, the electronic board may interface to the glass chip  through spring-loaded gold pogo pins, and may connect directly to a custom-built RF function generator. The function generator may be built on a printed circuit board (2\u00d71 in) and powered by a 9 volt battery. The board may produce accurate, high-frequency sine waves (up to 20 V) with a minimum of external components. Here, the output frequency of the board is controlled over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 15 MHz by an internal 2.5V band-gap voltage reference and an external resistor\/capacitor combination. Pulse width modulation may be controlled over a wide range by applying a \u00b12.3 volt control signal. The gain may be set at the current feedback amplifier using a variable resistor. In one embodiment, the amplifier that was chosen has a 145 MHz unity gain bandwidth (3 dB) and a slew rate of 1600V\/uS. The duty cycle and frequency controls may be independent and may be selected at the output by setting the appropriate binary code at two transistor-transistor logic (TTL) compatible select pins. The maximum output current in one embodiment may be on the order of 20 mA. It should be noted that numerous other components and schemes may be used to create electronic circuits for system . These circuits may be integrated directly with the microfluidic device , as discussed in one particular embodiment above, or they may be discrete components that interface with device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["104","104","108","306","104","202","104","104","204","206","204","204","208","210","104","104","104"]},"In one illustrative embodiment, system  for detecting biological molecules may use a sandwich assay on the surface of FMPs .  is a schematic of an illustrative embodiment of an FMP  with an associated sandwich assay in accordance with at least one aspect of the present disclosure. Numerous binding chemistries may be used to create the FMP  with the proper optochemical properties. In one illustrative embodiment, to create particles , carboxylated polystyrene particles (3.0 \u03bcm diameter; Spherotech Inc., Lake Forest, Ill.) embedded with UV-light yellow fluorescent dye molecules and magnetic ferrite nanoparticles were covalently conjugated to streptavidin (SA)  through standard amide coupling chemistry. The particles  were then suspended in 0.016M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 with 0.02% (w\/v) sodium azide (NaN) and refrigerated at approximately 4\u00b0 C. until use. In one experiment, the functionality of the covalently linked SA  as well as the biotin-binding capacity of the particles was measured using biotinylated fluorescein isothiocyanate (biotin-FITC) and the value was determined to be 0.77 nmol per milligram of the microspheres. Based upon this value, the estimated number of biotin-binding sites (BBS) was 2.3\u00d710BBS per particle.","With the SA-biotin chemistry discussed above, the internal fluorescence signal may be used for target-identification for particle  by indicating which particular biotinylated antibody (biotin-Ab1)  may be bound to the particle surface. For multiplexed detection, each set of SA-coated particles with a different internal color may be mixed separately with an appropriate biotinylated-Ab1  to ensure correspondence between the internal fluorescence signal and the target antibody . With this particular chemistry, the extremely strong association of the SA-biotin interaction (K=approximately 10M) may ensure stable anchoring of the biotinylated antibodies  to the particle surface.","The antibody functionalized particles may then be resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 containing NaNand stored at 4\u00b0 C. until use. Multiple sets of antibody-anchored particles may then be mixed into the sample for multiple target capture. Target analytes  may then bind to their corresponding antibody-anchored particles. The sandwich assay may be completed when appropriate secondary antibodies with an attached fluorophore (Ab2-Fluor, in one embodiment)  bind to the target analyte . As an example of an Ab2-Fluor conjugate, one of the experiments conducted used a long-wavelength fluorophore Atto-655 (Fluka BioChemika; obtained through Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Mo.) to covalently conjugate a second antibody to chicken ovalbumin using NHS-ester coupling. The Ab2-Flour conjugate  target-presence signal may indicate the presence of a target on the surface of the particle. Again, Ab2 may be different for different targets and specific to its own recognition analyte. Thus, several Ab2s may be utilized for multiplexed detection while keeping the fluorophore coupled to Ab2 the same.","As mentioned earlier, one procedure that may be performed in system  is the pelleting of the FMPs . This step may reduce the sample volume in which FMPs  are suspended (for example, from 100 \u03bcl to <1 \u03bcl). In addition, while the particles  may be pelleted at the surface of the DEP chip, contaminants and interferants may be removed from the particles  and surrounding medium with a wash step, thus reducing background noise and false positives\/negatives.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["102","108","112","102","106","102","108","102","108","108","108","106","108","102","108"]},"The DEP force, F, on a spherical particle of radius rsubjected to an electric field E is given by:\n\n=2\u03b5(\u03c9)]\u2207\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere \u03b5is the permittivity of the suspending medium and K(\u03c9) is the Clausius-Mossotti factor.

In one configuration, DEP and MEP are simultaneously employed. Here, a lower flow rate is used to preconcentrate particles upstream of the focusing zone and a higher flow rate is employed to overcome the in-plane MEP forces (x,y) and deliver the particles to the DEP focusing zone of the chip. In such a configuration, the magnetic force encroaches upon the DEP focusing zone such that particles are forced close into proximity of the chip surface under the strong MEP force along the z axis. Minima in the electric field gradient that reside adjacent to the chip surface only occur in the diverging gap regions of the chip. In these regions, particles with a diameter >3 micrometers can fit within the spatial dimensions of these minima, whereas in the converging gaps, the minima close to the chip surface are too small to hold particles larger than 1 micrometer in diameter. This leads to larger particles being pulled down to the diverging gaps under a combination of MEP and DEP forces normal to the chip surface while remaining tightly focused into single file streams under in-plane DEP forces. In a second configuration, MEP is employed sequentially with DEP (i.e., particles  are preconcentrated with the MEP force to the floor of the microchannel  upstream from the focusing array  after which the magnet  is switched off and the DEP electrodes  and  are switched on as the particles  flow into the focusing array ). Here, particles  flow both in the converging gaps  and diverging gaps , thus creating a scenario in which the particles  will be focused in the more spatially confined local electric field gradient node in the converging gaps  in addition to the broader nodes in the diverging gaps . In both experimental configurations, during the focusing procedure, microelectrodes  may be held at ground. On either side of the ground microelectrodes  may lay the high voltage microelectrodes . Microelectrodes  may be connected to the same side of the array as the launching pads  and form the diverging microelectrode gap . In certain embodiments, individual microelectrodes  and  may be 5 \u03bcm wide and the final spacing between converging microelectrodes may be 5 \u03bcm. However, in other embodiments, depending on the size of the particles being focused, the width of individual microelectrodes and the spacing between electrodes may range from several nanometers up to several millimeters. In fact, electrode configurations other than the interdigitated arrays  shown in and may also be used to create DEP forces. Examples of other electrode configurations  include straight line electrodes without converging and diverging gaps and tetrode configurations, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["c ","a ","b ","c"],"sup":["2 ","18 ","2","3","2","2 "],"b":["508","510","108","5","108","506","512","108","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIGS. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["108","102","102","6","108","106","502","102","102","102","102","108","102","502","108","502","506","512","108","108"],"i":["a ","b","Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering ","a","a","c.
