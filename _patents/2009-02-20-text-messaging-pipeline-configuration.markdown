title: Text messaging pipeline configuration
abstract: Text messaging between cell phones, computer applications, and/or other communication devices has become a common means of communication. Because of the prevalence of text messaging, robust text message processing may be facilitated through text messaging pipelines. Accordingly, as provided herein, a text messaging pipeline may be configured according to a pipeline module list. The pipeline module list may be constructed through an online service wherein predefined pipeline modules and/or user defined pipeline modules may be selected to create the pipeline module list. The configured text messaging pipeline may provide customized text message processing. For example, a user may select a spam filter, a translator, and/or other pipeline modules to configure a text messaging pipeline. Text message workflow (e.g., SMS messages that are sent and/or received by a computer application associated with the text messaging pipeline) may be processed through the text messaging pipeline.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Text messaging (e.g., short message service (SMS)) has become a prevalent means of communication. Text messaging may be utilized through cell phones, computer applications, and\/or other communication devices. Like e-mail, text messages may be processed to add value to text messaging. For example, a text message may be logged, translated, filtered, fanned out to a distribution list, etc. Currently, computer applications manage and execute text message processing at the computer application level before calling an exposed text messaging service.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A technique for configuring a text messaging pipeline is provided herein. A set of available pipeline modules may be presented to a user, wherein the presentation may be through an online service that a user may interact with (e.g., register a computer application with). The user may be able to select available pipeline modules to generate a pipeline module list. The pipeline module list may comprise at least one pipeline module that is to be associated with a text messaging pipeline. The text messaging pipeline may be configured according to the pipeline module list. The text messaging pipeline may comprise predefined pipeline modules and\/or user defined pipeline modules. The pipeline modules may connect to a 3party service for execution and\/or processing.","Text message workflow (e.g., a received SMS text message that is to be delivered to a recipient) may be processed through the text messaging pipeline. The pipeline modules within the text messaging pipeline may be executed upon the text message workflow. The execution of the text messaging pipeline may occur within an online service. For example, a user may register a computer application with an online service. The user may select pipeline modules (e.g., a filter module, a translation module, etc.) to use in configuring a text messaging pipeline. The text messaging pipeline may be configured with the selected pipeline modules. An outgoing text message from the computer application to a remote cell phone, for example, may be processed as a text message workflow through the text messaging pipeline before being delivered to the remote cell phone.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Text messaging services, such as short message service (SMS), are commonly used for communication. To facilitate text messaging, mobile operators, third parties, and aggregators may expose their text messaging services. This allows computer applications to receive, process, and send text messages. For example, a computer application may receive and count votes for a contest through incoming text messages. The computer application may send confirmation text messages to the original senders, for example.","Text message processing may be performed upon text message workflow to provide enhanced features. For example, a text messaging pipeline may be executed upon a text message to provide spam filtering, message logging, translation, and\/or other processing. Currently, computer applications utilizing a text messaging service may handle the text message processing itself before calling the text messaging service. Providing this additional functionality at the computer application level creates additional overhead, network traffic, and\/or reallocation of resources.","As provided herein, a technique for configuring a text messaging pipeline is disclosed. A text messaging pipeline may be built, configured, and\/or executed to provide text message processing. For example, a text messaging pipeline may comprise pipeline modules comprising functionality that may be executed upon text message workflow (e.g., an incoming text message that is to be processed and delivered to a recipient). Pipeline modules may comprise user defined pipeline modules and\/or predefined pipeline modules.","Predefined pipeline modules may be pipeline modules that are prebuilt and selectable within a set of available pipeline modules. Predefined pipeline modules allow a user to select pipeline modules without having to create the pipeline modules. The predefined pipeline modules may be created, accessible and\/or executable through 3parties, for example.","User defined pipeline modules may be pipeline modules a user (e.g., a user of a text message processing online service) created. The user defined pipeline modules may be associated with the text messaging pipeline (e.g., uploaded to a web service comprising the text messaging pipeline and\/or a corresponding text messaging service). This provides flexibility and customization of pipeline modules. For example, a scripting engine module may be available for configuration within a text messaging pipeline. If the scripting engine module is selected to be configured within the text messaging pipeline, then user defined script may be associated with the scripting engine module for execution during text message processing. This allows for the creation and execution of dynamically defined user logic in the text message processing (e.g., text messaging pipeline) above and beyond creation of a statically complied user defined pipeline module.","Text messaging services may be hosted and\/or configured through an online service. In one example, a text messaging pipeline associated with a text messaging service may be hosted as an online service. Users may be able to setup accounts, login through delegated credentials, register computer applications that may utilize the text messaging service, configure a text messaging pipeline, and\/or perform other tasks. Hosting the text messaging pipeline as an online service may free-up local resources that were previously consumed in providing local text message processing by a computer application.","In one example, the text messaging pipeline may be hosted within a shared computing facility. The text messaging pipeline may provide a secure environment for text message processing because security and permission (e.g., permission to enable execution of trusted subset of code) may be facilitated within the shared computing facility. To enhance security, pipeline modules within the text messaging pipeline may be digitally signed for ownership and\/or assignment of execution permission. The pipeline modules within the text messaging pipeline may be configured and managed by the shared computing facility, thus mitigating interference between pipeline modules and\/or other text messaging pipelines (e.g., a shared computing facility may host a plurality of text messaging pipelines and\/or respective pipeline modules).","One embodiment of configuring a text messaging pipeline is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , a pipeline module list comprising at least one pipeline module to be associated with a text messaging pipeline is received. The pipeline module list may be received through an online service in which a user is engaged. The at least one pipeline module may comprise user defined pipeline modules, predefined pipeline modules, 3party services, and\/or other modules that may be associated with the text messaging pipeline. The at least one pipeline module may have been selected based upon a presented set of available pipeline modules (e.g., through a graphical user interface presented to a user).","At , the text messaging pipeline may be configured according to the pipeline module list. For example, a module list may comprise predefined pipeline modules (e.g., a message logging pipeline module and a scripting engine module), a third party service (e.g., a set of script to execute with the scripting engine module), and a user defined pipeline module (e.g., a filter message module). A text messaging pipeline may be configured to comprise the message logging pipeline module, the scripting engine module associated with the set of script, and the filter message module. During text message processing, text message workflow (e.g., a received text message that is to be processed then delivered) may be processed through the modules in a configured manner. For example, the message logging pipeline module may be executed upon the text message to log the information. Next, the scripting engine may execute the set of script upon the text message. Finally, the filter message module may be executed upon the text message. The resulting text message may be delivered to the recipient through various routing and\/or delivery techniques.","It may be appreciated that the method  may be hosted within an online service (e.g., a shared computing facility). For example, a user may log into the online service. Upon verification, the user may create a pipeline module list based upon a set of available pipeline modules. The user may add additional 3party services and\/or user defined pipeline modules. Upon receiving the pipeline module list, a text messaging pipeline may be created and\/or configured. The user may associate a computer application and\/or other text messaging enabled devices with the text messaging pipeline. The text messaging pipeline may be hosted through the online service (e.g., a shared computing facility). Text message workflow to and from the registered computer application and\/or associated devices may be processed through the text messaging pipeline within the online service. Text message workflow may comprise sending and\/or receiving short message service messages.","It may be appreciated that during configuration of the text messaging pipeline, pipeline modules and\/or other text messaging pipelines may be restricted from interfacing with one another. To facilitate text message processing within the text messaging pipeline, an execution component and\/or interface components may be used to orchestrate text message workflow through the text messaging pipeline. At , the method ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","204","202","218","216","220","222"]},"The set of available pipeline modules  may comprise predefined pipeline modules and\/or user defined pipeline modules. Predefined pipeline modules may comprise prebuilt pipeline modules (e.g., built and exposed by a 3party, built and exposed by a host of an online service hosting a text messaging service, etc.) that a user may select without further development, thus providing core out of the box pipeline components. User defined pipeline modules may be modules custom created by a user and may comprise arbitrary source code. The set of available pipeline modules  may comprise 3party services that may be selected and\/or associated with a pipeline module. The presentation component  may be configured to operate within an online service and\/or other computing environments.","The assembler component  may be configured to receive the pipeline module list . The pipeline module list  may be received through an online service with which a user is engaged. The pipeline module list  may comprise at least one pipeline module (e.g., a pipeline module (1) , a pipeline module (2) , a pipeline module (3) , and\/or a pipeline module (4) ) to associate with a text messaging pipeline . The assembler component  may be configured to configure the text messaging pipeline  according to the pipeline module list . For example, the assembler component  may determine which pipeline modules are trusted. This may facilitate security and permissions between a user, a computer application, and\/or pipeline modules that may be associated with the text messaging pipeline .","During configuration, the assembler component  may arrange pipeline modules according to a set of logic to provide a logical ordering for execution of text message workflow within the text messaging pipeline . For example, it may be advantageous to filter a message before translating the message; otherwise information that was translated may later be filtered, thus wasting resources.","The assembler component  may be configured to associated third party services with pipeline modules within the text messaging pipeline . For example, a spam filter module may be configured within the text messaging pipeline . The spam filter may access a third party service that provides a spam filter list. The assembler component  may associate the desired third party service with a respective pipeline module.","In one example, during configuration, the assembler component  may be configured to configure at least one interface component (e.g., an interface component ) between respective pipeline modules within the text messaging pipeline . Because pipeline modules may be autonomous (e.g., self contained with respect to other pipeline modules and\/or other text messaging pipelines) to prevent interference and\/or incompatibility, an interface component may be utilized to facilitate movement of text message workflow between pipeline modules. Because pipeline modules and\/or third party services may comprise arbitrary source code it may be advantageous to provide interface components for routing of information in a standardize manner. For example, a translation pipeline module may translate a text message within a text message workflow. An interface component may extract the translated text message and input it into a message log pipeline module.","The execution component  may be configured to execute the text messaging pipeline  upon text message workflow. The execution component  may be configured to execute the text messaging pipeline  through an online service with which a computer application may be engaged. For example, a computer application may be associated with the text messaging pipeline  during configuration. An online service may host the configuration of the text message pipeline  and\/or the execution of the text message pipeline  upon text message workflow to and from the computer application. The execution component  may be configured to call (e.g., invoke for execution) pipeline modules in a configured sequence. The execution component  may be configured to ensure text message workflow is pushed through correct pipeline modules.","Text message workflow may comprise sending a text message, receiving a text message, short message service messages, and\/or other data which may be processed within the text messaging pipeline . In one example, execution of the text messaging pipeline  may comprise executing source code within a pipeline module upon text message work flow. Execution may also comprise sending and receiving information between pipeline modules and\/or third party services. In another example, execution of the text messaging pipeline  may comprise verifying security, permissions, digital signatures, performing routing of text message workflow to a router for delivery, and\/or other administrative functioning of the text messaging pipeline . In yet another example, execution of the text messaging pipeline  may comprise fault handling within the text messaging pipeline . It may be appreciated that an execution component may be configured to facilitate any functioning associated with text message processing of text message workflow within a text messaging pipeline.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","304","302","302","302"]},"The set of available pipeline modules  may comprise predefined pipeline modules , user defined pipeline modules , associated third party services, and\/or other functionality that may be associated with a pipeline module and\/or a text messaging pipeline. For example, the predefined pipeline modules  may comprise a log messages pipeline component, a spam filter pipeline component, a translator pipeline component, a distribution list pipeline component, and\/or a filter messages pipeline component. A user may have the ability to select (e.g., a check mark corresponding to a spam filter pipeline component) desired pipeline modules to build a pipeline module list. The user may select user defined pipeline modules  (e.g., a check mark corresponding to an auto response pipeline component) to build and\/or add to the pipeline module list.","Within the online service , an upload of additional modules  may be performed. For example, a user may create a user defined pipeline module comprising arbitrary source code that is to be executed as a pipeline module within a text messaging pipeline. The user defined pipeline module may be uploaded and added into the pipeline module list. Within the online service , an association of a third party service with a pipeline module  may be performed. This allows third party services to be utilized by pipeline modules within a text messaging pipeline during execution. For example, a distribution list may be accessible from a third party service. This service may be associated with a distribution list pipeline module.","Upon creation of a pipeline module list, a text messaging pipeline may be created and\/or configured based upon the pipeline module list.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","416","402","402","404","406","408","410","412","414"]},"The application  may create text message workflow . For example, the application  may send a text message to a remote communication device . The text messaging pipeline  may be executed upon the text message workflow . For example, the text message may be logged within the application message log . Next the text message may be processed by the SMS spam filter . Finally, the text message may be compared with the third party block list service  to determine whether the application  is black listed. Once the pipeline modules within the text messaging pipeline  have been executed upon the text message workflow , then the text message workflow  may be delivered to the remote communication device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","518","502","502","504","506","508","510","512","514"]},"The remote communication device  may create text message workflow .

Finally, the text message may translated by the MSR translation service . Once the pipeline modules within the text messaging pipeline  have been executed upon the text message workflow , then the text message workflow  may be delivered to the application .","It may be appreciated that text message workflow may be derived from a variety of scenarios. In one example, an SMS message may be sent from a communication device to a computer application as an Instant Message or as an Instant Message from the computer application to the communication device as an SMS message. In another example, a computer application may send text message workflow to another computer application. In yet another example, text message workflow may be created by a text message sent to a computer application for the purpose of becoming a post within a social networking blog.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["606","602","606","602","606","602","602","604","606","602","602"]},"For example, a contest where users may send text messages to vote for whom they want to win the contest may be held. The application  may be registered within an online service.

The functionality of the text messaging pipeline  may be performed by executing pipeline modules upon the text message workflow.","Examples of text message workflow within example  may comprise voting SMS messages from cell phones (e.g., remote communication devices ) to the application .
