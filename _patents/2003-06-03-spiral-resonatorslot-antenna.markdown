The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to mobile wireless communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to mobile resonator-slot antennas.","2. Description of the Related Art","Air-to-ground and air-to-sea communication and radio transmission\/reception use surface antennas for a variety of requirements such as, for example, military Ultra High Frequency (\u201cUHF\u201d) band (225-400 MHz), LOS, SATCOM, etc. For many years submarine UHF communication with satellites has been accomplished by using wide-band antennas incorporated within an extendable mast. Frequently, raising a mast may compromise the ship's stealth. Furthermore, the original designs may be cumbersome, inefficient and cost prohibitive. Numerous attempts directed to lower power capability of and to improve compactness of wireless systems have been undertaken over a period of time.","As a result, a mast-supporting communication system has been at least partially replaced by a buoyant antenna towed by a submarine. Typically, the existing antenna assemblies are configured to have a rigid cylindrical core wrapped in a conductive material sandwiching a piece of dielectric material that is partially exposed to form a shallow cavity.","One of the first submarine-towed floating resonator-slot antennas providing a foundation for further numerous designs is disclosed in J. C. Lee's paper entitled \u201cA Slender Resonator-Slot UHF Antenna\u201d (M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory, 1981). This paper discloses a relatively efficient UHF slot antenna extending linearly between its opposite ends and having a straight linear slot backed by a shallow cylindrical cavity of a small diameter, as shown in FIG. . While being in a seawater tank and with the antenna slot being kept out of contact with the water surface, the antenna's performance (gain) was satisfactory. When the disclosed resonator-slot antenna was tested at sea, the results were not as good as those produced in the seawater tank.","Among various reasons that may explain lower-than-expected results, the topology of the tested vertically polarized slot-antenna and particularly, the linearly extending slot are rather critical. Conceptually, the tested antenna and its numerous subsequent modifications have been premised on an antenna assembly in which the resonator-slot material stays at the apogee of the hemisphere defined by the floating portion of the assembly. Structurally, as seen in , antenna  is configured to have a body of conductive material formed with a slot , which is backed by a core , and a coaxial feeder . Accordingly, any deviation from the ideal position would cause a change in its voltage standing wave ratio, and sufficient shift from the apogee, (i.e. making it parallel to the water), would lead to a de-tuning effect. Once the assembly has reached a position in which the slot deviates at about a 90\u00b0 from the apogee, the antenna ceases to function, since, as is well known in the art, the electromagnetic waves propagate in a plane extending transversely to the longitudinal direction of the slot. Furthermore, the selection of dielectric materials and the dimensions of the tested antenna may also contribute to unsatisfactory gain characteristics produced by the tested antenna. Since the demand for commercial and military mobile wireless systems is on the rise, it is imperative to develop a simple and reliable structure of a resonator-slot antenna. In particular, as discussed above, the problems confronting a resonator-slot antenna designer are the following: (1) cumbersome antenna topology and (2) antenna efficiency as a function of its orientation.","A need, therefore, exists for a miniature mobile slot antenna configured to be immune to its orientation (or roll) relative to the apogee and to exhibit a satisfactory gain regardless of its position.","In accordance with the present invention, a mobile antenna having a helical sliver of dielectric material defining a slot in the body of the inventive resonator-slot antenna, successfully meets this need.","The inventive resonator-slot antenna provides both higher gain and roll immunity with no deleterious side effects (except that higher gain does change the pattern from hemispherical, so, the gain is degraded at lower elevation angles), while still exhibiting all advantages of the known configurations of the resonator-slot antenna. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, based on theoretical and experimental data, the antenna's gain is a function of antenna slot twist.","According to a further aspect of the invention, the selection of the high dielectric material incorporated in the inventive structure is critical to the compactness of the inventive resonator without detrimentally affecting its performance. Overall, the resonator-slot antenna includes a sliver of high dielectric material sandwiched between a single conductive sheet.","Furthermore, in accordance with another aspect of the invention related to the optimization of the mechanical tuning of the antenna, the location of the coaxial feeder's point of attachment is selected strictly as a function of the length of the sliver.","A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of fabricating the inventive resonator-slot antenna allowing for a cost efficient and simple structure.","It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a mobile resonator-slot antenna characterized by efficient wideband coverage regardless of the orientation of the slot.","A further object of the present invention is to provide a mobile resonator-slot antenna having a simple, space- and cost-efficient structure.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a low-profile, submarine-towed resonator-slot antenna assembly.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing the inventive resonator-slot antenna.","As shown in , a resonator-slot antenna , configured in accordance with the present invention, is space-efficient and characterized by superior radiation efficiency due to a helical sliver  of dielectric material sandwiched between a conductive material of body  and extending between the body's opposite ends  and . Coupled to a signal-generating source, such as, for example, cavitron, by a coaxial feeder , the antenna  is characterized by the desired efficiency in either radiating electro-magnetic waves or picking them up while being towed by a vessel or a motor vehicle. In contrast to the prior art teaching, as illustrated in , the antenna which is optimally efficient only when the straight slot faces away from a horizontal plane (seawater surface), a portion of the inventive sliver  is invariably oriented in the desired direction because of its helical shape. While a twist of the sliver  equal to at least 180\u00b0 offers a somewhat enhanced roll immunity, a radiation pattern of at least about 360\u00b0 around the body  produces excellent gain augmentation. Accordingly, a helical slot , formed as discussed below, allows for complete immunity of the antenna  to the orientation of the body . At the same time, the antenna  has a gain along and across the slot higher than the one characterized by the prior art antenna as has been evidenced by numerous experiments.","Turning to , a process of manufacturing the inventive antenna  begins with preparing a foil sheet  of conductive material. While the body  has been found suitable for providing a desired gain when constructed of shim stock or copper screen\/mesh, other high conductance materials can be used as well, e.g., foils such as tin foil, mesh other than copper mesh, gold, silver, MONEL(a copper-nickel alloy) and aluminum. The foil sheet  preferably has a polygonal cross section including, for example, a rectangular or parallelogram shape, and may be cut of, for example, 0.005 pure copper shim stock. Attached to one of longitudinal edges  of the foil sheet  is the sliver  preferably made from dielectric material having the dielectric constant of at least 9, for example, about 10, and characterized by a good flexibility and a good moisture immunity. Preferably, the dielectric material is configured as a laminate having an inner layer of dielectric material sandwiched between thin outer faces , of conductive material, as illustrated in FIG. . The dielectric material found to be particularly suitable is a dielectric material having a dielectric constant of about 10, e.g., Arlon AR1000 configured to have a woven fiberglass, reinforced ceramic filled PTFE based composite material with a dielectric constant of 10.0.","To form the slot , the sliver  is treated to have one portion , equal roughly to half a top face  (FIGS. -), stripped from conductive material whereas the other half  of this top face and the bottom face  are still covered by this material. Alternatively, the sliver  can be machine deposited directly on the edge  of the sheet . Further, the bottom face  is soldered to one of the longitudinal edges  of the foil sheet . Preferably, the sliver  is so attached to the foil sheet  that a portion thereof including the half  extends beyond the rolled edge . Thereafter, this construct is rolled and twisted in such a manner that the sliver  forms a helix along the axis A\u2014A, whereas the opposite ends  and  () of the body  each represent a true spiral having approximately 360 degree turn, as better seen in . As the foil sheet  is twisted, the sliver  conforms to the helix and provides the slot  between juxtaposed surfaces of the foil sheet . The process is completed once the sliver  is sandwiched between opposite surfaces ,  () of the sheet  overlapping the faces ,  (FIG. ), respectively, of the sliver , with the surface  coupled to the copper-covered half  of the sliver's top face . Accordingly, the antenna  is configured with the dielectric material of half  of the sliver's top face  exposed such that the longitudinal slot , defined by the sliver , is formed extending along approximately a 360\u00b0 helical twist around the body .","Simplification of the fabrication process is achieved by utilizing a mandrill  of appropriate inner diameter, as shown in , and later removed, as illustrated in FIG. . While initial stages of the inventive process may differ from one another by optionally using the tube , it has been found advantageous to temporarily secure the construct including the foil sheet  with the soldered sliver  to the tube . After twisting the construct to form the annular body  () including approximately a 360\u00b0 twist of the sliver \/slot , the top face  of the sliver  is gradually soldered to the sheet  by progressively reducing intervals between the soldering points. Thus, the surface  of the foil sheet  is first soldered to the portion  of the sliver  every 2\u2033, then, upon a cooling period, every 1\u2033, and so on until a soldering seam between the sliver and the edge  is continuous. Finally, as illustrated in , if used, the tube  is removed leaving the antenna  with as small an outer diameter as less than about 1\u2033 and a thickness of about 0.0005\u2033.","The dimensions of the foil sheet  are critical in relation to the length of the slot  and the diameter of the antenna  in yielding roll integrity. Having formed too long or too short the slot , one will risk having the antenna  exhibit fluctuation in gain v. roll, wherein the roll is the slot's deviation from the apogee of the hemisphere defined by a floating support of the antenna. Furthermore, the coaxial feeder  (,  and ) and its location relative to the length of the slot  (or the length of the sliver ) are also critical to the tuning of the antenna . Advantageously, the feeder  is attached to the antenna  at a tuned point  spaced from the leading end  of the body  at a distance approximating 20% of the entire slot length. The coax feeder  may be attached to the inner surface of the body  or extend along and attached to the outside thereof. Advantageously, the feeder  extends within the body  and via the tuned point to have its jacket soldered to the former while having its center conductor soldered to the outer surface  () of the foil sheet . To further facilitate the tuning of the antenna , a tunable capacitor and\/or inductor can be coupled to the antenna.","Thus, the foil sheet  forming the body  of the antenna  functions as the conductive ground plane and the structural member making the resonator-slot antenna  a self-supporting coreless structure. However, a core still may be used to enhance structural integrity and\/or to improve tuning as long as its material is not RF absorbent and is selected from the group consisting of fiberglass, polyvinyl chloride (PCV), polyurethane, and the like and mixtures thereof.","The use of the antenna  at sea requires isolation from seawater, which is accomplished by enclosing the antenna  (not shown) within a radome shell , as illustrated in FIG. . The inner diameter of the shell  is only slightly greater than the outer diameter of the antenna. Various materials selected for the shell  may include, but not limited to a fiberglass composition and rigid foams subject only to the enhanced buoyancy. Overall, an antenna assembly  including the shell  and the antenna  is specifically configured for use by submarine or vessels. As can be seen, the assembly is low profiled and has a keel  to provide stability to the towable assembly even at high speeds of a towing vessel. As shown, the shell has a kill. Preferably, however, the shell  has a cylindrical body sealed by and end-pieces  to prevent water penetration inside the shell.","The desired frequency band dictates the final overall length and diameter of the antenna  which is a function of the sliver's length  defined between its ends , . Each of the ends ,  is covered by copper\/solder to terminate the effective length of the dielectric element and, as a consequence, of the entire antenna. Typically, higher frequencies require a smaller antenna and lower frequencies dictate a larger antenna. Furthermore, the dielectric constant of the used material also affects the length, width, and thickness of the sliver  and the overall size of the resonator-slot antenna .","While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other objects, features and advantages will become more readily apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment of the invention accompanied by the following drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
