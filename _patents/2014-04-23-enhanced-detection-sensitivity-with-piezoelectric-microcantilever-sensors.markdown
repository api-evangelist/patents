title: Enhanced detection sensitivity with piezoelectric microcantilever sensors
abstract: A method for enhancing the detection sensitivity of a piezoelectric microcantilever sensor. The method may involve providing a piezoelectric microcantilever and inducing a change in the Young's modulus during detection of a species of interest. The change in the Young's modulus may be induced or enhanced by the application of a DC bias electric field to the piezoelectric layer that enhances non-180Â° polarization domain switching of the piezoelectric layer. The change in the Young's modulus may also result from binding of the species of interest to the piezoelectric microcantilever sensor or a combination of binding and application of a DC bias electric field. Significantly enhanced detection sensitivity results from the changed Young's modulus of the piezoelectric layer.

Some research for this invention was supported by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Ben Franklin Technology Development Authority through the Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern Pennsylvania as fiscal agents for the Nanotechnology Institute.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to methods and systems for enhancing the detection sensitivity of piezoelectric microcantilevers. The method of the present invention may be particularly beneficial for biodefense, food safety, pathogen detection and diagnostic applications involving body fluids such as serum, saliva, and urine.","2. Description of the Related Technology","Piezoelectric sensor technologies, specifically piezoelectric cantilever sensors, are useful for detecting the presence and\/or mass of various compounds and molecules. Typically millimeter-sized, these cantilever sensors are fabricated by bonding a thick layer of a piezoelectric material, such as commercial lead zirconate titanate (PZT), to a non-piezoelectric substrate, such as stainless steel, titanium or glass, and have a number of advantageous properties, such as the capability of electrical self-excitation and self-sensing. Furthermore, piezoelectric cantilevers that include an insulation layer are capable of preventing conduction in liquid media, rendering them promising for biological in-situ electrical detection. Current piezoelectric cantilever sensors, however, generally lack the desired detection sensitivity necessary for many applications, particularly in-situ biosensing applications. These sensors typically have poor piezoelectric properties, characterized by a low \u2212dpiezoelectric coefficient of less than 20 pm\/v.","The detection sensitivity of piezoelectric cantilever sensors, which may be viewed as simple harmonic oscillators, is correlated to the resonance frequency shift capability of the sensor. The resonance frequency shift capability in turn is dependent upon the ability to detect changes in the effective spring constant and effective mass of the sensor. Current cantilever sensor technologies, such as non-piezoelectric microcantilevers and piezoelectric microcantilevers constructed from bulk PZT of relatively large thickness are only useful for methods which detect changes in mass and\/or minor changes in the effective spring constant of the sensor.","Enhancement of detection sensitivity, accuracy and efficiency of piezoelectric cantilever sensors would be useful to the development of numerous industries and technological fields, such as bioterrorism defense, health sciences and diagnostic devices. Therefore, there is a need to develop a piezoelectric microcantilever sensor capable of achieving very high detection sensitivities.","In one aspect, the present invention is directed to methods for enhancing detection sensitivity of a piezoelectric microcantilever sensor. One such method involves providing a piezoelectric microcantilever sensor, applying a DC bias electric field to the sensor.","In another aspect, the method involves providing a piezoelectric microcantilever sensor wherein binding of the species of interest to the sensor induces a significant change in the Young's modulus of the piezoelectric layer.","In another aspect, the invention relates to a piezoelectric microcantilever sensor sensing system having enhanced detection sensitivity comprising a piezoelectric microcantilever sensor and a DC bias electric field generation means.","For illustrative purposes, the principles of the present invention are described by referencing various exemplary embodiments thereof. Although certain embodiments of the invention are specifically described herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be employed in other apparatuses and methods. Before explaining the disclosed embodiments of the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of any particular embodiment shown. The terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation. Further, although certain methods are described with reference to certain steps that are presented herein in certain order, in many instances, these steps may be performed in any order as may be appreciated by one skilled in the art, and the methods are not limited to the particular arrangement of steps disclosed herein.","It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Specifically, these modes refer to the direction of the induced stress relative to the cantilever sensor.","Additionally, for the purpose of this patent application, Q value is defined as the ratio of the resonance frequency to the resonance peak width at half the peak height.","The present invention pertains to various methods and systems for enhancing the detection sensitivity of cantilever sensors, particularly piezoelectric microcantilever sensors (PEMS) which use an electrical means for detection. Specifically, the method of the present invention involves providing a PEMS and using the PEMS to detect the presence or mass of a species of interest. It has been found that for certain PEMS sensors, a change in the Young's modulus of at least one piezoelectric layer of the PEMS sensor can be induced by the species of interest, thereby significantly enhancing the detection sensitivity of the sensor. The method of the present invention enables a PEMS to quickly, accurately and efficiently determine the presence and\/or mass of a species of interest with a high level of detection sensitivity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","7","1","2","5","7","4","3"]},"In general, the effective mass and\/or the effective spring constant of the piezoelectric layer change as a result of binding of a target species to the PEMS. By monitoring resonance frequency shifts which result from the mass and\/or spring constant changes, the PEMS is capable of rapid, label-free, quantitative detection of various species, including pathogens, antigens, proteins, and DNA in a small volume of a sample medium (e.g. 100 \u03bcl) or in a cell culture using simple all-electrical measurements. The PEMS is capable of electric actuation and detection and may be used to create a PEMS array to enable simultaneous monitoring of multiple target compounds or molecules.","Conductive elements ,  may be any element capable of conducting an electrical signal from the piezoelectric layer to a device for detecting that signal. In a preferred embodiment, conductive elements  and  are electrodes which may be constructed from any conductive material. Preferably, the first electrode  is constructed from Au\/Cr or Pt\/Ti and subsequently patterned in several regions. The second electrode  is preferably constructed from Pt\/TiOon SiOfor PZT\/SiOPEMS or Pt\/Ti or Au\/Cr on a metal substrate or non-piezoelectric layer. The electrode may be subsequently patterned.","Receptors  may be densely packed and immobilized onto, for example, any bi-functional linker modified sensor surface. Any receptor, such as specially synthesized cavitants, DNA oligonucleotides, proteins, single chain variable fragments (scFvs), enzymes, and antibodies to cells, antigens or pathogens, may be bound to any surface of the sensor. In an exemplary embodiment, receptors  cover as much of the sensor surface as possible. Preferably, receptors  cover the major faces of piezoelectric layer  and an optional non-piezoelectric layer . For example, when trying to detect cancer, monomeric and dimeric anti-tumor scFv molecules, which are composed of variable light and heavy chains of antibody molecule anti-ECD scFV that react to cancer markers, may be employed. Similarly, when trying to detect (\u201cBA\u201d), antibodies specific to BA spore surface antigens may be employed.","Any means of adhering receptors  to a sensor surface may be utilized. In a preferred embodiment, receptors  may be bound to a surface of the sensor using an immobilization layer , such as self assembled monolayers (\u201cSAM\u201d), mercaptopropylsilane (MPS) and bi-functional linkers. In one exemplary embodiment, for purposes of binding scFv, the immobilization coating may be a self assembled monolayer of 3-mercaptoproprionic acid (MPA) on a copper, platinum, or gold-coated electrode activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropy)carbodimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 5 mg\/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS).","In one embodiment, the piezoelectric microcantilever includes a highly piezoelectric layer , which enables electrical detection and actuation within the cantilever. The piezoelectric layer may function as a driving element, vibrating element, sensing element, or a combination thereof. Preferably, piezoelectric layer  is a driving, vibrating and sensing element. Applying an AC voltage (input) across piezoelectric layer  bends and vibrates the PEMS, which in turn induces a piezoelectric voltage that produces readily detectable changes in the magnitude and phase of the output voltage. The resonance frequency of the PEMS may be obtained, for example, by monitoring the maximum of the phase shift of the output voltage. This measurement is accomplished all-electrically, i.e., electrical actuation and electrical sensing.","Piezoelectric layer  may be constructed from any piezoelectric material, preferably highly piezoelectric materials, such as lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (Pb(MgNb)O)\u2014(PbTiO)(PMN-PT) films (PMN-PT), where 0.3<x<0.4, highly piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films and sodium potassium niobate-lithium niobate solid solutions (NKN-LN). In an exemplary embodiment, piezoelectric layer  may be fabricated from any highly piezoelectric material with a high \u2212dcoefficient of about 20 pm\/V<\u2212d<5000 pm\/V, preferably about 200 pm\/V<\u2212d<5000 pm\/V, more preferably, about 500 pm\/V<\u2212d<5000 pm\/V and most preferably, about 2000 pm\/V<\u2212d<5000 pm\/V. In another exemplary embodiment, the \u2212dcoefficient may be greater than about 20\u00d710m\/V. Additionally, piezoelectric layer  may have a piezoelectric coefficient dgreater than about 40\u00d710m\/V.","Piezoelectric layer  may have any structural configuration or dimension. In one exemplary embodiment, piezoelectric layer  may be rectangular, triangular, circular, elliptical, or any other geometric shape. In another exemplary embodiment, the piezoelectric layer has a thicknesses of about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 250 \u03bcm, more preferably about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 127 \u03bcm and most preferably about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm. Piezoelectric layer  may further have a length of about 1 \u03bcm to about 3 mm and a width of about 1 \u03bcm to about 3 mm. In yet another exemplary embodiment, piezoelectric layer  may further have a length of about 10 \u03bcm to about 3 mm and a width of about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 3 mm.","Optionally, the PEMS may also include at least one non-piezoelectric layer , which may be fabricated from any compatible material, including ceramic, polymeric, plastic, metallic material or a combination thereof. In an exemplary embodiment, non-piezoelectric layer  may be fabricated from silicon dioxide (SiO) or silicon nitride (SiN) for PZT-thin film based PEMS. In another exemplary embodiment, non-piezoelectric layer  may be fabricated from a metal such as Cu, Sn, Ni, Ti, or any combination thereof. Non-piezoelectric layer  may also have any structural configuration or dimension. In one exemplary embodiment, non-piezoelectric layer  may be rectangular, triangular, circular, elliptical, or any other geometric shape. In another exemplary embodiment, non-piezoelectric layer  may have a length of 1 \u03bcm to about 3 mm, a width of about 1 \u03bcm to about 3 mm and a thickness of about 0.05 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm.","The piezoelectric microcantilever of the present invention includes a piezoelectric layer . In another exemplary embodiment, the PEMS may include a piezoelectric layer  and optionally, at least one non-piezoelectric layer . Piezoelectric layer  and\/or optional non-piezoelectric layer  may be attached to a clamp. The microcantilever may have a wide variety of structural configurations. In one exemplary embodiment, a piezoelectric layer  may be bonded to a non-piezoelectric layer  that is shorter, longer or equal in length. Preferably, non-piezoelectric layer  may be shorter than or extend beyond piezoelectric layer , so as to form a cantilever tip. When flexural modes are not used, the preferred PEMS need not have a non-piezoelectric layer  so as to maximize the length-mode or width-mode resonance frequency shift. In yet another exemplary embodiment, a piezoelectric layer  may be wider than, narrower than or equal in one or more dimensions with respect to non-piezoelectric layer .","For applications involving detection in a liquid, the PEMS may further include an electrically insulating layer  in order to electrically separate or buffer conductive element  and second conductive element , thereby maintaining functionality by preventing conduction. Conductive element  may be patterned slightly smaller than the piezoelectric layer  to ensure complete insulation of the edges and corners thereof Any electrically insulating layer  may be used as a coating to achieve electrical separation or buffering.","In one embodiment, insulating layer  may comprise a 1.5 \u03bcm thick parylene (poly-para-xylylene) coating deposited on a conductive element ,  by chemical vapor deposition. When placed in static and 1 ml\/min flow rate of PBS solution, a parylene insulating layer  essentially prevents background resonance frequency shifts greater than 30 Hz and 60 Hz, respectively, over a period of 30 minutes. As a result, insulating layer  enables complete submersion of the microcantilever for in situ or in-liquid detection while maintaining a Q value (quality value) greater than about 35.","Alternatively, a PEMS may be insulated using self-assembled monolayers with hydrophobic properties, preferably methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) or a combination of MTMS with parylene coatings of varying thicknesses, may also be used. When immersed in a PBS solution, an MTMS insulated piezoelectric microcantilever yields strong resonance peak intensities and prevents background resonance frequency shifts greater than about 30 Hz over a period of 30 minutes.","Other insulation materials may include AlO, SiOand any functional hydrophobic silane, having a hydrophobic group selected from the group consisting of alkyl, phenyl, alkyl halide, alkene, alkyne, and sulfhydryl. In an exemplary embodiment, the insulation material is mercaptopropylsilane (MPTS), which can also function to immobilize a receptor on the cantilever.","The resultant PEMS may be chemically inert, thermally stable and preferably miniaturized to enhance sensitivity. In an exemplary embodiment, the PEMS has a high detection sensitivity of about 1\u00d710g\/Hz or better, more preferably 1\u00d710g\/Hz or better and most preferably 1\u00d710g\/Hz or better. Preferably, the PEMS has a detection sensitivity of about 1\u00d710g\/Hz or better. Preferably, the PEMS may be electrically insulated to enable detection in any sample medium, including air, liquid or solid.","In operation, an alternating voltage may be applied to conductive element  to drive piezoelectric layer  of the self-actuating PEMS and a conductive element  may be used to detect a shift in the mechanical resonance frequency of the PEMS due to the binding of a target molecule or compound by the receptors. During this process, the method of the present invention involves inducing a positive or negative change in the Young's modulus of the piezoelectric layer, which is preferably a substantial change in the Young's modulus of the piezoelectric layer. In one exemplary embodiment, the change in the Young's modulus may be up to about 70%. The change in the Young's modulus of the piezoelectric layer is preferably greater than about 25%. Most preferably, the change in the Young's modulus may be about 25% to about 70%. One of the factors that induces a change in the Young's modulus is non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching.","By inducing and\/or enhancing non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching, it may be possible to further increase the detection sensitivity of the PEMS in comparison to non-piezoelectric or weak piezoelectric microcantilevers of the same dimension. One means for inducing non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching may be application of stress produced by the binding of target molecules or compounds. In another exemplary embodiment, non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching may be induced by exposing the PEMS to a DC bias electric field. The DC bias electric field may be established using any conventional means and may involve applying a DC voltage across a thickness, length or width of piezoelectric layer . Preferably, the established DC bias electric field (E) is from about \u221220 kV\/cm to about 20 kV\/cm, more preferably, from about \u221210 kV\/cm to about 10 kV\/cm, and, most preferably, from about \u22128 kV\/cm to about 10 kV\/cm. A positive value for E denotes an applied electric field that is parallel to the poling direction of the piezoelectric layer. A negative value for E denotes an applied electric field that is opposite to the poling direction of the piezoelectric layer. By establishing a DC bias electric field, the flexural frequency shift and hence, detection sensitivity, may be further increased by a factor of up to about three in comparison to the sensitivity PEMS operated without a DC bias electric field. The DC bias electric field changes the polarization configuration such that it increases polarization domain switching, which in turn enhances the resonance frequency shift enabling enhanced detection sensitivity. The degree of detection sensitivity enhancement is dependent upon the piezoelectric material, the thickness of the piezoelectric layer, whether it is bonded to a non-piezoelectric layer, the physical properties, i.e. thickness and\/or material characteristics of the non-piezoelectric layer and any combination thereof.","The method may further involve enabling detection of a species of interest using any resonance frequency peak and any resonance frequency modes. In an exemplary embodiment, the PEMS may be operated in a flexural resonance mode, a longitudinal resonance mode, such as a length mode, a width mode and\/or a thickness mode, or a combination thereof. Preferably, the PEMS may be capable of length-mode and width-mode detection, which enables more sensitive detection with high peak frequency intensities and minimized damping effects. More preferably, the PEMS is capable of enhanced detection sensitivity using both flexural and longitudinal resonance modes. In an exemplary embodiment, the PEMS may be used at resonance frequencies within the range of about 10 kHz to about 10 GHz.","Additionally, to further increase sensitivity and expedite the detection process, the PEMS may be immersed in a flowing solution for in-liquid detection. The PEMS is preferably situated in a flow cell system to enable tailored, rapid and simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple organic compounds or molecules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2()","FIG. 2()"],"b":["10","11","12","10","10"]},"These PEMS may be used for various sensing applications such as solid-liquid transition detectors, liquid viscosity and density sensors, mass sensors for in situ and in-water detection. The PEMS may generally be used to detect molecules, compounds, biological elements such as DNA, proteins, viruses, cells, spores, and parasites, or combinations thereof.","The PEMS technology may be particularly useful for the detection of bioterrorism agents. Antibody receptors specific to at least one bioterrorism agent may be bound to an electrode and used to detect the presence of a bioterrorism antigen. In addition to identifying the existence of a bioterrorism agent, it may also be used to quantify the concentration of the agent.","Additionally, PEMS may be useful in the health sciences as a diagnostic instrument. It may be used as a means for early detection of cancers and other diseases. It may also be used to monitor the progress of the disease throughout treatment. The PEMS may be incorporated in a portable device and used as a noninvasive means for testing blood and other bodily fluids for various pathogens, infectious agents and other markers indicative of disease.","PEMS may also be particularly applicable for the food science and food manufacturing industry. PEMS may be used as a diagnostic instrument for detecting pathogens or other disease agents present in food supplies and prepared or processed foods. Additionally, it may also be useful in manufacturing plants and food service industries as a means of intermittently checking food products during different phases of food preparations thereby preventing contamination and the spread of bacterial or viral diseases such as salmonella and ","The effect of a DC bias electric field on the flexural mode resonance frequency shift of a PMN-PT\/tin PEMS, having a length of 650\u00b1100 \u03bcm, a width of 600\u00b150 \u03bcm thickness of 14 \u03bcm, was investigated for humidity detection. The PEMS was constructed from an 8 \u03bcm PMN-PT freestanding film bonded to a 6-\u03bcm tin layer by electroplating. Alternatively, the non-piezoelectric layer may be fabricated from copper. A 30 nm thick nickel electrode with a 15 nm thick chromium bonding layer was deposited on one side of the PMN-PT freestanding film by E-beam evaporation (Semicore Equipment, Livermore, Calif.). The tin layer was subsequently electroplated on the nickel electrode and a 150 nm thick gold top electrode was deposited on the other side of the PMN-PT film by evaporation. The PMN-PT\/Sn bilayer was then cut and configured as a rectangular strip with a wire saw (Princeton Scientific Precision, Princeton, N.J.). 25-\u03bcm thick gold wires (Kulicke & Soffa, Willow Grove, Pa.) were attached to the top and bottom electrodes using conductive glue (XCE 3104XL, Emerson and Cuming Company, Billerica, Mass.). The PMN-PT\/Sn strip was then glued to a glass substrate to form a microcantilever, and the PEMS was subsequently subjected to poling at 20 kV\/cm and a temperature of 120\u00b0 C. on a hotplate for 30 minutes.  shows an optical micrograph of the fabricated PEMS and top gold electrode.","The performance of the PEMS was first measured without a DC bias electric field at a constant humidity. Subsequently, a DC bias electric field and changes in the relative humidity (RH) were applied to the PEMS system as means to induce stress and change the Young's modulus of the PEMS. The flexural-mode and width-mode resonance frequencies and dielectric constants of the PEMS were measured at different DC bias electric field strengths and at different relative humidity levels. Specifically, examples were carried out under a DC bias electric field varying from about \u22129 kV\/cm to about 9 kV\/cm and under relative humidity's of from 60% RH to 30% RH.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 3()","FIG. 3()","FIG. 3()","FIG. 3()"],"sup":["\u22121","3 ","3"],"sub":["p","p","n","n"]},"To measure the effects of relative humidity changes on the resonance frequency, the PEMS was placed in a sealed glove box to control relative humidity. A humidifier was then connected to the glove box to first raise the relative humidity (RH) inside the glove box to 90%. Dry air was then circulated in the glove box to establish the desired humidity level. Prior to measuring resonance frequency, the humidity level was allowed to stabilize for period of 5-10 minutes. Throughout the study, the temperature inside the glove box was maintained at 23\u00b10.1\u00b0 C.","As an example,  shows a graph of phase angle as a function of the resonance frequency spectra of the PEMS at 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% RH with a DC bias electric field of \u22124 kV\/cm. The resonance frequency increased with a decreasing relative humidity due to desorption of water molecules from the sensor surface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 4()"},"For purposes of comparison, the relative resonance frequency shift due to the mass change of the PEMS from desorption of water molecules was deduced using the PEMS mass change,\n\n(\u0394)2\u2003\u2003(Equation 1)\n\nwhere \u0394m=(\u0394\u0393\u0394\u0393)wL and M=(\u03c1t+\u03c1t)wL. \u0394\u0393and \u0394\u0393, respectively, denote the water molecule adsorption density change on the tin surface and on the gold surface. w and L represent the width and length of the PEMS, respectively, and \u03c1=7.9 g\/cmand t=8 \u03bcm (\u03c1=7.3 g\/cmand t=6 \u03bcm) represent the density and thickness of the PMN-PT (tin) layer, respectively. Using two 10 MHz QCMs, one with two gold surfaces and the other with one tin surface and one gold surface, it was found that the mass density changed on the tin surface and on the gold surface from 60% RH to 30% RH, where \u0394\u0393=\u22121.3 and \u0394\u0393=\u22120.4 ng\/mm, respectively. The deduced relative resonance frequency shift, (\u0394f\/f)=8\u00d710, was more than 400 times too small to account for the observed resonance frequency shift of 2.5\u00d710at E=0 and 4 kV\/cm field and more than 800 times smaller than frequency shift of 6.5\u00d710at E=\u22124 kV\/cm as shown in . These differences show that adsorption of the species of interest changed the Young's modulus of the PMN-PT layer and that application of a negative DC bias electric field further enhanced the change in the Young's modulus providing even better detection sensitivity.\n","This phenomenon may be explained by comparing the PEMS resonance frequency measurements. In the absence of relative humidity change, both the flexural resonance frequency and the dielectric constant varied with application of a DC bias electric field.  show the relative resonance frequency shift, \u0394f(E)\/f, and relative dielectric constant change, \u0394\u2208(E)\/\u2208 as a function of the applied DC bias electric field, E, respectively, where \u0394f(E)=f(E)\u2212f, \u0394\u2208(E)=\u2208(E)\u2212\u2208 and f and f(E) (\u2208 and \u2208(E)) are the resonance frequencies (dielectric constant) at E=0 an E\u22600, respectively. The slope of \u0394f(E)\/f at E=\u22124 kV\/cm was about 2.5 times that at E=0 and 4 kV\/cm. In addition, \u0394\u2208(E)\/\u2208 was found to be negative for E>0 and positive when E<0. The fact that the dielectric constant decreased with application of an increasing positive DC bias electric field indicated that a positive DC bias electric field switched the polarization from an in-plane direction to the poling direction as schematically shown in I of .","The increase in the dielectric as a result of application of an increasingly negative DC bias electric field, indicates that application of a negative DC bias electric field switched the polarization from a vertical direction to an in-plane direction in this field range as schematically illustrated in II of . These results indicated that the increase in the in-plane polarization due to application of a negative DC bias electric field of about \u22124 kV\/cm increased the \u201cswitchability\u201d of the polarization domains, thereby enhancing the resonance frequency shift in the presence of a negative DC bias electric field. In contrast, a positive DC bias electric field decreased the switch-ability of polarization domains causing a DC bias electric field induced clamping effect.","The detection sensitivity of the PEMS was also investigated under application of DC bias electric fields ranging from \u22129 kV\/cm to 9 kV\/cm.  shows the relative resonance frequency shift as a function of relative humidity under applied DC bias electric fields ranging from \u22129 to 9 kV\/cm. As can be seen, for relative humidity changes from 60% RH to 30% RH, a DC bias electric field of \u22126 kV\/cm showed the largest resonance frequency shift of any of the applied DC bias fields, including zero.","For comparison,  shows the resonance frequency shift from 60% RH to 30% RH versus the applied DC bias electric field. As shown in , a DC bias field of \u22126 kV\/cm produced a relative resonance frequency shift of 0.75%, three times that of the zero DC bias electric field resonance frequency shift of 0.25%. Note that the 0.75% relative frequency shift with a DC bias electric field of \u22126 kV\/cm was also 1200 times greater than what could be accounted for by mass change alone, (\u0394f\/f)=8\u00d710.","The relationship between a change in Young's modulus and the flexural mode resonance frequency shift was investigated for humidity detection using a PMN-PT\/tin PEMS, having a length of 900\u00b1100 \u03bcm, a width of 700\u00b150 \u03bcm and a thickness of 8 \u03bcm.

As shown in , an E>0 denotes an electric field parallel to the poling direction of the PMN-PT layer. For both (\u0394f\/f)and d, the effect of decreasing the relative humidity from 60% RH to 30% RH was found to have a similar effect as that of changing E from 0 to 3 kV\/cm. Without wishing to be bound by theory, since neither the mass loading effect nor the detection-induced strain accounts for the observed \u0394f\/f, the similarity between the effect of the change in humidity and the change in the DC bias electric field suggests that both changes in relative humidity and DC bias electric field may cause a change in the Young's modulus of the PMN-PT layer.","To examine whether the Young's modulus of the PMN-PT layer changed during humidity detection, the width mode resonance frequency of a PMN-PT strip having cantilever geometry was investigated. To ensure that the lateral stress of the PMN-PT strip did not change signs across its thickness, the PMN-PT strip was coated with two identical gold surfaces, such that no bending occurred in the PMN-PT strip during humidity detection. Additionally, the PMN-PT strip did not include a non-piezoelectric layer; therefore, it did not exhibit a flexural-mode resonance peak. Insert I of  shows an optical micrograph of the PMN-PT strip and Insert II of  shows the first width-mode resonance spectra of the PMN-PT strip at 30% RH and 60% RH.

As shown in , the deduced Was a function of relative humidity overlapped with the experimental results.  further confirms that the flexural resonance frequency shift, which provides enhanced detection sensitivity, is induced by a change in the Young's modulus of the PMN-PT layer.  shows (\u0394f\/f) as a function of average bending strain, \u2212\u2208, at the outer surface of the PMN-PT layer, which is calculated from the axial tip displacement of . The relative resonance frequency shift correlated with the lateral strain regardless of whether the resonance frequency shift was caused by a DC bias electric field or by a change in humidity. Additionally, by comparing -, the change in the Young's modulus appears to be caused by non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching as polarization domain pattern changes were observed in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). A schematic of the polarization domain switching in a DC electric field is shown in . For comparison, the average stresses in the PMN-PT layer due to the adsorption or desorption of water molecules and due to application of a DC bias electric field were estimated as \u03c3=Yand \u03c3=Y, respectively.  shows that both \u03c3and \u03c3were on the order of MPa and the relative Young's modulus change was about 0.5% per MPa stress in the PMN-PT layer, which was comparable to the 1-1.5% Young's modulus change per MPa stress reported for unpoled lead zirconate titanate (PZT). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that the stress effect can induce much larger frequency shifts than predicted by mass loading in chemical and biological detection because surface stress causes a change in the Young's modulus, inducing a change in the spring constant of the PEMS. Furthermore, a change in the Young's modulus may be induced by non-180\u00b0 polarization domain switching due to analyte binding and\/or by application of a DC bias electric field.","It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2()"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2()"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3()"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3()"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4()"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4()"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5()"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5()"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6()"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6()","sub":["RH ","RH ","DC ","DC "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":["RH ","DC "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 8","sub":["p","p ","ave ","ave "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
