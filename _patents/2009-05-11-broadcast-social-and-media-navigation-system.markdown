{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many popular television series have a devoted fan base. These devoted viewers establish websites and blogs dedicated to the television series to share their viewing experiences, review episodes, discuss what will happen next to certain characters in the series, advertise upcoming fan parties, post comments about the series\/episode via social networking sites, and the like. The broadcast television network that provides the popular television series also creates and maintains at least one website dedicated to the television series. The network's website often provides \u201cbehind-the-scene\u201d videos, photographs of the cast, exclusive interviews with the cast, trailers, and offers merchandise related to the series.","There is no single website or third-party service that provides all of the latest information regarding the television series. Keeping up with the latest information about the television series often requires a user to navigate between numerous third-party websites as well as the network's website. Thus, it is difficult and tedious for a user to keep up with the latest information about their favorite television series.","One aspect of the present technology is to provide a service that collects and aggregates third-party content related to a television series of interest to a user. The technology detects that a user has requested to record a television episode (or series), and obtains metadata associated with the television episode. Using the metadata associated with the television episode, the technology queries registered content providers for content within their control that is related to the television episode and series. Content is returned from each registered content provider (e.g., photos, videos, prior episodes, etc.). The content received from the registered content providers is aggregated together into groups of related content based on metadata associated with each instance of content and stored.","One aspect of the present technology is to present the content received from the content providers to a user via a navigation strip. In some embodiments, a navigation strip is rendered upon detecting that the user has selected to view a recorded television episode. In another embodiment, the navigation strip is rendered upon the user selecting to pause the viewing of a television episode during playback of the episode.","A navigation strip provides a framework for displaying a television episode and third-party content related to the television episode (and series if the episode is associated with a series) in a single user interface. The third-party content displayed in the navigation strip may include comments made by friends, previous episodes, videos\/photos, surveys\/trivia, blogs, ratings, reviews, merchandise, and the like. Upon a user selecting a content group displayed in the navigation strip, the third-party content associated with the group is displayed in the navigation strip for selection by the user. From a user's perspective, the navigation strip provides the opportunity to easily view and navigate all available third-party content related to a television episode\/series via a single user interface.","The technology described herein collects and organizes third-party content related to a television program and renders a navigation strip that provides access to the third-party content. The technology queries content providers for content within their control that is related to a television program (or series) a user has requested to record. The content received from each content provider is aggregated into groups and stored. The navigation strip allows a user to view and navigate through the third-party content (e.g., prior episodes, friend's comments, images, etc.) via a single user interface.","The technology disclosed herein will now be described with reference to .  illustrates an exemplary system  for rendering a navigation strip. The system  may include an interface server , which provides a browser based user interface access to content database  via the Internet  to a client's operating computer  utilizing a web browser  and a browser process .

A set-top box may be configured to accept a signal source from, by way of example only, an Ethernet cable, a satellite dish, a coaxial cable, a telephone line (including DSL connections), Broadband over Power Line, or even an ordinary VHF or UHF antenna.","The system  may also include a query server , which forwards queries to and accepts content from content providers  via the Internet , and forwards the content to the content database . The term \u201cregistered content provider\u201d used herein refers to any third-party website or service that supplies online information and has registered with the system . Requiring content providers  to register with the system  essentially forms a pool of available content providers that may be queried by the query server  to obtain relevant content for a navigation strip.  illustrates that any number of content providers A . . . N may be queried by system . Content received from the content providers is stored in content database .","The system  may also include an aggregation engine  and user information database . The aggregation engine  aggregates like media content received from the registered content providers . The user information database  stores user profile information related to the user. In some embodiments, a user may add their account information (e.g., username, email address, content access level, etc.) for one or more third-party content providers to their profile page (not shown) using the web browser . On example of such a profile page is profile.live.com. It is within the scope of the technology to store and organize profile information by other means. The user's account information for each content provider is stored in the user information database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["120","102","107","122","109","120","110","122","108","122","120","114"]},"A user, via either the computer  or the television , may schedule a recording of a specific television episode of a television series, schedule to record every episode of a series, or schedule to record a one-off event (e.g., sports event, movie, etc.) using an EPG. Any method known today for scheduling recordings of television programs is within the scope of the technology described herein. The recorded episode is stored for later viewing by the user. In some embodiments, the episode is stored on the user's computer  for later viewing. In other embodiments, the episode is stored on the set-top box  for later viewing by the user. Either way, the user may view the recorded episode at his leisure by accessing a recorded programs menu (not shown) via the media player  or the set-top box  and selecting to play the episode. Media players, as well as set-top boxes, provide media controls so that a user may play, pause, fast-forward or rewind through the episode.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the technology described herein includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer . Components of computer  may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit  (which can include multiple processors), a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","Computer  typically includes a variety of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by computer .

By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of the any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through a non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through a output peripheral interface .","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks.

It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["302","109","102","108","110"]},"At step , the system  obtains the metadata associated with the television episode that the user has requested to record. There are various standards used today for labeling audiovisual content, which includes television programming, with metadata. The Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) has developed the MPEG-7 standard, which provides for labeling television programming content with metadata. The TV Anytime Forum (TVAF) provides another standard for labeling audiovisual content with metadata. The MPEG-7 standard and the TVAF standard are exemplary only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the technology described herein.","In general, television programming content is labeled with \u201ccontent\u201d metadata and \u201cinstance\u201d metadata. Content metadata includes, among other things, the content title, content description, television station call letters (of the network that originally aired the episode as well as the current network), and genre associated with the content. Instance metadata includes, among other things, usage rules and delivery parameters. Content metadata and instance metadata are created by the content provider. Television programming content is labeled with metadata provided by the broadcast television network. Metadata may be physically located with the audiovisual material, in the same data stream or on the same storage system. Metadata may also be located elsewhere, in which case a link to the metadata is provided with the content. In some embodiments, the metadata obtained at step  is limited to content metadata. In other embodiments, the metadata obtained at step  includes both content metadata and instance metadata.","At step , the query server  queries each of the content providers  for content that is related to the television episode. In some embodiments, if the television episode is part of a television series, the query server  queries each content provider  for any content related to the series as well as the specific episode. In other embodiments, the query includes all of the metadata obtained at step . Alternatively, the query contains only the content metadata associated with the television episode. A query may specify a date range for the relevant content (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.). However, it is within the scope of the technology described herein for a query to request all content that is related to a television episode (or series).","The date range in a query may vary depending on the subject matter of the television episode itself. For example, if the recorded television episode is an episode of a weekly series, the query may request content from each provider  that has been added to the provider's site since the last episode to obtain the most recent information. Alternatively, the date range in a query may vary depending on whether new episodes of a television series are being broadcast (indicating whether the series is in-season or off-season). While a series in in-season, it is likely that more third-party content is being generated than during off-season. Thus, a query sent to content providers  during off-season may have a longer date range. IN yet another example, if the recorded episode is a one-off broadcast, it is likely that third-party content is not regularly available, and the date range in the query may specify content within the last few months. These date ranges are exemplary only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the technology described herein.","A query allows the system  to specify a description of the television episode (using the metadata) program and the date range that content should be within to be considered \u201crelevant.\u201d However, it is left to the devices of the content provider  to plan, optimize, and perform the physical operations necessary to produce that result set in as efficient a manner as possible. The system  relies on each content provider  to return only content that is relevant to the query. As will be discussed in more detail below with reference to , determining which content providers to query (step ) may depend, in part, on the television episode the user requested to record.","At step , the system  determines if any content was returned by the content providers  that were queried at step . It is possible that none of the content providers will have any content that is relevant to the subject matter of a recorded episode. If the system  determines that none of the queried content providers  returned any content, the process is completed, at step . In this case, a navigation strip will not be provided at step  and the system  waits for the user to schedule another recording. If, however, the system  determines that at least one content provider  returned content to the system , the technology proceeds to step .","At step , the aggregation engine  aggregates like content received from the content providers  together. As will be discussed in more detail later, the content groups of like content are the basis for organizing the content provided in a navigation strip. In some embodiments, the groups of like content are predetermined by the system , and may be included in the query.  illustrates groups of like content, which include, by way of example only, previous episodes, videos\/images, comments by friends, surveys, and merchandise. The groups of like content shown in  are exemplary only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the technology described herein. The content returned by the content providers  may be aggregated into different content groups, and content groups may differ based on the subject matter of the television episode the user requested to record (e.g., one set of content groups for sports, one set of content groups for a television series, etc.). The groups of related content are stored in the content database .","At step , the system  renders a navigation strip, which provides access to the relevant content via a single user interface.  illustrates an exemplary navigation strip. The navigation strip provides third-party content available from the content providers  that is related to the television episode (or series) that may be of interest to the user. The navigation strip eliminates the need for a user to navigate to numerous third-party sites simply to view the same content that has been aggregated into the navigation strip. In general, a navigation strip is specific to a particular episode and is rendered upon certain actions performed by a user. In some embodiments, a navigation strip is rendered upon the user selecting a recorded episode from a recorded episode menu (e.g., via the set-top box  or media player ). In other embodiments, a navigation strip is rendered when a user selects to pause a viewing of an episode. These user actions are exemplary only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the technology described herein. Other user actions may trigger the rendering of a navigation strip. Additional details of generating a navigation strip are provided later herein with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["103","306","350","142","103"]},"At step , the system , in an effort to minimize costs associated with querying content providers , determines if all registered content providers  should be queried for content relevant to the episode or if only certain content providers could be queried in order to receive the relevant content. In particular, the system , at step , determines if the episode (or series) scheduled to be recorded is exclusively affiliated with a single broadcast network. Television series are often exclusively affiliated with a single broadcast network. For example, the television series \u201cLost\u201d is only broadcast on the American Broadcast Channel (ABC) network. None of the other broadcast networks broadcast episodes of \u201cLost,\u201d own a website related to \u201cLost,\u201d etc.","Using an example whereby the user schedules a request to record the \u201cLost\u201d series, the system  determines that the episode is exclusively affiliated with a single network, ABC, at step . Thus, the query server  sends the query packet over the network  to only ABC.com, at step . There is likely no need to deliver the query packet to other broadcast network content providers such as NBC, CBS, FOX, etc., because the other broadcast networks are not likely to have any content related to the series \u201cLost.\u201d In this instance, ABC.com processes the query, creates a response packet, and returns the response packet back to the query server  via the network . Relevant content returned by a broadcast network content provider may include, but is not limited to, prior episodes from the current season, prior episodes from past seasons, one or more network sponsored blogs, message boards, trailers, behind-the-scenes images and videos, and the like. Other content provided by a broadcast television network is within the scope of the technology described herein.","On the other hand, if a user requested to record a one-off broadcast such as a sports event (e.g., baseball game, etc.), a news-related event (e.g., presidential debate, etc.), or a movie, the system  determines that the episode is not exclusively affiliated with a single broadcast network at step , and proceeds to step . The system  makes this determination because the subject matter of the episode (sports, news, etc.) is not exclusive to any single network. A sports team is likely broadcast by more than one network during the season, and news and movies are exclusively affiliated with any single network.","At step , the query server  sends the query packet over the network  to the content providers  not associated with a broadcast network, i.e., the content hosting websites, social networking sites, third-party blogs, merchandising websites, etc., for content that is related to the episode\/series. Such content providers are referred to herein as non-broadcast network content providers. The type of content received from non-broadcast network content providers may vary. For example, a content hosting website may include images, videos, etc.; a social networking site may include comments by friends, images, videos, etc.; a blog may include comments by third-parties, images, videos, etc.; a merchandising website may include offers to sell series-related t-shirts, posters, etc.","Many of the non-broadcast network content providers may require authenticating a user before returning content. In order to query, for example, a social networking site for comments by the user's \u201cfriends,\u201d the system  obtains a user identifier associated with the social networking site from the user information database  and authenticates the user before delivering the query. By doing so, a social networking site is able to identify the user's friends and identify comments made by the user's friends that are relevant to the metadata included in the query. The same is true for a content hosting website (e.g., Flickr, etc.) or any other third-party service that requires identifying a user's \u201cfriends\u201d or requires user authorization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["103","310","100","103","402","404","144","103","402"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["103","406","408","410","412","414","406","414","100","100","404"]},"The aggregation engine  adds a tag to each instance of relevant content received from a content provider . As a result, each instance of relevant content received from a content provider  is tagged with a \u201cprevious episode\u201d tag , a \u201cfriend comment\u201d tag , a \u201cvideos\/photos\u201d tag , a \u201csurveys\/trivia\u201d tag  or a \u201cmerchandise\u201d tag .  illustrates that, in some embodiments, an instance of relevant content may include more than one tag; a group tag and a subgroup tag. As will be discussed in more detail later herein, subgroup tags allow the system  to further refine the content provided to a user via a navigation strip. By way of example only,  illustrates that the previous episodes group  includes three subgroups: current season , second season  and first season ; the friend comments group  includes three subgroups: XBOX friends , Facebook friends , and LIVE friends ; and the videos\/photos group  includes four subgroups: trailers , recaps , photos  and behind-the-scenes . These subgroups are exemplary only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the technology described herein. Each content group - may include different subgroups or any number of subgroups.
