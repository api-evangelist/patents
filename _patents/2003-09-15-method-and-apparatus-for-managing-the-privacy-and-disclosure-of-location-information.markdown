title: Method and apparatus for managing the privacy and disclosure of location information
abstract: An approach for managing the privacy and disclosure of location information associated with a computer system. For one aspect, a request is received from a requestor for a location property associated with a location of a computer system. It is then determined whether a privacy preference associated with the requestor has been specified. If not, a user may be prompted to supply privacy preferences associated with the requester. The privacy preferences are then applied to determine whether or not to provide the requested information. A user setting, such as a basic input-output system memory location setting, may also be implemented to enable and/or disable location-aware computing.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An embodiment of the present invention relates to the field of computing systems and, more particularly, to an approach for managing the privacy and disclosure of location information related to computing systems.","Some current and planned computer systems have or will have the capability to automatically determine location properties such as, for example, latitude, longitude, altitude, street address, city, state, postal code, and\/or country.","For some applications, it is useful to provide access to this information to enable, for example, location-based services. Under other circumstances, it may be desirable to protect the privacy of such information.","A method and apparatus for managing the privacy and disclosure of location information is described. In the following description, particular software modules, systems, etc. are described for purposes of illustration. It will be appreciated, however, that other embodiments are applicable to other types of software modules and\/or systems, for example.","For one embodiment, referring to , a location privacy manager module associated with a computer system controls, by requestor, access to each of a set of location properties, where a requestor may be, for example, a specific location-based services (LBS) content server (e.g. a web site or web service) or client application. For this embodiment, in response to receiving a request for a location property at block , the location privacy manager module may optionally determine at block  whether the computer is enabled for location-based computing. If location-based computing is enabled, it is determined at block  whether a privacy preference associated with the requestor has been specified. If so, the privacy preference is applied at block  to determine whether to provide the requested location property information. If a privacy preference has not been specified for the particular requester, a preference may be requested at block  through, for example, a pop-up user interface (Pop-Up UI) box. The provided preference is then applied at block ","It will be appreciated that, where block  is not included, the method may proceed directly from block  to block . Further details of these and other embodiments are provided below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"The computer system  includes a processor  including an execution unit  to execute instructions. The processor  may be, for example, a Pentium\u00ae M microprocessor or other microprocessor available from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. Other types of processors, including graphics processors, embedded controllers, digital signal processors, microprocessors from other sources, etc. are also within the scope of various embodiments.","A cache memory  may be coupled to or integrated with the processor  to store recently and\/or frequently used instructions. The processor  may be coupled to a bus  to communicate information between the processor  and other components in the computer system .","Also coupled to the bus  are one or more input devices , such as a keyboard and\/or a cursor control device, one or more output devices , such as a monitor and\/or printer, one or more memories  (e.g. random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), etc.) and other components  such as one or more antennae , a battery adapter  to receive a system battery, a memory controller, graphics controller, and\/or a bus bridge, etc. (not shown). One or more mass storage devices and\/or other network connectivity devices , such as one or more network interface cards (NICs)  may also be included. The NICs may act as and\/or alternately be referred to herein as sensors.","The mass storage device(s) and\/or network connectivity devices  may further include a hard disk drive, a compact disc read only memory (CD ROM) drive and\/or an optical disk drive. One or more of the NIC(s)  may operate to couple the computer system  to one or more other computer systems or mass storage devices over a wired or wireless network, for example. Further, the mass storage device(s)  may include additional or alternate mass storage device(s) that may be accessible by the computer system  over a network (not shown).","A corresponding data storage medium (or media)  (also referred to as a computer-accessible storage medium) may be used to store instructions, data and\/or one or more programs to be executed by the processor . For one embodiment, the data storage medium (or media)  stores information, instructions and\/or programs - that may be used for location-aware computing and\/or to manage privacy\/disclosure of location information associated with the computing system .","For this exemplary embodiment, an operating system , system software  and application software  may be provided.","The operating system of one embodiment may be, for example a Windows\u2122 operating system from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Other types of operating systems such as, for example, a Linux operating system, are within the scope of various embodiments. The operating system  may include drivers  associated with one or more components of the system , such as the NICs , as described in more detail below and an Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) driver  to provide for ACPI capabilities as described in more detail below.","The system software  of one embodiment may include a location fuser , one or more location providers , a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\u2014ACPI mapper , a location application programming interface (API)  and\/or a WMI API . One or more Managed Object Format (MOF) files  may also be included. Various features and functions of these modules are described in more detail below.","The application software  may include, for example, one or more location aware applications  and a web browser .","Each of the software modules , ,  and  may include other modules and\/or features not shown or described in conjunction with . Further, while a single block is shown to illustrate data storage media , multiple mass storage or other storage devices may be used to store the various programs -.","Other computing systems configured in another manner are also within the scope of various embodiments. For example, while only a single bus  is shown, it will be appreciated that multiple buses may actually be used to interconnect the various components of the computer system in a different way. For example, a front-side bus may be coupled directly between the processor and one or more chipset components while a peripheral bus may be coupled between one or more chipset components and one or more peripherals and\/or other types of buses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["246","305","307","309","260","264","311","313","246","264","260"]},"The system software  may also include a module referred to herein as a location fuser . Where the operating system  is a Windows operating system, the location fuser  may be, for example, a windows service. The fuser operates to combine, select and\/or derive, through algorithmic and\/or mathematical approaches, a reasonable approximation of the computer\/user's location based on readings obtained from at least one of the plurality of sensors . The location fuser  of one embodiment may include a property provider  to transmit location property information, a preferences layer  to manage user preferences as described in more detail below, a pop-up or other user interface (UI)  and scripting capabilities  to provide for communication from browser content (e.g. web pages) and other script-based applications, for example. More specifically, the property provider  may verify privacy requirements and, if appropriate, provide the value of the requested location propert(ies) by obtaining them from the fuser  and the preferences layer  provides an interface for various kinds of user interfaces to be plugged in. User-entered privacy preferences are thus handled and stored for later use. Additional and\/or different modules may be provided as part of the location fuser for various embodiments. A location service provider interface (SPI)  may be provided through which the fuser  may communicate with the various location service providers -.","One or more location aware applications  may communicate with the location fuser and other modules through a location API . Service APIs  may be included to provide communication between application software  and a service infrastructure .","Some elements of an exemplary service structure  with which the system  may interact are shown in . The system  may have access via, for example, the Internet or other network, to one or more databases  that store information such as floor maps, street maps, directions, etc. The system  may also have access to various location servers such as a WLAN location server , a LAN location server  and\/or a WWAN location server .","While the computer system  including the elements shown in  may provide for location-aware computing, for some embodiments, for privacy reasons, for example, it may be desirable to provide a user with the capability to enable and\/or disable location-aware computing.","Referring to , for one embodiment, a basic input\/output system (BIOS) memory location  may be used to store a location privacy setting (LPS). The BIOS may be stored in a BIOS read-only memory (BIOS ROM)  as part of the memories , for example.","Using WMI and ACPI instrumentation techniques described in detail in documentation available from Microsoft Corporation that can currently be found at, for example, http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/whdc\/hwdev\/driver\/WMI\/wmi-acpi.mspx, a Managed Object Format (MOF) file may be defined to describe a Data Block to define the LPS bit  and compiled to provide a compiled MOF file . The compiled MOF file  may then be attached as a resource to a WMIACPI.SYS file (per the ACPI specification, revision 2.0b, dated Oct. 11, 2002) or other file, or provided as a resource-only data dynamic link library (DLL).","The ACPI driver  provides the interface for reading the LPS bit  setting from BIOS . The WMI-ACPI mapper  interfaces between the ACPI driver  and the WMI API  of the operating system  to export the LPS bit  setting to the location aware application(s) .","A Data Block Query Control Method may then be implemented in ACPI\/ASL (ACPI Source Language) code to provide for setting the LPS bit  (i.e. either enabling or disabling location-aware computing) as part of the BIOS configuration as described below. Once the LPS bit  is set, a location-aware application such as the location-aware application  () can discover the Data Block information, including the LPS bit  setting, by looking in the WMI variable name space exported by the operating system , WMI-ACPI mapper  and ACPI driver . Thus, for one embodiment, the LPS bit  may only be set via the BIOS setup screen during BIOS configuration, and not during normal operating system run-time. Further, for this embodiment, the LPS bit  may only be queried during the normal operating system run-time using the WMI namespace lookup technique.","While WMI\/ACPI instrumentation techniques in conjunction with a BIOS memory location setting are described herein to implement the location privacy setting of one embodiment, it will be appreciated that other approaches for enabling\/disabling location-aware computing are within the scope of various embodiments.","An exemplary method of one embodiment for configuring\/reading the location privacy setting associated with a computing system is described in reference to . At block , upon start-up of the computer system , or at another time, the location privacy setting bit  or other location privacy setting mechanism may be configured by a user to enable and\/or disable location computation and\/or any location aware activities through, for example, a BIOS set-up routine.","At block , the setting is saved such that it can be subsequently accessed as described below to determine whether location awareness is enabled (i.e. whether the computer system  can compute and\/or convey its location.)","For some embodiments, the location privacy setting bit or comparable feature may not be implemented.","As discussed above, where location-aware computing is enabled, when using location-aware applications or interacting with location-based services over, for example, the Internet, it is desirable for a user to be able to selectively control the privacy and disclosure of location information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 2"],"b":["3","5","505","510"]},"The scripting may initiate a query at block  for one or more location properties (e.g. city, state, latitude, longitude, etc.) from the property provider  using the universal resource locator (URL) of the requestor. At block , it is determined whether location-aware computing is enabled as described above. If so, then at block , it is determined whether a user of the computer system has specified a privacy preference associated with the requestor URL. For one embodiment, privacy preference information may be stored and accessed via the preferences layer .","If no privacy preference information associated with the requestor URL has been specified, then at block , a request is made to the user to provide such privacy preferences. For one embodiment, a pop-up dialog box may be launched, for example.  shows an exemplary pop-up dialog box through which the user may specify privacy preferences. The pop-up dialog box may be part of the pop-up user interface .","As shown, the user may individually select particular location properties to provide or prevent transmission of particular location properties in response to a request from the specified URL or other requestor. The pop-up dialog box may also provide an option to prevent or enable transmission of all properties as shown. Once the privacy preferences have been specified, they may be submitted and saved to a memory via the preferences layer .","At block , it is determined whether the user-specified privacy preferences allow for transmission of the requested location properties to the requester. If not, or for those properties for which the user has requested privacy, at block , no information is returned. If the privacy preferences allow the requested location properties to be provided, then, at block , a query may be initiated, for example, by the location fuser  to return the location properties. For one embodiment, the query by the location fuser  is handled by one of the location providers - to obtain the requested location information from the service infrastructure  via the associated driver  and NIC ,  and\/or . More specifically, the location fuser  queries one or more of the location providers - via the SPI . In response to this query, each of the location providers may make standard and\/or custom calls to respective device drivers  to extract sensor readings from NICs ,  and\/or . Each of the location providers - may further query associated location servers , , and\/or  to find additional location descriptions associated with the sensor readings (i.e. sensor readings may be used as a \u201clookup key\u201d into the databases on the location servers ,  and\/or .)","As described above, the fuser  combines, selects or derives a substantially best approximation of the actual computer\/user's location using an algorithmic and\/or mathematical approach based on sensor readings obtained from device drivers  and\/or supplemental location descriptions obtained from location servers ,  and\/or .","It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the fuser  may also or alternatively use cached sensor readings or supplemental location descriptions from prior events, rather than execute all of the sequences described above.","At block , the requested information is returned to the requestor. For the embodiment shown in , the information may be returned through the appropriate sensor, driver and location provider combination to the location fuser , through the property provider , scripting capabilities and browser . Depending on the requestor and location-based computing capabilities, the returned information may result in page element customization. For example, if the requestor is a retailer website, based on the returned location information, the page may be customized to show details of the retail location nearest the user. Additional location information may be subsequently be requested and provided (or not) as previously described.","Referring back to block , if privacy preference(s) have been specified for the particular URL or other requester, those preferences may be applied at block , and the remainder of the method proceeds as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 5"]},"At block , the LBS client application is run. An LBS client application may include, for example, an instant messaging application. Other types of LBS applications are within the scope of various embodiments. At block , a query requesting one or more location properties is initiated by the client application along with some means for identifying the requesting client application. For example, where the operating system of the host computer is a Windows operating system, existing operating system Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) may be used to determine the identity of the requesting application, either by \u201cprocess name\u201d or by a \u201cprocess ID\u201d number. Similar facilities are provided for other operating systems.","It is determined at block  whether or not the computer system is enabled for location-aware computing. If location-aware computing is enabled, then for the exemplary system of , a query is made via the property provider  and the preferences layer  to determine at block  whether user's privacy preferences have been specified for the requestor client application.","If so, then at block , the preferences are applied and it is determined whether the requested information can be returned. Information that has been permitted to be returned is returned at blocks  and  as described above, and information specified to be held private is blocked at block .","At decision block , if the user's privacy preferences associated with the particular client application have not been specified, then at block , privacy preferences are requested. This request may be made as described above through a pop-up dialog box or other mechanism. The specified preferences are then applied at block  and the method continues as described above.","If location properties are provided to the client application, they may then subsequently be provided to an outside entity.","It will be appreciated that, for the methods shown and described in reference to , for other embodiments, additional actions may be included and\/or not all of the actions shown and described may be included.","Using the approaches described above, a user may selectively control aspects of location-based computing to prevent or allow location properties to be transmitted based on the particular requester.","Thus, various embodiments of a method and apparatus for managing privacy and disclosure of computing system location information are described. In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be appreciated that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. For example, while the exemplary embodiments described above request location information from external entities in response to a query, for other embodiments, location information may be previously ascertained and stored in an accessible and known location. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
