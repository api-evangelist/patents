title: In-band flow control methods for communications systems
abstract: In the method, a source device places identifiers in data packets to be transmitted. The identifiers may include in-band flow control acknowledgment data in response to a flow control request transmitted from a destination device. When the destination device receives the transmitted data packets, the destination device will proceed based on the data contained in the data packets that are to be decoded at the destination device. If the decoded data packet contains in-band flow control acknowledgment data in response to a flow control request from the destination device, the destination device processes the data packets based on the received in-band flow control acknowledgment data.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to next generation wireless communication systems; and more particularly, to methods for flow control in channels of these systems.","2. Description of Related Art","In telecommunications systems, particularly in the well-known High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) specification in the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) standard, for example, a transport channel such as a High Speed Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) is used for transmissions from a source device (e.g., Node-B or base station) to one or more destination devices (e.g., mobile stations or user equipment (UE)).","Typically, flow control in wireless communications systems is necessary in order to regulate a transmission over the transport channel from the source device to the destination device (e.g., from UE to Node-B). Flow control techniques should account for the receiving capability of the destination device, so that queuing at the destination device is managed so as to avoid congestion and packet loss at the destination device. With flow control, both the transport latency and signaling latency is reduced, since retransmissions due to discarded packets as a result of congestion or buffer overflow at the destination device is reduced or avoided.","In HSDPA, downlink flow of data to the UE needs to be regulated for similar reasons, i.e. to avoid the congestion and overflowing of the buffer at the UE. The problem is more serious in HSDPA due to a fast channel dependent scheduling nature that is present at the Node-B.","In HSDPA, in order to improve efficiency, the scheduling function has been relocated from a Radio Network Controller (RNC, a central, fixed controller at the UMTS core for example that is responsible for managing system radio resources) to the base station or Node B in order to provide \u201cfast\u201d scheduling based on channel quality feedback from the UEs. Moreover, technologies such as adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and hybrid automated repeat request (HARQ) have been introduced to improve overall system efficiency and capacity by providing higher data rates and greater transmission robustness. In general, a scheduler selects a UE for transmission at a given time, and adaptive modulation and coding allows selection of the appropriate transport format (modulation and coding) for the current channel conditions seen by the UE.","In HSDPA, for example, the scheduler, AMC and HARQ functions are provided by a MAC-hs (medium access control-high speed) controller located in a base station. The MAC-hs is responsible for handling the data transmitted on the air interface. Furthermore the MAC-hs has responsibility to manage the radio link physical resources allocated to HSDPA. In general, the functions carried out by MAC-hs include scheduling\/priority handling, Hybrid ARQ, and a physical layer transport format, e.g., modulation, coding scheme, etc. The flow control entity would also reside in the MAC, for HSDPA in the MAC-hs.","Thus, in a fast channel dependent scheduling scheme, large amounts of data may be sent to the UE when the UE channel condition is very good. Accordingly, flow control mechanisms or techniques should be able to inform a Node-B as to the current buffer status, or the receiving capability at the UE, in order to avoid overflow or congestion conditions at the receiver buffer in the UE.","The following illustrates an example where an overflow condition could occur. A UE may be used as a personal gateway, e.g., where the UE is used to connect to other devices such as laptop, personal display assistant (PDA), etc., through a BLUETOOTH wireless protocol, for example, which allows users to make effortless, wireless and instant connections between various external communication devices, such as mobile phones and desktop and notebook computers. The radio link between the UE and the connected external device could be temporarily reduced, since bit rate is lowered as interference increases. As a result, the data enroute to the external device is held up at the UE. To control the buffer overflow at the UE, the present link setup between a Radio Resource Controller (RRC) at the Node-B and the UE has to be reconfigured. Before such a reconfiguration can take place, the Node-B will already have scheduled additional data to the UE. The UE will have no choice but drop the packets meant for the destination device once the buffer at the UE is full. Since packets have already been correctly transmitted by the HARQ, any retransmission incurs additional delay, thereby wasting radio resources as well.","Flow control techniques must be able to avoid these overflow conditions. Equally important, flow control must be able to perform selective flow control on the multiple flows originating from the source device. More than one \u201cflow\u201d or application can be multiplexed in the downlink transmission to the UE. These flows could be of different priority levels or classes from different or same applications. Up to a maximum of eight priorities classes are supported in HSDPA. Thus, if there is more than one data flow existing for the UE, and buffer occupancy is critical for only one of the flows, flow control that is able to differentiate between these different flows is important in order to maximize system throughput.","Presently, flow control mechanisms employing an out-of-band signaling solution have been proposed for UE flow control for both uplink signaling and downlink signaling. In general, out-of-band signaling sends the control messages in the control channel or channels. Out-of-band signaling carries physical layer, or layer 1-generated messages. These messages, without additional signaling defined therein, are essentially blind to the contents of the data payload.","Flow control mechanisms using in-band signaling could be embodied in the following possible combinations: (1) Out-of-band Uplink and Downlink Signaling; (2) Out-of-band Uplink and In-band Downlink Signaling; and (3) In-band Uplink, and In-band\/Out-of-band Downlink Signaling.","In general, uplink signaling consists of transmitting UE feedback to the Node-B request for a reduction of flow rate, for termination of flow, or for the postponement or hold from the Node-B, or the restart of flow from the Node-B to the UE. A UE would send such a request before its application buffer is full to avoid dropping any packet caused by buffer overflow. The Node-B will reduce, terminate or hold the data flow to the UE for a predefined time, or until the Node-B receives a restart flow request from the UE.","In addition to the uplink UE flow control request signaling from the UE, out-of-band downlink signaling from the Node-B carrying the acknowledgment message of the flow control request by the UE can be employed in the downlink to increase the reliability of the flow control mechanism. Errors in the uplink UE requests for flow control may lead to unrecoverable error cases. In HSDPA, where enhancement to the air interface capability is only in the downlink, the uplink is relatively more error prone since no HARQ process and AMC are implemented. The UE can use a higher power on the uplink request. However, it may not be possible to increase the power due to system UE power limitations. Moreover, higher transmit power from the UE will generate more interference, thus affecting the overall uplink capacity for the system.","In the uplink UE request for flow control, either in-band or out-of-band signaling could conceivably be employed. However, presently in HSDPA, where no new uplink transport channel has been proposed, the choice of signaling method is restricted to only the above-described out-of-band signaling method.","Further, in the downlink, there are several disadvantages with using the aforementioned out-of-band flow control methods for UE flow control: (a) flow control for the different flows cannot be provided since knowledge of the data payload types is not available at the layer 1 or the physical layer. Hence, flow control has to be performed for all the flows sent to the UE; (b) out-of-band signaling requires protection through more complex coding and\/or modulation schemes that requires higher power requirements. These complex schemes consume precious air interface resources that otherwise could be used for other functions; and (c) in HSDPA, the out-of-band signaling does not gain from the HARQ retransmissions process that, among many of its advantages, also provides robustness at high Doppler and provides a Turbo Coding gain that is not employed by out-of-band signaling techniques. Accordingly, flow control mechanisms or techniques that do not distinguish between the different priority flows must simultaneously control each of the different priority flows to the UE.","The present invention provides transmission and reception methods and apparatuses where a source device places identifiers in data packets being transmitted. The identifiers may include in-band flow control acknowledgment data in response to a flow control request transmitted from a destination device. When the destination device receives the transmitted data packets, the destination device will proceed based on the data contained in the data packets to be decoded at the destination device. If the decoded data packet contains in-band flow control acknowledgment data in response to a flow control request from the destination device, the destination device proceeds based on the received in-band flow control acknowledgment data.","In an embodiment describing a method of transmitting data packets, a flow control acknowledgment for a destination device is inserted in a non-payload portion of a data packet; and the data packet is transmitted to the destination device with the flow control acknowledgment. The flow control acknowledgment is transmitted in response to a flow control request from the destination device.","In an embodiment describing a method of receiving the transmitted data packets, the destination device receives the data packet with the portion containing the flow control acknowledgment for the destination device therein, stores the received data packets in at least one buffer; and decodes the data packets to process the data packets based on the received flow control acknowledgment data.","Although the principles of the invention are particularly well-suited for wireless communications systems based on the well-known High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) specification in the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) standard, and will be described in this exemplary context, it should be noted that the embodiments shown and described herein are meant to be illustrative only and not limiting in any way. As such, various modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art for application to other transmission systems and are contemplated by the teachings herein. Additionally where used below, user equipment (UE) is synonymous to a mobile station in a wireless network, and base station and Node-B may be used interchangeably. In this disclosure, the phrases \u201cdifferent flows\u201d and \u201cdifferent priority classes\u201d are used interchangeably.","In accordance with the invention, an in-band flow control technique in the downlink utilizes a header of a MAC-hs PDU packet to send flow control acknowledgment messages to respond to the UE's flow control request. In addition, the in-band control acknowledgement messages (ACK) contained in the MAC-hs PDU permits flow control to be activated for the same flow or priority class that the current flow control ACK is currently being sent in (i.e, the MAC-hs payload contains data of the same flow that requires flow control); and permits flow control to be activated for a different flow from the current flow, where the flow control ACK is currently being sent in. Both methods are achievable since the flow control ACK message is associated with the flow identification, or the priority class of the flow. Thus, in-band signaling for flow control in the downlink allows flow control of different flows to be communicated to the UE rapidly, without having to wait for data of a specific flow for the flow control ACK message to be sent.","The advantages of in-band downlink signaling for flow control are several. Firstly, in-band signaling for flow control in the downlink allows the Node-B to selectively control the flows to the UE, so that individual flows to one device may be suspended or reduced while allowing other flows to continue. The decision of selective control may be based on many requirements such as delay, quality of service etc. Second, in-band signaling benefits from the robustness of the HARQ operation as well as the Turbo coding gain that exists in the downlink transport channel such as the HS-DSCH transport channel for HSDPA for UMTS Finally, acknowledgment in the downlink provides reliable two-way communications for handling flow control requests from the UE.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","130","110","111","112","113","114","130","116","130"]},"In accordance with an embodiment, the method provides in-band signaling for flow control in the downlink. This is done by utilizing additional available space in the TSN  of the header  in order to insert in-band flow control acknowledgment data for acknowledging a UE's flow control request, which is to be transmitted in the data packet over an HS-DSCH, for example, to a UE. The flow control acknowledgement to the UE's request tells the UE what to do so as not to become overloaded. As an example, the acknowledgment may contain messages to terminate a particular flow, hold up a particular flow, simply acknowledge a request to reduce the rate for a particular flow or to restart a particular flow. Providing the flow control acknowledgment in-band, where the payload of each data packet is indicated by priority, ensures that the in-band flow control acknowledgment data is per priority. This enables the base station to control the flow of various priorities of transmitted data packets in the downlink.","In this embodiment, providing in-band flow control in the downlink is possible due to the current size of the TSN in the HSPDA standard (6 bits), which provides sufficient space (2or 64 possible values) for inclusion of both the TSN and the in-band flow control acknowledgement.","In another embodiment, instead of allocating space in TSN  for insertion of the in-band flow control acknowledgment, the ASN  is utilized for acknowledging the UE's flow control request, in addition to performing other functions. This is possible since the ASN  contains sufficient space, depending on the field size allocated for the ASN. For an ASN of 5 bits, 32 possible values for the ASN are available. Thus, 1-4 of these values, for example, could be used to acknowledge the various flow control requests from the UE.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"As shown in , a source device (e.g., a base station or Node-B)  transmits data packets over a medium  to a destination device (e.g., user equipment (UE)) . Hereinafter, the source device  will be referred to as base station  and the destination device  will be referred to as the UE , but it will be understood that the UE could be the source device and the base station the destination device.","The base station  includes a parser  that receives data packets for transmission from other base station circuitry, not shown for the sake of brevity and clarity. The data packets originate from one or more logical channels, and have been assigned a priority class. As discussed above, each data packet includes a PCI  indicating the priority class (1 through N) of the data packet. As described in , the PCI  may be included in a header portion of the data packet.","The parser  parses the data packets into one of N buffers  based on the PCI  of the data packet. A buffer  is provided for, and associated with, a different one of the N priority classes; hence, N buffers  are provided. For example, the parser  outputs data packets  having a PCI of 1 to the buffer  associated with priority class 1, outputs data packets  having a PCI of 2 to the buffer  having a priority class of 2, etc.","A scheduler  receives the data packets from the buffers , and schedules the data packets  for transmission by a transmitter . Specifically, a scheduling unit  receives the data packets  based on their priority class, and orders the data packets for transmission. Data packets having a higher priority class will be scheduled for transmission prior to data packets of a lower class, and data packets having a higher priority class may pre-empt the transmission of data packets having a lower priority class. If a data packet  having a higher priority class than the data packet currently undergoing transmission\/re-transmission is received by the scheduling unit , the scheduling unit  may instructs the transmitter  to abort transmission of the lower priority class data packet. The scheduling unit  also notifies an ASN generator  (discussed in detail below) of the aborted data packet.","A transmission sequence number (TSN) generator  receives the data packets for transmission from the scheduling unit  and assigns each data packet a transmission sequence number. The TSN generator  keeps track of a transmission sequence for each priority class accordingly, there are 1 transmission sequence number for every priority class. The TSN generator  assigns the next TSN in the transmission sequence for the priority class to which a received data packet belongs. Specifically, the TSN is disposed in a predetermined position in the data packet. As described in , the TSN may form part of header portion of the data packet.","After assigning a TSN to a data packet, the TSN generator  increments the TSN, and this new TSN will be assigned to the next, received data packet of that priority class. In a preferred embodiment, the TSN generator  begins by assigning a TSN of, for example, 0, and increments the TSN by 1.","Because a different transmission sequence is associated with each priority class, the data packets of a particular priority class have TSNs that are independent of the TSNs assigned to data packets of other priority classes. As a result, two data packets of different priority classes can have the same TSN.","An acknowledge sequence generator  generates an acknowledge sequence number (ASN) based on information from a receiving system \u2032, and inserts the generated ASN into a predetermined position in the data packet. For example, as shown in , the ASN may form part of the header portion for the data packet. When the source device receives an acknowledgment that the destination device has received a data packet, the source device inserts an acknowledge sequence number in a data packet for transmission. The acknowledge sequence number is the same as the transmission sequence number of the acknowledged data packet. On the receive side, the destination device will treat a missing data packet having the same transmission sequence number as the acknowledge sequence number as having been output to the next, upper layer of processing; namely, confirmation that the missing data packet is lost. And, because the missing data packet is flushed, any stall in the delivery of correctly received data packets to the higher layers is avoided.","Furthermore, when the transmission of a data packet is aborted, the source device inserts an acknowledge sequence number in a data packet for transmission. The acknowledge sequence number is the same as the transmission sequence number of the aborted data packet. Consequently, on the receive side, the destination device will treat the missing, aborted data packet having the same transmission sequence number as the acknowledge sequence number as having been output to the next, upper layer of processing. Because the missing, aborted data packet is flushed, again a stall situation is avoided.","The receiving system \u2032 has the same structure as the receiving system  in the UE , and will, therefore, not be described in detail as the receiving system  is described in detail below. Briefly, however, the receiving system \u2032 differs in that it notifies the ASN generator  of the TSN and PCI for data packets that have been acknowledged by the user equipment  as properly received.","The ASN generator  generates an ASN equal to the TSN of the acknowledged data packet, and stores the generated ASN by the priority class of the acknowledged data packet. The ASN generator  also generates an ASN equal to the TSN of the data packet aborted by the scheduling unit . Specifically, the scheduling unit  identifies the data packet to be aborted by its TSN and PCI, the ASN generator  generates the ASN equal to the TSN of the aborted data packet, and stores the generated ASN with the other ASNs having the same priority class as the aborted data packet. The ASN generator  receives a data packet for transmission from the TSN generator , and identifies its priority class from its PCI. The ASN generator  then looks up the stored ASNs having that priority class, and inserts, for example, in one embodiment, the latest or most current stored ASN in the data packet. In this manner, the ASNs are inserted into the header portions  of the data packets  on a last-in, first-out basis.","A transmitter  receives the data packets from the scheduler , and multiplexes the data packets into a transport channel, such as a HS-DSCH, for transmission via a duplexer  and one or more antennas At over medium . For data packets that the receiving system \u2032 identifies as not being properly received by the UE , the transmitter  retransmits those data packets. Additionally, the transmitter  expects to receive confirmation that a data packet has been received at a predetermined period of time after transmission. If no such confirmation is received, then the transmitter  retransmits the data packet. And, after a data packet has been retransmitted a predetermined number of times, the transmitter  discard the data packet without attempting any further retransmissions.","At the UE , the data packets are received by a receiving system  via one or more receive antennas Ar and a duplexer . A receiver  decodes the data packets, and outputs the data packets to a single buffer , which stores the data packets. In a preferred embodiment, the buffer  is a random access memory. When the receiver  sends the data packets to the buffer , the receiver  instructs the transmission system \u2032 to output an acknowledge response for the received data packet. The acknowledge response identifies the received data packet by its PCI and TSN and indicates that the data packet has been received. However, if the receiver  is unable to receive the data packet (e.g., cannot decode the data packet), the receiver  instructs the transmission system \u2032 to send a non-acknowledge response for the data packet. The non-acknowledge response in this embodiment indicates that the data packet has not been correctly received, and due to fore mentioned associated timing between the transmission and the reception of the acknowledge indicator at the transmitter, the transmitter is able to identify the received data packet by its PCI and TSN. The transmission system \u2032 may have the same structure as the transmission system  in the base station  described in detail above.","Control logic  in the UE  causes the buffer  to output data packets to the next, upper layer of processing based on the PCI and TSN of the data packets. Specifically, the control logic  includes a counter  associated with each priority class. Accordingly, there are N counters , one for each priority class. The counter  is set to the next expected in-sequence value of the TSN in the received packet data. After the buffer  has been loaded with a number of data packets, the control logic  examines the TSNs of the data packets for priority class 1 and compares the counter  for that priority class to a value equal to the lowest TSN of the received data packets. If the received data packet has a TSN equal to the count value of the counter  for that priority class, the counter  is incremented. In this manner, even though data packets are received out-of-sequence by the user equipment , the data packets are sent to the next, upper layer of system processing in-sequence. This process is then repeated for other data packets having the same priority class and in turn repeated for each priority class.","Furthermore, the same comparison, output and increment process is performed for data packets in the other priority classes using their associated counters . The count down timer  is started when a data packet having a TSN greater than the count value of the counter  is received. The control logic  initializes a count down timer (e.g., 10 seconds)  associated with the counter  when either the counter is reset, or all the packet data with TSN values between the count value of the counter  and the packet data with the value SN, are received, or the timer expires. Where SN is the TSN value of the packet data received for which the timer is started. If the count down timer  expires before the buffer  receives a data packet having a TSN equal to the count value of the counter  for that priority class, the counter  is incremented. In this manner, even though data packets are received out of order by the user equipment , the data packets are sent to the next, upper layer of system processing in sequence.","The control logic  further monitors any ASNs in the received data packets. If the counter  for a priority class has the same count value as the ASN in a received data packet belonging to that priority class and a data packet in that priority class having a TSN equal to the ASN is not present in the buffer (e.g., is missing), the control logic  will treat the data packet having that priority class and a TSN equal to the ASN as having been output to the next, upper processing layer. Namely, the control logic  will increment the counter  associated with that priority class. This effectively flushes that data packet.","The overall structure having been described, a flow control method in accordance with one embodiment is now described with reference to the flow diagram of , where the header for a MAC-hs PDU is appended. Initially, scheduler  assigns a TSN (Step S) to UE ; this may be done by a suitable algorithm in scheduler . The scheduler  then checks if any flow control request for a particular flow has been received from the UE  (Step S). If a flow control request has been received (YES at Step S), TSN generator  will replace the TSN assigned to UE  in Step S with the flow control ACK message through a pre-allocated TSN number (Step S) for flow control in TSN  of the header , and ASN generator  then proceeds to generate an ASN number (Step S). A single location or space in TSN  is assumed to be allocated for the in-band flow control acknowledgment (ACK) message. For this embodiment, the flow control request is for the same data that is being sent in the current MAC-hs PDU packet over an HS-DSCH to UE .","If, after assigning a TSN, it is determined that UE  has not sent a flow control request (NO at Step S), the TSN generator  increments the current TSN value (Step S) and this new TSN will be assigned to the next, received data packet of that priority class. In a preferred embodiment, the TSN generator  begins by assigning a TSN of, for example, 0, and increments the TSN by 1, as discussed above regarding .","In a variation of this first flow control embodiment, the flow control request from the UE  may be for a flow or data flow priority that has no data to send. In order to send a flow control command to the UE , the PCI field is then set to the value equal to the PCI for the flow requested by the UE . A MAC-hs PDU of zero payload with PCI set to the PCI flow requested can then be sent to the UE with the TSN value indicating termination of flow for the flow identified by the PCI value.","Similar to that described in , ASN generator  generates an ASN (Step S) based on information from a receiving system \u2032, and inserts (Step S) the generated ASN into the header portion of the data packet. Transmitter  receives the data packets with PCI, the TSN  containing a valid transmission sequence number only, or containing the flow control ACK message through a pre-allocated spacer (Step S) for flow control in TSN  of the header , and the generated ASN  from the scheduler , and multiplexes (Step S) the data packets into a transport channel, such as a HS-DSCH, for transmission (Step S) via a duplexer  and one or more antennas At over medium .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["14","16","41","23","16","23","16","11"]},"Specifically, the UE , upon receiving the MAC-hs PDU (e.g., data packet), de-assembles the MAC-hs PDU (e.g., decoding of Step S) to obtain the TSN value from the TSN field. The UE  then determines whether or not the decoded TSN (Step S) is a valid TSN with no flow control request therein, or a TSN value that has been assigned for flow control signaling to UE . If the TSN value is a valid transmission sequence number (NO at Step S), the transmission system \u2032 transmits an acknowledge response to the base station  that identifies the received data packet by its PCI and TSN and indicates (Step S) that the data packet has been received. If the TSN value is equal to the TSN value assigned for flow control (YES at Step S), the UE  will interpret the TSN as a message that the flow indicated by the PCI will be controlled as requested by the UE in its flow control request. The flow is then terminated (Step S) in this example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},"TSN generator  receives the data packets for transmission from the scheduling unit  and assigns (Step S) each data packet a transmission sequence number. The TSN generator  assigns the next TSN in the transmission sequence, (Step S) incrementing the TSN so a new TSN is assigned to the next, received data packet of that priority class.","Similar to that described in , ASN generator  generates an ASN (Step S) based on information from a receiving system \u2032. However, if a flow control request has been received in the uplink from the UE (YES in Step S), the ASN generator  will replace the ASN assigned in Step S with the flow control ACK message through a pre-allocated ASN number (Step S) for flow control in the ASN . In this embodiment, a single location in the ASN space is assumed to be allocated for the in-band flow control acknowledgment message, although one or more spaces could be allocated for the in-band flow control acknowledgment message. If no flow control request was received (NO at Step S), the generated ASN is inserted (Step S).","Transmitter  receives the data packets with PCI, TSN, and ASN with either valid acknowledgment sequence number or in-band flow acknowledgment data from the scheduler , and multiplexes (Step S) the data packets into a transport channel, such as a HS-DSCH, for transmission (Step S) via a duplexer  and one or more antennas At over medium .","In a variation of this second flow control embodiment, the flow control request from the UE  may be for a flow or data flow priority that has no data to send.

For example, the flow control ACK message could contain information indicating one of Stop, Hold, or Restart, or a combination of some or all of them. If the flow control ACK message indicates STOP, UE  receives information indicating that the flow control request has been received and that transmission for a particular flow (e.g., the requested flow) is being terminated. If the flow control ACK message indicates HOLD, UE  receives information indicating that the flow control request has been received, that UE  should continue to send flow control requests, and that data flow to UE  will remain active into the future. If the flow control ACK message indicates RESTART, UE  receives information indicating that the flow control request to restart data flow has been received by BS , and that the destination device is to resume receiving data flow from BS .","Accordingly the flow control acknowledgment implemented in the above embodiments use either a TSN space in the TSN field or the ASN field in a MAC-hs PDU packet to signal flow control acknowledgment message(s).
