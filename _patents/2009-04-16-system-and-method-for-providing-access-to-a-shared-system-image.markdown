title: System and method for providing access to a shared system image
abstract: Systems and methods for providing data integrity for stored data are disclosed. A method for providing access to a remote shared image may include receiving from a first provisioning server a request to create a write space for a client communicatively coupled to the first provisioning server. The message may further include creating a partition on a first logical unit disposed in a storage array, the first logical unit communicatively coupled to the first provisioning server and associated with the client. The method may additionally include storing a thin clone of a shared image on the partition, the shared image common to the client and at least one other client and stored on a second logical unit, the thin clone comprising a write space for data specific to the client.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates in general to storage and processing of data, and more particularly to access to a shared system image.","As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and\/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.","Increasingly, information handling systems have utilized on-demand desktop streaming (ODDS) and other similar methods. ODDS is an approach used to provide a single, standard desktop image (e.g., an operating system and one or more application programs) to information handling systems from a network service. Because the shared image may be configured, delivered and managed centrally, costs associated with maintaining the network of information handling systems may be minimized, while providing greater security and flexibility. In an ODDS implementation, individual information handling systems are often communicatively coupled to one or more provisioning servers. The one or more provisioning servers are generally configured to manage input\/output (I\/O) communications between the individual information handling systems and a storage array communicatively coupled to the one or more provisioning servers. For example, because a user of an information handling system may write data specific to that user and not common to the shared image, an individual write space may be created for such user-specific data. Accordingly, the one or more provisioning servers may create and\/or manage the user-specific write spaces, and may present a user of an information handling system with the shared image and any user-specific write space such that the user may be presented a private copy of the shared image and write space.","To ensure high availability of ODDS and similar approaches, two more provisioning servers may be employed. The use of multiple provisioning servers allows operational redundancy, such that in the event of a failure or fault of one provisioning server, another provisioning server is available to provide I\/O access to information handling systems in an ODDS configuration. However, in order to support access to individual write spaces and a shared image using multiple provisioning servers, the shared image and write spaces are often managed by the provisioning servers as files in a clustered file system. Clustered file systems are often expensive to implement, and may render high-availability ODDS implementations economically infeasible in many situations.","In accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure, the disadvantages and problems associated with providing access to a shared system image and associated write spaces may be reduced or eliminated.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for providing access to a remote shared image is provided. The method may include receiving from a first provisioning server a request to create a write space for a client communicatively coupled to the first provisioning server. The message may further include creating a partition on a first logical unit disposed in a storage array, the first logical unit communicatively coupled to the first provisioning server and associated with the client. The method may additionally include storing a thin clone of a shared image on the partition, the shared image common to the client and at least one other client and stored on a second logical unit, the thin clone comprising a write space for data specific to the client.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, a system for providing access to a remote shared image may include a client, a storage array, and a plurality of provisioning servers communicatively coupled to the client and the storage array. The storage array may have a first logical unit having stored thereon a shared image common to the client and at least one other client a second logical unit. A first provisioning server of the plurality of provisioning servers may be configured to manage input\/output operations communicated between the client and the partition and input\/output operations communicated between the client and the shared image. The storage array may be configured to: (i) receive from the first provisioning server a request to create a write space for the client; (ii) create a partition on a first logical unit; and (iii) store a thin clone of the shared image on the partition the thin clone comprising a write space for data specific to the client.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, software may be embodied on a computer-readable media, the software configured to, when executed by a processor: (i) receive from a provisioning server a request to create a write space for a client communicatively coupled to the first provisioning server; (ii) create a partition on a first logical unit disposed in a storage array, the first logical unit communicatively coupled to the provisioning server and associated with the client; and (iii) store a thin clone of a shared image on the partition, the shared image common to the client and at least one other client and stored on a second logical unit, the thin clone comprising a write space for data specific to the client.","Other technical advantages will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the following specification, claims, and drawings.","Preferred embodiments and their advantages are best understood by reference to , wherein like numbers are used to indicate like and corresponding parts.","For the purposes of this disclosure, an information handling system may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, entertainment, or other purposes.

Computer-readable media may include, without limitation, storage media such as a direct access storage device (e.g., a hard disk drive or floppy disk), a sequential access storage device (e.g., a tape disk drive), compact disk, CD-ROM, DVD, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and\/or flash memory; as well as communications media such wires, optical fibers, microwaves, radio waves, and other electromagnetic and\/or optical carriers; and\/or any combination of the foregoing.","An information handling system may include or may be coupled via a network to one or more arrays of storage resources. The array of storage resources may include a plurality of storage resources, and may be operable to perform one or more input and\/or output storage operations, and\/or may be structured to provide redundancy. In operation, one or more storage resources disposed in an array of storage resources may appear to an operating system as a single logical storage unit or \u201clogical unit.\u201d","In certain embodiments, an array of storage resources may be implemented as a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (also referred to as a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks or a RAID). RAID implementations may employ a number of techniques to provide for redundancy, including striping, mirroring, and\/or parity checking.

Each client may be configured to access storage array  via the one or more provisioning servers . In certain embodiments, one or more of clients  may be a server. In another embodiment, one or more of clients  may be a personal computer (e.g., a desktop computer or a portable computer). As depicted in , each client  may include a processor , a memory  communicatively coupled to processor , and a network interface  communicatively coupled to processor . Although system  is depicted as having four clients , system  may include any suitable number of clients .","Each processor  may include any system, device, or apparatus configured to interpret and\/or execute program instructions and\/or process data, and may include, without limitation, a microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor (DSP), application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or any other digital or analog circuitry configured to interpret and\/or execute program instructions and\/or process data. In some embodiments, processor  may interpret and\/or execute program instructions and\/or process data stored in memory , storage array  and\/or another component of system .","Each memory  may be communicatively coupled to its associated processor  and may include any system, device, or apparatus configured to retain program instructions and\/or data for a period of time (e.g., computer-readable media). Each memory  may include random access memory (RAM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), a PCMCIA card, flash memory, magnetic storage, opto-magnetic storage, or any suitable selection and\/or array of volatile or non-volatile memory that retains data after power to its associated client  is turned off.","Each network interface  may include any suitable system, apparatus, or device operable to serve as an interface between its associated client  and network . Each network interface  may enable its associated client  to communicate over network  using any suitable transmission protocol and\/or standard, including without limitation all transmission protocols and\/or standards enumerated below with respect to the discussion of network .","Network  may be a network and\/or fabric configured to couple clients , provisioning servers , and storage array  to one another. As an example, in certain embodiments, network  in connection with one or more of provisioning servers  may allow one or more of clients  to connect to logical units  such that portions of logical units  assigned to a particular client  appear to such particular client  as locally attached storage resources. In the same or alternative embodiments, network  may include a communication infrastructure, which provides physical connections, and a management layer, which organizes the physical connections, clients , provisioning servers , and storage array . In the same or alternative embodiments, network  may allow block I\/O services and\/or file access services to logical units  of storage array . Network  may be implemented as, or may be a part of, a storage area network (SAN), personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a virtual private network (VPN), an intranet, the Internet, or any other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates the communication of signals, data, and\/or messages (generally referred to as data).

Network  and its various components may be implemented using hardware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof.","Each provisioning server  may comprise an information handling system and may generally be operable to communicate via network  with one or more of clients  and storage array . In operation, each provisioning server may manage the access of one or more clients  to storage array , as described in greater detail elsewhere in this disclosure. As depicted in , each provisioning server  may include a processor , a memory  communicatively coupled to processor , a network interface  communicatively coupled to processor , and a shared database . Each processor , memory , and network interface  may be similar or identical in structure and\/or functionality to processor , memory , and network interface , respectively. Although system  is depicted as having two provisioning servers , system  may include any suitable number of provisioning servers .","Shared database  may include a table and\/or other suitable data structure that represents one or more mappings or relationships among clients , provisioning servers , and write spaces  of logical unit . Shared database  may be stored on any suitable computer-readable medium associated with each provisioning server , including without limitation a storage resource (e.g., disk drive) associated with provisioning server  and\/or memory  of provisioning server . As described in greater detail elsewhere in this disclosure, each provisioning server may use data stored in shared database  to manage access of clients  to logical units  of storage array . In certain embodiments, the content of shared database  on one provisioning server  may be similar or identical to the content of shared database  on one or more other provisioning servers .","Storage array  may include any suitable number and\/or combination of storage resources configured to store data. Such storage resources may include hard disk drives, magnetic tape libraries, optical disk drives, magneto-optical disk drives, solid state storage drives, compact disk drives, compact disk arrays, disk array controllers, and\/or any other systems, apparatuses or devices configured to store data. In certain embodiments, storage array  may include one or more storage enclosures configured to hold and\/or power one or more of such storage resources. As depicted in , the storage resources of storage array  may be configured to appear to an information handling system as one or more logical units . For example, each logical unit  may include one or more storage resources logically combined to appear as single logical storage unit to one or more of clients  and provisioning servers .","As shown in , logical unit may include a shared image  stored thereon. Shared image  may include data and\/or programs that are shared by more than one client  (e.g., such data and\/or programs are used by more then one client ). For example, shared image  may include an operating system configured to run on more than one client . In addition or alternatively, shared image  may serve as a boot image to more than one client . Furthermore, in addition or in the alternative to having a common operating system and\/or boot image for more than one client , shared image  may include application programs, drivers, other programs, and\/or data shared by more than one client .","Also as shown in , logical unit may include one or more partitions, wherein each such partition includes a write space . Each such write space  may include a dedicated logical unit that may include data and\/or programs for use by a particular client  and\/or user. For example, write space may include data and\/or programs for use by client , write space may include data and\/or programs for use by client , write space may include data and\/or programs for use by client , and write space may include data and\/or programs for use by client . In certain embodiments, one or more of write spaces  may include the differences or \u201cdeltas\u201d from the shared image  that are associated with a particular client . In the same or alternative embodiments, one or more of write spaces may be \u201cthin clones\u201d of shared image . Thin cloning allows creation of an image template with minimal storage resource usage. Shared image  may be \u201ccloned\u201d for an individual client  by creating an individual write space  which may only require disk space to store differences or \u201cdeltas\u201d from shared image  on the particular write space .","In certain embodiments, partitions for write spaces  may be created and\/or managed using thin provisioning (also known as \u201csparse volumes\u201d). Generally speaking, thin provisioning is a mechanism that applies to large-scale centralized computer disk storage systems, SANs, and storage virtualization systems. Thin provisioning allows write spaces  to be easily allocated to clients , on a \u201cjust-enough\u201d and\/or \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. Thin provisioning allows maintenance of a single free space buffer pool (e.g., logical unit ) to service the data requirements of clients .","Although  depicts logical unit having four write spaces , logical unit (and system  in general) may have any suitable number of write spaces .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","100","200","202","208","200"]},"The discussion of method  below will apply, solely for the purposes of clarity and exposition, to the operation of method  to client and provisioning server . However, method  may be applied to any suitable component of system .","At step , client may boot. Client may be booted in any suitable manner (e.g., powering on of client , logging on by a user of client , remote command to boot client ).","At step , client may discover the existence of provisioning server and associate with such provisioning server . The association between client and provisioning server may be established in any suitable manner. For example, either of client or provisioning server may include metadata representing that client and provisioning server are to be associated, if such association is possible (e.g., provisioning server is operating correctly). As another example, provisioning server (e.g., instead of provisioning server or another provisioning server) may be associated with client on a random basis (e.g., provisioning server randomly assigned to client at boot of client ). As a further example provisioning server (e.g., instead of provisioning server or another provisioning server) may be associated with client based one or more operational parameters associated with client , provisioning servers , and\/or other components of system  (e.g., the number of clients already assigned to each provisioning server , the proximity of client to each provisioning server , the communication speed between client and each provisioning server , etc.).","At step , provisioning server may issue a request to storage array  to create a partition on storage array  for a write space associated with client ","At step , storage array  may allocate storage capacity and create a partition on logical unit for write space such that client may use write space as a dedicated write space. As mentioned above, in certain embodiments, write space may be created as a thin clone of shared image . Also as mentioned above, such partition may be created and maintained using thin provisioning.","In certain embodiments, the request issued at step  and the partition creation of step  may be carried out in accordance with an application programming interface (API) command exposed by storage array  to provisioning server . For example, an API may include a command Create (source, destination) that may be communicated from a provisioning server  to storage array . The command may cause storage array  to create a thin clone of the image associated with the variable source and assign the thin clone to a partition on a logical unit associated with the variable destination. On successful completion of the API command, storage array  may return a partition identifier associated with the partition of logical unit to which the write space  has been assigned.","At step , provisioning server may store the association or \u201cmapping\u201d of client to provisioning server and write space .

In addition, steps - may be repeated, independently and\/or collectively, as often as desired or required by a chosen implementation.","Method  may be implemented using system  or any other system operable to implement method . In certain embodiments, method  may be implemented partially or fully in software and\/or firmware embodied in computer-readable media.","Once a client  is associated with a provisioning server  and\/or write space , input\/output (I\/O) communications (e.g., read or write) initiated by such client may first be communicated to the provisioning server  associated with such client . The provisioning server  may then process the I\/O communication based at least on the associations set forth in shared database . For example, in the event of a write-based I\/O command, client may communicate the write-based I\/O command to its associated provisioning server . Provisioning server may then, based on the association to write space set forth in shared database , communicate the write-based I\/O command to storage array  for storage on write space . As another example, in the event of a read-based I\/O command, client  may communicate the read-based I\/O command to its associated provisioning server . Provisioning server may then, based on the association to write space set forth in shared database , communicate the read-based I\/O command to storage array  to see if data stored on write space is responsive to the read-based I\/O command. If responsive data (e.g., previously-stored data specific to client ) is stored on write space , storage array  may retrieve such data and communicate it to client . On the other hand, if no responsive data to the read-based I\/O command is stored on write space , storage array  may retrieve the appropriate data from shared image  and communicate such shared image data to client ","In some embodiments, the combination of shared image  and a write space  associated with a client  may be presented to a client  (e.g., by storage array ) such that the shared image  and associated write space  appear to be the same logical unit to the client  (e.g., the logical unit presented to the client  \u201clooks\u201d like shared image , except to the extent modified by data present in an associated write space ).","Although the above discussion of method  contemplates that a provisioning server  may create associations among itself, a client , and a write space  following a boot of a client , it is noted that not every boot of a client  necessarily invokes method . For example, in certain embodiments, after a client  boots, it may retain associations with a provisioning server  and\/or write space  established during a previous boot, as such associations may be set forth in shared database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","128","102","400","402","100","400","402","408","400"]},"The discussion of method  below will apply, solely for the purposes of clarity and exposition, to the operation of method  to client , provisioning server and write space . However, method  may be applied to any suitable component of system .","At step , client may be removed from system . Removal from system  may include any event for which client may no longer access storage array . For example, removal may include physical removal of client from system . Removal may also include modification of user privileges for client such that client is no longer permitted to access storage array .","At step , provisioning server may discover the removal of client and communicate a request to storage array  to delete write space for client . Provisioning server 's discovery of the removal of client may take place in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, provisioning server may simply detect that client has been removed or is no longer present. In other embodiments, provisioning server may receive a message from client or another client  indicating that client has been removed.","At step , storage array  may delete write space and\/or the partition associated with write space . In certain embodiments, the request issued at step  and the write space\/partition deletion of step  may be carried out in accordance with an application programming interface (API) command exposed by storage array  to provisioning server . For example, an API may include a command Delete (destination, partition identifier) that may be communicated from a provisioning server  to storage array . The command may cause storage array  to delete data in write space and\/or delete the partition associated with write space , thus freeing up capacity of logical unit to be allocated to other subsequently-created write spaces.","At step , provisioning server may update the associations or mappings of clients  to indicate the removal of host and deletion of write space . In certain embodiments, such associations may be updated in shared database .","Although  discloses a particular number of steps to be taken with respect to method , method  may be executed with greater or lesser steps than those depicted in .

If the policy indicates that reclamation should take place, method  may proceed to step . Otherwise, if the policy dictates that reclamation should not take place, method  may end.","At step , in a response to a determination that a policy indicates that write space should be reclaimed, provisioning server may communicate a request to storage array  to reclaim write space associated with client ","At step , storage array  may delete data stored in write space while maintaining the existing partition associated with write space . Such reclamation of write space may be desirable upon reboot in certain situations. For example, perceived security vulnerabilities associated with \u201cdata at rest\u201d may lead to a desire to reclaim write spaces  at reboot (or shutdown) of their associated clients. As another example, reclamation may also be beneficial as it frees physical storage resource blocks associated with a thin-provisioned write space . Nonetheless, it may also be desirable in such situations to leave the partition for the write space intact, so as to reduce time associated with creation of a new write space upon reboot.","In certain embodiments, the request issued at step  and the write space reclamation of step  may be carried out in accordance with an application programming interface (API) command exposed by storage array  to provisioning server . For example, an API may include a command ReclaimCapacity (destination, partition identifier) that may be communicated from a provisioning server  to storage array .
