title: Apparatus and method for determining variation in a predetermined physical property of a circuit
abstract: Apparatus and method for determining variation in a predetermined physical property of a circuit. The apparatus includes monitored circuitry for generating output pulses, and configured such that each output pulse has a pulse width which is indicative of the current value of the predetermined physical property. Circuitry is then configured to receive both the output pulses generated by the monitored circuitry and an oscillating timing reference signal. With reference to the oscillating timing reference signal, the counter circuitry produces for each output pulse an associated count value indicative of the pulse width of that output pulse. Circuitry then compares the associated count values for at least two output pulses, in order to produce a comparison result used to determine the variation in the predetermined physical property. This provides a flexible mechanism for monitoring variations in a physical property on the fly during use of a data processing circuit.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for determining variation in a predetermined physical property of a circuit.","2. Description of the Prior Art","In modern data processing systems, the individual components of data processing circuits are becoming smaller and smaller. As process geometries shrink, the variations in certain physical properties of the individual circuit components is becoming more significant, and techniques are required to enable those variations to be determined.","One physical property that may vary significantly between circuit components is referred to as an ageing effect, a variation in the ageing effect amongst components resulting from a variation in performance degradation of individual transistors over time. Examples of articles that describe monitoring techniques for the ageing effect are \u201cAn Array-Based Odometer System for Statistically Significant Circuit Aging Characterization\u201d by John Keane et al, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Volume 46, No. 10, October 2011, and the article \u201cA Precise-Tracking NBTI-Degradation Monitor Independent of NBTI Recovery Effect\u201d by E Saneyoshi et al, 2010 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, Session 9, Digital Circuits and Sensors. However, both of these techniques are invasive, requiring an external tester to be used.","Another type of physical property that may vary between components within a circuit is a history effect that can occur in transistors that have a body region insulated from the substrate, the body region comprising the channel material in which a channel is established between a source and drain of the transistor below the gate of the transistor. One known technology that can be used to produce transistors having a body region insulated from the substrate is referred to as Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) technology, where the SOI channel material is formed within a region of a thin superficial silicon layer above an oxide insulating layer and located under the gate of the transistor, reducing resistive leakage to the substrate and capacitive loading by the substrate. However, it has been found that the voltage on the body region becomes dependent on the previous circuit activity, this typically being referred to as the history effect. This variation in voltage on the body region can have an impact on the behaviour of components constructed using such transistors. The article \u201cA New Structure for In-Depth History Effect Characterization on Partially Depleted SOI Transistors\u201d by O Faynot et al, 2002 IEEE International SOI Conference, 10\/02, pages 35 to 36, describes a technique for measuring the history effect, but similarly to the earlier described articles is invasive, and requires use of an external test probe.","Whilst techniques that use external testing equipment can be useful during the design and manufacture of components, for example to allow suitable margins to be set, it is still desirable to provide mechanisms that allow variations in certain physical properties to be monitored \u201con the fly\u201d whilst circuits are in use, since if accurate information about such variations can be obtained in real time during use of the circuit, it may be possible to take certain actions in order to reduce or at least constrain such variations. The article \u201cRun-Time Adaptive Performance Compensation using On-Chip Sensors\u201d by M Hashimoto, Department of Information Systems Engineering, Osaka University and JST, CREST, ASPDAC '11 Proceedings of the 16Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, pages 285-290, describes a run-time performance adaptation technique using on-chip sensors for capturing delay variations, with circuit performance then being compensated according to the sensor outputs. The described technique does not provide any quantitive information as to the variations being observed.","A number of articles have been published that discuss techniques for monitoring the ageing effect of transistors on the fly during operation of integrated circuits. Examples of such articles include the article \u201cA Compact Monitoring Circuit for Real-Time On-Chip Diagnosis of Hot-Carrier Induced Degradation\u201d by H Oner et al, Proceedings of the IEEE 1997 International Conference on Microelectronic Test Structures, Volume 10, March 1997, the article \u201cA TDC-Based Test Platform for Dynamic Circuit Ageing Characterisation\u201d by M Chen et al, 2011 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS), 10-14 Apr. 2011, 2B.2.1-2B.2.5, the article \u201cOn-Chip Circuit For Monitoring Frequency Degradation due to NBTI\u201d by K Stawiasz et al, IEEE CFP08RPS-CDR 46Annual International Reliability Physics Symposium, Phoenix, 2008, Pages 532 to 535, and the article \u201cAn All-In-One Silicon Odometer for Separately Monitoring HCI, BTI and TDBD\u201d by J Keane et al, IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Volume 45, No. 4, April 2010, Pages 817 to 829. Each of these techniques uses a ring oscillator as the circuitry to be monitored, and as such lacks flexibility in that the circuitry being monitored is somewhat artificial and cannot directly represent an actual circuit portion of a real data processing apparatus, for example a critical path within a processor. In addition, such techniques using ring oscillators as the monitored circuit cannot measure certain physical properties such as the earlier-mentioned history effect, since the history effect occurs primarily due to static data and hence the continual dynamic changes that occur within an oscillator will mask the history effect.","In the article \u201cA Test Concept For Circuit Level Aging Demonstrated By A Differential Amplifier\u201d by F. Chouard et al, 2010 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium, (IRPS), 2-6 May 2010, pages 826-829, the authors propose applying an accelerated aging technique to an analogue circuit, thereby allowing measurements to be taken from a tester after forced aging of the circuit to model the aging effects. This approach hence seeks to take aging into account by modeling\/simulating aging rather than by measuring actual aging in a live circuit.","Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a more flexible approach for determining variation in a predetermined physical property of a circuit, that can be used on the fly as and when required during the lifetime of the circuit.","Viewed from a first aspect, the present invention provides apparatus for determining variation in a predetermined physical property of a circuit, comprising: monitored circuitry for generating output pulses, the monitored circuitry being configured such that each output pulse has a pulse width which is indicative of a current value of said predetermined physical property; oscillator circuitry configured to generate an oscillating timing reference signal; counter circuitry configured to produce for each output pulse, with reference to the oscillating timing reference signal, an associated count value indicative of the pulse width of that output pulse; and comparison circuitry configured to compare the associated count values for at least two output pulses, in order to produce a comparison result used to determine the variation in said predetermined physical property.","In accordance with the present invention, the physical property of interest is not measured directly, but instead the monitored circuitry is arranged to produce output pulses such that the pulse width is indicative of a current value of the predetermined physical property. There are a number of ways in which the monitored circuitry can be arranged to produce an output pulse whose pulse width varies in such a mariner. For example, the pulse can be generated having a width which is dictated by a signal propagation path delay within the monitored circuit, where that propagation delay will vary dependent on the physical property of interest. As another example, the circuit may be arranged to generate an output pulse whose width is dictated by a time taken to perform a charging operation of a capacitive element, where again the time taken will vary dependent on the current value of the physical property of interest.","In accordance with the invention, counter circuitry is provided which receives each output pulse, and also receives an oscillating timing reference signal produced by oscillator circuitry. Based on these inputs, the counter circuitry can then produce an associated count value for each output pulse, that count value being indicative of the pulse width. In particular, the count value identifies the number of oscillations of the timing reference signal during the duration of the output pulse. The count values hence form digital information providing a quantitive indication of a current value of the physical property, with comparison circuitry then being used to compare two or more such count values in order to produce a comparison result that can be used to determine the variation in the predetermined physical property.","The technique of the present invention is very flexible, since the monitored circuitry can take a variety of forms. In particular, in some embodiments it may be a dummy circuit not performing any active data processing, whilst in another embodiment it may be formed by an active circuit within the apparatus, for example a critical path within a processor or other data processing circuit. Further, many different physical properties can be observed using the technique of the present invention. All that is required is to ensure that the monitored circuitry produces an output pulse whose pulse width will vary to reflect any variations in the predetermined physical property of interest.","In one embodiment, the monitored circuitry comprises a plurality of monitored circuits, and said at least two output pulses compared by the comparison circuitry comprise an output pulse generated by each monitored circuit, with the pulse width of each output pulse being indicative of a current value of said predetermined physical property within the monitored circuit producing that output pulse. Hence, in such embodiments, it is possible to compare multiple count values determined from output pulses produced by multiple monitored circuits at a particular point in time, thereby enabling a determination as to the degree of variation in a physical property amongst the various monitored circuits.","In one embodiment, the counter circuitry comprises a separate counter circuit for each monitored circuit.","The comparison result produced by the comparison circuitry can be used in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, the apparatus further comprises evaluation circuitry configured to generate a notification signal if the comparison result indicates that the variation of the current value of said predetermined physical property within the plurality of monitored circuits is greater than a predetermined threshold. The notification signal can then be used in a variety of ways, for example to provide a warning notification to a user, or to cause certain changes in the operation of the apparatus with the aim of reducing the variation.","In an alternative embodiment, or in addition, a test operation may be initiated periodically, each occurrence of the test operation causing the plurality of monitored circuits to produce corresponding output pulses from which count values are then produced by the counter circuitry. For each test operation, the comparison circuitry is arranged to compare the count values produced by the counter circuitry in order to produce said comparison result, and the apparatus further comprises evaluation circuitry configured to monitor variation in the comparison result over a series of said test operations in order to determine the variation in said predetermined physical property. Hence, in such embodiments, a history of the comparison results produced for a series of test operations can be maintained, and that history then reviewed by the evaluation circuitry in order to determine the variation in the predetermined physical property over time.","The plurality of monitored circuits can take a variety of forms. In one embodiment, the plurality of monitored circuits comprise a tested monitored circuit and a reference monitored circuit. The reference monitored circuit is configured so as to exhibit a benchmark value for said predetermined physical property, and the comparison circuitry is configured to compare the count value for an output pulse from the tested monitored circuit with the count value for a corresponding output pulse from the reference monitored circuit in order to produce said comparison result.","There are a variety of physical properties that can be monitored using such an arrangement. However, in one embodiment, the predetermined physical property is an ageing effect on components within the tested monitored circuit that causes performance of those components to vary through use.","In one such embodiment, the reference monitored circuit is formed as a replica of said tested monitored circuit. Further, the reference monitored circuit is active only for test operations where an output pulse is generated by the reference monitored circuit for comparison with a corresponding output pulse from the tested monitored circuit, whilst the tested monitored circuit is active for other operations in addition to the test operations, such that components in the tested monitored circuit are subjected to the ageing effect more rapidly than the components in the reference monitored circuit. In one particular embodiment, the reference monitored circuit is powered off other than when a test operation is being performed, and hence the components within the reference monitored circuit age very slowly compared with the equivalent components within the tested monitored circuit. Accordingly, the comparison result output by the comparison circuitry provides an accurate indication of the degree of ageing of the components within the tested monitored circuit.","The tested monitored circuit can take a variety of forms, but in one embodiment is used to perform actual data processing operations in a normal mode of operation of the apparatus. Hence, in one embodiment, the tested monitored circuit may form a critical path of a processing circuit of the apparatus. The performance of the components within such a critical path is very important, and the ageing effect will typically increase propagation delays over time. Accordingly, the technique of the above described embodiments provides a very useful mechanism for continuing to monitor periodically the ageing effect within the tested monitored circuit, so that a notification can be issued if the ageing effect exceeds some predetermined level, and prior to any actual timing failure within the critical path.","In an alternative embodiment, the plurality of monitored circuits are distributed at different locations within an integrated circuit, and the comparison circuitry is configured to compare the associated count values for corresponding output pulses produced by each monitored circuit in order to produce the comparison result, the comparison result being indicative of the variation in the predetermined physical property across the integrated circuit. Such an approach provides a simple and effective mechanism for monitoring across-chip variations of a physical property of interest.","The physical property of interest in such embodiments can take a variety of forms. For example, it may be one of a threshold voltage of components, an operating temperature of components, or a history effect of components.","The plurality of monitored circuits distributed within the integrated circuit can take a variety of forms, but in one embodiment are arranged to be identical to each other so as to allow ready comparison of the count values determined for the output pulses produced by the various monitored circuits. In one embodiment, the identical monitored circuits may be active circuits within the integrated circuit, for example a particular critical path within each core of a multi-core implementation. Alternatively, each of the monitored circuits may be dummy circuits constructed identically, such that any variation in their pulse width outputs reflects the variation in the physical property of interest between those various dummy circuits.","Whilst the monitored circuitry may comprise multiple monitored circuits as discussed above, in an alternative embodiment the monitored circuitry may comprise a single monitored circuit configured to produce the at least two output pulses at different times, such that the pulse width of each output pulse is indicative of the value of said predetermined physical property within that single monitored circuit at the time the output pulse is generated.","Such an arrangement may be useful in a variety of scenarios, but in one embodiment the single monitored circuit comprises components formed from transistors having a body region insulated from a substrate, and the predetermined physical property is a history effect that causes voltage on said body region to vary over time dependent on previous activity of the monitored circuit, thereby causing performance of the components to vary over time based on said previous activity.","In one particular embodiment, the single monitored circuit comprises an inverter chain arranged to produce a rising edge output pulse and a falling edge output pulse, the rising edge output pulse having a pulse width indicative of rising edge propagation delays within the inverter chain and the falling edge output pulse having a pulse width indicative of falling edge propagation delays within the inverter chain. The counter circuitry is configured to generate a rising edge count value for said rising edge output pulse, and a falling edge count value for said falling edge output pulse. The comparison circuitry is arranged to compare the rising edge count values for rising edge output pulses produced at different times, and the falling edge count values for falling edge output pulses produced at different times in order to produce the comparison result. By obtaining information about the rising edge propagation delay and falling edge propagation delay it is possible to accurately evaluate variations in the history effect.","The inverter chain can take a variety of forms, but in one embodiment comprises an even number of inverters, with each inverter formed from SOI transistors, and with every alternate inverter having its SOI transistors arranged in a body contacted arrangement.","In one embodiment, the single monitored circuit is driven at a first time by an input signal providing a temporary transition from a DC logic 0 value in order to produce a first rising edge output pulse and a first falling edge output pulse, and is driven at a second time by an input signal providing a temporary transition from a DC logic 1 value in order to produce a second rising edge output pulse and a second falling edge output pulse, the comparison circuitry being arranged to compare the rising edge count values for the first and second rising edge output pulses, and to compare the falling edge count values for the first and second falling edge output pulses in order to produce said comparison result. The history effect results from the presence of static values on the SOI transistors, and hence by simulating both a temporary transition from a DC logic 0 state and temporary transition from a DC logic 1 state, it is possible to build up an accurate picture of the history effect within the monitored circuit.","Viewed from a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of determining variation in a predetermined physical property of a circuit, comprising: employing monitored circuitry to generate output pulses such that each output pulse has a pulse width which is indicative of a current value of said predetermined physical property; generating an oscillating timing reference signal; with reference to the oscillating timing reference signal, producing for each output pulse an associated count value indicative of the pulse width of that output pulse; and comparing the associated count values for at least two output pulses, in order to produce a comparison result used to determine the variation in said predetermined physical property.","Viewed from a third aspect, the present invention provides apparatus for determining variation in a predetermined physical property of a circuit, comprising: monitored circuitry means for generating output pulses such that each output pulse has a pulse width which is indicative of a current value of said predetermined physical property; oscillator means for generating an oscillating timing reference signal; counter means for producing for each output pulse, with reference to the oscillating timing reference signal, an associated count value indicative of the pulse width of that output pulse; and comparison means for comparing the associated count values for at least two output pulses, in order to produce a comparison result used to determine the variation in said predetermined physical property.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","20","32","30","12"]},"The count value produced by the counter is then forwarded to comparison circuitry  for comparison with at least one other count value produced in respect of another output pulse.","In the example of , the other output pulse  is produced by the monitored circuit , again in response to a test enable input to the monitored circuit being set. The pulse  is provided to the counter , which also receives the same oscillating timing reference signal  as provided to the counter , and accordingly produces a corresponding count value for the pulse .","Whilst in  the monitored circuits  and  are shown as separate circuits, each with their own counter circuit , , the monitored circuit  can in alternative embodiments actually be one and the same circuit as the monitored circuit , with the pulses ,  representing pulses produced at different times by the single monitored circuit. In such an embodiment, it will be appreciated that the counter circuitry ,  can also be formed by a single counter circuit with the count values output by the counter being buffered for subsequent comparison by the comparison circuitry .","In embodiments where multiple monitored circuits are actually provided, it will be appreciated that any number of monitored circuits may be provided as desired, and accordingly more than two count values may be produced for comparison by the comparison circuitry .","The comparison result produced by comparison circuitry  is passed to evaluation circuitry , and the evaluation circuitry can take a variety of forms. In one embodiment, the evaluation circuitry  may analyse each comparison result produced by the comparison circuitry independently, and generate a notification signal if the comparison result indicates that the variation in the predetermined physical property as evidenced by the various count values compared by the comparison circuitry is greater than a predetermined threshold. This notification signal can be used in a variety of ways, for example to provide a warning notification to a user, or to cause certain changes in the operation of the apparatus with the aim of reducing the variation. As one particular example, if the predetermined physical property being monitored is temperature, and the variation in temperature as observed by the comparison circuitry with reference to the count values exceeds a predetermined threshold, the operating speed of the apparatus may be reduced in order to seek to reduce the temperature variation, and\/or cooling elements associated with one or more of the monitored circuits may be activated.","In an alternative embodiment, the evaluation circuitry  may have an associated storage  in which it maintains a history of the comparison results produced by the comparison circuitry  for a series of tests, thus enabling the manner in which the comparison results are varying over time to be evaluated, with this information then being used to identify the variation in the predetermined physical property of interest.","There are a number of ways in which the monitored circuits ,  can be arranged such that they produce an output pulse whose pulse width varies to reflect changes in the predetermined physical property arising within the components of the monitored circuit. In one embodiment, as illustrated in , a signal propagation delay can be arranged to vary dependent on the predetermined physical property, and accordingly a propagation delay across a particular path can be monitored, with a pulse being generated whose width represents that propagation delay. In particular, as shown in , a propagation delay path  can be formed from a plurality of components, and an input test signal may be routed via that delay path  to one input of the pulse generation circuitry . The second input of the pulse generation circuitry may receive the input test signal directly (i.e. not delayed by the propagation path ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["105","115","105","120","110","125","115","120","110"]},"However, propagation delay is not the only mechanism that can be used for producing a pulse whose width varies dependent on variations in the predetermined physical property. In particular,  illustrate another example where the read current through a transistor  varies dependent on the predetermined physical property, and this variation can be transformed into a pulse by monitoring time taken for the read current to charge a particular capacitive element . In the example illustrated in , the transistor  is connected between the power supply Vdd and a node B, with its gate connected to an input test signal. A capacitor  and a resistor  are then placed in parallel between node B and a ground connection. An inverter  connected to node B is then used to provide one input signal C to the pulse generator . The other input to the pulse generator  is provided by the input test signal A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["180","155","155","175","185","170","190","175","195","180","190","175"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["210","220","210","215","220","225","215","225","230"]},"In this embodiment, the predetermined physical property of interest is an ageing effect, and in particular an indication as to how the components of the tested circuit are wearing out is required. In this embodiment, the tested circuit can take a variety of forms, but in one embodiment represents active circuitry of a data processing apparatus where the wear out of the components is of a significant concern, one such example being circuitry within a critical path of a processor core.","A wear test select circuit  is provided for initiating a test operation when an input test control signal is set. When the test control signal is set, the wear test select circuit  sends a power enable signal to the power controller  in order to turn on the reference circuit . In particular, in such a test it is desired that the reference circuit exhibits a benchmark value for the predetermined physical property, and hence when considering the ageing effect it is important that the reference circuit ages to the smallest extent possible. Accordingly, in one particular embodiment, the reference circuit  is arranged to be a replica of the tested circuit , but unlike the tested circuit, the reference circuit is only powered up as and when required to perform the test operation. At all other times, the reference circuit is powered down so as to keep the reference path in as ideal a state as possible, i.e. to reflect as closely as possible a version of the tested circuit that is not subjected to ageing.","When the test control signal is set, test data is also input to the wear test select circuit , from where it is input in parallel to both the tested circuit  and the reference circuit . The corresponding counters ,  hence produce count values indicative of the width of the pulses produced by the tested circuit  and the reference circuit , and those two count values are then compared by the comparison and evaluation circuitry .","In the embodiment illustrated in , a notification signal is output from the comparison and evaluation circuitry if it is determined that the wear on the tested circuit has exceeded a predetermined level. One way in which the comparison and evaluation circuitry  can be configured in order to produce such a notification signal is illustrated in .","As shown in , it is assumed that the count value A is an n-bit value output from the reference circuit counter  whilst the count value B is also an n-bit value output by the test circuit counter value . The comparison circuitry is formed by the sequence of full adders, , , , , which are arranged to determine a difference between the two count values. In particular, the computation B\u2212A is performed, by performing within the full adders the addition of an inverted version of the count value A with the count value B plus an injected logic 1 value in the least significant bit position. Hence, as shown, each full adder , , ,  includes a corresponding bit of both count values, with the relevant bit of the count value A being inverted prior to input to the full adder. The full adder  computes the least significant bit of the difference, and hence receives the carry in of a logic 1 value. Any carry out from the full adder  is provided as a carry in value to the next full adder , and indeed this arrangement ripples through the entire set of adders, so that any carry out from one full adder is provided as a carry in to the next full adder (i.e. the full adder dealing with the adjacent more significant bits of the count value). The carry out value from the final adder  is ignored. The sum bits produced by the various full adders are stored within a sum register , whereafter a certain number of most significant bits are evaluated by the MSB evaluation circuitry . The number of most significant bits considered will be dependent on implementation, and in particular how much wear in the tested circuit is to be tolerated. If a logic 1 value is found to be present in any of the most significant bits reviewed by the evaluation circuitry , the notification signal is set.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["300","305","310","315","320","325","330","330"]},"In the embodiment shown in , it will typically be desirable for the various monitored circuits to be identical replicas of each other.
