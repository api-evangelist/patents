title: Network-based sweepstakes system and method
abstract: A system and method for automatically enrolling users of a website or other network-based service in sweepstakes. A user of 4 user computer system connects to a host computer system hosting a website or other network-based service and is awarded points for accessing features of the website or service. The points are displayed in real-time on the user's computer and transmitted to a database server, which maintains the user's point totals. The user is then automatically given a number of entries in a sweepstakes based on the number of points he or she has been awarded. Users may also be awarded points for accessing features of websites or services of third-party host computer systems.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This is a continuation of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/412,013, filed on Oct. 4, 1999, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,634,424, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to a system and method for generating traffic at Internet websites or other network-based services accessible for on-line communications and, in particular, for encouraging users to use a website or other network-based service by automatically enrolling users in sweepstakes.","With the proliferation of Internet websites, a major problem for website providers is attracting and retaining Internet users. This problem is of critical importance because advertising revenues, which is the major source of revenue for many websites, is often linked to the number of users visiting a site and the amount of time users spend on a site.","One technique used to attract users is to award points for, for example, purchasing goods through a website, which may be redeemed for merchandise or other prizes. Such a technique is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,774,870 to Storey. One drawback of this technique is that it is generally applicable only to websites where goods are sold and requires that the website provider have some manner of goods or services to be exchanged for points. Another drawback is that many Internet users are reluctant to make purchase; over the Internet and therefore an award program based on purchases will not attract these users. Still another drawback of this technique is that it requires Internet users to actively redeem accumulated points, which some users may find bothersome. Another drawback is that it requires the Internet provider to provide and support a points redemption program.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for attracting and retaining Internet users, and users of other network-based services, by rewarding users for accessing and using a website, or other feature of a network-based service, but without the drawbacks characteristic of the prior art, as mentioned above.","It is another object of the invention to provide a system and method for operating an on-line sweepstakes.","Briefly, the present invention provides a system and method in which users are awarded points, referred to herein as \u201cbones,\u201d for accessing a website, and, in particular, for clicking on hyperlinks within the website. The number of bones awarded for clicking on each hyperlink is stored in a table on the web servers in the host system hosting the website. A tally of the number of bones awarded to each user over various periods of time is stored in a database on a database server. Illustratively, these periods are daily, monthly and yearly. These tallies are used to automatically enter each user in daily, monthly and yearly sweepstakes, awarding substantial cash or other prizes. Users are given an entry in each sweepstakes for each corresponding bone and, thus, the more bones that a user accumulates the more likely he or she is to win any of the sweepstakes.","When a user signs in to the website, the bone information for that user is retrieved by the web server from the database and stored in cookies on the user's PC. A box is then displayed on the user's PC stating the user's current number of daily, monthly and yearly bones. The web server updates the display in real-time as the user accumulates more bones. In addition, the web server sends real-time user bone information to the database server so that the database server can maintain user bone information independently of the information stored in the cookies on the user's PC. In a preferred embodiment, the database server periodically transmits (for example, once a day) user bone information to a sweepstakes system that conducts the sweepstakes.","The present invention thus encourages users to access and use a website by awarding bones that give users chances to win sweepstakes. Users are automatically enrolled in the sweepstakes and thus are required to take no action other than using the website. The invention can be used on any type of website and does not require that the website sell a product. It also does not require that the website host provide products or services as prizes or provide and maintain a point redemption program.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","1","2","3","3","4","5","4","6"]},"Briefly, PC  contains and executes browser , which enables PC  to communicate with a web server , and contains various persistent and transient cookies  and . Cookies  and  are set by web server ; persistent cookies  are typically set when a user registers with host  and transient cookies are typically set when the user subsequently accesses host . Browser  and cookies  and  reside in memory in PC .","In a preferred embodiment, host  hosts a portal-type website, i.e., a website that provides hyperlinks to various services, various webpages in the website and various other websites and services. When PC  connects to a web server , it downloads a webpage, which is displayed by browser . The webpage contains hyperlinks that are typically highlighted in some manner by browser . When a user selects a hyperlink, by for example clicking on it with his or her mouse, PC  sends a URL (uniform resource locator) corresponding to the hyperlink to webserver .","In accordance with the present invention, a user is awarded points, referred to herein as \u201cbones,\u201d for clicking on hyperlinks. The hyperlinks may represent, in the user's view, a request for a webpage or a portion of a webpage or a request for a service or other feature of a website. For example, a user may be awarded bones for performing some task, such as making a webpage on host  the user's homepage or signing up for a service, such as email. In this case, the user may have to click on one or more hyperlinks to complete the task, with the last hyperlink, for example, indicating that the task has been completed. Alternatively, after the user has completed the task, host  can send a redirection response to PC , causing PC  to automatically request a url associated with the completion of the task. Advantageously, different numbers of bones may be awarded for clicking on different hyperlinks in accordance with a URL-Bone Table . Users are automatically enrolled in daily, monthly and yearly sweepstakes and their chances of winning depend on the number of bones they have collected over the corresponding time period. For security and sometimes legal reasons, the maximum number of bones a user can accumulate in a day is fixed. In one embodiment, the maximum number is 100. Transient cookies  on PC  store the daily, monthly and yearly bone totals. A javascript on PC  displays a \u201cbone box\u201d on PC , containing the user's first name and daily, monthly and yearly bone totals as stored in cookies .","Each webserver  executes ID cookie module  and BCBT (bone counting bone tracking) module . ID cookie module  generates a unique user ID when a user registers and writes the ID in a persistent cookie, called ssuid, on PC . The unique user ID can be generated, for example, using Vignette Corporation's StoryServer Software package, which guarantees that the ID is specific and unique for each user and produces IDs that are very difficult to generate without using the package (i.e., the IDs are difficult to \u201cspoof\u201d). ID cookie module  also generates a unique user number, associated with each unique user ID, and writes the user number in a persistent cookie, called user num. on PC . The user_num cookie is used as an index to conveniently access URL-Bone Table .","BCBT module  performs the following functions:","(a) determines whether the user interacting with the host system is a registered user and sets the Register_flag cookie on PC  to \u2018Y\u2019 (yes) or \u2018N\u2019 (no) accordingly, causing the javascript on PC  to display a message directing the user to register if he or she is not a registered user;","(b) awards a number of bones to a user for requesting a hyperlink, or url, based on the number specified in URL-Bone Table ;","(c) awards bones to bone counter cookies on the user's PC and asynchronously or synchronously writes the number of awarded bones to Database Server  (Database Server  in turn updates user-bones table , which stores daily, monthly and yearly boric information for one or more of the registered users).","(d) if the daily bone limit for a user has been reached, does not increment the bone counter cookies or send awarded bone information for the user to the database;","(e) writes the user's first name, and daily, monthly and yearly bone totals to temporary cookies, called Firstname, Bonecounter_daily, Bonecounter_monthly and","Bonecounter_yearly, respectively, which are then displayed in a \u201cbone box\u201d via a javascript that executes on PC ;","(f) writes a special value into the Bonecounter_daily cookie when the system is unavailable because the Database Server  is transmitting bone information to Sweepstakes System  (called \u201cbone time\u201d), which in turn causes the javascript on PC  to display a message indicating that bones cannot be awarded at the present time; and","(g) when an error occurs, writes an error code in an Errorcode cookie on PC , causing the javascript to display the appropriate error message.","The BCBT module may be implemented as an NSAPI (Netscape Application Programming Interface) plug-in to a Netscape Enterprise Webserver (NES).","Preferably at least once a day, database server  sends new user information and updated bone information to sweepstakes system  for all new users and all users who have received bones during the course of the day. If required to satisfy local and federal rules and regulations regarding sweepstakes, sweepstakes system  may also receive mail-in requests for bones via postcards  or other alternative means of sweepstakes entry. Sweepstakes system  performs daily, monthly and yearly sweepstakes, with each user getting one entry for each of his or her daily, monthly and yearly bones.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["31","1","3","2","2","7","32","2","1","33","3","1","7","1","1","2","1","34","35","36","3","13","3","37","1","4","5","3","1","38","34"]},"If the user has not been previously registered, then he registers at step . During registration, ID cookie module  on web server  creates an entry for the user in password table  and creates a unique ssuid and user number for the user. Also, BCBT module  creates an entry for the user in a specific database server  and user bones table . The registration process also collects other information about the user, such as the user's age and address, and determines if the user is eligible to participate in the sweepstakes by, for example, checking if the entered age is greater than or equal to 18 and the entered address is located in a United States state or territory. This information can be carefully verified in the event the user wins a sweepstake. Processing then proceeds to step , which again creates and sets the ssuid and DBIndicator cookies on PC .","Next, in step , web server  creates and sets the following transient cookies on PC : Bonecounter_daily, Bonecounter_monthly, Bonecounter_yearly, Firstname, Registered flag and Last_url. Bonecounter_daily, Bonecounter_monthly and Bonecounter_yearly cookies store the current number of daily, monthly and yearly bones, respectively. The Firstname cookie stores the user's first name. The bonecounter and Firstname cookies are retrieved by BCBT module  from the user_bones table  and database server  identified by the previously set DbIndicator cookie. The Registered_flag cookie is set to \u2018Y\u2019 (yes) or \u2018N\u2019 (no) depending on whether the user is registered. The Last_url cookie holds the last url the user went to and is used for fraud detection, as explained below. The Last_url cookie preferably expires after 30 minutes; the other transient cookies expire when, for example, the user logs off the Internet.","In step , a javascript running on PC  reads the bonecounter and Firstname cookies and displays the user's first name and daily, monthly and yearly bonecounts in a box located, for example, at the top of PC 's display screen.","In step , the user clicks on a hyperlink, causing browser  on PC  to send a url request to BCBT module  on web server . Url information may also be sent from a third party host, not part of host system , to BCBT module . In this way, a user may receive bones for accessing and using websites that are not hosted by host . In one implementation, the third party host includes an image tag containing a url associated with host  on each webpage for which bones are awarded; when browser  renders the third party webpage, it will request the url, which in turn will cause the url to be sent to BCBT module  on a web server  in host . If the user's ssuid and user_num cookies are set, BCBT module  then awards the user the appropriate number of bones and returns an image containing the current bonecounts in a bone box, which is then displayed on PC . Alternatively, the third party host can display current bonecounts in a bone box via a javascript. In another implementation, the third party host can execute its own version of BCBT module  that writes user bonecount information to a file, instead of to database server . The file can then be sent periodically from the third party host to database server , which in turn will update user_bones table .","In step , BCBT module  compares the received url to the url stored in the Last_url cookie. If the two are the same, the user does not get any bones for the request and processing resumes at step . This prevents a user from getting credit for, e.g., hitting the reload button on his browser. Otherwise, if the received url is different from the url in the Last_url cookie, BCBT module  checks, in step , if the daily bone limit has been reached by reading the Bonecounter_daily cookie. If it has, processing resumes at step . If the daily bone limit has not been reached, BCBT module , in step , looks up the number of bones associated with the url in url-bone table  on web server . Each entry in url-bone table  comprises a url (or pathname) and a number of bones associated with the url. A master url-bone table is stored on database server  and is automatically downloaded by each web server  whenever a web server starts up. The master url-bone table is also periodically downloaded by each web server, for example, once a month, and, the downloaded url-bone tables are also preferably automatically updated whenever the master url-bone table is updated. A received url is first parsed before the table lookup occurs such that all characters after the rightmost slash in the url are removed.","Finally, in step , BCBT module  determines, based on the Bonecounter daily cookie, if adding the associated number of bones to the user's bone totals will exceed the user's daily bone limit. If it does not, BCBT module  adds the associated number of bones to the Bonecounter_daily, Bonecounter_monthly and Bonecounter_yearly cookies on PC ; otherwise, BCBT module  only adds enough bones to the three bonecounter cookies to bring the Bonecounter_daily cookie up to the daily limit. The javascript on PC, in turn, displays the new bone totals in real-time in the user-bone information box.","BCBT module  also sends the bone information to database server , which independently updates user_bones table . The bone information is sent, in one embodiment, asynchronously to reduce the danger that communications between web servers  and database server  will cause a bottleneck, slowing down the performance of the overall system. BCBT module  sends to database server  the total number of bones associated with the url even if it will exceed the user's daily bone limit. Database server  then performs its own determination of whether the daily bone limit for the user will he exceeded based on the information in user_bones table  and only adds enough bones to bring the user up to the daily limit. This determination is performed in two places, BCBT module  in web server  and database server , to ensure that user_bones table  will store the correct number of cookies even if something goes wrong with the cookie values that BCBT module  uses for its determination. This prevents a user from fraudulently obtaining bones by modifying his or her cookie values.","Database accesses are performed by a database access module executing on database server . This module may be implemented as a pooled connection design in which each web server  opens a number (for example, 8) connections to database server , with the final link in each connection implemented using, for example, RogueWave libraries, Oracles's Pro*C, OCl and\/or Query Cache by Sapient Corporation. The writes to the database can be done using asynchronous or synchronous calls to PL\/SQL stored procedures. Preferably, synchronization points are set up in each web server  such that only one thread can use any one connection to the database at any given time.","Preferably once a day, during an off-peak time such as the early morning, database server  transmits to sweepstakes system  new user information and daily bone information for each user who was awarded one or more bones during the previous twenty-four hours. The time that this transmission occurs is referred to as \u201cbone time,\u201d and is programmed into BCBT module . If a user accesses host system  during bone time, BCBT module  will place a special token in a cookie that specifies that the bone counting system is unavailable. This cookie is read by the javascript on PC , which in turn displays an appropriate message in the user bone-box on PC . BCBT module  will come out of the bone time state when a flag is set by database server  telling BCBT module  that bone time is finished.","Sweepstakes system  conducts daily, monthly and yearly sweepstakes in accordance with applicable local and federal rules and regulations. Each user automatically gets an entry in each daily, monthly and yearly sweepstakes for each of his or her daily, monthly and yearly bones. Preferably, the awards for each of the sweepstakes is large enough to encourage users to use host system . In one embodiment, the daily sweepstake prize is $10,000, the monthly sweepstake prize is $1,000,000, and the yearly sweepstake prize is $10,000,000.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3B","b":["70","71","72","73"]}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
