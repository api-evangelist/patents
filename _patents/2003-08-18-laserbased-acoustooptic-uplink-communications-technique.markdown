{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for performing non-contact acousto-optic uplink communications. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for enabling communication between a submerged platform and an in-air platform via the transmission and reception of acoustic and optical signals.","(2) Description of Related Prior Art","Traditionally, underwater acoustic telemetry involves all in-water hardware to establish an acoustic communication link. No known method of communications from a submerged platform to an in-air platform exists. Conventionally, submerged platforms such as submarines have to surface to transmit their data to an in-air platform or remote site. This procedure can be time consuming and inefficient as compared to a non-contact communications scheme.","What is therefore needed is a technique for facilitating the communication of information from an underwater platform to an above-surface platform without establishing a physical link or line of communication between the two.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for performing a non-contact acousto-optic uplink communication.","In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus for enabling acousto-optic communication comprises an in-water platform emitting an acoustic signal to an acousto-optic interaction zone. An in-air platform transmits a first interrogation laser beam, a portion of the first interrogation laser beam and a reflection of the first interrogation laser beam from the acousto-optic interaction zone. The in-air platform measures the differences between the received beams. A plurality of optical interferences between the portion of the first interrogation laser beam and the received second laser beam are provided as output. A signal converter receives the plurality of optical interferences and provides an electrical signal representing the in-water acoustic communication signal.","This invention provides a non-contact laser-based sensor acousto-optic communications uplink capability using the concepts of laser Doppler vibrometry, i.e., optical interrogation of the air-water interface, to detect velocity pertubations which provide information on the signal structure, spectrum and time domain signal of the underwater acoustic waveform.","With reference to  there is illustrated the apparatus of the present invention. In-water platform  transmits an acoustic telemetry signal  to an acousto-optic interaction zone . In a preferred embodiment, in-water platform  is a platform such as a submarine fully submerged in a body of water. However, in-water platform  may be any platform submerged or partially submerged in water including, but not limited to, sea vessels, submersibles and remote sensing platforms. In a preferred embodiment, the acoustic signal is comprised of a scheme for underwater propagation such as multi-frequency shift keying (MFSK), M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK), or M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM). In a preferred embodiment, acoustic telemetry signal  is provided electrically by a processor  to an acoustic projector  which projects acoustic telemetry signal  into environmental water .","Acoustic telemetry signal  is emitted from in-water platform  towards acousto-optic interaction zone . Acousto-optic interaction zone  is contiguous to air-water boundary . In , the air is indicated as  and the water as . As such, part of acousto-optic interaction zone  consists of an area of the surface boundary between the air  and the water . The interaction of the acoustic telemetry signal  with the acousto-optic interaction zone  causes physical perturbations in the air-water, pressure release boundary . These perturbations take the form of surface vibrations.","In-air platform  transmits an optical interrogation laser beam  created by a laser  towards the acousto-optic interaction zone  at a time when the perturbations in the air-water boundary  formed at the acousto-optic interaction zone  are expected. In a preferred embodiment, in-air platform  is a rotary winged aircraft capable of hovering over and in proximity to acousto-optic interaction zone  as illustrated in FIG. . While described in relation to a helicopter, the present invention is not so limited. Rather, the in-air platform of the present invention is broadly drawn to include any platform located above the air-water boundary capable of emitting an interrogation beam  including, but not limited to, fixed wing aircraft, satellites, land based systems, and portions of a sea vessel located above water.","The interrogation beam  is reflected off the air-water boundary  and back to in-air platform  for reception as a received reflection beam . Although, in the preferred embodiment, interrogation beam  and reflection beam  are transmitted and received at the same platform, different platforms could be used for transmitting and receiving. Having been formed from a reflection off of a surface experiencing vibrational perturbations, received reflection beam  is laser light altered to include numerous frequency shifts corresponding to the vibrational perturbations of the acousto-optic interaction zone .","Analysis of the received reflection beam  may be performed to recover acoustic telemetry signal  using the invention as claimed hereinafter. Laser Doppler vibrometry refers to optical interrogations of the pressure release interface and layers slightly below the surface to detect velocity perturbations. A laser doppler vibrometer  is joined to single sensor or a number of sensors  arranged to obtain beam formable array data. A splitter  is used to divide out unperturbed portion of the interrogation beam \u2032 from the interrogation beam . The unperturbed beam portion \u2032 is used as a reference to compare with received reflected beam . As noted above, received reflection beam  is perturbed by the vibrations in the air-water boundary  in contact with acousto-optic interaction zone . The optical interference between the two beams ,  are measured as a Doppler velocity by an interference vibrometer , which is then converted to an electrical representation of the acoustic signal in the form of an electrical signal by acoustic\/photonic\/electrical signal converter . Acoustic\/photonic\/electrical signal converter  outputs the electrical signal to a telemetry receiver . Telemetry receiver demodulates or otherwise decodes the electrical signal to recreate the received acoustic telemetry signal at the air-water interface.","Because the perturbations to the acousto-optic interaction zone  occur over a finite time and space, advance knowledge of the time and place to emit and receive optical interrogation beams is generally required by the in-air platform . This required knowledge adds a layer of data transmission security, preventing unwanted parties from accessing the acoustic telemetry signals . In addition, the sensing capability of the present invention can be used for a number of related applications such as threat\/marine mammal detection.","It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention an apparatus for performing a non-contact acousto-optic uplink communications which fully satisfies the objects, means, and advantages set forth previously herein. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other alternatives, modifications, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00010","num":"00010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00011","num":"00011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
