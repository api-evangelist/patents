{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH","SEQUENCE LISTING OR COMPUTER PROGRAM","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["(None)","(None)","(None)","The present invention relates to a method for assessing DSL capability of telephone lines, and more particularly, a DSL test method that employs test signals in both narrow band frequency ranges and mid band frequency ranges along a selected test path of a telephone line to identify line characteristics and line conditions that could affect DSL service on the telephone line.","With the explosion in the growth of Internet usage among both businesses and households, telephone companies have been pressured to provide affordable, high bandwidth access that will support high-speed multimedia services, such as video on demand, high speed Internet access, and video conferencing. To meet this demand, telephone companies are increasingly turning to digital subscriber line (DSL) technology. As used herein, DSL is a generic term for a group of higher-rate digital subscriber line communication schemes capable of utilizing twisted pair wiring from an office or other terminal node of a telephone network to the subscriber premises. DSL has been further separated into several different categories of technologies according to specific expected data transfer rates, the types and lengths of the medium over which data are communicated, and schemes for encoding and decoding the communicated data. Examples under various stages of development include ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line), HDSL (High data rate Digital Subscriber Line), SDSL (Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line), and VDSL (Very high data rate Digital Subscriber Line). DSL technology, while having several different embodiments, can provide throughput rates over 100 times faster than that available through traditional 56 Kb\/s modems. As with most telecommunication products and services, DSL service providers need reliable, cost effective means of testing or qualifying the DSL capabilities of the basic telephone lines as well as providing periodic or on-demand assurance of DSL service to its subscribers.","One way of addressing the problem of DSL service assurance is for a service provider to leverage the capabilities of their existing testing infrastructure, such as the common Plain Old Telephony System (POTS) test hardware. As part of the POTS test environment, many service providers today use an automated loop test system (LTS), for analyzing reported troubles on subscribers' telephone lines. An LTS selectively connects to the central office terminals of twisted pair telephone wiring and conducts electrical tests on metallic circuits. Such a system can apply AC voltage across a wire pair, between the Tip (T) wire and ground, and between the Ring (R) wire and ground, and take appropriate measurements to determine characteristic impedances. The LTS can also measure the DC resistance between the wires and between each wire and ground. The LTS stores a list of DC and AC resistance\/impedance values that correspond to certain line conditions, e.g. shorts, opens, normal telephone set connections, etc. The LTS makes decisions as to the presence or absence of different types of faults by comparing the test result values to its stored list of fault threshold values.","However, LTS tests provide limited information regarding the transfer characteristic of the loop or telephone line, particularly with respect to the frequency ranges affecting DSL services. Deployed line test systems cannot accurately determine if a line is \u2018Test OK\u2019 for DSL service and can give erroneous test results based on voice band measurements and POTS dispatch and fault analysis. These erroneous test results include incorrectly stating \u2018Test OK\u2019 when loop or telephone line is faulty or inadequate for DSL service, and incorrectly identifying loop failures associated with voice band that do not impair DSL service.","Another common approach for DSL qualifications or service assurance is for a service provider to use their network management infrastructure to access status information about each subscriber's DSL service from the DSLAM. A DSLAM typically makes available the following information about the status of each subscriber's data connection (ATU-C and ATU-R): serial number, version number, current signal-to-noise margin, current attenuation, current operating status (including loss of framing, loss of power, loss of signal quality), current output power, current attainable rate, current transmit rate, current receive rate.","Unfortunately, the DSLAM does not support direct measurements of the switching fabric, central office splitter, the central office wiring, the outside plant wiring, and premises wiring. Thus, while the DSLAM information can indicate that a service is unavailable or impaired it cannot perform necessary analysis to determine root cause of a fault, type of fault, or location of a fault, except where the fault is within the DSLAM itself","Yet another approach is to introduce a DSL test unit into the path between the ATU-C and ATU-R using a Test Access Matrix (TAM) just beyond the CO splitter. The TAM provides a test path that circumvents the splitter allowing high frequency based measurements to be performed on the line. These measurements provide a direct indication of ingress noise and other line failure modes. In addition to the additional test hardware required, a critical limitation to this approach is that establishing a test path through the high frequency measurement unit disrupts the subscriber's DSL service for the duration of testing, which could last anywhere from thirty seconds to over three minutes or more.","The presently disclosed DSL test system and methods overcome one or more of the problems identified above.","In one aspect, the present invention may be characterized as a method for assessing DSL capability in a telephone line comprising the steps of: (1) obtaining identification information of she telephone line; (2) obtaining frequency test measurements of the telephone line, including mid-band frequency test measurements; (3) ascertaining imbalance line characteristics from the identification information and frequency test measurements; (4) comparing imbalance line characteristics to prescribed imbalance thresholds to determine existence of imbalance line conditions; (5) classifying the imbalance line characteristics, and (6) assessing DSL capability in a telephone line based on the imbalance line characteristics.","In another aspect, the invention may also be characterized as a method for assessing DSL capability in a telephone line comprising the steps of: (1) obtaining identification information of the telephone line; (2) obtaining frequency test measurements including mid-band frequency test measurements; (3) ascertaining imbalance line characteristics from the identification information and frequency test measurements; (4) assessing imbalance line characteristic trends using real-time and historical test data; and (5) assessing DSL capability of the telephone line based on said imbalance characteristic trends.","Other salient features or aspects of the present invention include steps of assessing faults relating to DSL capability in a telephone line based on said imbalance line characteristics and other line conditions; and identifying a repair location, a fault statement, and affecting condition, from said imbalance line characteristics and other line conditions. These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from consideration of the detailed description and drawings set forth below.","The following description includes the best mode presently contemplated for carrying out the invention. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principals of the invention. The scope and breadth of the invention should be determined with reference to the claims.","The written description uses a large number of acronyms to refer to various services and system components. For purposes of this description, selected acronyms therefore will be defined as follows:","DSL\u2014Digital Subscriber Line","ADSL\u2014Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line","HDSL\u2014High data rate Digital Subscriber Line","VDSL\u2014Very high data rate Digital Subscriber Line","xDSL\u2014Generic class of Digital Subscriber Line Services","ATU-C\u2014ADSL Terminal Unit-Central Office","ATU-R\u2014ADSL Terminal Unit-Remote","RT\u2014Remote Switching Unit","CO\u2014Central Office","DSLAM\u2014Digital Subscriber Lim Access Multiplexer","TAM\u2014Test Access Matrix","MDF\u2014Main Distribution Frame","POTS\u2014Plain Old Telephony Service","LDU\u2014Loop Diagnostic Unit","NID\u2014Network Interface Device","OSS\u2014Operations Support System","TSC\u2014Test System Controller","IDS\u2014Interface Data Server","API\u2014Application Program Interface","GUI\u2014Graphical user Interface","SR\u2014Series Resistance","SOAP\u2014Simple Object Access Protocol","CORBA\u2014Common Object Request Broker Architecture","XML\u2014External markup Language","DSP\u2014Digital Signal Processor","ISDN\u2014Integrated Services Digital Network","TCP\/IP\u2014Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol","SNR\u2014Signal to Noise Ratio","DC\u2014Direct Current","AC\u2014Alternating Current","DSL Test System","The system architecture of the preferred embodiment is built around three main platform components. These three platform components are preferably extensions of platform components typically used to implement a Plain Old Telephony System (POTS) Loop Test System such as Teradyne's 4TEL System.","As illustrated in , the DSL Test System architecture  comprises a Test System Controller (TSC) , a Loop Diagnostic Unit (LDU) , and an Interface Data Server (IDS) . In the preferred embodiment, the TSC  is a central computing platform comprising a software and hardware element. The TSC  is adapted for commanding and controlling the test infrastructure, including the LDU  and IDS  as well as other peripheral test related equipment and systems. In addition, the TSC  performs comprehensive DSL analysis and diagnostics using the collected test data and readily available system information. The TSC  is also adapted to dispatch various reports, alarms, and other outputs, where appropriate.","In the preferred embodiment, the LDU  is a DSP-based test head that uses narrow-band and mid-band frequency signals to test a DSL. As used herein, narrow-band frequencies relates to voice band frequencies, typically less than 3.5 kHz. Mid-band frequencies typically include frequencies from the narrow-band range to about 20 kHz.","As further shown in , the LDU  typically resides or is installed in the Central Office, but alternatively can reside in a remote site such as the RT. The LDU  generates test signals, executes selected tests to prescribed lines, and collects parametric measurement data. Advantageously, the LDU  is adapted to execute the selected narrow-band and mid band frequency tests on prescribed lines that include at least one switch test bus  and one or more ASDL splitters , . More specifically, the LDU  can access a line having a signal path including the switch test bus , MDF  and DSLAM  cabling, the low-pass filter of an ADSL CO or RT splitter , outside premises cable and instrumentation, network interface device (NID) , subscriber premises wiring and other subscriber equipment such as a telephone , PC , or modem  located within the premises  or any combination thereof.","In short, the preferred embodiment uses the test path typically accessible to a POTS Loop Test System, but does so at mid-band frequencies, not applicable to voice band test measurements. As with many POTS Loop Test Systems, line measurements obtained through this test path are initiated at the service provider's central office or remote switching units and are single-ended. In other words, the DSL mid-band frequency tests do not require any active measurement technology on the subscriber end or other second location, thus keeping systems costs manageable. The LDU  is in operative communication with the TSC  such that the collected parametric measurement data is forwarded to the TSC  for analysis and fault identification.","The IDS  is also a computing platform comprising a hardware and software element. In particular, the IDS  provides one or more application programming interfaces (API)  for access by OSS , or other computers  machines and equipment of the service provider or its agents. The preferred embodiment of the Interface Data Server also includes a HTML-based Graphical User Interface  for access by various users and their workstations . As used herein a user may include one or more DSL subscribers, DSL service provider personnel, customer service representatives, or other persons or machines that have an identified need or desire for DSL test data. The IDS  typically resides would reside within the management network of the service provider so as to offer a source of persistence data storage  as well as secure access to the system from users and equipment within the service center . Alternatively, the IDS  may be a distributed computing platform accessible by users via a local or wide area network, or may be a centralized system at the site of one or more users. Like the LDU , the IDS  is in operative communication with the TSC  such that the analysis and fault identification as well as any configuration information or other data residing on the TSC  or its associated persistent storage  may be available to the users.","On an as-needed basis selected users of the system such as the subscriber, Tier 1 or Tier 2 personnel, or administrative users, are queried for specific and targeted information directly relevant to the contemplated analysis. This dialog or interchange-based component of the test and analysis method is constrained and mediated by the identified line conditions and selected performance models. This results in more efficient and focused interactions with users or other external sources of information. This user provided information could include such data elements as the vendor and type of ATU-C 40 and ATU-R equipment, the status of the ATU-R42, the status of the voice-grade connection, the status of the DSL data service, and information about any other premises equipment.","Turning back to , the TSC  is disposed in a designated computer center  and forms the central element of the DSL testing system . The TSC  provides administration user interface, LDU interface, test management and control, expert system analysis, and operation support system (OSS) database interface.","Using industry standard hardware, such as a SUN Microsystems Central Processing Unit and UNIX Operating System, the TSC  provides all the centralized processing and control for the DSL test system . The TSC  includes a main processing unit or units, random access memory, persistent storage , input\/output peripherals and a communications server sub-system. The TSC  manages the majority of the external interfaces included within the disclosed DSL test system .","The TSC  is preferably configured and associated with for a selected group of switches and associated LDUs. For service provider users (e.g. Tier 1 users, Tier 2 users, and administrative users), a gateway TSC will be configured with their account details and test system access privileges. This account applies for both testing on the gateway and other TSCs reachable from the gateway. The site data is fully configurable on line. For large geographical area coverage, multiple TSCs can be transparently networked together via Local Area Networks or wide Area networks thereby enabling the DSL test system to test millions of lines across a telephone network.","The LDU  is a DSP-based test head installed in the central office (CO)  or remote switching unit (RT) in order to conduct measurements of the designated cable or loop  in response to requests from the TSC . The TSC  makes such test requests to the LDU  in response to user requests for various tests or on a prescribed test schedule. The LDU  interfaces to both analog and digital switches of varying size, complexity, and location, including switching schemes deployed in smaller remote switching units as well as larger central offices. The LDU  forms an integral part of the test system , returning parametric line measurement data to the TSC . The parametric line measurement data is used to ascertain selected line characteristics which is subject to further analysis to obtain the desired DSL assessments, including line condition identification, fault identification, line impairment detection, and other assessments such as overall DSL qualification determinations as well as overall DSL service assurance determinations.","The LDU  uses a DSP, random access memory, and non-volatile storage to execute measurement algorithms for the testing of copper lines to deliver accurate, reliable test results. Communication between a TSC  and LDU  is preferably achieved via a modem, ISDN, X.25 or TCP\/IP network connection, although other communication protocols can be used.","The preferred DSL test system uses a machine-to-machine interface to digital switches from the TSC . The TSC  performs the access request to the switch interface and then commands the LDU  to perform the actual measurements. Each LDU  is connected to a switch test bus  and employs the same specialized loop test techniques to perform metallic line measurements. DSP measurement circuits in the LDU  test the accessed line and the resulting parametric measurement data is returned to the TSC . To maintain accuracy, the LDU  automatically compensates for temperature and other changes during its working life by periodically re-calibrating itself","The DSL test system provides a variety of options for integration into the service provider's environment through use of the IDS . This server supports an HTML-based interface  using a web server (Apache) or a server engine (Tomcat) so users can access the system from an Intranet or the Internet using a standard web browser.","The IDS  also offers standards-based APIs  such as SOAP and CORBA to allow access from the service provider's OSS. This enables the service provider to generate test requests and receive results via an API . The preferred DSL test system  automatically executes the requested test using the directory or equipment number of the customer line. Both Equipment Number and Directory Number access is supported.","During the test sequence, the IDS  provides progress messages that allow the operator to monitor the status of the test. With the test complete, the test system  provides the analyzed results to assist either the operator or the OSS  to determine the condition of the line, and the appropriate repair action.","Mid-Band Frequency Tests","Most POTS LTS test measurements are made at frequencies of 1 KHz and below. While the telephony signal path through the splitter has a frequency limit above that of normal telephony signals, typically up to about 20 KHz, it is much lower than the frequencies used to support xDSL communication. The information provided using these low-frequency measurements (e.g. 1 KHz) has restricted value with respect to identifying and evaluating line conditions that might affect xDSL service quality, and in particular ADSL service quality.","The frequencies at which ADSL operates which are between 38 KHz and 1.1 MHz. This frequency range within the telephony infrastructure is considered high or very high frequency range. For purposes of telephony infrastructure-based DSL testing, the frequency range between about 4 KHz and up to about 20 KHz is referred to as the mid-band frequency range.","The test path in most POTS measurement systems is frequency-limited by the CO splitter to a maximum of no more than about 20 KHz. This is below the frequencies at which ADSL operates which are between 38 KHz and 1.1 MHz. Further, it is well below the frequencies of any noise that might impact ADSL performance. For these reasons, it was historically thought that mid-band frequency measurements would be of little or no use in matters of xDSL service qualification and xDSL service assurance. However, the present DSL test system and associated analysis techniques overcomes this challenge.","In the preferred embodiment, the mid-band frequency tests are carried out at a plurality of bandwidths and frequency resolutions. Typical mid-band frequency tests range between 8 kHz and 20 kHz. The test frequency values are controllable through LDU test request parameters. The test path is probed under various drive conditions during the tests. The drive condition settings refer to different configurations for test signal application. The drive source excitation can be applied in common-mode or differential mode, and the common mode signal in turn could be with reference to tip, ring or both the legs of the cable pair. A single mid-band LDU test typically involves a combination of drive settings where the response of the line under test to the drive signal is inverted to obtain various line parameters used for subsequent line conditions analysis. In a preferred mid-band frequency test sequence, the specific mid-band frequency tests include: AC2: (common-mode) at 20 kHz; AC2: (differential-mode) at 20 kHz; and AC3: (Common\/differential mode) at 9 kHz","The AC2 and AC3 nomenclature refers to 2-terminal or 3-terminal mid-band measurements, respectively. The AC2 drive source is either in common or differential mode where the AC3 measurement implies a sequential combination of common mode and differential mode measurements. The 20 kHz tests are performed at multiple test frequency resolutions and drive conditions.","Narrow-band frequency testing includes POTS test measurements taken using applied voltages between \u221210V and \u221240V. Introducing these voltages may change the magnitude of fault conditions on the line under test. In some cases, for example, with oxidation-based resistance faults, application of these voltages may remove or diminish them. However, such faults may reappear some minutes or hours later and then continue to worsen. In some cases, the application of these voltages appears to make line balance faults worse. Thus line condition stability is itself an important condition to be developed and analyzed.","Most potentially unstable DSL service affecting line conditions can be identified through using mid-band frequency test measurements. However, the sequence in which the DSL tests are performed is potentially important. In general, low voltage, mid-band frequency measurements will be made first, followed by higher voltage, narrow-band frequency measurements, followed again by a second set of mid-band frequency measurements. The magnitude of the line characteristics (and associated line conditions) identified using the first set of mid-band frequency measurements are compared with those identified using the second set of mid-band frequency measurements.","DSL Test Path","The preferred embodiment of the DSL test system employs single ended test paths. Test measurements of selected telephone lines are typically initiated and the test results collected at the same location and using the same LTU. In practice, the LTU is located at the central office or remote switching unit. As a single-ended test system, the DSL tests do not require any active measurement technology on the subscriber end or other second location, thus keeping the deployment or installation costs of the disclosed DSL test system manageable and the overall DSL test system configuration relatively simple, as compared to multi-end DSL test systems.","Of equal importance is the fact that the present DSL test system and method takes appropriate test measurements on a test path that passes through the voice switch test bus associated with the telephone line under test. As such, the DSL tests and test path do not require or involve any Test Access Matrix (TAM) for access to the telephone line, making this approach an economical solution for mass-market consumer DSL service assurance testing. Further, the present DSL test system and methods are not disruptive of DSL service and therefore can be used to support a background testing capability that periodically monitors the health of a subscriber's DSL service.","As seen in , the test path for a DSL circuit generally extends from the CO splitter  or RT splitter to the premises . The cable length is a critical factor in determining what maximum DSL data rate a copper pair can support. Thus, cable length must be consistent and accurate to within 100 feet across multiple test measurements taken at different times. This includes situations where there are line terminations such as mechanical or electronic ringers, modems, fax machines, or other typical telephony compatible customer premises equipment and DSL service provider instrumentation.","Signaturized splitter detection is a DC signature analysis technique. Section E.2.1.7 Maintenance Test Signatures of the T1E1 standard G.992.1 ADSL Transceivers defines the requirements for splitter maintenance test signatures. The signatures are designed to be activated only by line test systems and not to interfere with normal circuit operation. Through analysis of raw DC test measurements, the DSL test system is capable of determining the presence of the CO splitter as well as its orientation in the test path, as well as other splitters disposed in the test path.","Detailed Test & Analysis Methodology","Turning now to , the twelve phases of the preferred test and analysis method  are depicted. The exact order, sequence, and execution of the steps or phases may be interchanged or even skipped altogether, depending on the identified or anticipated line conditions and selected performance models.","Phase 1\u2014Process Test Request Transaction (Block ). This phase accepts a test transaction. The test transaction generally includes service provider identification, test type, circuit access information (directory number, switch name, circuit identification), DSL equipment information, customer problem report, and DSL service profile name.","Phase 2\u2014Test and Analysis Parameter Initialization (Block ). This phase obtains general information about the ADSL environment including service profiles, business rules, line models, and analysis thresholds. Such environment related information includes both generic and provider specific elements.","Phase 3\u2014Real-Time Test Data Acquisition and Assembly (Block ). This phase instructs the LDU servicing the line to initiate and obtain voice-band and mid-band test measurements.","Phase 4\u2014External Data Source Interaction (Block ). This phase accesses any external data or source information necessary from the test operator, the subscriber, the operation support system (OSS), or other users.","Phase 5\u2014Primary Condition Analysis (Block ). Perform analysis to develop primary line condition information from the real-time test measurements, and archived measurement and condition information.","Phase 6\u2014Historical Test Data Acquisition (Block ). This phase accesses archived measurement and condition information for the line under test.","Phase 7\u2014Secondary Condition Analysis (Block ). This phase performs data analysis to develop performance and noise model-based secondary line-condition information from the primary line conditions, real-time measurements, and archived line test measurements and condition information.","Phase 8\u2014Trending Analysis (Block ). This phase performs selected data analysis to develop line condition trend information related to the line under test.","Phase 9\u2014Fault Ranking (Block ). This phase of the test and analysis method perform an analysis to identify critical line conditions and rank the impact of each critical line condition on ADSL performance and availability.","Phase 10\u2014Dispatch and Jurisdiction Analysis (Block ). This phase performs jurisdiction analysis necessary to develop repair location, fault statement, affecting condition, and other fault summary information.","Phase 11\u2014Results Archiving (Block ). This phase of the preferred test and analysis method performs analysis to determine if the current measurements and line conditions for this line should be archived and if any previously archived information about this line should be purged. If necessary, update the archive in persistent storage.","Phase 12\u2014Results Presentation (Block ). This phase of the preferred test and analysis method prepares summary and detailed information for the service provider or subscriber as a response to the test transaction and provides the results and information via an appropriate user interface.","Additional information relating to each of the twelve identified phases of the preferred test and analysis method  is provided in the paragraphs that follow.","Process Test Request Transaction","This phase of the test and analysis process handles the test request transaction that initiates data collection for the line under test. It processes each of the transaction inputs into a canonical internal format and makes the information available for subsequent analysis steps. Where inputs are missing or inappropriate default values will be provided. The following steps are performed within this initial phase. (a) Collect the service provider identification and test type input from a request transaction, performs a time stamping operation, and provides the service provider identification, test type and test start time. (Test types include \u2018batch mode\u2019 or \u2018immediate mode\u2019); (b) Look up of any necessary generic and provider specific request defaults; (c) Identify circuit access information including the directory number, the equipment number, the internal circuit identification, and the switch short name of the line under test; (d) Map the internal circuit identification and switch short name to an internal switch element identification; (e) Collect DSL equipment description information from the test request input and request defaults including the DSLAM name, vendor and type, ATU-C vendor and type, and DSL circuit type (The DSL circuit type indicates the protocol standard supported by the circuit between the ATU-C and ATU-R); (f) Identify the DSL service profile name from the test request input and the request defaults and map a service profile name that is not available to the appropriate request default value and provides the profile name.","Test and Analysis Parameter Initialization","This is the test and analysis phase where service provider and market specific data will be accumulated from persistent storage associated with the DSL Test System. This data includes parameter thresholds, test path compensation factors, and DSLAM to MDF compensation factors. The following steps are performed within this second phase: (a) Identify the path compensation factors using a lookup table and the switch identification (SWID) and DSLAM name as a selector; (b) Perform a lookup of the analysis parameters for the named switch including a set of thresholds for use in subsequent phases of analysis; and (c) Retrieve the service profile information. If the service profile information available from persistent storage, the information is retrieved directly from the lookup table using DSLAM as the selector. In the preferred embodiment, the persistent storage maintains service profile information in the form of a lookup table with one row for each named profile for each named DSLAM. If service profile information is not available from persistent storage, the analysis system retrieves the service profile information from an external source via a request transaction.","Real-Time Test Data Acquisition","This is the test and analysis phase where real-time narrow-band frequency and mid-band frequency test measurements are requested from an LDU and the results are stored for subsequent analysis. The preferred test measurements include those typical for a POTS LTS and additional mid-band frequency test measurements. The following checks, measurements and detections are included within this third phase: (a) Narrow band frequency test measurements, including a plurality of resistance measurements, capacitance measurements, low frequency AC current measurements, DC current measurements, and voltage measurements; (b) Mid band frequency test measurements; (c) Validity Checks of collected mid-band and narrow band frequency measurements; and (d) Signaturized splitter detection.","In the preferred embodiment, line characteristics are ascertained using line test systems such as the 4TEL II Line Test System from Teradyne, Inc. The preferred measurements include a plurality of resistance measurements, capacitance measurements, low frequency AC current measurements, DC current measurements, and voltage measurements. Safety considerations in test execution and performance require the application of very low current and voltages through the test path.","In particular, the preferred embodiment obtains a plurality of resistance measurements such as tip-ground (\u03a9), ring-ground (\u03a9), tip-battery (\u03a9), ring-battery (\u03a9), tip-ring (\u03a9), and ring-tip (\u03a9) as well as a plurality of capacitance measurements such as mutual (C), cable (C), tip-ground (C), ring-ground (C), tip-ring (C), ring-tip (C). The disclosed embodiment also includes both Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) measurements. Specifically, the narrow-band frequency (e.g. 30 Hz) AC current measurements include tip-ground-conductance (G), tip-ground-susceptance (S), ring-ground-conductance (G), ring-ground-susceptance (S), tip-ring-conductance (Gtr), tip-ring-susceptance (S), ring-tip-conductance (G), ring-tip-susceptance (S), tip-mutual-conductance (G), tip-mutual-susceptance (S), ring-mutual-conductance (G), ring-mutual-susceptance (S), tip-background-current (I) and ring-background-current (I) whereas the DC current measurements include tip-battery (I), ring-battery (I), tip-ground (I), ring-ground (I), tip-ring (I), and ring-tip (I). Finally, the disclosed embodiment also includes selected voltage measurements as part of the scheme for ascertaining line characteristics. These voltage measurements include: measurement-dc-volts (V), tip-prebco-dc-volts (V), ring-prebco-dc-volts (V), tip-ground-dc-volts (V), ring-ground-dc-volts (V), tip-ring-dc-volts (V), ring-tip-dc-volts (V), tip-ac-volts (V), ring-ac-volts (V), tip-ring-ac-volts (V), and ring-tip-ac-volts (V).","Accompanying these primary measurements is a group of validity conditions indicating whether a measurement is usable for further condition or segmentation analysis. These basic measurement conditions are \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019 valued and include: Capacitance validity conditions (e.g. mutual-capacitance-valid, cable-capacitance-valid, tip-ground-capacitance-valid, ring-ground-capacitance-valid, tip-ring-capacitance-valid, ring-tip-capacitance-valid); AC current validity conditions (e.g. tip-ground-ac-current-valid, ring-ground-ac-current-valid, tip-ring-ac-current-valid, ring-tip-ac-current-valid, tip-mutual-ac-current-valid, ring-mutual-ac-current-valid); and Voltage validity condition (prebco-available).","The preferred mid-band frequency tests include: AC2 test at 20 KHz, common-mode with logarithmic spectrum; AC2 test at 20 KHz, differential mode with logarithmic spectrum; AC3 test at 20 KHz, combined common and differential mode with linear test spectrum; AC3 test at 9 KHz, two-terminal loop impedance; and AC3 test at 20 KHz, three-terminal line impedance.","As indicated above, the AC2 refers to a to 2-terminal mid-band test whereas the AC3 refers to a three terminal mid-band frequency test. The AC2 drive source is either in common or differential mode where the AC3 measurement implies a sequential combination of common mode and differential mode measurements. The mid-band frequency tests of the line under test and resulting data, (e.g. resistance, capacitance, impedance, conductance, susceptance, current, voltage, validity, etc) are performed at multiple test frequencies between about 4 KHz and 20 KHz, frequency resolutions and drive conditions.","External Data Source Interaction","The next test and analysis phase performs a sequence of interactions with the customer or agents of the service provider (Tier 1 and Tier 2 personnel) and\/or Operation System Support (OSS). More particularly, the presently disclosed system interacts through a graphical interface to obtain data from human operators (i.e. Tier 1, 2) or through a machine-machine interface with the OSS to obtain the same information. Information requested from the human operators may include a problem report, problem severity, and problem duration for both voice service and DSL service. Information requested from the OSS preferably includes service profile information and ATU-R vendor and type information. The following specific steps are performed within this fourth phase: (a) The customer voice service problem identification, including problem report, problem severity and problem duration. (b) The customer DSL service problem identification, including problem report, problem severity and problem duration; (c) Service Profile information retrieval; and (d) ATU-R information retrieval.","The customer voice service problem report could be one of: not available, no dial tone (NDT), can't be called (CBC), can't call out (CCO), can't hear (CH), can't be heard (CBH), noise (NOI), and so on.

It then moves the service profile information to persistent storage. The ATU-R Information retrieval preferably performs an interaction with the operation support system using the DslamName as a selector to obtain ATU-R vendor and type information. If this information is unavailable from the operation support system, this knowledge source performs a sequence of interactions with the customer (directly or indirectly through the Tier 1 operator).","Identifying Primary Line Conditions","The critical fifth phase of the subject test and analysis method provides the underlying analysis to determine the primary line condition information from the real-time test measurements as well as archived measurement and condition information. Such primary line conditions are determined using narrow-band frequency and mid-band frequency test measurements, calculations and analysis. The following steps are performed within this important fifth phase: (a) Identify primary line conditions using narrow-band frequency test measurements; (b) Establish validity of narrow-band frequency test measurements; (c) Determine cable length and corrected cable length; (d) Retrieve footprint information; (e) Determine premises continuity condition; (f) Determine Resistive Imbalance Line Condition using mid-band frequency tests; (g) Determine Capacitive Imbalance Line Condition using mid-band frequency tests; (h) Determine Metallic Faults Line Condition; (i) Determine Imbalance Stability; (d) Determine Imbalance Historical Stability; (k) Determine Imbalance Type; (l) Determine cable length normalization parameters; (m) Determine capacitive imbalance value for narrow band frequencies; and (n) Detect any signaturized splitter in test path.","Using the narrow-band resistance measurements, capacitance measurements, low frequency AC current measurements, DC current measurements, and voltage measurements identified above, it is possible to ascertain selected line conditions of the line under test. Broadly speaking, the primary line conditions include the following seven significant line conditions. (1) Metallic Access Condition: This indicates whether a line was in use for voice service when last accessed by a loop diagnostic unit to perform measurements. (2) Ringer Condition: This indicates whether any premises equipment on the line is in an off-hook state. (3) Hazardous Volts Condition: This indicates whether any safety impacting voltage conditions are present on the line. (4) Termination Condition: This indicates the state of any voice service related premises or network termination equipment at the subscriber end of the line. (5) Cable Condition: This defines the overall condition of the twisted pair or cable associated with the line this condition includes a cable status, a cable length (where available), and an imbalance length (where available). The cable length defined here is the primary derivation useful for voice telephony analysis. This is the cable length corrected to eliminate switch test bus and main distribution frame (MDF) contributions of AC currents and capacitance. However, before cable length can be used for ADSL service assurance analysis it must be processed further. (6) Dispatch Condition: This includes the most voice service affecting fault and the fault jurisdiction assigned to the line by LTS5 analysis. While this is the major outcome of LTS, it is evaluated as just another input condition for ADSL service assurance analysis. (7) Signature Condition: This defines the overall condition of the line with respect to the presence of any specialized equipment whose narrow band AC and DC characteristics fit certain standard profiles. This condition includes signature-status, signature-type. The signature status indicates whether any signature has been encountered. The signature type indicates a best efforts attempt to identify the general or specific type of equipment discovered on the line.","Table 1 identifies the preferred line conditions of interest and list of possible values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"343pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Primary Line Conditions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["CONDITION NAME","POSSIBLE VALUES","COMMENTS"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["MetalicAccessbCondition","IDLE_LINE_ACCESSED",{}]},{"entry":[{},"BUSY_LINE_ACCESSED"]},{"entry":["RingerCondition","OFF_HOOK_DETECTED"]},{"entry":[{},"OFF_HOOK_NOT_DETECTED"]},{"entry":["HazardousVoltsCondition","HAZARDOUS_AC_VOLTS"]},{"entry":[{},"HAZARDOUS_DC_VOLTS"]},{"entry":[{},"NO_HAZARDOUS_VOLTS"]},{"entry":["TerminationCondition","TERMINATION_NOT_AVAILABLE","The status of the termination cannot be"]},{"entry":[{},{},"determined."]},{"entry":[{},"NO_TERMINATION","The subscriber end of the line has no premises"]},{"entry":[{},{},"or network termination equipment."]},{"entry":[{},"BRIDGED_TERMINATION","A bridged ringer is detected."]},{"entry":[{},"ABNORMAL_TERMINATION","Voice service termination equipment is"]},{"entry":[{},{},"detected, but signature is atypical."]},{"entry":[{},"NETWORK_TERMINATION","A remote isolation or network demarcation"]},{"entry":[{},{},"device is detected."]},{"entry":[{},"NO_NETWORK_TERMINATION","No remote isolation or network termination"]},{"entry":[{},{},"device is detected."]},{"entry":["Cable-Status","CABLE_NOT_AVAILABLE","The status of the cable cannot be determined."]},{"entry":[{},"CABLE_NORMAL","Status of the cable is normal"]},{"entry":[{},"NO_CABLE","No cable was detected on the line."]},{"entry":[{},"TIP_IMBALANCE","The tip leg is shorter then the ring leg."]},{"entry":[{},"RING_IMBALANCE","The ring leg is shorter than the tip leg."]},{"entry":[{},"TIP_DISCONNECT","An exchange disconnection on the tip leg."]},{"entry":[{},"RING_DISCONNECT","An exchange disconnection on the ring leg."]},{"entry":["Cable Length","<#Value>","Length of the cable in feet where cable has a"]},{"entry":[{},{},"normal, imbalance, or disconnect status"]},{"entry":["Cable Imbalance-Length","<#Value>","Length of the imbalance in feet where the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"cable has an imbalance or disconnect status."]},{"entry":["Signature Type","EQUIPMENT_SIGNATURE"]},{"entry":[{},"LINE_TREATMENT_EQUIPMENT"]},{"entry":[{},"OTHER_STATION_EQUIPMENT"]},{"entry":[{},"MUSIC_SPLITTER"]},{"entry":[{},"RF_FILTER"]},{"entry":[{},"DACS"]},{"entry":[{},"INDETERMINATE"]},{"entry":[{},"NONE"]},{"entry":["Signature Status","DETECTED"]},{"entry":[{},"NOT_DETECTED"]},{"entry":[{},"INDETERMINATE"]},{"entry":["Dispatch Status","NO_DISPATCH","No fault jurisdiction is assigned."]},{"entry":[{},"TESTED_OK","No fault identified."]},{"entry":[{},"FAULT_EXCHANGE","Major fault has been identified -

An imbalance can be caused by any of the following sources: metallic faults, resistive imbalance, or capacitive imbalance. Each of these impairments produces line imbalance of different levels with respect to ground. Therefore, the longitudinal balance of the line is compromised resulting in increased longitudinal conversion loss. This, in turn, can make the cable pair vulnerable to crosstalk and EMI noise if present in the bundle. However, different sources of imbalance impact ADSL service in different manners. In addition, where the higher frequency ADSL data link is affected, there may or may not be an affect on lower frequency voice service. Thus, a line test system using voice band frequencies alone will not be adequate to test ADSL service.","Resistive imbalance, caused by Series Resistance (SR) in the line, also affects the line balance.  shows a pictorial representation of SR in an ADSL line . As seen therein, the cable loop includes a tip leg  and ring leg  of the cable pair connected at one end to the CO splitter  and at the other end to a second splitter . Upstream of the CO splitter  on the low frequency coupling is the voice switch  while the higher frequency coupling is connected to the DSLAM . Premises equipment such as modem  or telephone  are coupled appropriately to the lower frequency or higher frequency path within the splitter  depicted at or near the premises end of the ASDL line under test . Series Resistance (SR)  is typically introduced by a bad splice or solder in the cable or a damaged conductor. If such splice is exposed to air, the value of the fault is often stimulated by oxidation process caused by the loop current, making it time varying and intermittent in nature. These faults are sometime referred to as high-resistance or high impedance faults. The imbalance due to a single leg series resistance in a loop would cause asymmetry in the voltage measurement about earth or ground.","Capacitive imbalance is another common line condition contributing to line balance.  shows a typical capacitive imbalance scenario with an unbalanced bridged tap in an ADSL line . The cable loop includes a tip leg  and ring leg  of the cable pair connected at one end to the CO splitter  and at the other end to a second splitter . Upstream of the CO splitter  on the low frequency coupling is the voice switch  while the higher frequency coupling is connected to the DSLAM . Premises equipment such as modem  (high frequency) or telephone  (low frequency) is depicted at the premises end of the ASDL line under test . The influence of capacitive imbalance on ADSL service will depend upon the length of the tap (y) causing the imbalance and its location (x).","A third form of line imbalance is a result of metallic faults on the line such as shorts, grounds and contacts, affect the balance of the line. These conditions typically are caused by exposure of the cable to groundwater that can reduce the isolation between conductors or between conductors and the sheath resulting in increased conductivity.","In practice, SR is typically originated due to a poor splice or joint. In a corrosive environment, such as exposure to air and water ingress in the cable, the conductivity of the splice can change over time due to oxidation resulting is a time-varying resistance. These variable impairments are generally referred to as \u201cswinging\u201d or unstable SR faults. For the specific purpose of maintaining cable splice integrity by preventing the build-up of oxidation, a small DC current is applied to the loop. This is known as known as wetting or \u201csealing\u201d current. An ADSL circuit relies on the wetting current provided by off-hook loop current. Every time the receiver is picked up, the line voltage applied across a bad splice produces an arcing effect over the discontinuity that can remove the dirt layer or corrosion that can build over time creating an SR. On the other hand, such a fault can grow to a very large value if the phone is not in use over a long period. Generally, an unstable SR would vary cyclically over time due to the splice oxidation and de-oxidation resulting from changes in the line current. Therefore, an attempt is made to discern between static and time-varying faults during line balance analysis.","The input signal to ADSL line imbalance analysis is represented as:\n\n()={}, k=1 . . . 45.\n\n()={}\n\nwhere:\n\ncos \u03b8,\n\nsin \u03b8\n","Thus, aand bare the real and imaginary part of the peak amplitude voltages corresponding to the 45 test frequencies in the received signal respectively and are associated with ring leg of the cable pair.

The calculations are then compared to prescribed imbalance detection threshold \u0393. More specifically, the present method performs a comparison between Iand \u0393. If \u0393>\u0393the analysis provides an indication that an imbalance condition is detected, otherwise it provides and indication that a imbalance condition is not detected. Likewise, the imbalance parameter I, is compared to the imbalance detection threshold \u0393. If I>\u0393the preferred method provides an indication that an imbalance condition is detected, otherwise it provides and indication that an imbalance condition is not detected. Similarly, the imbalance parameters Iand Iare also compared to the imbalance detection threshold \u0393. If I>\u0393or I>\u0393, the method provides an indication that an imbalance condition is detected, otherwise it provides and indication that an imbalance condition is not detected.","Discriminating between a capacitive imbalance and resistive imbalance is preferably addressed using multiple techniques including narrow-band frequency parametric data analysis, historical line stability analysis, and real-time line stability analysis.","The first technique assesses the real time stability of the line under test. By comparing the difference between the Iand Icalculations or the Iand I, calculations, and comparing such differences to a change threshold (\u0394Ior \u0394Ip as the case may be), it is possible to ascertain the real-time stability of the line.","A second imbalance classification technique is a historical line stability assessment. For example, the pattern of line imbalance calculations (Iand I) over several days can help differentiate between a capacitive or resistive source of imbalance. As described earlier, SR faults are typically time varying in nature. On the other hand, the pure capacitive imbalances are static. Therefore if no changes in the line imbalance calculations (Iand I) are observed over time, it generally indicates the existence of a capacitive imbalance. Otherwise a resistive imbalance or SR is the likely cause of the imbalance.","A third imbalance classification technique utilizes narrow-band frequency parametric data. Typically, a resistive imbalance or SR in the loop results in reduced tip-to-ring conductance of the line. Once an imbalance is detected in the line, the conductance across the pair is compared against a threshold to determine the nature of the imbalance. Typically, there is no significant change in tip-ring conductance (G) for loops with capacitive imbalance. For example,  shows tip-ring conductance versus Series Resistance for loop lengths of 4000 fit (ref numeral ), 10000 feet (reference numeral ) and 16000 feet (reference numeral ) as well as tip-ring conductance versus Capacitive imbalance for loop lengths of 4000 ft (ref numeral , 10000 feet (reference numeral ) and 16000 feet (reference numeral )","Alternatively, the tip-to-ground and ring-to-ground impedances provide another way of imbalance classification. Knowing that the ADSL loop is a mostly a capacitive load, logic can be applied to distinguish between capacitive and resistive imbalances. This approach can resolve majority of capacitive versus resistive imbalances.","Each of the aforementioned techniques can be used alone or in conjunction with each other to reach a determination of whether an imbalance exists and the nature of such imbalance.  depicts the preferred method for determining whether the imbalance calculated using requency measurements is capacitive or resistive.","As seen in , the process Starts (Block ) and various conductance and susceptance values for the line under test are determined (Block ). If the tip-ring conductance is greater than a prescribed conductance threshold value or minimum (Block ) the process proceeds to evaluate the various line susceptance values. Specifically, the process compares the difference between tip-ground susceptance and ring-ground susceptance to a susceptance threshold value (Block ). If the difference exceeds the susceptance threshold value, the imbalance is classified as capacitive imbalance (Block ), else the imbalance is classified as a resistive imbalance (Block ). On the other hand, if the tip-ring conductance is not greater than a prescribed conductance threshold value or minimum (Block ), the process assesses the tip-ground conductance and ring-ground conductance values (Blocks  and ). If either of the two conductances is null (e.g. zero) and the other is greater than 1.0, then the imbalance is classified as resistive imbalance (Block ), else the imbalance is not classified. Once an imbalnce is classified or if classification is not possible, the process stops (Block ).","Historical Test Data Acquisition","The purpose of the next phase is to access archived measurement and condition information for the line under test. The following steps are included in this sixth phase: (a) Access of persistent storage to obtain archive records for the line under test; (b) Designate one such archived record as the footprint; and (c) Retrieve historical values of line imbalance factors from persistent storage. The footprint is a record holding test data and line condition information collected at least 72 hours prior to the current test with a Dispatch Condition of \u2018Tested OK\u2019. As seen in , the Historical Test Acquisition Phase is performed in conjunction with or interfaces with the primary and secondary line condition analysis phases as well as the trend analysis phase, described herein.","Secondary Line Condition Analysis","The purpose of the seventh test and analysis phase is to conduct analysis of secondary line conditions that are based on an interpretation of real-time and archived measurements as well as primary line conditions. The following analyses are performed within this phase: (a) Develop conditions that characterize unstable phase imbalance and predict upstream and downstream data rate in the face of various performance-affecting line conditions; (b) Collect ATU-C vendor and type information; (c) Provide upstream and downstream performance values, the line noise susceptibility factor, and the line noise radiation factor, all associated with a level of resistive imbalance; (d) Provide upstream and downstream performance values, the line noise susceptibility factor, and the line noise radiation factor, all associated with a level of capacitive imbalance and (e) Provide upstream and downstream performance values, the line noise susceptibility factor, and the line noise radiation factor, all associated with a level of resistance in the line.","The performance (i.e. data rate) of a DSL line in both upstream and downstream directions decreases as the value of the fault series resistance increases.

If the predicted data rate is much above the minimum promised, then the line condition is ranked as \u2018Not Service Affecting\u2019. If the predicted data rate is somewhat above the minimum promised data rate the line condition is ranked as \u2018Suspect\u2019. If the predicted data rate is within some small range above or below the minimum promised data rate the line condition is ranked as \u2018Minor\u2019. If the predicted data rate is much below the minimum, promised data rate the line condition is ranked as \u2018Major\u2019. Of course, in actual analysis, quantitative assessments replace these qualitative ones.","There are some complications since the line models offer several predicted data rates for varying levels of cable bundle occupation. For example, consider the predicated data rate for a line in a no noise situation, one where no other line in the cable bundle offers DSL or other high-speed data service. Under these conditions, if the predicted data rate is much below the minimum, promised data rate the line condition is ranked as \u2018Major\u2019. Analysis can stop here without the need to consider predicted data rates under more service effecting noise environments. If the line is predicted not to support some minimum data rate even under the most favorable noise conditions, in more realistic noise environments performance can only be predicted to be worse. On the other hand, consider the predicated data rate for a line in a high noise situation, one where almost every other line in the cable bundle offers DSL or other high-speed data service. Under these conditions, if the predicted data rate is much above the minimum, promised data rate the line condition is ranked as \u2018Not Service Affecting\u2019. Analysis can stop here without the need to consider predicted data rates under less service effecting noise environments. If the line is predicted to support some minimum data rate even under the least favorable noise conditions, in more favorable noise environments performance can only be predicted to be better. Other situations, where the noise level or the predicted data rate is not extreme require additional business logic to access. To some extent service provider specific thresholds will control this business logic.","Even if the effect of a resistive imbalance, capacitive imbalance, or resistance line condition is only \u2018Suspect\u2019 or \u2018Not Service Affecting\u2019, the line condition might cause the line to be more susceptible to the effects of ingress noise. This could cause the line intermittently to exhibit more degraded performance. Line conditions are associated with susceptibility factors through the various line models. Service provider and line condition specific thresholds are applied to these severity factors to rank line susceptibility as Not Susceptible, Severe, Moderate, Suspect, or Indeterminate. Alternatively, the line condition could cause the line to radiate noise that might affect data service on other lines in the same bundle. Hence, these line conditions are ranked with respect to how severely they expose the line or other lines to excessive noise. Again, service provider and line condition specific thresholds are applied to these severity factors to rank line radiation as Not Radiating, Severe, Moderate, Suspect, or Indeterminate.","The service provider typically establishes the thresholds for each service profile that help determine the acceptable margins for upstream and downstream data rates relative to the minimum promised data rates for each named profile in each named DSLAM as well as establish noise susceptibility and radiation impact thresholds for each line condition.","Once the appropriate fault rankings are established, the disclosed test and analysis method evaluates the impacts, the possible service level agreement or agreements that apply to the subscriber, and the results of external data-source interchanges. The result of this impact analysis is to identify the most impacting line condition, the impact of that condition with respect to appropriate service level agreements, and the jurisdiction of that line condition. Preferably, the impact analysis includes an assignment of the DSL service into one of the following categories: (1) ok service; (2) degraded service; (3) no service; (4) intermittent service; (5) suspect service; or (6) indeterminate. Each of these bins can be associated with a particular color such as green for \u2018ok service\u2019, red for \u2018no service\u2019, orange for \u2018degraded service\u2019, yellow for \u2018suspect service\u2019, blue for \u2018intermittent service\u2019, gray for \u2018indeterminate\u2019, or other colors as may be appropriate. These assessments are with respect to each possible service level agreement or agreements to which the subscriber may be associated.","Jurisdictional & Dispatch Analysis","The jurisdictional and dispatch analysis phase performs jurisdiction analysis necessary to develop repair location, fault statement, affecting condition, and other fault summary information. The following data analyses are performed within this ninth phase: (a) If Capacitive Imbalance Fault Rank is major or the Capacitive Imbalance Data Rate Fault Rank is \u2018Minor\u2019 then create a DSL Service Problem Report; (b) If Resistive Imbalance Fault Rank is \u2018Major\u2019 or Resistive Imbalance Data Rate Fault Rank is \u2018Minor\u2019 then create a DSL Service Problem Report; (c) If Resistance Fault Rank is \u2018Major\u2019 or Resistance Data Rate Fault Rank is \u2018Minor\u2019 then create DSL Service Problem Report; (d) Modify the Capacitive Imbalance Data Rate Fault Rank based on problem severity and problem duration; (e) Modify the Resistive Imbalance Data Rate Fault Rank based on problem severity and problem duration; (f) Modify the Resistance Data Rate Fault Rank based on problem severity and problem duration; (g) Determine the most unfavorable or worst Data Rate Fault Rank from the respective upstream and downstream Fault Ranks; (h) Record the Capacitive Imbalance Problem {\u2018Major\u2019, \u2018Minor\u2019, \u2018Suspect\u2019, or \u2018Indeterminate\u2019}; (i) Records the Resistive Imbalance Problem {\u2018Major\u2019, \u2018Minor\u2019, \u2018Suspect\u2019, or \u2018Indeterminate\u2019}; (j) Record the Resistance Problem {\u2018Major\u2019, \u2018Minor\u2019, \u2018Suspect\u2019, or \u2018Indeterminate\u2019}; (k) Upgrade the Resistive Imbalance Problem, if appropriate, based on line stability analysis; and (l) Identify the most appropriate Dispatch Condition. As seen in , these steps are broadly characterized as initiation (Block ) followed by idnetifying cable problems and associated fault rankings (Block ) and upgrading the fault rankings (Block ).","The jurisdictional and dispatch analysis phase also runs through a prescribed sequence of fault queries and fault identifications set out generally in . Broadly speaking, these steps include: Hazardous AC Volt Condition (Blocks  and ); Hazardous Volt DC condition (Blocks  and ); CO\/RT Splitter detection or other filter detection (Blocks  and ); Premises Continuity assessment (Blocks  and ); Major Capacitive Imbalance Problem query (Blocks  and ); Major Resistive Imbalance query (Blocks  and ); Major Resistance Problem query (Blocks  and ); Minor Imbalance queries including capacitive, resistive and resistance problems (Blocks  and ); Noise Problem queries, including noise susceptability and noise radiation (Blocks  and ); and finally a suspected imbalance query (Blocks  and ). If after progressing through these multiple queries, the analysis will either Stop (Block ) as a result of a fualt or suspected fault being identified or will result in a Line Tested OK status (Block ) after which the analysis will Stop (Block )","Results Archiving","Determine whether the measurement data and results of the present analysis should be added to the results of previous analysis. In many applications of a DSL Test System, only a finite volume of data and analysis results for each tested line can be saved. The decision of introducing and storing a new test record may require that an existing test record be purged from persistent storage. The following steps are performed within this eleventh phase: (a) Evaluate the current test results to determine whether to archive the most recent data and analysis results; and (b) Delete one or more archived records of prior data and analysis results.","Results Presentation","The purpose of this final phase of the test and analysis methodology is to produce summary information of the performed DSL assessments in a format appropriate to a specific type of client, for example, a graphical user interface client or a web-services client.
