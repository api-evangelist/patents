title: Visualization of time-variant data
abstract: A method to display time-variant information that includes displaying, for example, on a computer-generated user interface, a common baseline value indication (or representation) for multiple data items. The common baseline value indication represents respective baseline values for each of the multiple data items (e.g., stocks) at a first instance in time. The method includes displaying deviation indicators (or representations), relative to the common baseline value indication, for each of the multiple data items. The multiple deviation indicators represent respective deviation values, relative to respective base values, for each of the multiple data items at a second time instance. Each of the deviation indicators may further visually identify a respective deviation value as being positive or negative, relative to a related base value.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the software and data as described below and in the drawings that form a part of this document: Copyright 2008, Adobe Systems Inc., All Rights Reserved.","Example embodiments relate generally to the technical field of data processing, and, more specifically, to the presentation of data.","The display of data in a meaningful and easily interpretable way to users presents a number of technical challenges, particularly to interface designers. The Information Age is making increasing demands on users quickly to receive, process, interpret and act on ever more volumes of data, both in the performance of job functions and other day to day activities. In particular, the presentation of complex information in a manner that is readily discernible and easily interpretable presents technical challenges to interface designers.","Another challenge facing interface designers is the increased adoption of mobile computing devices, such as mobile telephones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Such mobile devices typically have small screens and are used in a wide variety of lighting conditions. Usage patterns for such mobile devices may differ greatly from the desktop experience. Further, users of mobile computing devices tend to be task-oriented and may have less time to view and interpret data. Considering, for example, traditional financial data visualizations, such visualizations tend to be large scale and require significant time on the part of users to interpret the data, and draw conclusions therefrom.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of some example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.","Example embodiments provide methods and systems to generate, render and\/or display a user interface that presents time-variant information. The example methods and systems seek to present the time-variant information in a manner that seeks to increase understanding of information at a glance, and may use color hinting, radial deviation and area usage to these ends. Example embodiments may, for example, seek to address shortfalls in the mobile data consumption experience by rendering data in a space-efficient manner, using color and by conveying key points of information (e.g., financial information) to a user within constrained area size and radial dimensions.","According to an example embodiment, there is provided a method to display time-variant information that includes displaying, for example, on a computer-generated user interface, a common baseline value indication (or representation) for multiple data items. The common baseline value indication represents respective baseline values for each of the multiple data items (e.g., stocks) at a first instance in time. The method includes displaying deviation indicators (or representations), relative to the common baseline value indication, for each of the multiple data items. The multiple deviation indicators represent respective deviation values, relative to respective base values, for each of the multiple data items at a second time instance. Each of the deviation indicators may further visually identify a respective deviation value as being positive or negative, relative to a related base value.","In one embodiment, the baseline value indication and the deviation indicators are displayed within the context of a segmented graph. Each deviation indicator may be displayed within a dedicated segment of the segmented graph, and the common baseline value indication may be displayed as a baseline reference within each of the segments of the segmented graph.","The sizing of the segments of the segmented graph may be varied according to respective quantity values for data items attributed to these various segments. For example, where a first segment of the segmented graph is dedicated to a particular stock, as an example of a data item, the sizing of segment may be proportional to a number of stock holdings (within a portfolio) for that particular stock.","Within a particular segment of a segmented graph, multiple deviation indicators may be displayed for a particular data item. Each of the deviation indicators may represent a respective deviation value, relative to a particular base value, at a different determinable time or over a different and determinable time interval. For example, where a segment is dedicated to a particular stock, each of the multiple deviation indicators may represent a percentage increase or decrease in the stock for each of multiple days, weeks, and months, relative to a base value, for such a period of time.","In one example embodiment, the segmented graph may be a bar graph. In another example embodiment, the segmented graph may be a polar area graph. In the example embodiment in which the segmented graph is a polar area graph, a number of radial extending dividers may define the segments of the graph, each of the segments being dedicated to a specific data item (e.g., a stock). As noted above, the sizes of the segments may be varied according to a quantity of data items (e.g., a quantity of stock) held in a particular portfolio. The common baseline value indication may be displayed as a baseline circle defined at a radius from a center point of the polar area graph, the baseline circle accordingly extending across each of the segments of the polar area graph.","The displaying of the deviation indicators may include displaying respective indicium or markers (e.g., a circle segment) within each of the graph segments at respective distances (e.g., a radius) from the center point of the polar area graph. The radii of the circle segments displayed may be calculated based on respective deviation values.","The deviation indicators may, in this embodiment, comprise a visual characterization of an area of a dedicated segment (e.g., a coloring of the area of the segment) of a graph. The display of the deviation indicators within the context of a polar area graph may also include visually characterizing (e.g., coloring or otherwise visually distinguishing) a segment area of the polar graph dedicated to a particular data item between the baseline circle and a circle segment of a particular graph segment. The visual characterization indicates an associated deviation value as being either positive or negative relative to a base value.","In various embodiments, the visual identification (or representation) of a deviation value being at least a positive or negative may include displaying a deviation indicator as extending in either a first direction or a second direction from the common baseline value indication.","Example embodiments may also include scaling the display of a segmented graph, as well as deviation indicators displayed within the context of the segmented graph, relative to the common baseline value indication. This scaling may be based upon a determined maximum peak-to-peak deviation between deviation values for multiple data items (e.g., stocks).","In one example embodiment, deviation values may be subject to determination as to whether they transgress a predetermined threshold (e.g., constitute \u201cBlack Swan\u201d deviations), and may be selectively excluded from a determination of the maximum peak-to-peak deviation. Further, if a particular deviation value is found to transgress a predetermined threshold, a dedicated and specific transgression indicator may be displayed instead of displaying a deviation indication. In an example embodiment, the deviation values represented by the deviation indications may be percentile deviations relative to respective base values for each of the multiple data items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","104","109","106","104","110","102","106","102","111","112","114"]},"The data capture module , together with the visualization application  and the data store , is communicatively coupled to the data interface , and may receive data (e.g., real time data) from the data interface  and process such real time data to generate and write time-variant data to the data store . For example, the data capture module  may capture periodic stock price values for a portfolio of stocks and store such information as time-variant data within the data store .","While the display component  is shown in  to comprise part of the computer system , it will be appreciated that, in other embodiments, the visualization application  may generate or render user interfaces (e.g., markup language documents such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages). The user interfaces may be communicated, via the data interface  and network , to a remote device such as a mobile telephone , a PDA  or a remote computer system  for display.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","104"]},"The visualization application  includes a graph module , a baseline module , a deviation module  and a threshold module , all of which may be communicatively coupled. The graph module , as will be described in further detail herein, is operative to generate (e.g., render) a display of a graph structure (e.g., a segmented graph), including axes and value data for such a graph structure. The graph module  may include the ability to generate and display polar area graphs  and bar graphs , in addition to numerous other types of graphs that are well-known in the art.","The baseline module  is responsible for the generation (e.g., rendering) of a common baseline value indication or representation for multiple data items within the context of a graph generated by the graph module . Similarly, the deviation module  is responsible for displaying deviation indications or representations for each of multiple data items, with these deviation indications being displayed relative to a baseline value indication. The deviation module  includes scaling functionality  in order to scale deviation indications within the context of a graph generated by the graph module . The graph module  may similarly include scaling functionality (not shown) in order to the scale the generation of a graph structure to be displayed.","The threshold module  operates in conjunction with the deviation module  to determine whether a deviation value exceeds a determinable threshold (e.g., constitutes a \u201cBlack Swan\u201d event). The threshold module  may accordingly operate to generate and cause display of a transgression indicator, within a segment of a graph, in place of a deviation indication generated by the deviation module . The threshold module  then also operate with the scaling functionality  of the deviation module  and the graph module  in order to selectively exclude deviation values from a scaling operation (e.g., that includes determining maximum peak-to-peak deviations) that is performed by the scaling functionality .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304","306","302","110","310","312","308","110","304","306","310","312","108","106"]},"The visualization application  may use the various data values to derive and display comparative data information. For example, the visualization application  may use data values  and  to generate comparative (e.g., deviation) data particular to the first data item . Further, the visualization application  may also derive comparative information relevant to the comparison of the data item  and the data item  from combinations of the data items , , , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","102"]},"The method  commences at operation , and at operation , time-variant data is retrieved by the visualization application  from a data source. For example, the visualization application  may retrieve time-variant data, via the data interface , from the data store , from a remote data store  by the network , or directly from a real time remote data feed . In one example embodiment, the time-variant data retrieved from the data store  is initially captured, processed and written to the data store  by the data capture module , prior to the retrieval operation  by the visualization application . While the time-variant data may relate to any number of different types of data items, the example embodiment as described below will be discussed in the context of time-variant data relating to stocks, with a portfolio of stocks providing an example of multiple data items. Accordingly, in the example embodiment, the retrieval of the time-variant data from multiple data items may include the retrieval, from the data store , of stock prices for multiple stocks captured at multiple points in time.","At operation , the baseline module  determines a base value for each of the multiple stocks. The base value may, in an example embodiment, be selected at the closing price of the stock at a determinable time instance (e.g., at closing of a particular stock exchange on a previous day). However, in other embodiments, the base value may be calculated based on the time-variant data retrieved at operation . For example, the base value may be the average price of a particular stock over a determinable time period (e.g., the average price, high price, or low price of a particular stock over the past week, set month, year or some other time period).","At operation , the deviation module  may then determine a deviation value (e.g., as a percentile or relative value change) for each of the stocks, again based on the time-variant data. A deviation value may, in one example embodiment, be calculated as the percentile change from the base value relative to a stock price value at some other determinable time (e.g., a current time, or some other identified past time). For example, where the base value for a stock is selected as being the closing price of the previous day, the deviation value may be calculated by determining a current stock price, and calculating the deviation value as the percentage change between the current price and the closing price on the previous day. In other embodiments, the deviation value may again involve a calculation of a second value to be compared to the base value. This second value may be calculated as the average price, high price, or a low price over another period of time. In one example, the base value may be the average price of the stock in one year, and the deviation value may be generated using the average price for the stock over another year as the second value. In any event, it will be appreciated that in order to generate a deviation value, a base value and a comparison value for each of multiple data items (e.g., stocks) are determined, and are then used to calculate a relative change or deviation value representing a deviation between the base value and the comparison value. A wide variety of values may be determined and\/or calculated as either the base value or the comparison value.","At operation , the graph module  then proceeds to generate a display of a segmented graph that includes dividers defining multiple graph segments. Each graph segment is dedicated to a specific data item of the multiple data items (e.g., to a specific stock of a portfolio of stocks). As mentioned, the graph module  may be capable of generating any one of a number of graph types, such as polar area graph or a bar graph using the polar graph functionality  or the bar graph functionality , respectively. Examples of each of these graphs are discussed elsewhere herein with reference to subsequent user interface diagrams.","At operation , the baseline module  generates a display of a common baseline value indication, representative of the base values of the multiple data items. The common baseline value indication is displayed, within the context of the segmented graph, so as to provide a common base reference across each of the segments. Where the segmented graph is a bar graph, the common baseline value indication may be a simple straight line which traverses the segments, parallel to one of the axis of the bar chart. Where the segmented graph is a polar area graph, the baseline value indication may comprise a circle at a predetermined radius from the center of the polar graph.","At operation , the deviation module  may generate a display of deviation indications, representative of the deviation values calculated at operation , for each of the multiple data items. The deviation indications are displayed within the context of the segmented graph, and relative to the common baseline indication, so as to provide a visual depiction of the deviation value. The display of the deviation indication for each data item may include scaling the display of the various deviation indications to provide a meaningful display. The display of the deviation indications may also include visually characterizing and enhancing the deviation indications so as to provide additional information regarding the deviations and so as to enable a user to assess a meaning and nature of the deviation at a glance. The method  then terminates at operation .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["410","414","400","502","504","206","506","208","208","208"]},"At operation , the threshold module  may operate with the deviation module  to substitute or replace the display of a deviation indication, within a segment for the relevant data item, with a transgression indication for transgressing deviation values. In the above example, within a segment of the segmented graph generated by the graph module , a transgression indication may be provided as opposed to a deviation indication, which will be displayed for the \u201cWhite Swan\u201d deviation values (i.e., deviation values that do not transgress the determinable threshold).","At operation , the deviation module , using the remaining \u201cWhite Swan\u201d deviation values, determines a scaling for the display of the deviation indicators. The scaling of the display for the deviation indicators may include determining a peak-to-peak deviation between the multiple deviation values for the portfolio of stocks. Again, given the above example, the Bloomberg stock is excluded from the peak-to-peak determination, and a maximum peak-to-peak deviation is observed to exist between the ADBE stock and the MS stock (e.g., a 25% peak-to-peak deviation). This calculated maximum peak-to-peak deviation may be used to scale the display of the deviation indications within the context of the segmented graph so as to allow for maximum utilization of the graph area. The calculation of the maximum peak-to-peak deviation across the data items may also be used by the baseline module  to determine placement of the baseline value indication within the context of the segmented graph. Again, considering the example where there is a 25% peak-to-peak maximum deviation, the baseline value indication may be positioned so as to accommodate display of the \u221210% deviation indication for the MS stock, and also to accommodate the +15% deviation indication for the ADBE stock.","The scaling for the display of the deviation indications at operation  accordingly takes into account that a 25% \u201cspread\u201d needs to be displayed to accommodate the maximum and minimum deviation values, and the scaling for both the graph and the deviation indications may be calculated accordingly.","At operation , the deviation module  proceeds to generate displays of deviation indications for each of the multiple data items positioned relative to, or extending from, the baseline indicator within the context of the segmented graph. The deviation indicators are positioned relative to, or shown to extend from, the baseline indicator at a location or in a direction reflecting either a positive or negative value relative to the baseline value.","At operation , the deviation indicators may be visually characterized (e.g., colored) to enhance the communication of a positive or negative value of the deviation value relative to baseline value. The operations then terminate at operation .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602"]},"At operation , the time-variant dataset is transformed into a dataset of relative changes. For example, the deviation module  may apply an equation to produce a set of percentile changes based on the collected time-variant dataset.","At operation , the threshold module  may identify significant outliers from the relative change dataset. As described above, this may involve determining whether any values within the relative change dataset exceed either positive or negative thresholds. Accordingly, the threshold module  may, at operation , generate two sets of relative change values, namely a first set of \u201coutlier\u201d deviation values and a second set of \u201cnormal\u201d deviation values.","At operation , the deviation module  may generate a display of a transgression indication for each of the deviation values in the outlier dataset. In one example embodiment, the negative outliers may be rendered, within the context of the segmented graph and within a segment for the relevant stock, as solid blocks of red that extend from the baseline to a center point of the polar area graph. Positive outliers, on the other hand, may be rendered as blinking solid blocks of green that extend from the baseline to an outer circle of the polar area graph.","At operation , for the \u201cnormal\u201d dataset of relative change values, the scaling function  of the deviation module  determines a maximum peak-to-peak deviation amongst the data items of the \u201cnormal dataset.\u201d The display of the graph, baseline and deviation indications may then be scaled or otherwise adjusted by the deviation module  based on this maximum peak-to-peak deviation, as described above, for aesthetic purposes.","At operation , the deviation module  may, for each of the relative change values within the \u201cnormal\u201d set of relative change values, determine a radius, as a proportion of the radius of the diagram, at which to display a circle segment (or other marker) within an appropriate segment. Further, at operation , the deviation module  may render the deviation indications within the segments. For example, if the relative change value is negative, then the deviation module  may render a circle segment, within the appropriate graph segment, towards the center of the polar area graph, relative to the baseline, and may render the area within the segment between the baseline and the circle segment in red, with red being indicative of the negative value. On the other hand, if the relative change value is positive, the deviation module  renders a circle segment (or other marker) between the baseline indication and an outer circle of the polar area graph, and renders a segment area between the baseline and the circle segment in green, with green being indicative of a positive deviation value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","200","700"]},"Each of the segments of the polar area graph is furthermore shown to include a marker in the form of a circle segment indicating the value of the relevant stock at a further time instance (e.g., a current time). The area between the baseline and the circle segment within each graph segment may be visually characterized (e.g., colored) to denote either a relative increase in a value for the stock or a relative decrease in the value of the stock. For example, for the ADBE stock, the area between the dotted baseline and the circle segment is colored green to denote a relative increase in the value of the stock. On the other hand, the area between the dotted baseline and a circle segment in the MS segment is colored red to denote a decrease in the value for the stock.","It should be noted that for the radial summation view shown in the radial summation view interface , the deviation scale for all stocks is equivalent, but the peak-to-peak scale (e.g., for example, \u22125% to +5% or \u221210% to +10%) is derived from the maximum peak-to-peak deviations (barring \u201cBlack Swan\u201d deviations) of the represented portfolio. A Black Swan may be an eccentric change outside a predetermined threshold (e.g., +\u221210% of a market trend). In an example embodiment, a positive Black Swan may be represented by an entire slice or segment of a polar area graph being colored green and shown to be blinking, while a negative Black Swan may be represented by entire slice being colored red and also blinking.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","800","202","206"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 6"],"b":["900","606","612"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIGS. 11-16","b":["1100","1600"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 18"],"b":["1700","1800","1800"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIGS. 19-24","b":["1900","2400"]},"Modules, Components and Logic","Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components, modules, or mechanisms. A component is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more components of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a component that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a component may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a component may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor) to perform certain operations. A component may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a component mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201ccomponent\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and\/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which components are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the components need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the components comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different components at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular component at one instance of time and to constitute a different component at a different instance of time.","Components can provide information to, and receive information from, other components. Accordingly, the described components may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiples of such components exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the components. In embodiments in which multiple components are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such components may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple components have access. For example, one component may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further component may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Components may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","Electronic Apparatus and System","Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations thereof. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product, e.g., a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers.","A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.","In example embodiments, operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by, and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry (e.g., a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)).","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system, it will be appreciated that that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. Specifically, it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware (e.g., an ASIC), in temporarily configured hardware (e.g., a combination of software and a programmable processor), or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice.

Under this paradigm, various parts of computer code (or software) that instantiate or configure components or modules may be categorized as belonging to one or more of these three tiers. Some embodiments may include a first tier as an interface (e.g., an interface tier). Further, a second tier may be a logic (or application) tier that performs application processing of data inputted through the interface level. The logic tier may communicate the results of such processing to the interface tier and\/or to a backend, or storage tier. The processing performed by the logic tier may relate to certain rules or processes that govern the software as a whole. A third, storage tier, may be a persistent storage medium, or a non-persistent storage medium. In some cases, one or more of these tiers may be collapsed into another, resulting in a two-tier architecture, or even a one-tier architecture. For example, the interface and logic tiers may be consolidated, or the logic and storage tiers may be consolidated, as in the case of a software application with an embedded database. The three-tier architecture may be implemented using one technology or a variety of technologies. The example three-tier architecture, and the technologies through which it is implemented, may be realized on one or more computer systems operating, for example, as a standalone system, or organized in a server-client, peer-to-peer, distributed or some other suitable configuration. Further, these three tiers may be distributed between more than one computer system as various components.","Components","Example embodiments may include the above described tiers, and processes or operations about constituting these tiers may be implemented as components. Common to many of these components is the ability to generate, use, and manipulate data. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may form part of standalone, client, server, or peer computer systems. The various components may be implemented by a computer system on an as-needed basis. These components may include software written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using Flash Lite, Flash, AIR, FLEX, Python, a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Java Enterprise Beans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), or other suitable technique.","Software for these components may further enable communicative coupling to other components (e.g., via various Application Programming interfaces (APIs)), and may be compiled into one complete server, client, and\/or peer software application. Further, these APIs may be able to communicate through various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Distributed Computing Components and Protocols","Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above described components across a distributed programming environment as distributed computing components. For example, an interface component (e.g., an interface tier) may form part of a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing a logic component (e.g., a logic tier). These first and second computer systems may be configured in a standalone, server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other suitable configuration. Software for the components may be written using the above described object-oriented programming techniques, and can be written in the same programming language, or a different programming language. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various components to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, a component written in Flash may be able to communicate with another component written in the Python programming language through using a RESTful, XML-RPC, a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), or some other suitable protocol. Some embodiments may include the use of one or more of these protocols with the various protocols outlined in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, or Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data","A System of Transmission Between a Server and Client","Example embodiments may use the OSI model or TCP\/IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client, or between peer computer systems, may, for example, include five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software, for instantiating or configuring components, having a three tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP\/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP\/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also contains port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer, and the data transmitted over a network such as an internet, LAN, WAN, or some other suitable network. In some cases, internet refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP\/IP, and additionally ATM, SNA, SDI, or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology) or structures.","Although an embodiment has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention.
