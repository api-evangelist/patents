Field","Embodiments relate to rate adaptive allocation of resources for delivering content over a wireless link.","2. Related Art","Stable transmission channels are required for delivery of many real-time services over wireless packet networks. These channels typically have requirements that stipulate delay, packet loss and throughput requirements. Known standards bodies (e.g., 3GPP and 3GPP2) have recognized this and provide in their respective standards mechanisms for establishing and maintaining Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) bearers. The logic applied to these bearers is that an optimum GBR value can be ascertained a-priori, and then used to provide a real-time service at a known quality level.","GBR has almost never been deployed by wireless service providers, largely because GBR bearers can require significant network resources when subscribers are in poor RF conditions. In addition, while the resources needed to maintain a GBR bearer may be acceptable when the network is lightly loaded, allocating significant network resources becomes increasingly less acceptable as the network congestion level increases.","Meanwhile in this environment, adaptive techniques for delivering content to and receiving content from mobile devices are becoming the norm in wireless communications. Examples include transmission of video via HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS), and voice communication via adaptive codecs such as the AMR codec used in 3GPP technologies (GSM, UMTS\/HSPA, LTE). What all these techniques have in common is the ability to adapt the rate at which content is delivered to the bandwidth available on the delivery channel. The techniques provide a local optimization, with each client\/server pair independently sensing the available bandwidth and adapting accordingly. However even with this ability to adapt, the quality of service delivery in wireless environments is compromised without some degree of channel stability","In adaptive streaming techniques a server provides clients with a table of URLs. Every URL points to a specific time interval of a specific quality of the same content. All intelligence is implemented in the client, the server can be any HTTP-compliant device serving regular files. Once the client has downloaded the table of URLs, the client selects the appropriate URL to fetch next. The client performs playback of the content. Typically, the client will initiate playback by selecting the smallest content chunk from those available (e.g., the chunk with the lowest available quality). This will give the fastest start-up time. The Client adjusts available quality within, for example, the network bandwidth.","The content (e.g., media file) is created in multiple qualities by, for example the server. The content is also cut into time intervals synchronously across the different qualities. Typically, every individual chunk is individually addressable by the client.","HAS is emerging as a popular approach to streaming video on demand and real-time content. HAS is adaptive in the sense that the quality of the video can be adjusted based on the bandwidth or data rate available between the server and the client. However, each client individually adapts its video quality independent of other video users sharing the same resources.","Currently there is a mismatch between the capabilities of currently used adaptive delivery protocols and standardized mechanisms to establish stable, GBR channels in wireless environments. The below example embodiments address this problem, and provide a mechanism to ensure that the resource consumed to maintain the stable channels adapts to the degree of congestion in the wireless network.","In conventional systems, the wireless network is modeled as a wireline network and issues such as channel fading, user mobility, throughput discontinuities at handoff, and Limited, shared resources are ignored. Content is delivered via adaptive techniques using best effort, bearers with each client server pair independently sensing the available bandwidth and acting accordingly. This is the typical approach today with adaptive algorithms. This approach is inadequate because variation of content delivery rate due to these issues degrades the quality of experience of the subscriber as is determined for example via Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). Because each client\/server pair acts independently to maximize throughput, this approach provides for sub-optimized quality of experience. For example subscribers at the cell edge receiving such a low bit rate that the QoE is unacceptable, while subscribers near the cell antenna have bit rates that far exceed what is really necessary for a particular application.","In conventional systems, GBR bearers are established where the guaranteed bit rate value is determined a-priori. This negates the advantages of having algorithms such as HAS that can adapt to variations in available throughput. Left unconstrained this technique uses excessive amounts of air-interface resources, to the point where this technique is almost never used by wireless service providers. Further, signaling mechanisms for various aspects of the video stream, such as the device screen size, that may be utilized to optimize the resource allocation to the base station have yet to be determined.","In conventional systems typically deployed today, HAS streaming over mobile wireless is based on a best effort allocation of resources. The base station typically employs a proportional fair scheduler that is unaware of the HAS flow and treats HAS and other flows the same. Additionally a guaranteed bit rate (GBR) can be set and throughput for a particular flow can be guaranteed. A guaranteed bit rate (GBR) set equal to the fixed source codec rate of traditional streaming (RTP\/UDP or HTTP\/TCP progressive download) is known to improve QoE through steady offered rate as channel and load vary.","Example embodiments provide a method and system to allocate resources in an eNodeB for adaptive bit rate application protocols such as HAS and AMR.","One embodiment includes a method for serving content. The method includes receiving a first message from a mobile unit, the message including a request for content and an indication to use an adaptive guaranteed bitrate (AGBR) bearer to transmit the content to the mobile unit. A server generates a second message based on the first message, the second message including device information associated with the mobile unit and information associated with the AGBR. The server generates the requested content such that the content is configured to be transmitted over an AGBR bearer. The server sends the requested content to a first network entity and sends the second message to a second network entity.","Another embodiment includes a method for indicating an adaptive guaranteed bitrate (AGBR) bearer. The method includes receiving, by a first network entity, a first message from a second network entity, the first message including an application identifier and a guaranteed bitrate (GBR) request indication. The first network entity retrieves subscriber and device information based on the application identifier and the GBR request indication. The first network entity sends a second message to a third network entity, the second message including a Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI), the QCI indicating an AGBR bearer is to be used for delivering content to a mobile unit.","Still another embodiment includes a method for generating an adaptive guaranteed bitrate (AGBR) bearer. The method includes receiving a first message from a first network entity, the message including a Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI), the QCI indicates to use an AGBR bearer for delivering content to a mobile unit and generating an AGBR bearer based on the QCI and a default guaranteed bitrate (GBR) setting.","Still another embodiment includes a method to communicate with a mobile unit over a wireless interface. The method includes receiving a message including a Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI), the QCI indicating an AGBR bearer is to be used for delivering content to a mobile unit, receiving content configured to be transmitted over an AGBR bearer, scheduling the mobile unit on the AGBR bearer based on the QCI and communicating the content to the mobile unit based on the schedule.","Still another embodiment includes a method for delivering content. The method includes receiving a first message including a request for content from a mobile unit, generating a second message based on the first message, the second message including an application identifier and a guaranteed bitrate (GBR) request indication and generating the requested content such that the content is configured to be transmitted over an adaptive guaranteed bitrate (AGBR). The method includes sending the requested content to a first network entity and sending the second message to a second network entity.","The method includes retrieving subscriber and device information based on the application identifier and the GBR request indication, sending a third message to the first network entity, the third message including a Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI), the QCI indicating an AGBR bearer is to be used for delivering the content to the mobile unit, generating an AGBR bearer based on the QCI and a GBR setting and associating the content with the AGBR bearer. The method includes sending a fourth message and the content to a fourth network entity, the fourth message including the QCI, scheduling the mobile unit on the AGBR bearer based on the QCI and communicating the content to the mobile unit based on the schedule.","It should be noted that these Figures are intended to illustrate the general characteristics of methods, structure and\/or materials utilized in certain example embodiments and to supplement the written description provided below.

An algorithm, as the term is used here, and as it is used generally, is conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of optical, electrical, or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated.

The example embodiments not limited by these aspects of any given implementation.","Example embodiments provide a method and system to allocate resources in an eNodeB for adaptive bit rate application protocols such as HAS and AMR. Example embodiments provide for controlled variation of bandwidth allocation to services rather than leaving the bandwidth allocation fixed (as the case with GBR bearers), or at the mercy of channel capacity fluctuations typical of wireless environments when best effort wireless service is provided.","Example embodiments function, for example, within the context of GBR bearer setup mechanisms standardized by standards bodies (e.g., 3GPP\/3GPP2). However the GBR value requested is treated as a target for the type of service, device type and screen type rather than as a fixed value. The actual provided GBR value is controlled dynamically in a systematic manner according to congestion level in an eNodeB. The control allows for optimization and\/or improvement of the subscriber Quality of experience (QoE) across a geographic cell taking into account the individual requirements of applications.","Example embodiments are equally applicable to uplink and downlink. For example, during the downlink an eNodeB directly allocates bearer resources. During the uplink the eNodeB signals to a mobile unit the resources the mobile unit is allowed to consume.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","105","110","115","120","125","130","135","140"]},"Geographic cell  may be a geographic area including one or more mobile units  communicating with one or more eNodeB's  over a wireless communication channel. Geographic cells (e.g., geographic cell ) are known to those skilled in the art and will not be described further for the sake of brevity.","A mobile unit  communicates with one or more eNodeB's  over a wireless communication channel using one or more known communication standards. Mobile unit  may run one or more applications. The one or more applications may request content be delivered using one or more streaming standards. The one or more streaming standards may include one or more adaptive streaming standards. The requested content may be communicated to the mobile unit  from the HAS server  via the PGW\/SGW  and the eNodeB . According to at least one example embodiment, the PGW\/SGW  may communicate with the mobile unit  via the eNodeB  using the AGBR Bearer .","The HAS server  (or Content Delivery Network (CDN)) delivers video content. HAS server  adapts the rate at which video is delivered according to, for example, a bandwidth between the HAS server  and a device client (e.g., mobile unit ). The HAS server  may obtain device specific information such as the screen size from a subscriber and a device data base the HAS server  maintains, or in some cases from the client on the device at the time the client requests the content. Other information such as the video complexity or intensity as well as the bit rates associated with the different quality levels of a HAS video may be part of the meta-data of the video that the HAS server  stores. This information if available may be conveyed to other network entities\/elements.","The HAS server  may use an application programming interface (API) to an Open API Platform (OAP). The OAP provides secure exposure of network capabilities to application and protocol translation, for example from a proprietary application to a standards protocol. Alternatively a known 3GPP Rx interface from the HAS server  to the PCRF  may be used. In either case, the use of specific Application Function Identifiers (AF-Id) on these interfaces is used to indicate a request for an AGBR bearer, and the GBR value specified in the request is a requested target GBR value. If the bit rates of a particular HAS video are known by the HAS server , then those values may be passed in addition to or instead of a target GBR value.","A HSS\/SPR  stores device and subscriber information. The HSS\/SPR subscriber information is used to adjust the requested target GBR value according to the subscriber's level of service, device type as indicated by the International Equipment Identity (IMEI) or International Equipment Identity & Software Version (IMEISV) and other stored subscriber specific information. For example, IMEISV scaling allows for different target GBRs for devices with different screen sizes.","A PCRF  may map the AF-Id to a special QoS class identifier (QCI) value and applies the scaling of the requested target GBR value according to HSS\/SPR information. A core network entity (e.g., PGW\/SGW ) may set-up a GBR in response to an indication from the PCRF . The eNodeB , in response to setup of a QCI=10 bearer, will use the GBR value as a target and adjust the actual provided bandwidth according to total available resources allocated to the service or available on the cell. If the HAS video bit rates are available, then an AGBR algorithm can adapt the GBR and maximum bitrate (MBR) values so that they closely match the rate of one of the available quality levels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"205"},"The network entity may be an application server, a content delivery server or a plurality of servers (e.g., a content delivery network) configured to store and or deliver content. The network entity may be configured to format the content using one or more of the known adaptive streaming standards. The network entity may be a HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) server (e.g., HAS server ). The request may include information associated with an application and device information associated with the mobile unit.","In step S the network entity may determine if the request for content indicates or warrants an adaptive guaranteed bit rate (AGBR). If the request for content does not indicate or warrant an AGBR, some other conventional processing is performed. Otherwise, processing continues to step S. For example, the request may be in the form of a signaling message. The signaling message may include a value in a field that indicates to use an AGBR to deliver the content. For example, the request may be for a segment of a larger content form (e.g., a segment of video) and previous segments were formatted as AGBR content.","For example, the request may be associated with an application that is configured to communicate using an AGBR. In other words, the mobile unit (e.g., mobile unit ) may be running an application that has requested the content. The network entity (e.g., HAS server ) may associate the application with an adaptive streaming standard (e.g., using a look-up table). Determining an AGBR bearer may be used to transmit the content to the mobile unit based on a Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI) associated with the message. The QCI may be the indication to use an AGBR bearer, and a value of the QCI may be undefined in a communications standard.","In step S the network entity may determine device specific and other information associated with the request for content. For example, the network entity may determine a type of device (e.g., cell phone, PDA or tablet), a model of the device (e.g., a model number), a display screen size and\/or a display screen capability. For example, the network entity may determine an application running on the device, a type of service running on the device, max\/min\/average data rates over a period of time for the device.","The signaling message may include the device specific and other information. For example, the signaling message may include a field including the device specific and other information. The device may be, for example, mobile unit . The device specific and other information may be retrieved from a network device. The signaling message may include at least one of an application ID and a device ID used to determine at least one of the information associated with an application and the device information associated with the mobile unit","In step S the network entity may generate an application trigger including a request for an adaptive guaranteed bit rate (AGBR) bearer. The application trigger may be a signaling message. For example, the trigger may be a signaling message that is a quality of service (QoS) application programming interface (API) to another network entity. As is known, an API is a mechanism for communicating between devices. An API may be used to request resources. According to example embodiments, the API may be used to request an AGBR for the delivery of the content.","The application trigger may include the device information and\/or identification of the application (e.g., an AppID) and\/or device (e.g., a DevID) and\/or subscription information so that additional information may be looked up. The application trigger may include a manifest file. Manifest files are known to those skilled in the art. The manifest file may include data rate information (e.g., data rates associated with delivery of content to mobile user ). The application trigger may include an association between the device and the content. (e.g., mobile user  may be mapped to the request for content). The application trigger may include an association between a previously established AGBR bearer, an identification of the application (e.g., an AppID) and\/or device (e.g., a DevID).","In step S the network entity may send the application trigger to a first different network entity. For example, the application trigger may be sent in or as a message to the another network entity. The another network entity may be, for example, a server including a Policy Charging and Rules Function (PCRF), e.g., PCRF . The message may include a resource identifier. The resource identifier may be a Universal Resource Locator (URL). The message may include an application identifier and a guaranteed bitrate (GBR) request indication, and the application identifier may trigger a subscriber lookup based on the GBR request, the information associated with the AGBR and the device information. The message may include device dependent bitrate information, and the device dependent bitrate information may be mapped to the information associated with the AGBR.","In step S the network entity may generate the content. The content may be configured to be transmitted over an AGBR bearer. For example, the network entity may generate the content using any known HAS standard. As discussed above, the network entity may be a HAS server (e.g., HAS server ) configured to generate HAS content using one or more known HAS standards. In step S the network entity may forward the content to a second different network entity. For example, the content may be forwarded to a Packet Data Network Gateway\/Serving Gateway (PGW\/SGW), e.g., PGW\/SGW .","Generating the requested content may include generating a plurality of content segments based on the device information, the information associated with the AGBR, and a content quality. Sending the requested content includes sending at least one of the plurality of content segments. Each the plurality of content segments may be associated with one or more bitrates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["305","125"]},"In step S the network entity may receive\/request subscription information. As discussed above, the application trigger may include subscription information. The device information may include the subscription information. Alternatively and\/or in addition, the network entity may request the subscription information from, for example, a Home Subscription Server\/Subscriber Profile Repository (HSS\/SPR), e.g., HSS\/SPR . The subscription information may include, for example, quality of service (QoS) class information. The quality of service (QoS) class information may include gold\/silver\/bronze level classifications. The quality of service (QoS) class information may include subscriber bitrate guarantees. Quality of service (QoS) classes are known to those skilled in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity.","In step S the network entity may receive\/request device information. As discussed above, the application trigger may include device information. Alternatively and\/or in addition, the network entity may request the device information from, for example, a Home Subscription Server\/Subscriber Profile Repository (HSS\/SPR), e.g., HSS\/SPR .

The message may include a QCI field indicating the quality information. As can be seen from Table 1 the resource type (e.g., type of bearer) includes GBR (QCI=1-4) and Non-GBR (QCI=5-9). Example embodiments include designating an Adaptive Guaranteed Bitrate (AGBR) bearer. The quality information may indicate the AGBR bearer. For example, the message may include a QCI value not listed in table 1. According to example embodiments, using a QCI value not listed in table 1 indicates an AGBR bearer. For example, the QCI value may be greater than 9.","For example, the standard supports QCIs>9, but the properties of bearers with those QCIs are undefined. A QCI=10 bearer may have similar properties to the QCI=4 bearer, which is a GBR bearer used for Non-Conversational Video (Buffered Streaming). HAS video bit rates may be conveyed by using additional QCI values and mapping them to bit rate sets commonly used for HAS videos.","According to example embodiments, QCI may also be used to indicate scheduling algorithms. For example, a QCI value of 10 may indicate a first scheduling algorithm, a QCI value of 11 may indicate a second scheduling algorithm, and so on. The scheduling algorithm may be used by a network device responsible for scheduling wireless transmissions (e.g., eNodeB ).","As indicated above, the message sent in step S may also include bitrate information. The bit rate information may include the GBR. As is known, a GBR is a minimum bitrate guaranteed to a user of a device based on, for example, a QoS class. The GBR may also be communicated to the network entity in the received message. The bitrate information may also include a maximum bitrate (MBR). For example, a MBR may be based on the GBR (e.g., 2\u00d7GBR, or 1\u00d7GBR). Alternatively MBR may be based on a device (e.g., mobile unit ) characteristic (e.g., screen size or download capability).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["405","120","125","320"]},"In step S the network entity may receive content.

In step S the network entity may associate the content with the message. For example, the content and the message may be associated with a request for content, e.g., the request for content discussed above with regard to step S. For example, the content and the message may include fields that have a same address or device ID.","In step S the network entity may generate an adaptive guaranteed bit rate (AGBR) bearer for communication with a mobile unit via another network entity. The another network entity may be a network device responsible for scheduling wireless transmissions (e.g., eNodeB ).","The AGBR bearer may be generated by setting up a standard GBR bearer using known methods. The standard GBR bearer may be based on, for example, one of the GBR bearers shown above in Table 1. For example, the GBR bearer associated with a QCI value of 4. However, whereas the known GBR bearer has a fixed guarantee, the AGBR bearer according to example embodiments sets a target bitrate based on the guaranteed bitrate. Further, the AGBR bearer according to example embodiments may set a range for the bitrate as a floor (e.g., target) and a maximum (e.g., MBR discussed above). Setting a range for the bitrate may be advantageous in that allocating resources above that which the target device (e.g., mobile unit ) can receive is a waste of resources that can be allocated elsewhere.","In step S the network entity may forward the content to the another device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":"505"},"In step S the network entity may receive content directed to a mobile unit.
