Firstly, there is the shape and styling of the garment and additionally, there is the fabric colours and style. Often, a fashion designer will try many different alternatives and may even attempt to draw the final fashion product before creating the finished garment.","Such a process is generally unsatisfactory in providing a rapid and flexible turn around of the garments and also providing rapid judgement of the final appearance of a fashion product on a person.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an alternative form for analysing the look of garments and for their creation. A further object of the present invention is to provide for automatic fabric creation.","In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention there is provided A garment creation system comprising:","an expected image creation system including an image sensor device and an image display device, said image creation system mapping portions of an arbitrary image sensed by said image sensor device onto a garment and outputting on said display device a depiction of said garment;","a garment fabric printer adapted to be interconnected to said image creation system for printing out corresponding pieces of said garment including said mapped portions.","The preferred embodiment is preferably implemented through suitable programming of a hand held camera device such as that described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/113,060 entitled \u201cDigital Instant Printing Camera with Image Processing Capability\u201d (Docket ART01) filed concurrently herewith by the present applicant the content of which is hereby specifically incorporated by cross reference.","The aforementioned patent specification discloses a camera system, hereinafter known as an \u201cArtcam\u201d type camera, wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by an Artcam portable camera unit. Further, the aforementioned specification discloses means and methods for performing various manipulations on images captured by the camera sensing device leading to the production of various effects in an output image. The manipulations are disclosed to be highly flexible in nature and can be implemented through the insertion into the Artcam of cards having encoded thereon various instructions for the manipulation of images, the cards hereinafter being known as Artcards. The Artcam further has significant onboard processing power provided by an Artcam Central Processor unit (ACP) which is interconnected to a memory device for the storage of important data and images.","The aforementioned patent specification discloses an Artcam system as indicated  in . The Artcam system  relies on an Artcam  which takes Artcards  as an input. The Artcard  includes encoded information for manipulation of an image scene  so as to produce an output photo  which contains substantial manipulation in accordance with the instruction of Artcard . The Artcards  are designed to be extremely inexpensive and contain on one surface the encoding information and on the other surface a depiction of the likely effect which will be produced by the Artcard  when inserted in Artcam .","In accordance with the method of the preferred embodiment, as shown in , a large number of Artcards  are prepared and distributed in packs . Each pack  relates to clothing wear of a specific size and includes images eg.  of models having clothing apparel  on to which an image captured by the camera will be mapped. The mapping can be to different items of apparel on different Artcards . One form of mapping algorithm is as illustrated  in  wherein the input image  is first warped  utilising a warp map which maps the image to a repeating tiling pattern that produces attractive warping effects. Of course, many other forms of algorithms could be provided for producing an attractive form of material with the algorithm being provided on Artcard  ().","Next, a second warp  is provided for warping the output of first warp map  onto the specific model image in the Artcard. Therefore, warp  will be Artcard specific. The result can then be output  for printing as an art photo . Hence, a user is able to point an Artcam  at a design image  and produce art photo  which has a manipulated version of the image based upon a model's item of fashion apparel or garment. This process can be continued until a desirable result is produced.","Next, as indicated in , when a final selection has been made, the Artcam  can be connected by its USB port, as illustrated at , to a fabric printer  which can comprise an ink jet fabric printer and associated drive controller electronics etc. The printer  comprises a printhead  having a width corresponding to the width of a bolt of fabric. Either the Artcam  or the ink jet printer  can be programmed to print out on fabric  the garment pieces eg.  having on the surface  thereof the original warped image so as to produce a garment corresponding to that depicted by the model on the Artcard.","The output fabric can include tab portions eg.  for alignment and border regions eg.  in addition to instructions  for joining the garment pieces together. Preferably, the output program includes providing for warp matching of border regions so as to present a continuous appearance on the garment cross seams. Additionally, a user interface could be provided for utilising the same Artcard with many different output sizes so as to taken into account different shaped bodies. By utilisation of Artcam technology, a system can be provided for customised production of garments and rapid depiction of the likely results by means of utilisation of the Artcam device .","It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty-five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the list under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest print head designed is covered in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/112,764, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Tables of Drop-on-Demand Ink Jets","The present invention is useful in the field of digital printing, in particular, ink jet printing. A number of patent applications in this field were filed simultaneously and incorporated by cross reference.","Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.","The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of ink jet types.","Actuator mechanism (18 types)","Basic operation mode (7 types)","Auxiliary mechanism (8 types)","Actuator amplification or modification method (17 types)","Actuator motion (19 types)","Nozzle refill method (4 types)","Method of restricting back-flow through inlet (10 types)","Nozzle clearing method (9 types)","Nozzle plate construction (9 types)","Drop ejection direction (5 types)","Ink type (7 types)","The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. Forty-five such inkjet types were filed simultaneously to the present application.","Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty-five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the II axes. Most of the forty-five examples can be made into ink jet print heads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.","Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The simultaneously filed patent applications by the present applicant are listed by USSN numbers. In some cases, a print technology may be listed more than once in a table, where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.","Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include: Home printers, Office network printers, Short run digital printers, Commercial print systems, Fabric printers, Pocket printers, Internet WWW printers, Video printers, Medical imaging, Wide format printers, Notebook PC printers, Fax machines, Industrial printing systems, Photocopiers, Photographic minilabs etc.","The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"315pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ACTUATOR MECHANISM (APPLIED ONLY TO SELECTED INK DROPS)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Description","Advantages","Disadvantages","Examples"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Thermal","An","Large force","High power","Canon Bubblejet"]},{"entry":["bubble","electrothermal","generated","Ink carrier","1979 Endo et al GB"]},{"entry":[{},"heater heats the","Simple","limited to","patent 2,007,162"]},{"entry":[{},"ink to above","construction","water","Xerox heater-in-pit"]},{"entry":[{},"boiling point,","No moving","Low efficiency","1990 Hawkins et al"]},{"entry":[{},"transferring","parts","High","U.S. Pat.
