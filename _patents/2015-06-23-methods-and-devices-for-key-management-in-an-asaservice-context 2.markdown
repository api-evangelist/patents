{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62\/015,547, filed Jun. 23, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to methods and devices for key management in an as-a-service (aaS) context (e.g., SaaS (software as a service), PaaS (platform as a service), and IaaS (infrastructure as a service)).","Key-management processes involving splitting keys are well-established. All data-encryption keys are split using a master key. The master key is: (1) a real key, not a password; (2) known (i.e., revealed) only to the customer; and (3) very easy to manage. Keys are encrypted and integrity-protected using standard algorithms. Keys are associated with (encrypted and integrity-protected) metadata. Customer-side key hierarchies provide deployment flexibility.","Assume that a key may be legitimately used by several entities in an environment (each is called an \u201cappliance\u201d); some of the appliances may create the key, while other appliances may use the key. Each such creation operation or usage operation may in principal be performed by the same or a different entity.","Also, the appliances are in communication with a Protected Virtual Key Manager (PVKM) which may provide services to the abovementioned appliances and to the users of the system. Such services are related to managing the keys of the system, and also related to enhancing the security of the system.","In the discussion below, the PVKM may be viewed as a \u201clocation\u201d (whether physical or virtual) in such an environment, while each appliance and other security element may be viewed as another \u201clocation\u201d (whether physical or virtual). However, for the avoidance of doubt, while the PVKM itself may be implemented as a collection or a cluster, it is still referred to as a location for the sake of simplicity.","Referring to the drawings, the overall processes have been depicted according to separate, sequential time lines (going from top to bottom in the drawings) for two primary generalized components, an appliance A and a PVKM B, in order to representationally isolate the parallel processes that are occurring on each component independently.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","4","6","8"]},"It is noted that appliance A is intended to be a simplified example of a plurality of appliances in order to provide clarity throughout the description. It is understood that the present invention has broader applicability to a collection or cluster of such appliances. Furthermore, PVKM B is intended to be one conceptual entity (e.g., a server); however, in practical implementations, PVKM B may be a plurality of entities (e.g., a cluster of servers for fail-over protection). In generalizations of this approach, there may be more locations, and therefore more timelines.","The master key is critical to the security of the whole system. Initially, it is kept only in memory. A passive attacker that takes a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the storage device cannot see the master key. The master key is then encrypted so that even an active attack is mitigated. Such encryption is access-controlled, policed on the key-management service, and integrated with customer access-control.","In order to encrypt the key, and yet still use the key, Homomorphic Key Management (HKM) has been shown to be an effective protocol. Homomorphic functions have F(a\u2296b)=F(a)\u2296F(b) in which \u2296 is a suitable operator. Partially-homomorphic functions are employed for key management only (e.g., ElGamal encryption).","ElGamal encryption is homomorphic and entails a secret key x and a public key (g, h=g) in which g is a generator. Encryption is random and produces a pair: Enc(m)=(c, d)=(g, h\u00b7m) in which r is random, and Dec(c, d)=d\/c=m. Such keys can be used to exploit the homomorphic property. As an example, under a multiplication operation: Enc(m; r)Enc(m\u2032; r\u2032)=Enc(m\u00b7m\u2032; r+r\u2032) for element-wise multiplication. Such HKM methods employing split-key encryption are amenable to exact proofs of strength.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","26"],"sub":["i ","i","i ","i ","PK",{"sub2":"i"},"PK",{"sub2":"i"},"i","i"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":["i ","i ","ij","j","i","j","ij","i","j","j "],"b":["30","32","34","36","38","40"]},"As mentioned, the master key is known (i.e., revealed) only to the customer. However, in \u201cas-a-Service\u201d use-cases, there are actually a chain of customers. For example, one customer of the key-management mechanisms may be a service provider, which may know the master key. However, \u201cend\u201d customers further down the chain may be customers of the service provider. A security-conscious end-customer desires to be able to use available shared or distributed resources in the aaS context configured for a multi-tenant environment, as provided by the service provider, and yet enjoy full security and control\u2014by controlling their own keys in such a way that the service provider knows nothing about the keys.","It would be desirable to have methods and devices methods and devices for key management in an as-a-service (aaS) distributed environment. Such methods and devices would, inter alia, expand on the capabilities and applications of the methods mentioned above.","It is the purpose of the present invention to provide methods and devices for key management in an as-a-service (aaS) context.","It is noted that the term \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to refer to examples of embodiments and\/or implementations, and is not meant to necessarily convey a more-desirable use-case. Similarly, the terms \u201calternative\u201d and \u201calternatively\u201d are used herein to refer to an example out of an assortment of contemplated embodiments and\/or implementations, and is not meant to necessarily convey a more-desirable use-case. Therefore, it is understood from the above that \u201cexemplary\u201d and \u201calternative\u201d may be applied herein to multiple embodiments and\/or implementations. Various combinations of such alternative and\/or exemplary embodiments are also contemplated herein.","Embodiments of the present invention enable the security-conscious customer to use available shared or distributed resources in an aaS context configured for a multi-tenant environment, and yet enjoy full security and control\u2014with emphasis placed on key management. While three-way key-splitting in an aaS computing environment using homomorphic key-management is described below as an exemplary embodiment, it is contemplated, and within the scope of the present invention, to extend such methods to splitting keys into more than three key-shares. For example, such further key splitting could accommodate secondary (and further-distant) customers of the primary customers of a service provider.","Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided for the first time a method for key management in an as-a-service (aaS) context, the method including the steps of: (a) upon receiving a creation request in a provider computing-environment, creating a specific key in at least one location in the provider computing-environment by repetitively computing respective specific-key contributions: (i) in a set of N computing resources in the provider computing-environment, wherein N is a non-negative integer; and (ii) in a set of M customer locations in a customer computing-environment, wherein M is a non-negative integer, and wherein the customer computing-environment is outside of the provider computing-environment; and (b) applying the respective specific-key contributions to change a specific-key value in the computing resources, wherein the respective specific-key contributions are never revealed to any computing resources, and to any customer locations, other than respective contributors associated with the respective specific-key contributions;

(ii) a memory module for storing data; and (iii) a network connection for communicating across a network; and (b) a protection module, residing on the server, configured for: (i) upon receiving a creation request in a provider computing-environment, creating a specific key in at least one location in the provider computing-environment by repetitively computing respective specific-key contributions: (A) in a set of N computing resources in the provider computing-environment, wherein N is a non-negative integer;

The principles and operation for providing such methods and devices, according to the present invention, may be better understood with reference to the accompanying description and the drawings.","Consider a computing system (e.g., a software application) that includes multiple computing resources. Such resources may be defined broadly (e.g., data, secret phrases, keys, memory segments, storage areas, storage segments, networks, network segments, and computing resources). Some or all of such resources are protected by keys. It is required to use a master key (a \u201ckey-encryption key\u201d) to secure some of the keys in the system.","In computing environments involving an aaS context, several assumptions must be made related to aaS requirements.\n\n","It is assumed that for such customers, it is acceptable that their data will be decrypted while being processed, but only in memory and in the customer's context (e.g., for a query or a report in a particular service application server, which is serving that customer at that moment). It is assumed that it is also acceptable that the decryption key will exist only in memory of the aaS environment for the time needed for decryption and in the customer's context (e.g. for a query or report in a particular service application server, which is serving that customer at that moment).","Considering a chain of customers, the provider of the service is a customer of the key-management system, and has a master key to ensure that no data leaks outside its control. The end-customers are the customers of the service provider, so they are customers of the customer. Such end-customers also need to have a master key, different for each of the end-customers, and unknown to anyone but themselves. The end-customers desire their own master key so that other tenants of the service, and also the service provider, are not be able to know a particular end-customer's data. Therefore, three-way splitting of keys is desired. One key-share is \u201cowned\u201d by the service provider, and unknown to anyone but the service provider. Another key-share is \u201cowned\u201d by the end-customer, and unknown to any other end-customer, or to the service provider. Yet another key-share is a \u201cfiner-granularity\u201d key (i.e., specific to the resource intended to be protected).","It is clear that each end-customer has their own master key, and the service provider has a master key. All these master keys are protected through homomorphic encryption, thereby creating a Homomorphic Key-Management (HKM) approach which keeps all such master keys secret, even when the master keys are in use. Even when the complete computing system is running, and such master keys are in memory, an attacker looking into the memory will find all master keys encrypted at all times.","Referring again to the drawings,  is a simplified high-level block diagram of the system architecture for three-way key-splitting in an aaS computing environment using homomorphic key-management, according to embodiments of the present invention. A virtual key-management (VKM) system  is shown operationally connected to an aaS environment  having an aaS database and apps  with encryption agents . In such a configuration using encryption agents , HKM encrypts keys all the way down to the \u201capp context.\u201d This means that keys can remain homomorphically encrypted even after key-shares are joined, so key-shares (i.e., key contributions) and final specific keys remain hidden. The app context can be as specific as a specific thread or process during the brief time of use for the needs of an individual tenant (i.e., customer) in the aaS system.","Encryption agents  can exchange encrypted data, via an encrypted transmission connection , with an aaS storage server . aaS environment  also includes a server or cluster of servers with a VPD (Virtual Private Data) library . VPD library  is the location where keys are split into (three) shares before storage, or joined from (three) shares before use. It is noted that such splitting and joining is performed by VPD library  under homomorphic encryption, so the actual key-shares and final keys are never revealed to VPD library .","aaS environment  is able to receive service provider (SP) master-keys from an SP master-key owner . SP master-key owner  may be either a human using an appropriate homomorphic-encryption tool provided by VKM system , or a server configured for that purpose. Customers access and utilize aaS environment  only after providing customer-scoped master-keys  which are homomorphically encrypted before being provided, while the customer's users access and utilize aaS environment  using user access tokens .","It is noted that master-key scope (e.g., a customer organization) is usually defined by the service provider in a way that is convenient for the running of aaS environment . In other words, scope depends upon an appropriate system definition of the idea of a customer. Such a definition is common in all aaS systems as they must define their tenants.","Scoped master-keys never leave a customer's premises, except under homomorphic encryption, meaning customer's appointed owners always control and own the customer's data. Furthermore, specific encryption keys never exist anywhere other than in the memory of a requesting thread, not even in an appliance, due to homomorphic encryption. Moreover, user tokens  are an access-control mechanism with an API. Projects can include mapping to aaS access control (e.g., user level, role level, organizational level, or scope level). The flexible architecture allows encryption\/decryption of data to be performed by aaS environment  or by a system agent. VPD library  requires no long-term state memory, and can be placed on virtual instances as defined by aaS environment , meaning that the instances are completely stateless, and this approach is massively scalable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["52","66","68","70"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["52","50","64","50","64","50","64","62"]},"Customer premises  include customer-scoped master-keys  (which are provided in homomorphically-encrypted form to VPD library  as needed) and user tokens  (which provide access to applications on aaS database and apps ).

Block Step  defines a new value, the combined master key, K=K\u2296k, which is encrypted homomorphically, and never revealed to anyone (neither customer, service provider, nor key management system ever know it). Instance i therefore holds a vector of combined, encrypted master-key values Kindexed by j. Instance i also generates and stores a random mask, mask(Block Step ).
