{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to and benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/078,288, filed Jul. 3, 2008, entitled, \u201cMulti-Media Online Presentation System and Method,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","1. Technical Field","The present invention generally relates to network-based multi-media presentations and, more particularly, to unification of local and remote resources over a network.","2. Related Art","Presently, in reference to creating and posting online media presentations, a user must typically purchase conventional media presentation software, which may be expensive, create a media presentation with the conventional media presentation software, which is often time consuming, upload the rile for the media presentation, and then post a link to a file for online access to the created media presentation, which may require security features. To view the posted media presentation, another user must access the site storing the file, pass some form of access security features, download the file from the communication network, and have the same software that created the file for viewing. Unfortunately, this sequence of creating and downloading the media presentation is often expensive, time-consuming, and inconvenient for each user involved in the process.","Another problem when working with web-based applications is the issue of dealing with mixed local and remote resources. In general, users typically utilize resources (i.e., files, documents, and media) that are stored locally on a user device, but these locally stored resources are usually inaccessible to web applications for security reasons. The traditional web application forces users to locate these assets and upload them to a server environment, after which they are available for working within a web-based application. As such, there exists a need to simplify the process of creating and publishing online media presentations over a communication network.","Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a system and method for utilizing locally stored resources in a secure manner within a network-based application, while allowing locally stored resources to be shared over a network, such as the Internet.","In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, a system and method for facilitating information transactions over a network include communicating with a user device and one or more distribution channels via the network, installing a local network server on the user device, monitoring user drop events, generating resource mapping of media resources based on the user drop events, and uploading media resources.","In various implementations, the method includes gathering media resources based on user input, creating a media presentation with the media resources based on user input, and publishing the media presentation by distributing the media presentation to the one or more distribution channels via the network. The method includes verifying communication with the user device and installing a plug-in module on the user device that is adapted to install the local network server on the user device and monitor user drop events, wherein monitoring the user drop events comprises passing one or more filenames of local file resources to the plug-in module. The method includes generating a browser callback to detect user drop events and translating file formats of media resources to recognizable media formats.","In one implementation, the method includes storing the media resources in a storage component of the user device, and the media resources comprise local file resources stored locally on the user device. In one implementation, generating resource mapping of media resources comprises mapping a local file resource to a secure URL, wherein the secure URL supports one or more query parameters including at least one of resolution, rotation, and media format. In another implementation, the method includes processing secure URL queries by accessing media resources via one or more secure URLs. In one implementation, the method includes receiving an HTTP request for a local file resource, checking for a secure URL related to the local file resource, retrieving the local file resource if a secure URL exists for the local file resource, and applying one or more requested query parameters to the local file resource including at least one of resolution, rotation, and media format.","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.","The system and methods disclosed herein, according to one or more embodiments, utilize locally stored resources in a secure manner within a network-based application, while allowing locally stored resources to be shared over a network, such as the Internet. The system and methods disclosed herein are also adapted to facilitate collecting various types of media, creating multi-media presentations, and publishing multi-media presentations over the network for viewing by other users in communication with the network. Further scope and function related to these features are described in greater detail herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","160","100","120","140","180","160"]},"The network , in one embodiment, may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, the network  may include the Internet and\/or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of communication networks. In another example, the network  may comprise a wireless telecommunications network (e.g., cellular phone network) adapted to communicate with other communication networks, such as the Internet. As such, in various embodiments, the at least one client device , the multi-media distribution channels , and the at least one service provider device  may be associated with a particular link (e.g., a link, such as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to an IP (Internet Protocol) address).","The at least one client device , in various embodiments, may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over the network . In various implementations, the client device  may be implemented as a personal computing device (e.g., a personal computer (PC)) in communication with the network , such as the Internet. In various other implementations, the client device  may be implemented as one or more wireless telephones (e.g., cell phones), personal digital assistants (PDAs), notebook computers, and\/or various other generally known types of wired and\/or wireless computing devices. It should be appreciated that the client device  may be referred to as a user device or customer device without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","The client device , in one embodiment, includes a user interface application , which may comprise a network-based application (e.g., a web-based application) and may be utilized by a user  to conduct information transactions with the distribution channels  and the service provider server  over the network . For example, the user interface application  may be implemented as a multi-media presentation application to collect, create, and publish information via the network . In various implementations, media (e.g., photo-images, audio, video, music, etc.) may be collected from various sources (e.g., local PC storage, remote data storage, Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds, online websites, other online sources, etc.), multi-media presentations may be created, and the multi-media presentations may be published to and\/or shared with one or more of the multi-media channels  via the user interface application  over the network .","In one implementation, the user interface application  comprises a software program, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), executable by a processor that is configured to interface and communicate with the multi-media channels  and the service provider server  via the network . In another implementation, the user interface application  comprises a browser module that provides a network interface to browse information available over the network . For example, the user interface application  may be implemented, in part, as a web browser to view information available over the network . In another example, each member of the user group  is able to access multi-media websites via the one or more multi-media channels  to view, collect and publish multi-media presentations over the network .","The client device , in one embodiment, comprises a plug-in module  that is adapted to interface with the user interface application  to provide a local web server  for use by the client device . The plug-in module  is adapted to extend the behavior of the user interface application , such as when implemented as browser, using one of several standard browser plug-in APIs (i.e., application programming interfaces). In one implementation, the plug-in module  installs the client-side local web server  that runs external to the browser. The user interface application , when implemented as a browser, includes a JavaScript API file adapted to initialize the plug-in module  with a session ID  and setup application callbacks for certain events. Once initialized, the plug-in module  is adapted to verify that a local web service is running, start the local web service if not running, and register for user drag and drop events. Further scope related to the plug-in module  and the local server  is described in greater detail herein.","The client device , in various embodiments, may include other applications as may be desired in one or more implementations to provide additional features available to the user . In one example, such other applications may include security applications for implementing client-side security features, programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate APIs over the network , and\/or various other types of generally known programs and\/or applications. In other examples, these other applications may interface with the user interface application  for improved efficiency and convenience. For example, files, data, and\/or various types of information may be imported from multi-media software directly into the user interface application  for ease of access to multi-media files (e.g., audio, video, pictures, clip-art, etc.).","The client device , in various embodiments, may include a user identifier, which may be implemented, for example, as operating system registry entries, cookies associated with the user interface application , identifiers associated with hardware of the client device , or various other appropriate identifiers. The user identifier may include attributes related to the user , such as personal information (e.g., a user name, password, etc.). In one implementation, the user identifier may be passed to the service provider server  during publishing mid\/or sharing of a multi-media presentation.","The multi-media distribution channels , in one embodiment, may be maintained by one or more resource providers and\/or entities (e.g., social networking sites, resource information sites, management sites, merchant sites, etc.) in communication with the network . As such, the multi-media distribution channels  may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over the network . In one implementation, the multi-media distribution channels  may be implemented as a network computing device (e.g., a network server) in wired and\/or wireless communication with the network .","The service provider server , in one embodiment, may be maintained by an online transaction processing provider and\/or entity in communication with the network . As such, the service provider server  may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over the network . In one implementation, the service provider server  may be implemented as a network computing device (e.g., a network server) in wired and\/or wireless communication with the network . As shown in , the service provider server  includes a service interface application , which may be adapted to interact with the client device  to facilitate publishing and\/or sharing multi-media presentations over a network. In one example, the service provider server  may be provided and implemented by PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., USA.","The service application , in one embodiment, utilizes a collect module , a create module , and a publish module  to collect information, create presentations, and publish presentations, respectively. As described in greater detail herein, the modules , ,  enable users, such as the user , to collect diverse types of audio and visual media, create rich multi-media presentations with real-time editing and authoring using media software, such as Flash, and then share and\/or publish the rich multi-media presentations with other users via the network . In one example, the collect, create, and publish modules , ,  may be implemented within a standard web browser for interfacing with the user .","In one implementation, the user  is able to share multi-media presentations with other users via the media channels  and\/or embed multi-media presentations directly in webpages of other users. For example, the user  may provide a unique URL link for the multi-media presentation to other users. In another example, the user  may directly email multi-media presentations to multiple recipients and include a message with the email. In still another example, the user  may provide the source HTML (i.e., HyperText Markup Language) code to other users and\/or embed the source HTML code directly into other user's webpages. Still other examples include the ability to publish multi-media presentations on a website to sell a particular item or service for purchase. For items and\/or services, a media rich presentation helps users market and sell items and\/or services, which may be valuable for high-end or high-priced items and\/or services. Social and\/or dating sites may utilize these multi-media presentations to provide online users with a way to better present themselves to other online users. In various implementations, some types of webpages may be presented in a more dynamic manner by utilizing Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds, since, for example, a particular user's presentation may be continually changing with new media.","The service provider server , in various embodiments, may be configured to maintain, store and\/or archive multi-media presentations in a database , each of which may include information related to one or more users, such as the user , and one or more multi-media channels; such as multi-media distributions channels . In various examples, the multi-media presentations may include attributes stored as part thereof, and the attributes may be passed to the service provider server  as part of a creating, publishing and\/or sharing the multi-media presentations.","Referring to , the collect module , in one embodiment, enables the user  to collect audio, photographic images, video, and music media from various sources, such as a PC, RSS feeds, websites, and any other online source, via a user interface, such as the user interface application . In various implementations, the user interface application  comprises multiple tabs and\/or links for the various sources. Once collected, the media may be saved and categorized in the database  and edited on the system site via the service provider server . Editing may include one or more of sizing, rotating, overlying, moving and stacking various media backward and forward with an overlay or stack. Video may be broken up automatically by the service provider server  into smaller segments. Selected video segments may be combined and\/or used as desired. Selected media may be placed on a virtual storyboard, such as a clipboard, on the same screen as the collection of media. Media may be edited either in the collection or in the storyboard. Placing desired media on the storyboard may be accomplished by dragging and dropping. In one example, the collect module  provides selected media on a storyboard. In another example, the collect module  provides media on a user's media page (i.e., not placed on the storyboard). In still another example, uploading media may be delayed until editing is completed.","Referring to , the create module , in one embodiment, enables the user  to place selected media onto a presentation style, board or collage. The service provider server  may automatically suggest a story idea to launch the creative process, or the user  may select a specific style or presentation tool. In one implementation, media from the storyboard may be dragged and dropped onto the presentation. Within the presentation, there may be multiple styles, such as a picture frame, a television, a billboard, etc. Media may be placed within the viewing window of each type of style. Once in the presentation, the media may be edited. For example, the media may be rotated, sized, cut-out (e.g., by selecting the boundaries of an image, such as with clicks to designate points along the boundary, enabling as coarse or fine a resolution as desired), moved forward or backward in relation to adjacent media, slide multiple images to add or remove spaces within the presentation, and adding a hotspot (e.g., selecting an area of the image for additional information, such as adding a link, video, text, etc.). Other editing features may include adding audio to the background, adding text, and\/or distorting images. In one aspect, the editing may be achieved in real-time so that the user  may quickly and easily see the results and change them as needed.","Referring to , the publish module , in one embodiment, enables the user  to share, publish and\/or distribute the presentation when, for example, the presentation is completed. In one implementation, as described herein, the presentation may be saved in the database  of the service provider server . Once saved, the user  may share, publish and\/or distribute presentations to any selected channel, such as one or more of the multi-media channels . Any users on the network  having access to the channels  or website related to the channels  may refresh the view, which may automatically load the presentation into that channel and\/or website for viewing the content of the presentation. As such, the presentations may be distributed to various online websites, blogs, mobile video players, and IP TV networks, and\/or on the system site.","These modules , ,  may be combined, used, and\/or modified to provide the user  with different initial choices regarding the type of presentation and features desired for creating the presentation. The choices may be a simple, easy to use tool to quickly build  presentations with dynamic content from RSS feeds and online albums. Accordingly, the user  may select a presentation style and then link it to the user's media libraries through RSS feeds that maintain an \u201calways on\u201d permalink to the content source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2B","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","160"]},"Referring to , the method  comprises collecting media for a multi-media presentation (block ). In various implementations, media such as photographic images, audio, video, music, etc. may be collected from a variety of sources including local sources, such as a personal computer (PC), and online sources, such as the Internet, for use in the media presentation or media piece. For example, an online search engine may be accessed and one or more keyword searches may be utilized to search the Internet for various types of media content. In another example, additional media may be collected from other sources, such as media from a PC, which may be selected, uploaded and viewed. As such, media from different sources may be viewed by selecting corresponding media source tabs from the user interface application . Media may be viewed as individual media items or clustered such that each of the individual media items within the cluster may be viewed. In one aspect, the user interface application  interfaces with the service interface application  via the network  to utilize the collect module  for collecting media. In another aspect, any media collected may be displayed on the user device  via the network  for viewing by the user  in a media collection area of the user interface application  (block ).","Next, the method  comprises populating a storyboard (block ). In one implementation, the user interface application  includes a graphical storyboard, which may be populated with collected media from one or more of the media items or a cluster of media items collected from various media sources. For example, the graphical storyboard may include one or more images of items and\/or clustered items collected from the Internet and items uploaded from a PC.","Next, optionally, one or more of the media items may be edited (block ). In various implementations, media positioned on the graphical storyboard may be edited prior to generating the media presentation or media piece, and\/or individual media items in a media cluster may be reordered.","Next, the media presentation or media piece may be created (block ). In one implementation, once media items have been collected and optionally edited, the media presentation or media piece may be created by selecting a creation operation of the user interface application . In one aspect, the user interface application  interfaces with the service interface application  via the network  to utilize the create module  for creating the media presentation or media piece.","In various implementations, creating the media presentation and\/or media piece may include selecting and\/or customizing its style (block ) and viewing the selected and\/or customized style (block ). For example, presentation styles may include, but are not limited to, a picture frame, billboard, kaleidoscope, street scene, landscape, etc. Once a style is selected, media items from the storyboard may automatically flow into or populate the selected style. Some styles, such as kaleidoscope style, support movement of media as part of a presentation style and provides various customizable characteristics of movement, such as speed of media rotation, etc., within the style. In one aspect, the customized style may be displayed on the user device  via the network  for viewing by the user .","Next, referring to , the selected and\/or customized style of the media presentation or media piece may be optionally edited (block ). In various implementations, if further editing of media presentation style is desired, style editing tools may be provided to the user interface application  via the create module . These editing tools may include the ability to preview the media presentation or media piece, edit the media presentation or media piece (e.g., scale, rotate and\/or move frames directly onto the media presentation or media piece), add text and\/or captions to the media presentation or media piece, add audio, sound, music and\/or voice-over to the media presentation or media piece, placement of a frame and\/or masking of the media presentation or piece, and add background images and\/or color to the media presentation or media piece. For example, a sound and\/or audio feature may provide options, such as adding music to particular media or background, having the music vary in loudness depending on time and\/or spatial indicators, and having a repeating playlist that repeats particular music and\/or plays different segments in a random manner.","Next, the method  comprises providing identifying information (block ) about the media presentation or media piece (e.g., a title, storage location and\/or various types of descriptive information) and deciding where to store the media presentation or media piece (block ). In one implementation, the user  may identify and\/or a select one or more distribution channels located on an associated server for storage of the media presentation or media piece or choose an alternative storage location in the network .","Next, the method  comprises publishing, sharing and\/or broadcasting the media presentation or media piece via the network (block ). In various implementations, the media presentation or media piece may be published or distributed to a site accessible via the network  for viewing by one or more other network users in communication with the network . For example, the media presentation or media piece may be directly emailed (block ) to one or more recipients (i.e., other network users), along with a message. In another example, an associated URL link (block ) for the media presentation or media piece may be given (e.g., via email or some type of text message) to one or more recipients (i.e., other network users) for direct access to the media presentation or media piece via the network . In still another example, source code (block ) for the media presentation or media piece may be obtained by the user  and embedded into a web page managed by the user  via the network .","Accordingly, in various implementations, the user  may email the media presentation or media piece to other network users via the network , embed the media presentation or media piece in a web page that is accessible via the network , and\/or create a URL permalink of the media presentation or media piece to one or more of the multi-media distribution channels  in the network .","In one implementation, the service interface application  allows users to compose multi-media stories, presentations and pieces by laying out photographic images, video, text and audio on a stage, storyboard or collage. In one aspect, a multi-media story may begin from an unpopulated storyboard. The user  may select to view and work with a sample story until the user  is ready to begin the media story. Multi-media items from various sources may be viewed by selecting source tabs of the user interface application .","Once the user  is ready to create a media story, the user  accesses a collage storyboard. In one aspect, the storyboard or stage progressively moves in a first direction, such as a left or right direction, and when viewed, may appear as a movie adapted to present a linear narrative in time and\/or space. In another aspect, the stage may progressively move in a second direction, such as upward or downward. As such, this may also be presented as a movie adapted to present a linear narrative in time and\/or space. The vertical orientation may represent physical structures that have height and\/or depth, such as buildings, structures, monuments and\/or geological strata. In still another aspect, the stage may be adapted to progressively move in a plurality of directions and may be presented as real or virtual spaces in two or three dimensions.","In various implementations, multi-media items from various sources may be uploaded from the network , or previously collected media items may be used to populate the storyboard by selecting desired multi-media items. A multi-media item may be repositioned within the storyboard by dragging and dropping the multi-media item to another location in the storyboard. Similarly, a multi-media item may be removed from the storyboard by dragging and dropping the multi-media item from the storyboard. In one aspect, once multi-media items are positioned within the storyboard, the media story may be edited. In this regard, a rich interface may be presented to users within a predefined screen area.","In various embodiments, the service interface application  utilizes a number of innovative techniques. For example, a first technique utilizes one or more direct-attached media-specific tools. When selecting any media object on the stage, a highlight rectangle appears around the object. Attached to the rectangle around the media object are a number of tools, some generic for all media types, others specific to the media type. By showing the tools in close proximity to the media object, it is easier for users to understand the relationship of the tool to the media object. For each tool, an edge may be specified (e.g., expressed as a number from 0-3, 0=top, 1=right, 2=bottom and 3=left), a position along the edge (e.g., expressed as a ratio of edge length) and an offset from the edge (e.g., expressed as a factor of the tool's size). Whenever updating a position of a tool, an absolute position may be calculated or recalculated based on various parameters.","In another example, another technique utilizes a rotation invariant display of tools. If a user  rotates a media object using a rotate tool, the associated tools remain fixed to the original object constraint point (i.e., they do not rotate, thereby making it easier for the user to read the icons). Once a rotation is complete, the attached edge is calculated or recalculated based on the perceived edge, and if necessary fades the tool out from a previous location to a new location. As such, the user  may be accustomed to finding certain tools in certain positions relative to a media object, irrespective of the media object's rotation.","In another example, another technique utilizes a slide tool. When working with media that may progressively move in a particular direction, user selection and manipulation of individual media objects may become a challenge. Traditional techniques of multiple selection and direct manipulation break down when dealing with large documents. The slide tool allows the user  to perform an action that may be difficult, such as insert or remove horizontal space within a collage or story. The user  selects a media object to reveal the media specific tools. The slide tool is affixed to an edge of the media object, and when grabbed, the slide tool selects one or more media objects at or to the other edge of the selected media object, and allows side-to-side sliding during a user action. In one aspect, this technique may be utilized for a vertically oriented collage or story, which would present the slide tool on an upper edge of the selected media object and allow dragging of layers at or below the selected object.","In another example, another technique utilizes a drag and drop insertion. The user  may drag thumbnails representing media objects from a media tab and drop them onto the stage or storyboard. As the user  drags the thumbnail over the stage, an insertion point indicator is presented to the user  showing where an edge of the dropped item may be located during user action, such as, if the user's mouse is released. If the user's mouse hovers over the left edge of any existing media object on the stage, the indicator state switches to an insert mode. If the user releases the mouse while the indicator is in this mode, the underlying media object and all media objects to the right of the left edge of that media object will be offset to the right to allow for the dropped media object to fit on the stage without being obscured.","In another example, another technique utilizes one or more unconstrained animated button icons. Some applications use iconic images to represent actions that the user  may perform. As icons become smaller, they are difficult to discern and understand. The service interface application  uses animation and unbounded icons to convey visual information. In one aspect, a text tool icon in an idle state is an \u201cA\u201d (other applications often use a T as the text tool). On rollover, the A is revealed to be a window onto a cropped, sliding Add Text message, which animates to an edge. In another aspect, a soundtrack tool may be represented as a musical note, but on rollover, the notes play and rise outside of a representative button. To create these buttons, a designer may designate a static rectangle, which represents traditional bounds of the graphic. These bounds may be used by the button to determine the button bounds and scale. The innovative part is to not force all graphic icon content to lie within these bounds and set the button class to not clip its content. By triggering the animation on rollover, the design may exceed its bounds, while still preserving visual coherence in the idle state.","In another example, another technique utilizes one or more collapsible tabbed containers. When editing a collage or story, a button bar may represent one or more additional editing options. The collapsed bar may comprise a row of buttons, although each icon may be presented as a button rather than an icon. When the user  selects at least one of the buttons, the selected button transforms into a tab, and the bar expands horizontally to include the tab content. The user  may collapse the bar by selecting a close button in the bar or by selecting the currently open tab.","In another example, another technique utilizes an on-demand loading of media. A presentation may be represented as a document with a plurality of layers. Each layer may include various attributes, including position, scale, visual bounds, associated annotations (i.e., hotspots) and a target media asset, which may have layer specific properties, such as playback behaviors. When a player loads a collage or story, the player requests the first page of the collage document and specifies a number of layers per page. The server returns up to a page worth of layers, sorted by x position in the collage. The player may download one or more pages of layers and create a local indexed list of layers. Then, based on the visual window, the player may filter the layers down to the currently visible. For each layer, if the layer hasn't already been loaded or queued for loading, the layer is queued for loading.","In one implementation, the user  may add one or more hotspots to the media presentation or piece. A hotspot may be identified by a title as a cursor is moved over a designated hotspot area. Activating the hotspot by selecting the hotspot area may link the user  to additional information relating to the hotspot item. For example, if an automobile is used as a media item within the collage storyboard, a hotspot may link the user  to additional information relating to the automobile, such as price, condition, and terms or sale. Hotspots may be specific to one part or element of the media item. In this example, the user  may create a hotspot on the tire, which, when opened, may give the viewer access and\/or information on the tire, where to buy the tire, etc. Other hotspots may link the user to music or other audio clips, and other media may be uploaded into the collage storyboard from a clipboard or link to sale items posted on the Internet. Once the media piece has been created the media piece may be viewed, saved, previewed and\/or published. Once published, the user  may have options as to the playback. For example, the media presentation or piece may play continuously until stopped, play only for a specified number of times, play only once, etc.","In various implementations, using the various media creation and publishing tools described herein, a user  may quickly and easily create media rich presentations and use those presentations in numerous ways. Some examples include the ability to publish a presentation on a site to sell a particular item or service. For items or services, a media rich presentation may assist the seller with marketing and selling the item or service, which may be valuable for high-end or high-priced items or services. Sellers may be able to cross sell or promote items or services or direct consumers to partner commercial sites using the hotspot feature. Social or dating sites may use these presentations to give its users a meaningful way to present themselves to others. Blogs and personal pages may be more dynamic using RSS feeds, since, for example, a particular user's presentation may be continually changing with new media.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","160","300","160"]},"In one implementation, the plug-in module  is installed on the user device  (block ). For example, the service provider device  downloads the plug-in module  to the user device  via the network  for installation on the user device . The plug-in module  is adapted to extend the browsing behavior of user interface application , when implemented, e.g., as a network browser, using one of several standard browser plug-in APIs.","Next, the plug-in module  is adapted to install a local network server  (block ). In one implementation, the plug-in module  is adapted to install the client-side local network server  (e.g., local web-based server) that is adapted to operate external to the browsing operation of the user interface application , when implemented as a network browser. The user interface application  may include a JavaScript API file that is adapted to initialize the plug-in module  with a session ID and setup application callbacks for certain events. When initializing, the plug-in module  verifies that a local network service is running, starts the local network service if not running, and registers for user drag-and-drop events.","Next, user drag-and-drop events are monitored (block ). The plug-in module , in one embodiment, may be associated with a rectangular area of interest specified within a browser Document Object Model by the OBJECT\/EMBED width and height. If the user  drags a file or folder over the area of interest and drops (i.e., releases) the file or folder over the area of interest, then the plug-in module  is adapted to communicate with the local network server  over a transmission control protocol (TCP) backchannel to thereby pass the File path of the file or folder.","Next, the local network server  generates a resource mapping (block ). In one embodiment, the local network server  maps a local file resource to a secure URL, based on the session ID, a pseudo random code, and the file name, and the local network server  returns the generated resource mapping to the plug-in module . Then, the plug-in module  generates a callback to the browser JavaScript environment (block ). Depending on the browser environment, the browser callback may be immediate or a flag may be set, which the JavaScript environment may poll to detect events. In one aspect, a drop event passes the secure URL and filename to the JavaScript environment. The browser is adapted to access the mapped resource through the secure URL in a manner similar to a remote asset.","Next, the local network server  may be adapted to translate file formats to media formats (block ). When dealing with media types, there may be a need for translating file formats to media formats and resolutions supported by common browsers. For example, a secure URL is adapted to support one or more query parameters that allow for specifying a desired resolution, rotation, and media format, and the local web server  is adapted to convert media files, if possible and\/or if necessary.","Next, the local network server  may be adapted to process one or more secure URL queries (block ). In one implementation, when the local server  receives an HTTP request, the local server  checks for an existing secure URL mapping, and if so, the local server  serves up the local file, applying any desired scaling, rotation, or format translations based on the URL query parameters. In one aspect, the user interface application  is adapted to process a secure URL resource in a similar manner as with a normal URL resource. However, the secure URL resource is served up locally to improve performance.","Next, the local network server  may be adapted to publish media and\/or upload resources (block ). In one implementation, once the user  has finished working on a media presentation and\/or document and proceeds to publish and\/or share the completed media presentation and\/or document, the user interface application  performs a call to the plug-in module  indicating which resources need to be uploaded to the service provider device  via the network . In one aspect, the plug-in module  communicates any related information and resources over the TCP backchannel to the local network server , which begins to upload the related information and resources, which may be scaled and\/or rotated, to the service provider device  via the network . In one aspect, this process (block ) may continue running in the background.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","120","140","180","140","160","140","180","120","140","180","400"]},"In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, computer system , such as a personal computer and\/or a network server, includes a bus  and\/or other communication mechanism for communicating information, which interconnects subsystems and components, such as processing component  (e.g., processor, micro-controller, digital signal processor (DSP), etc.), system memory component  (e.g., RAM), static storage component  (e.g., ROM), disk drive component  (e.g., magnetic or optical), network interface component  (e.g., modem or Ethernet card), display component  (e.g., CRT or LCD), input component  (e.g., keyboard), and cursor control component  (e.g., mouse or trackball).
