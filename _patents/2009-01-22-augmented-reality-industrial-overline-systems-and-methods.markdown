{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to industrial overline systems and methods, such as baking, cooking and routing systems, and more particularly, to augmented reality vision-based industrial overline systems and methods for monitoring and controlling baking, cooking and routing processes.","Conventional baking, cooking and routing processes, and the like, have the goal of providing efficient throughput of product conveyed along a conveyor belt. For example, buns produced for fast food providers have different specifications, and it is desirable to have automated high-volume baking systems that can detect out-of-spec product and remove defective buns from the conveyor belt. Similarly, cooked poultry transferred out of an oven is randomly located and oriented on the conveyor belt and it is desirable to detect product that is over-cooked or under-cooked. The defective buns or poultry is typically detected by an operator (inspector) and removed from the conveyor belt.","In the case of routing processes, labels may be used for routing within a distribution center. Such labels are applied to packages when they arrive at the distribution center, and are used to route the packages to appropriate delivery trucks. This process involves printing and applying thousands of labels, and a solution is desired to automate aspects of the internal routing process to reduce the number of labels that are necessary.","It would be desirable to have augmented reality vision-based systems and methods that monitor and control baking, cooking and routing processes, and the like. It would be desirable to have an augmented reality monitoring system that includes a projection display system or a laser projection system that is networked with an infrared or visible imaging system that improves the ability to monitor and control baking, cooking and routing processes, and the like. It would also be desirable to have an augmented reality monitoring system comprising a barcode reader, a projection display system or a laser projection system, and an infrared or visible imaging system that are networked together and which improves the ability to monitor and control baking, cooking and routing processes, and the like.","Described herein are augmented reality industrial overline systems and methods. The augmented reality systems and methods may be employed to monitor and control baking, cooking and routing processes, and the like. Exemplary reduced-to-practice embodiments of the augmented reality systems and methods may be used for overline monitoring, inspection and control of processes relating to raw and cooked meat, vegetables and baked items. Exemplary reduced-to-practice systems and methods may also be used to monitor, inspect and control package tracking and delivery processes.","Referring to the drawing figures,  illustrates a first exemplary embodiment of an augmented reality industrial overline system . The first exemplary embodiment of the system  comprises an oven that may be used to process product , such as to cook poultry or bake buns, for example. The exemplary system  displays identifying or instructional information directly on cooked or baked product  as it is moved by a conveyor  after exiting the oven ","The identifying or instructional information is generated by networking an imaging system  (or image acquisition system ) with a projection system  comprising a symbol generation system . The imaging system  may comprise an infrared (thermal) camera system  or a visible camera system , for example. The projection system  may comprise a laser projection system  or a liquid crystal display (LCD) projection system , for example. The imaging system  and the projection system  are coupled to and are controlled by a computer control system .","The imaging system  provides location information relating to product  transported by the conveyor . The use of an infrared camera system  provides location information and generates temperature information relating to the product  as it is transported by the conveyor . The temperature information is indicative of product temperature as the product moves out of the oven ","The computer control system  comprises software  () that, when used with the thermal camera system , compares product temperature data with predetermined low and\/or high temperature thresholds. When the temperature of a particular product  is lower than or exceeds one of the predetermined thresholds, the software  running on the computer control system  causes the projection system  to project information onto specific product  that is under or over the desired temperature, based on the monitored temperature data.","The projected information may be a symbol  or other indicator identifying the defective (over- or under-temperature) product . Suitable symbols  may be a cross, a plus sign, small or large dots, a star, or any other readily visible symbol  that is projected on and moves along with the defective product . The symbols  may be projected with any desired color that makes it visible to an operator. In exemplary reduced-to-practice embodiments of the system , red and green colored symbols were used in tests to determine their efficacy. The product  that is illuminated by the projected symbols  is removed from the conveyor  by the operator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIGS. 9","i":["a","d "],"b":["9","16","11","16","11","11","12"]},"A number of prototype systems  were developed to test capabilities of the various embodiments. As is illustrated in , one prototype system  comprises a visible\/thermal camera system  and a laser projection system  employing a pan-and-tilt laser pointing system . The laser projection system  comprises a laser  that may be mounted on the pan-and-tilt laser pointing system . A two-axis servo beamsteering controller is coupled to and controls the pan-and-tilt laser pointing system  to point the beam of the laser  onto the product . An exemplary two-axis servo beamsteering controller may be a Mini-ITX central processing unit (CPU). The two-axis servo beamsteering controller is controlled via the software  to move the laser , and thus its laser beam or spot , and move the laser spot  along with the moving product .","By sending control commands to the two-axis beamsteering controller from the computer control system , the laser light is projected onto product  on the conveyor . The control software  is calibrated to synchronize laser beam locations on the conveyor  with corresponding locations generated by the camera system . A laser controller turns the laser  on and off under control of software  running on the computer control system .","As is illustrated in , another prototype system  comprises a visible\/thermal camera system  and a laser projection system  employing a dual axis mirror and mirror beamsteering controller . The dual axis mirror is controlled by galvanometer circuitry that allows rapid movement of the mirror to point the beam of the laser  onto the product  and create the symbol pattern.","As is illustrated in , another prototype system  comprises a thermal camera system  and a liquid crystal display (LCD) projector  mounted above the conveyor . The thermal camera system  and LCD projector  are coupled to and are controlled by the computer control system . This embodiment of the system  may be used in conjunction with baking or cooking processes employing the oven . Cooked or baked product  exiting the oven is transported by the conveyor  under the thermal camera system  and projector . The thermal camera system  is used to detect the temperature of the product . The temperature data is passed to the computer control system , and the software  running thereon compares the product temperature data with low and\/or high temperature thresholds and identifies defective (uncooked or overcooked) product , for example. The thermal camera system  also provides location data to the software . The software  controls the LCD projection system and causes it to project a symbol  onto the defective product  as it is moved by the conveyor . An operator can then remove the defective product  from the conveyor  that is identified by the symbol .","More particularly, laser control algorithms of the software  process the location information found through analysis of the digital images derived from the camera system  to update the location of a currently tracked product . When a new product  is tracked, the servo system moves the laser beam to point at the correct location on the conveyor  and then turns on the laser  to controllably draw or project the desired symbol  or spot . The laser beam location is changed as information about the product location is updated. When the tracked product  moves out of range of the laser projection system , the laser  is turned off and the laser control system  waits for further product location information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["10","14","15","15","10","14","15","19","17","10","12","11","11","11","12","12","11","11","13","14","15","20","11","12","11","12"],"i":["a","a ","a","b ","c ","c "]},"In order to properly track product  as it moves from the field of view of the visible\/thermal camera system  to the field of view of the laser  or LCD projection system , locations viewed by the visible\/thermal camera system  are mapped to coordinates within the field of view of the laser  or LCD projection system ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 6","FIG. 6"],"i":["a","c ","a","a ","a"],"b":["6","14","18","15","14","18","15","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 6","i":"b ","b":["20","20"]},"3\u00d72 checkerboard squares=30\u00d720 laser units,","1 checkerboard square=10\u00d710 laser units,","3\u00d73 world units=10\u00d710 laser units,","1 laser unit=0.3 world units or 1 world unit=3.33 laser units.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6","i":"c "},"frame respective units may be defined as:","C1=(100, 100) in the camera,","C2=(105, 100) in the camera,","L1=(10, 20) in the laser,","L2=(20, 20) in the laser.","Camera software picks origin of world units and assigns C1 to WC1 and C2 to WC2:","WC1=(30, 10),","WC2=(35, 10).","The length of the yardstick is known and is:","V=(0, 300).","Where WL1 and WL2 are can be calculated using a vector V:","WL1=C2\u2212V,","WL2=C2\u2212V,","WL1=(30, 10)\u2212(0,300)=(30, \u2212290),","WL2=(35, 10)\u2212(0,300)=(35, \u2212290).","Since we know the scaling we can find where the laser origin is in world units, and the vector VO which defines the offset","VO1=WL1\u2212(L1*scaling),","V02=WL2\u2212(L2*scaling),","V01=V02.","To calculate the amount of rotation between the frames:","VC=C1\u2212C2=(5,0),","VL=L1\u2212L2=(5,0),","UnitVC=(1,0),","UnitVL=(1,0),","angle=UnitVC\u00b7UnitVl (dotProduct),","Rotation=cosine(angle)^(\u22121), and","Rotation=cosine(1)^(\u22121)=0.","With the offset vector VO and the rotation between the planes any coordinates the camera system outputs to the laser can be mapped.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 1-5","FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["20","10","20","20","13","20","14","17","18","15"],"i":["a ","a. "]},"The tracking camera system  outputs digital image frames to a ProductTracker module . A CVTypes module  is a Python programming language wrapper interface to a well-known OpenCV computer vision software library that contains routines that allow the ProductTracker module  to perform image processing necessary to track objects based on the camera images. The OpenCV software library is a computer vision library of open-source software routines originally developed by Intel. The OpenCV software library is a cross-platform library is designed for real-time image processing applications. Routines have been developed that are embedded in the ProductTracker module  and provide for product motion tracking.","The ProductTracker module  performs image thresholding and contour processing to track objects (product ) in the digital image frames, and updates a ProductList module  accordingly. A Product module  stores data that corresponds to or represents the product . The data stored in the Product module  may include a product identifier (id), a lastMatched time-stamp identifier, an x, y position of the product  in the digital image frame, an x, y speed of the product , and product type, for example. The data stored in the Product module  is input to the ProductList module .","An LD2000PY module  is a Python high-level object-oriented programming language wrapper class for a Lasershow Designer LD2000 DLL (dynamically linked library) provided with the LD2000 laser controller hardware by Pangolin Systems. The Python programming language wrapper is used to interface to other application programming interfaces. An application programming interface (API) is well-known to software programmers, and is a set of routines, data structures, object classes and\/or protocols provided by libraries and\/or operating system services in order to support the building of applications.","The LD2000PY module  comprises a laser controller application programming interface that outputs control signals to an LD2000 controller that is coupled to the dual-axis mirror , for example. An FPTDConfig module  is a well-known Python XML (extensible markup language) configuration class that implements XML parsing. The FPTDConfig module  stores configuration settings for the various software modules. The configuration settings stored in the configuration file include calibration values for translating between tracking camera, inspection system camera and laser coordinate systems, the direction of the conveyor belt, and other settings for the specifying how the tracking algorithms should function. A Shapes module  creates symbol shapes in LD2000 frames and outputs a selected shape that is generated by the projection system . The Shapes module generates a series of LD2000PY commands specifying a sequence of relative x, y coordinate locations to point the laser that comprises a frame for the LD2000 laser projection module. The LD2000 laser projection module then moves the laser repeatedly to draw the corresponding shape on the product. An XMLRPCServer module  provides an interface between the inspection system  and the projection system . The XMLRPCServer is an network server uses the well known XMLRPC protocol for relaying information. A LaserClass module  is coupled to the ProductTracker module , the LD2000PY module , the FPTDConfig module , the ProductList module , and the Shapes module . The LaserClass module  interfaces with the laser controller  to control drawing of symbols  by the laser .","More particularly, the software  running on the laser controller  initiates a session with the LD2000 controller . The software  loads configuration files from the FPTDConfig module , and then instantiates the LaserClass, ProductTracker and ProductList modules , , . The ProductTracker module  interfaces with and processes digital image frames output by the camera system  using OpenCV software routines in the CVTypes module . The ProductTracker module  performs image thresholding and contour processing to identify individual products  in the image frame and tracks the products  from frame to frame. The ProductTracker module  updates a list of products  contained in the ProductList module . The Product module  contains data representative of products  that are stored in the ProductList module . The LaserClass module  processes iteratively obtains product location data derived from the ProductTracker module  that is stored in the ProductList module  and uses routines in the LD2000PY module  and a selected symbol shape from the Shapes module  to generate an appropriate symbol  on the product  as is conveyed by the conveyor . The LaserClass module  updates the LaserClass ProductTracker, and ProductList modules , ,  as the product  moves with the conveyor . The software  thus generates one or more symbols  that illuminate and move along with the product  as it is conveyed by the conveyor .","After initialization of components as discussed above, the overall software system implements a loop that runs methods in the modules in sequence:","(1) The ProductTracker modules  is run to find moving product in the view of the tracking camera  and update the ProductList module ;","(2) The XMLRPCServer module  receives inspection system locations about out-of-spec product and updates the ProductList module ;","(3) A ProductList method is called to clear out old Product items and update current locations of Product items; and","(4) The LaserClass module  updates the locations of projected symbols  based on the ProductList by estimating the current locations using the x, y locations and timestamp in each of the Product items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIGS. 9","FIGS. 9"],"i":["a","d ","a","d ","a"],"b":["9","11","9","11","12","15","13","11","12","16","16","16"]},"for the purposes of completeness,  illustrates an exemplary augmented reality product processing method . The Exemplary method  comprises conveying  products  past image acquisition apparatus . Images of products  are generated  as the products  move past the image acquisition apparatus . Selected products in the generated images are identified  based upon predetermined criteria. Symbols are displayed  on the identified products as they are conveyed.","Thus, exemplary product processing systems  and methods  have been disclosed that comprise a conveyor  for moving products , an image acquisition system  for generating images of products  moved by the conveyor  and a symbol generation system for processing the generated images and for displaying symbols  on selected products  moved by the conveyor  based upon predetermined criteria.
