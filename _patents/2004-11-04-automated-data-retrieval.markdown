title: Automated data retrieval
abstract: Information missing from a database record is automatically identified and retrieved. In an embodiment, after the record is initially populated, a status such as complete, incomplete, missing, or verify is assigned to each field in the record. A request for information associated with the status is automatically generated, for instance asking a client to provide missing information or verify existing information. The request is transmitted to the client and solicits the client's response in any of a number of ways, for instance by email, phone, fax, or mail. The information is used to automatically update the record.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 60\/559,169, entitled \u201cMissing Data Collection\u201d and filed Apr. 1, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates in general to database software and in particular to software to facilitate data retrieval.","Tax return preparation is a document intensive process that requires the gathering of information memorialized on disparate paper documents collected from various sources. Once the relevant data has been located, calculations in consultation with tax tables and related official documents are performed to determine a taxpayer's outstanding surplus or debt to the tax authority. In the field of professional tax preparation, it is rarely the case that an individual taxpayer will initially provide a complete client record containing all the necessary information to her tax preparer. More typically, a tax accountant must determine what information is missing from a client record and follow up with requests to the client, typically made over the phone. Tax preparers often have to make several requests for documents, expending considerable energy trying to obtain the required data. Effort spent in the back and forth between tax preparer and client soliciting and providing information can contribute considerably to the overall headache associated with tax preparation.","The problems associated with incomplete or missing data extend generally tax preparation but to settings where data is exchanged between parties. In financial services, for instance, an applicant for a loan or new account may not have information required by the application form at her immediate disposal, requiring a number of iterations to complete the process. Other information sharing environments including accounting, human resources, legal compliance, and procurement are plagued with similar issues. While some online forms allow users to save records they are working on in order to allow them to provide information in stages, there are no systems for proactively gathering the missing information.","What is needed is a way to automate the identification and retrieval of missing or other needed data.","In accordance with the present invention, systems and methods for data retrieval are disclosed. In an embodiment, after a form, application, or record is initially filled out by a client, fields in the record are assigned by the forms preparer's system a status such as missing or complete. A request for missing information is automatically generated at the forms preparer's system that identifies the missing information, saving the client or forms preparer the trouble of having to remember what information is still outstanding. The request is electronically transmitted to the client's computer system. The client receives the request and sends back a response containing the requested information. The forms preparer's system receives the response and can automatically integrate the information contained in the response into the client's record, resulting in a more complete record. The forms preparer can monitor the workflow associated with the data retrieval process\u2014from identifying the missing information to updating the record\u2014using the application in which the form is being prepared. The overall process reduces the administrative burden on both the forms preparer and the client.","In an embodiment, a data retrieval system comprises a database, status module, and data retrieval module. The database includes a plurality of records corresponding to instances of a form, each record associated with a client and containing a plurality of fields and contact information for electronically communicating with the client. The status module is communicatively coupled to the database and is configured to assign a status to each of a plurality of fields of a record including a status associated with obtaining data from the client associated with the record. Responsive to a status of a field in a record associated with obtaining data from the client, the data retrieval module is configured to generate a request to the client using contact information for the client, transmit the request to client, and receive a response from the client to the request.","In another embodiment, information is solicited for a client record by assigning a status to each field of a plurality of fields in the record and automatically generating an information request based on the status of the fields in the record and transmitting the information request to the client. After receiving a response from the client responsive to the request, a field in the record corresponding to the response is updated. In another embodiment, the invention comprises various computer program products for carrying out these and other steps provided.","The figures depict embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following description that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described.","While the present invention will be described in connection with preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary, it may not cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.","Embodiments of the invention can be used to automate aspects of professional tax preparation. Take for example a tax preparation application such as Lacerte Tax, offered by Intuit, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. The application is coupled to a repository or database that stores records for use with the application. The records are organized by taxpayer, so that each taxpayer's record contains the relevant tax information for the taxpayer. The application allows for the manipulation and viewing of data at various levels, including at level of a field within a record, at the record level, and the global level, meaning one or more records stored within the database. The application includes or is coupled to a data retrieval module capable of generating messages based on data stored in the repository. The data retrieval module can create request messages to be sent through a variety of forms of communications depending on the client's needs. The client can then respond to the message by providing any requested information or response, either through a network or following a conventional communications protocol. The data retrieval module forwards the requested information to the application where it is saved to the database. The complete tax return is automatically prepared using the provided information and transmitted to the tax authority.","Data Retrieval System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","130","140","150","160","140","155","130","110","160","110","130","140","140","120"]},"The data retrieval module  creates a request  based on the status of the fields in the database record, for instance asking for additional information to populate fields marked as incomplete or missing. The module transmits requests  to clients  who in turn provide responses  containing the requested information to the data retrieval module  for storage in the database . If the client  does not respond within a predetermined period of time or a response  is incomplete or prompts further inquiry, a reminder or follow-up request  may be provided to the client . Additional calculations or assessments by the user  or application  may be performed based on information stored in the updated record. Once complete, the application or form can be output to a receiving system  for further processing.","Application","The system includes an application  for creating a database record. In an embodiment the application  supports preparation of a form, application, bid or other submission to be submitted to a receiving system  such as a tax authority, school, regulatory authority, compliance agency, competitive bid administrator, or other entity for evaluation. Each record represents an instance of a form or submission associated with a specific client . The application may include a graphical user interface for soliciting the information required for the submission that can be used by the user  or a client  to enter the information provided. The application  may be hosted on a desktop computer, be web-based, or be administered over a corporate network by a secure network server. The application  can be accessed by the user through a user computer (not shown). Access to information stored in the database  is controlled through a log-on or other conventional or emerging authentication system.","Database\/Record","Records created in the application  are stored in a database . The database  could comprise one or more flat, relational, or other types of databases and\/or include a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as offered by Oracle, Sybase, Informix, or Microsoft SQL, or a lightweight database access protocol (LDAP) database. The records may be initially populated by various sources. In one embodiment, the client  uses an interface of the application  to enter the information, for instance, and no involvement from the user  is required. In another embodiment, the client  provides initial information to the user , which uses the application  to create a record to store the client's information. The user provides the information over a network connection . As used herein throughout the disclosure, the term \u201cnetwork connection\u201d refers to any connection or combination of connections supported by a digital, analog, satellite, wireless, firewire (IEEE 1394), 802.11, RF, local and\/or wide area network, Ethernet, instant message, TCP\/IP, HTTP, email, web server, or other communications device, router, or protocol.","In another embodiment, one or more records is initially populated based on existing information about a client . For instance, if a client's tax return from the previous year is stored in the database , in an embodiment, a record comprising a new tax return is created based on information contained in the previous year's tax return such as the client's contact information, number of dependants. A statistical model such as one of the models described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application filed Sep. 7, 2004, Ser. No. 60\/608,035 entitled \u201cMy Tax History,\u201d to Quinn, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, may be used to determine what information is likely to remain unchanged from year to year and can be used to populate the new record.","Status Module","A status module  can be used to indicate the status of fields in one or more records stored in the database . The status module may be integrated into the application , or may be a separate utility that works with the application . In an embodiment, the status module  automatically assigns a status to each field in a record, in another the user  uses the status module  to mark data fields or verify the selections made by the status module . To automatically assign status values to fields in a record, the status module  compares the value stored in each field to an expected value. Referring to a tax return context, for instance, certain fields in a tax form must be populated for every user including identifying data, income data, and the number of dependants. Other fields only need to be populated under certain circumstance, for instance if the client  has capital gains to report. The format of the data provided in each field is also circumscribed\u2014for instance, a social security number field should include a 9-digit integer. A set of rules reflecting these expected values or ranges may be supplied to the module  by the user  or another source. The status module  in turn can automatically assign status values to fields in the record based on the rules\u2014for instance assigning a value of \u201cmissing\u201d to any field where a value is expected and not provided, a status of \u201cincorrect\u201d to any field where a provided value does not conform to an expected value, a status of \u201cincomplete\u201d where data entered is only partial, or by any other status that could be predefined by the application  or which a user  could define and specify. The process of creating a user-defined tag could be facilitated using a \u201ccreate tag\u201d wizard or other user interface. The assigned status value may be stored in \u201cstatus\u201d fields associated with fields of the record.","In another embodiment, a user  can provide and manage status information using a status module .  shows an exemplary user interface that enables a user  to indicate that information in a given field, \u201cHome mortgage interest & points on Form 1098\u201d is \u201cMissing.\u201d As one of skill in the art would know, a variety of fields could be marked as \u201cMissing\u201d or with another status. In the tax preparation arts, for example, a common missing data field is related to stock transactions. If the prior year contains a stock purchase, but no record of the stock exists in the current year, then the accountant must contact the client and obtain that information. The user interface of  includes a context menu including a missing data item  that can be selected to change the status of the field to missing. Other formats for data entry such as a dialog box may also be used. Once the field is tagged as missing, a visual indicator, such as the jagged border shown, is included on the field. Although  depicts a status \u201ctag\u201d attached to an individual field, similar identifiers may be attached to records, or groups of records, stored within the repository. In an embodiment, a database stored in the repository contains a reference to the field along with \u201cmissing data\u201d information. This information includes a custom description for the field, date\/time information, communications data, archiving\/history data, and a status for the field. If the user  marks a field as missing data, a record is added in the database . If the user  removes the missing data tag, the change is recorded in the database . The status module  may include a setting that allows the user to choose the automated setting of status data, based on parameters provided by the user , and the user  can verify those selections using the user interface. Providing a user  with the ability to tag fields as missing in the course of normal data entry minimizes interruption.","Once the status of a record or field is provided, the user  can take an action based on the status.  displays a user interface that allows a user  to take various actions based on the presence of \u201cMissing Data.\u201d In an embodiment, such menu options are only available once a field has been tagged, automatically or manually, as missing. As shown, menu options available to a user include \u201cCollect Missing Data Utility\u201d , selection of which launches a message generation program, or \u201cClear All Missing Data Tags for Client\u201d , which changes the status of fields previously marked as \u201cMissing Data.\u201d One of skill in the art would know that other options, including based on other tags, may also be presented. Toolbar icons, buttons, links, or other graphical interfaces, may also be used.","Data Retrieval Module","The data retrieval module  obtains or receives status information stored in the database  and uses it to obtain the required data or confirmations from one or more clients . In an embodiment, the data retrieval module  comprises a centrally hosted system that receives a notification of status information from the application  over a network connection. The notification specifies relevant fields and\/or records, the status of the fields in the records, and how the information should be retrieved. The notification may provide that several different sources need to be queried for information, for instance, different clients  or their agents if work is being done collaboratively for instance, or the information resides in different places. The data retrieval module  issues requests to all the different sources of data, minimizing the hassle for the user .","In another embodiment, the data retrieval module  queries the database  on a regular basis or in response to a notification from the application  and retrieves information about records in the database  that require follow up action. The data retrieval module  has the necessary authorizations or permissions to access the database  and in an embodiment provides those with its request. The data retrieval module  uses the status information to generate a request  to be sent to a client  based on instructions from the user  stored in the database , status module , or other location. In an embodiment, the data retrieval module  solicits information electronically, through an email, chat, or other request. The request may be automatically formulated and sent by the data retrieval module  or may be created and provided to the user  through an interface for verification before sending. The request may include a link to a secure website or a data object that can be populated, saved, and returned to the data retrieval module . Or the request may solicit a response  from a client  in the form of a return email. Described in greater detail below,  provide exemplary interfaces a user  can use to create such an email request, and  represents a website through which a client  can supply the requested information.","In an embodiment, the data retrieval module  can also transmit the request by email, phone, fax, mail, or other conventional means. The data retrieval module  includes computer software for formulating a request coupled to an output interface for transmitting the request. In the case of a request transmitted to the client's telephone, a standard autodialer system including voice generation, dialing, and\/or messaging capabilities may be used to formulate a message. The phone message may be created using a prerecorded message template, synthesized using voice generation software based on a predetermined text script, or be based on a live recording provided by the user , a call center representative, or other party. Or, the phone message can be generated by application of voice synthesis to an email message that is sent to the client . The autodialer system may in turn transmit the message over a telephone line (for instance a plain old telephone services (POTS), voice over IP, wireless, or other line), leaving a message if the client  is not home. The message may solicit a touch-tone response which is detected and recorded by the data retrieval module , or a verbal response that is recorded, or may comprise a reminder for the client  to provide the data in another form to the user . A verbal rather than text solicitation may be more suitable in certain cases such as where a yes or no response is needed, or there are limited options for selection by the client . In an embodiment, the data retrieval module  differentiates between different types of data requests based on the response solicited or the nature of the information (i.e. whether or not the client  is likely to have the information at her immediate disposal), and chooses the method of communication with the client  based on this response.","In the system shown in , the data retrieval module , database , and application  comprise separate and distinct elements. However, it is not necessary for these and other elements to be housed as shown; the elements can be hosted by other entities or in sub-modules of the elements may stand-alone or together. In addition, embodiments of the invention may not require any intervention from a user , and be administered purely between the data retrieval system  and clients . Likewise, as these and other elements are described throughout the invention, it should be understood that various embodiments of the invention may exclude elements and sub-elements described, or include other components entirely.","Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","202","204","204","206","208","210","212","214","216","218","212","200"]},"The processor  may be any general-purpose processor such as an INTEL x86, SUN MICROSYSTEMS SPARC, HP NonStop, or POWERPC compatible-CPU. The storage device  is, in one embodiment, a hard disk drive but can also be any other device capable of storing data, such as a writeable compact disk (CD) or DVD, or a solid-state memory device. The memory  may be, for example, firmware, read-only memory (ROM), non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM), and\/or RAM, and holds instructions and data used by the processor . The pointing device  may be a mouse, track ball, or other type of pointing device, and is used in combination with the keyboard  to input data into the computer system . The graphics adapter  displays images and other information on the display . The network adapter  couples the computer system  to the network.","As is known in the art, the computer system  is adapted to execute computer program modules for providing functionality described herein. As used herein, the term \u201cmodule\u201d can refer to computer program logic for providing the specified functionality. A module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and\/or software. Preferably, a module is stored on the storage device , loaded into the memory , and executed by the processor .","The types of hardware and software within the computer system  may vary depending upon the implementation of the data retrieval system . For example, a data retrieval system  operating in a high-volume environment may have multiple processors and hard drive subsystems in order to provide a high processing throughput, as well as be coupled to multiple clients  and users . Likewise, certain embodiments may omit certain components, such as the display , keyboard , and\/or network adapter  depending upon the specific capabilities of the system. In addition, the computer system  may support additional conventional functionality not described in detail herein, such as displaying images in a variety of formats, allowing users to securely log into the system, and supporting administrative capabilities.","Interfaces for Message Creation","As described above, in embodiments of the invention, requests for missing data are transparently generated and sent automatically without the need for user  input. However, the user  may also use an interface to verify or provide input to message creation. An interface for use with a \u201cCollect Missing Data Utility,\u201d one example of the data retrieval module  of , is shown in . As shown, the data retrieval module  can generate an email message requesting information tagged in the repository  as missing and send the message to a client  through a user's e-mail program. However, the data retrieval module  can also output status information to a printable or an electronic document such as a PDF that can be provided to the client or used internally. To generate the list  of missing data shown in the upper window of the interface in , the data retrieval module  queries the database for missing data for the particular taxpayer whose record is being worked on. By selecting the \u201cPrint Missing Data Report\u201d option  shown on the toolbar, a user  can generate a record report such as that shown in  or .","A pre-populated message template  is provided in the lower portion of the interface of . The data retrieval module  accesses the relevant client record in the repository  and collects addressing information, and also includes a Subject, Salutation, and Greeting selected based on default information provided by the data retrieval module  or instructions provided by the user . Any of this information can be changed by the user , and as described above, may be saved for use in the creation of future messages. The user  will also be able to choose the address to which the reply from the client taxpayer  will be returned. The program will default to the email address for the appropriate client  (as determined by the email addresses entered in) or allow the user  to select a different address to which the reply from the taxpayer  will be returned.","This information, as well as the user's  choices of what data fields to include, is used to generate an e-mail message such as the message depicted in  using Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) or existing or emerging protocol offering the same functionality. An e-mail is then created in the user's  local e-mail program, for instance Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo!Mail, or other MAPI-enabled program. In an embodiment, where the user's  email program cannot be directly accessed, the utility does not actually create an email but instead creates a text message that can be pasted into a blank email by the user . In an embodiment the message is output to an electronic notepad, note, or similar simple format; in another the message text is copied to a user's electronic clipboard, so it can it does not have to be copied before it is pasted into a message by the user . The user  then pastes the relevant text into a message form of the user's email program and sends to the client  over a network.","The table of missing data items  shown in the top portion of  allows the user  to specify whether the missing data should be included in the email message. The user  is given the ability to choose missing data fields to include in this message through checkboxes that are checked in their default form. The table also details which IRS or state tax form the missing data is associated with and provides the data field name, including a link back to the actual data entry field. The link allows the user  to directly access the underlying data field if need be. Using the \u201cNames to use in Report\/E-mail\u201d field, the user  can change the description provided by the tax program for any of the input fields tagged as \u201cmissing\u201d. Changing the name allows the user  to provide a more specific description to the tax payer (e.g., instead of \u201cHome Mortgage Interest\u201d, using a description of \u201cInterest on your BigBank Home Loan\u201d). These descriptions can be specified at any time\u2014including during the setup phase of the data retrieval module  or application , when the user  chooses to change the settings associated with the utility, or on the interface of . If the user  makes a change from one screen associated with a client, in an embodiment, the data retrieval utility  saves this information to be used in subsequent emails to other clients; alternatively however, the user  may also specify that the description only be used for the current or a subset of messages generated. If the user  does not choose to specify its own descriptions, this column is pre-populated with the existing data field name, otherwise it is pre-populated with shorthand or other descriptions previously provided by the user . The rightmost column of the table indicates whether or not an email request has been sent.","After making the appropriate selections of data items to include in the email, the user  can further customize the email message, by modifying the salutation, subject line, and greeting (body) text. When the user  is satisfied with the email, the user  clicks on the \u201cCreate Email\u201d button that creates the email and provides it to an email application, for final formatting, editing, and sending. As soon as the \u201cCreate Email\u201d option on the bottom of the interface is chosen, the data retrieval module  changes the status to \u201csent.\u201d Alternatively, the data retrieval module  can have a built in email interface, and directly send the email.","The data retrieval module  can solicit input from a client in any or a combination of different mechanisms. The email message to the client shown in  includes a link  embedded into a text description to a secure website operated by the tax preparer . The link  includes the necessary information (e.g., a client ID) to query the data repository for the relevant missing data fields for the client , which field information is provided to a web server. When the client  activates the link in the email, a browser application is invoked and contacts the web server, passing in the parameters that identify the client  (e.g., the client ID). The web server creates a web page including form fields for each of the missing data fields, and provides it to the browser. An exemplary web page form provided in this manner is shown in .","Alternatively, the data retrieval module  can create and send a data object to a client  that provides fields in which the client  can enter data. The object could be a HTML (or XML or other) file that can be saved once new data is entered that resembles the web page shown in . This way, a client  does not have to be connected to a network to modify and save her data. The data object can also be a simple text file, a spreadsheet, a self-extracting, self installing, executable application, or a Java applet. Other data objects, such as objects with limited input functionality like those provided by Intuit's E-Organizer application could be used or modified to provide an electronic form that the user can fill out.","In an embodiment, a form provided to the client , whether it be posted on a website or sent as a data object, includes data the client has already provided in a grayed out form. When the client  enters the missing data, in an embodiment, a utility, for instance, embedded in the form calculates a result taking into account the newly supplied data, for instance, a tax return amount. This provides an additional incentive for the client  to supply her missing data. In another embodiment, the missing data is associated with the source documents that have the missing data. After the data retrieval module  accesses the database to determine which fields are missing, it maps these to the corresponding sources, and then outputs the sources (e.g. \u201cW-2\u201d), rather than just the fields themselves, into a message to be provided to the client. All of these output options could be presented to the user  in the \u201cCollect Missing Data Utility\u201d interface shown in , in the form of a \u201cSpecify output\u201d button shown, or through a pull-down menu, or other interface with or without user interactivity.","Receiving Requested Data",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["160","110"]},"In an embodiment, a client  supplies the requested data using an electronic form posted to a website. The data is received by the web server, which forwards it to the data repository for storage in the client's record. In this way, the missing data is automatically added to the client's record in the database, avoiding the need for the tax preparer user to manually view and enter the data provided by the client. In an embodiment, the user can also track the client's progress, including when the website was accessed, for instance, thus helping the user to determine when a client address is no longer working. The data provided by the client  can be marked as \u201csubject to confirmation\u201d so that a user , when they access the client record, can review the responses received before accepting them into the client record. In another embodiment, a data object containing the data requested is returned to the user, through an email or another messaging format. In an embodiment, the object is tagged, and the data retrieval module  is programmed to search for it periodically on the memory of the user's computer. The data retrieval module  then populates the database with the data contained in the data object. Although these steps occur automatically, in an embodiment, the user  receives a message or indication that data has been received.","In another embodiment, the client  returns the information in the form of touch tone selections during a phone message that can be processed by a touch tone detection system and added to the database . In another embodiment, the client  provides the information in an email or other message, and the user  or other party has several options for how to enter the data. The user  can either enter the data by simply accessing the appropriate input field, or she can use the \u201cmissing data\u201d utility to \u201cJump-to\u201d the related fields previously marked as missing. Once data has been supplied to the field, the missing data tag is automatically removed. If no data is ever provided by the client  for a specific field, the user will have the ability to simply remove the missing data tag from the input field via various different means (using a function within the utility, at the input field level, or at the record level, or globally).","Status Reports","Various diagnostics and reports are available to the user  to view, manage, and manipulate status data at the field, record, or global level. The outputs discussed below can be generated by a report module integrated into the application  that queries the database  for the status information.  shows one example of a diagnostic output of all or a subset of records in the database that indicates through a checkmark in a column  that fields in several records have been marked as missing. The last date on which a field was tagged as missing could also be included in the interface of , to help a user  prioritize which clients  to pursue. An icon on the toolbar can be used to activate the data retrieval module  to retrieve the missing information. A user  can select an option to access a summary of client records that have \u201cMissing Data.\u201d  shows a report that only includes records that have missing data, and provides the taxpayer's phone number with which a user  can call the client .
