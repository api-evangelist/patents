More specifically, this invention relates to novel benzodiazepine compounds derivatives thereof, intermediates thereof, conjugates thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as medicaments, in particular as anti-proliferative agents.","This invention also describes the use of imine reactive reagents for the preparation of conjugates of cell-binding agents with DNA-binding cytotoxic drugs containing one or more imine functional groups.","Benzodiazepine derivatives are useful compounds for treating various disorders, and include medicaments such as, antiepileptics (imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,5]benzothiadiazepines, U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,688; U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,852), antibacterials (pyrimido[1,2-c][1,3,5]benzothiadiazepines, GB 1476684), diuretics and hypotensives (pyrrolo(1,2-b)[1,2,5]benzothiadiazepine 5,5 dioxide, U.S. Pat. No. 3,506,646), hypolipidemics (WO 03091232), anti-depressants (U.S. Pat. No. 3,453,266); osteoporosis (JP 2138272).","Recently, it has been shown in animal tumor models that benzodiazepine derivatives, such as pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs), act as anti-tumor agents (N-2-imidazolyl alkyl substituted 1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine-1,1-dioxide, U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,746), benzo-pyrido or dipyrido thiadiazepine (WO 2004\/069843), pyrrolo[1,2-b][1,2,5]benzothiadiazepines and pyrrolo[1,2-b][1,2,5]benzodiazepine derivatives (WO2007\/015280), tomaymycin derivatives (e.g., pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines), such as those described in WO 00\/12508, WO2005\/085260, WO2007\/085930, and EP 2019104. Benzodiazepines are also known to affect cell growth and differentiation (Kamal A., et al., Bioorg Med. Chem. 2008 Aug. 15; 16(16):7804-10 (and references cited therein); Kumar R, Mini Rev Med. Chem. 2003 June; 3(4):323-39 (and references cited therein); Bednarski J J, et al., 2004; Sutter A. P, et al., 2002; Blatt N B, et al., 2002), Kamal A. et al., Current Med. Chem., 2002; 2; 215-254, Wang J-J., J. Med. Chem., 2206; 49:1442-1449, Alley M. C. et al., Cancer Res. 2004; 64:6700-6706, Pepper C. J., Cancer Res 2004; 74:6750-6755, Thurston D. E. and Bose D. S., Chem Rev 1994; 94:433-465; and Tozuka, Z., et al., Journal of Antibiotics, (1983) 36; 1699-1708. General structure of PBDs is described in US Publication Number 20070072846. The PBDs differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove and crosslink DNA enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their potential for use as antiproliferative agents.","The first pyrrolobenzodiazepine to enter the clinic, SJG-136 (NSC 694501) is a potent cytotoxic agent that causes DNA inter-strand crosslinks (S. G Gregson et al., 200144: 737-748; M. C. Alley et al., 200464: 6700-6706; J. A. Hartley et al., 200464: 6693-6699; C. Martin et al., 200544: 4135-4147; S. Arnould et al., 20065: 1602-1509). Results from a Phase I clinical evaluation of SJG-136 revealed that this drug was toxic at extremely low doses (maximum tolerated dose of 45 \u03bcg\/m, and several adverse effects were noted, including vascular leak syndrome, peripheral edema, liver toxicity and fatigue. DNA damage was noted at all doses in circulating lymphocytes (D. Hochhauser et al., 200915: 2140-2147). Thus, there exists a need for improved benzodiazepine derivatives that are less toxic and still therapeutically active for treating a variety of proliferative disease states, such as cancer.","Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly being explored as therapeutic agents against cancer. Several monoclonal antibodies against cancer cell-surface antigens have already been approved for cancer treatment, such as rituximab for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, trastuzumab for breast cancer, cetuximab for head and neck and colorectal cancer, cetuximab, panitimumab, and bevacizumab for colorectal cancer, and alemtuzumab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Strome, S. E., Sausville, E. A., and Mann, D., 2007, The Oncologist, 12, 1084-1095). However, the cytotoxic activity of a \u201cnaked\u201d antibody can be limited to the mechanisms of receptor function inhibition, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).","An approach to enhance the cytotoxic activity of antibody toward target cancer cells is by linking antibody with cytotoxic effectors (A. D. Ricart, and A. W. Tolcher, 2007, Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 4, 245-255; Lambert, J., 2010, Drugs of the Future 35, 471-480). The antibody-cytotoxic drug conjugate (ADC) binds specifically to cancer cells, followed by conjugate internalization and degradation, which results in the intracellular release of the toxic drug and ultimately to the death of the cancer cells. The cytotoxic drugs that have been employed in linkage with antibodies include antitubulin drugs such as maytansinoids and auristatins, DNA-binding drugs such as calicheamicin that causes sequence-specific double-stranded DNA cleavage. Another class of DNA-binding cytotoxic drugs includes imine-containing pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBD) such as N-2-imidazolyl alkyl substituted 1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine-1,1-dioxide, U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,746), benzo-pyrido or dipyrido thiadiazepine (WO 2004\/069843), pyrrolo[1,2-b][1,2,5]benzothiadiazepines and pyrrole[1,2-b][1,2,5]benzodiazepine derivatives (WO2007\/015280), tomaymycin derivatives (e.g., pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines), such as those described in WO 00\/12508, WO2005\/085260, WO2007\/085930, EP 2019104, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,746). Other DNA-binding benzodiazepine drugs are described in US Patent Publication No. 2010\/0203007A1. These benzodiazepine drugs containing imine bonds bind to the minor groove of DNA and interfere with DNA function, resulting in cell death.","There is a need for new methods for preparing conjugates of cell-binding agent and cytotoxic drugs bearing an imine group.","Cytotoxic benzodiazepine dimers disclosed in the art possess two imine functionalities in their free form or reversibly protected form, such as a hydrate, alkoxylate or sulfonate. The presence of these two imine functionalities results in crosslinking of DNA (S. G. Gregson et al., 200144: 737-748). The present invention is partly based on the unexpected finding that cell binding agent conjugates of new cytotoxic benzodiazepine derivatives, such as pyrrolobenzodiazapene dimers that are devoid of two imine functionalities (e.g., one imine functionality and one amine functionality), and thus incapable of crosslinking DNA, display a much higher therapeutic index (ratio of maximum tolerated dose to minimum effective dose) in vivo compared to benzodiazepine derivatives that can crosslink DNA that are previously disclosed in the art.","Thus one object of the invention is to provide cytotoxic compound comprising a linking group with a reactive group bonded thereto capable of covalently linking the cytotoxic compound to a cell binding agent (CBA, see below), wherein the cytotoxic compound is represented by any one of the following formulas:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"82.04mm","wi":"118.19mm","file":"US09534000-20170103-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein:\n\n","In certain embodiments, X is not the linking group with the reactive group bonded thereto.

Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent wherein at least one non-hydrogen substituent is in the place of a hydrogen substituent on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro substituent, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro substituents.

Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and I or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier.

Typically, the linker is substantially inert under conditions for which the two groups it is connecting are linked. A bifunctional crosslinking agent may comprise two reactive groups, one at each ends of a linker moiety, such that one reactive group can be first reacted with the cytotoxic compound to provide a compound bearing the linker moiety and a second reactive group, which can then react with a cell binding agent. Alternatively, one end of the bifunctional crosslinking agent can be first reacted with the cell binding agent to provide a cell binding agent bearing a linker moiety and a second reactive group, which can then react with a cytotoxic compound. The linking moiety may contain a chemical bond that allows for the release of the cytotoxic moiety at a particular site.

In these figures, the synthesis of the mono reduced dimer (i.e., having one imine group) is accomplished by a two step coupling method, in which a reduced form of monomer is either initially coupled to the linker followed by coupling with the PBD monomer or the dimer is prepared using a mixture of both reduced monomer and the PBD monomer in the coupling with the reactive linker. While the di-reduced dimer is potentially a byproduct of the second synthetic pathway previously described (such as ), a more direct route is possible in which two reduced monomers are coupled to the linker directly.","Cell-Binding Agents","The effectiveness of the conjugates of the invention as therapeutic agents depends on the careful selection of an appropriate cell-binding agent. Cell-binding agents may be of any kind presently known, or that become known and includes peptides and non-peptides. Generally, these can be antibodies (especially monoclonal antibodies), lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, vitamins (such as folate etc., which may bind to a cell surface receptor thereof, e.g., a folate receptor), nutrient-transport molecules (such as transferrin), or any other cell-binding molecule or substance.","In certain embodiments, the cell-binding agents are proteins or polypeptides, or compounds comprising proteins or polypeptides. Preferably, the proteins or polypeptides comprise one or more Lys residues with side chain \u2014NHgroups. Alternatively or in addition, the proteins or polypeptides comprise one or more Cys residues. The side chain \u2014SH groups of the Cys residues may be intact, or may be in a disulfide bond that can be reduced. Preferably, reduction of the disulfide bond(s) does not significantly negatively impact the cell-binding function of the proteins or polypeptides (e.g., in the case of antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof, reduction of the disulfide bonds does not substantially increase the dissociation of light chains\/heavy chains).","The Lys side chain \u2014NHgroups and\/or the Cys side chain \u2014SH groups may be covalently linked to the linkers, which are in turn linked to the dimer compounds of the invention, thus conjugating the cell-binding agents to the dimer compounds of the invention. Each protein-based cell-binding agents may contain multiple Lys side chain \u2014NHgroups and\/or the Cys side chain \u2014SH groups available for linking the compounds of the invention through the bifunctional crosslinkers.","More specific examples of cell-binding agents that can be used include:","polyclonal antibodies;","monoclonal antibodies;","fragments of antibodies such as Fab, Fab\u2032, and F(ab\u2032), Fv, minibodies, diabodies, tribodies, tetrabodies (Parham, 131:2895-2902 (1983); Spring et al. 113:470-478 (1974); Nisonoff et al. 89:230-244 (1960), Kim et al., Mol, Cancer Ther., 7: 2486-2497 (2008), Carter, Nature Revs., 6: 343-357 (2006));","interferons (e.g. \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3);","lymphokines such as IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6;","hormones such as insulin, TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone), MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone), steroid hormones, such as androgens and estrogens;","growth factors and colony-stimulating factors such as EGF, TGF-alpha, FGF, VEGF, G-CSF, M-CSF and GM-CSF (Burgess, 5:155-158 (1984));","transferrin (O'Keefe et al. 260:932-937 (1985));","vitamins, such as folate;","Protein scaffolds based on a consensus sequence of fibronectin type III (FN3) repeats (also known as Centyrins; See U.S. Patent Publication 2010\/0255056, incorporated herein by reference);","Designer Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins; U.S. Patent Application Nos. 20040132028; 20090082274; 20110118146; 20110224100, incorporated herein by reference), C. Zahnd et al. 2010, Cancer Res., 70; 1595-1605, incorporated herein by reference); and,","Fibronectin domain scaffold proteins (Adnectins: US Patent Application Nos. 20070082365; 20080139791, incorporated herein by reference).","Monoclonal antibody techniques allow for the production of extremely specific cell-binding agents in the form of specific monoclonal antibodies. Particularly well known in the art are techniques for creating monoclonal antibodies produced by immunizing mice, rats, hamsters or any other mammal with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell, antigens isolated from the target cell, whole virus, attenuated whole virus, and viral proteins such as viral coat proteins. Sensitized human cells can also be used. Another method of creating monoclonal antibodies is the use of phage libraries of scFv (single chain variable region), specifically human scFv (see e.g., Griffiths et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,885,793 and 5,969,108; McCafferty et al., WO 92\/01047; Liming et al., WO 99\/06587). In addition, resurfaced antibodies disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,641 may also be used, as may chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies. Selection of the appropriate cell-binding agent is a matter of choice that depends upon the particular cell population that is to be targeted, but in general human monoclonal antibodies are preferred if an appropriate one is available.","For example, the monoclonal antibody MY9 is a murine IgG1 antibody that binds specifically to the CD33 Antigen {J. D. Griffin et al 8 Leukemia Res., 521 (1984)} and can be used if the target cells express CD33 as in the disease of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The cell-binding agent may be any compound that can bind a cell, either in a specific or non-specific manner. Generally, these can be antibodies (especially monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments), interferons, lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, vitamins, nutrient-transport molecules (such as transferrin), or any other cell-binding molecule or substance.","Where the cell-binding agent is an antibody, it binds to an antigen that is a polypeptide and may be a transmembrane molecule (e.g. receptor) or a ligand such as a growth factor. Exemplary antigens include molecules such as renin; a growth hormone, including human growth hormone and bovine growth hormone; growth hormone releasing factor; parathyroid hormone; thyroid stimulating hormone; lipoproteins; alpha-1-antitrypsin; insulin A-chain; insulin B-chain; proinsulin; follicle stimulating hormone; calcitonin; luteinizing hormone; glucagon; clotting factors such as factor vmc, factor IX, tissue factor (TF), and von Willebrands factor; anti-clotting factors such as Protein C; atrial natriuretic factor; lung surfactant; a plasminogen activator, such as urokinase or human urine or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA); bombesin; thrombin; hemopoietic growth factor; tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta; enkephalinase; RANTES (regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted); human macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1-alpha); a serum albumin, such as human serum albumin; Muellerian-inhibiting substance; relaxin A-chain; relaxin B-chain; prorelaxin; mouse gonadotropin-associated peptide; a microbial protein, such as beta-lactamase; DNase; IgE; a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen (CTLA), such as CTLA-4; inhibin; activin; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); receptors for hormones or growth factors; protein A or D; rheumatoid factors; a neurotrophic factor such as bone-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, -4, -5, or -6 (NT-3, NT4, NT-5, or NT-6), or a nerve growth factor such as NGF-\u03b2; platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF); fibroblast growth factor such as aFGF and bFGF; fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), epidermal growth factor (EGF); transforming growth factor (TGF) such as TGF-alpha and TGF-beta, including TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, TGF-\u03b23, TGF-\u03b24, or TGF-\u03b25; insulin-like-growth factor-I and -II (IGF-I and IGF-II); des(1-3)-IGF-I (brain IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, melanotransferrin, EpCAM, GD3, FLT3, PSMA, PSCA, MUC1, MUC16, STEAP, CEA, TENB2, EphA receptors, EphB receptors, folate receptor, FOLR1, mesothelin, cripto, alphabeta, integrins, VEGF, VEGFR, EGFR, transferrin receptor, IRTA1, IRTA2, IRTA3, IRTA4, IRTA5; CD proteins such as CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD6, CD8, CD11, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD25, CD26, CD28, CD30, CD33, CD36, CD37, CD38, CD40, CD44, CD52, CD55, CD56, CD59, CD70, CD79, CD80.

IL-2 which binds to activated T-cells can be used for prevention of transplant graft rejection, for therapy and prevention of graft-versus-host disease, and for treatment of acute T-cell leukemia. MSH, which binds to melanocytes, can be used for the treatment of melanoma, as can antibodies directed towards melanomas.

cytotoxic compounds or derivative thereof of the present invention to the cell-binding agent, the cytotoxic compound may comprise a linking moiety with a reactive group bonded thereto. In one embodiment, a bifunctional crosslinking reagent can be first reacted with the cytotoxic compound to provide the compound bearing a linking moiety with one reactive group bonded thereto (i.e., drug-linker compound), which can then react with a cell binding agent. Alternatively, one end of the bifunctional crosslinking reagent can first react with the cell binding agent to provide the cell binding agent bearing a linking moiety with one reactive group bonded thereto, which can then react with a cytotoxic compound. The linking moiety may contain a chemical bond that allows for the release of the cytotoxic moiety at a particular site. Suitable chemical bonds are well known in the art and include disulfide bonds, thioether bonds, acid labile bonds, photolabile bonds, peptidase labile bonds and esterase labile bonds (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020; 5,475,092; 6,441,163; 6,716,821; 6,913,748; 7,276,497; 7,276,499; 7,368,565; 7,388,026 and 7,414,073). Preferred are disulfide bonds, thioether and peptidase labile bonds. Other linkers that can be used in the present invention include non-cleavable linkers, such as those described in are described in detail in U.S. publication number 2005\/0169933, or charged linkers or hydrophilic linkers and are described in US 2009\/0274713, US 2010\/01293140 and WO 2009\/134976, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.","The compounds of the invention, such as those in formulas (V)-(VII), (Va)-(VIIa), (VAa)-(VIIAa) and (VIIA2a), and (VBa)-(VIIBa) and (VIIB2a) can be linked through L, L\u2032, L\u2033, L\u2032\u2033, X (when present), Y, X\u2032, Y\u2032, R, Qor Q\u2032. Of these, preferred linkable groups are L\u2032, L\u2033, L\u2032\u2033 and Qor Q\u2032, and most preferred linkable groups are L\u2032 and Qor Q\u2032.","In one embodiment, a solution of an antibody in aqueous buffer may be incubated with a molar excess of an antibody modifying agent such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) or with N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoate (SPDB) to introduce dithiopyridyl groups. The modified antibody is then reacted with the thiol-containing cytotoxic compound to produce a disulfide-linked antibody-benzodiazepine dimer conjugate. The cell binding agent-drug conjugate may then be purified using any purification methods known in the art, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,811,572 and US Publication No. 2006\/0182750, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. For example, the cell-binding agent-drug conjugate can be purified using tangential flow filtration, adsorptive chromatography, adsorptive filtration, selective precipitation, non-absorptive filtration or combination thereof. Preferably, tangential flow filtration (TFF, also known as cross flow filtration, ultrafiltration and diafiltration) and\/or adsorptive chromatography resins are used for the purification of the conjugates.","Alternatively, the antibody may be incubated with a molar excess of an antibody modifying agent such as 2-iminothiolane, L-homocysteine thiolactone (or derivatives), or N-succinimidyl-5-acetylthioacetate (SATA) to introduce sulfhydryl groups. The modified antibody is then reacted with the appropriate disulfide-containing cytotoxic agent, to produce a disulfide-linked antibody-cytotoxic agent conjugate. The antibody-cytotoxic agent conjugate may then be purified by methods described above. The cell binding may also be engineered to introduce thiol moieties, such as cysteine-engineered antibodies disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,772,485 and 7,855,275.","In another embodiment, a solution of an antibody in aqueous buffer may be incubated with a molar excess of an antibody-modifying agent such as N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate to introduce maleimido groups, or with N-succinimidyl-4-(iodoacetyl)-aminobenzoate (SIAB) to introduce iodoacetyl groups. The modified antibody is then reacted with the thiol-containing cytotoxic agent to produce a thioether-linked antibody-cytotoxic conjugate. The antibody-cytotoxic conjugate may then be purified by methods described above.","The number of cytotoxic molecules bound per antibody molecule can be determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the ratio of the absorbance at 280 nm and 330 nm. An average of 1-10 cytotoxic compounds\/antibody molecule(s) can be linked by the methods described herein. The preferred average number of linked cytotoxic compounds per antibody molecule is 2-5, and the most preferred is 2.5-4.0.","Cytotoxic agents containing linkers terminating in an N-hydroxy succinimidyl (NHS) ester can react with the antibody to produce direct amide linked conjugates. The antibody-cytotoxic agent conjugate may then be purified by gel-filtration by any methods described above.","Representative processes for preparing the cell-binding agent-drug conjugates of the present invention are shown in . A cytotoxic dimer compound of the present invention can be conjugated with a cell binding agent through either a one-step or a two-step conjugation method. In , representative examples are described, wherein a dimer compound that possesses a linker such as an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester is reacted directly with a cell binding agent, such as an antibody, generating the desired conjugate. In linkable dimer 13f was first treated with sodium bisulfate to provide a modified dimer compound before adding antibody to form the conjugate of the present invention.","A representative example of a two-step conjugation method is described in , wherein an antibody is first modified with a bifunctional crosslinking agent resulting in an antibody that possesses a desired number of linkers suitable for reaction with a dimer compound having a free thiol moiety. In this example the antibody huMy9-6 was first modified with SPDB to give an antibody with linkers containing the dithiopyridyl moiety. The modified antibody was then exposed to a free thiol, such as 5d, generating the desired conjugate huMy9-6-SPDB-5d.","Processes for synthesizing the drug-linker compounds and conjugates of the

For example, cell lines such as the human colon carcinoma line COLO 205, the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RH-30, and the multiple myeloma cell line MOLP-8 can be used for the assessment of cytotoxicity of these compounds and conjugates. Cells to be evaluated can be exposed to the compounds or conjugates for 1-5 days and the surviving fractions of cells measured in direct assays by known methods. ICvalues can then be calculated from the results of the assays. Alternatively or in addition, an in vitro cell line sensitivity screen, such as the one described by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (see Voskoglou-Nomikos et al., 2003, Clinical Cancer Res. 9: 42227-4239, incorporated herein by reference) can be used as one of the guides to determine the types of cancers that may be sensitive to treatment with the compounds or conjugates of the invention.","All of the conjugates are expected to be extremely cytotoxic on the antigen positive cancer cells with an ICin the low picomolar range. Antigen negative cell lines are expected to remain viable when exposed to the same conjugates. Related indolinobenzodiazepine dimers showed target specific potency being 160 fold less potent when blocked with unconjugated antibody huMy9-6 (anti-CD33) and 40 less potent when blocked with unconjugated antibody FOLR1 (anti-folate receptor antibody). For example, the huMy9-6-SPDB-If conjugate killed antigen positive HL60\/QC cells with an ICvalue of 10.5 pM, while the addition of an excess of unconjugated huMy9-6 antibody reduced this cytotoxic effect (IC=1.69 nM), demonstrating antigen specificity. In addition, the huMy9-6-SPDB-1f conjugate is also highly potent towards both the HL60\/ATCC cell line with an ICvalue of 21 pM and the NB-4 cell line with an ICvalue of 190 pM.","Similarly, the huFOLR1-SPDB-1f conjugate was highly potent, with an ICvalue of 55 pM for antigen positive KB cells. Addition of an excess of unconjugated huFOLR1 antibody reduced this cytotoxic effect >40 fold, demonstrating antigen-specificity.","The effect of conjugation on antibody binding can be measured by comparing the binding of both unconjugated huMy9-6 antibody and the huMy9-6-SPDB conjugate towards the HL60\/QC cell line. FACS analysis will reveal that there is no change in binding capability of the conjugate to naked antibody, indicating that there is no compromise in binding due to conjugation of the cytotoxic agent to the antibody.","In vivo efficacy of a cell binding agent\/cytotoxic agent conjugate can be experimentally measured. For example, nude mice bearing human HL60\/QC tumors can be treated with huMy9-6-SPDB-cytotoxic compound conjugate, and significant tumor regression is expected at multiple doses while untreated mice grow tumors rapidly.","Compositions and Methods of Use","The present invention includes a composition (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition) comprising novel benzodiazepine compounds described herein (e.g., indolinobenzodiazepine or oxazolidinobenzodiazepine), derivatives thereof, or conjugates thereof, (and\/or solvates, hydrates and\/or salts thereof) and a carrier (a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier).

In some cases, in addition or as an alternative, nude rats may be employed. The conjugates to be tested include any one or more of the conjugates described herein. The various tumor cell lines that can be used for inoculating the nude mice included HL60\/QC, MOLM-13, NB4, HEL92.1.7, OCI-AML3, KB, and\/or any other cancer cell lines recognized in the art as a proper model for a disease indication (e.g., cancer). Some criteria that may be applied for the selection of tumor cell lines suitable for in vivo evaluation include: a) expression of the target antigen on the tumor cell, and, b) sensitivity of tumor cells to the unconjugated drug in vitro. For example, an in vitro cell line sensitivity screen, such as the 60-cell line screen described by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (see Voskoglou-Nomikos et al., 2003, Clinical Cancer Res. 9; 42227-4239, incorporated herein by reference) can be used as one of the guides to determine the types of cancers that may be suitable for treatment with the compounds of the invention. The potency of the various conjugates against the various tumor cell lines, as expressed by ICvalues (nM), is measured accordingly.","The various tumor cell lines are inoculated to nude or SCID mice using substantially the same protocol as outlined herein. For example, about 1\u00d710-5\u00d710tumor cells (typically 1\u00d710) cells\/mouse are subcutaneously inoculated at a volume of approximately 0.1-0.2 mL\/mouse, in the area over the right shoulder of female athymic nude mice, 6 weeks of age. When the tumor has reached an average size of \u02dc100 mm(typically 6 to 8 days after tumor cell inoculation), mice are randomized into groups (e.g., n=5-8 per group) by tumor volume. Treatment is initiated the day after randomization, and groups includes a control group dosed with the appropriate vehicle (200 \u03bcL\/injection), or a single treatment at various doses (5 to 700 \u03bcg\/kg) of the above referenced drug conjugates (50 \u03bcg\/kg linked drug dose corresponded to about 2 mg\/kg antibody dose). Multiple dosing schedules (for example treatment at day 1, 3, 5, or day 1, 4, 7) may also be employed.","Median and mean tumor volume vs time is measured, with the data demonstrating a dose-dependent anti-tumor activity of the subject conjugates. The minimum effective dose is then calculated and compared to the maximum tolerated dose.","Humanized My9-6 antibody at 2 mg\/ml is conjugated with 9 molar equivalents of 2-NHS ester (of a subject cytotoxic compound) for 3 hrs at 25\u00b0 C. in 85% PBS, pH 7.4, containing 15% DMA (v\/v) and then purified over a G25 desalting column in PBS, pH 7.4, to remove unreacted or hydrolyzed, unconjugated drug. The conjugate is dialyzed in 10 mM Histidine, 250 mM Glycine, pH 6.5 buffer, containing 1% sucrose. The conjugate drug\/antibody ratio (DAR) is determined to be about 1.5 DAR based on UV absorbance at 280 and 320 nm and calculation using the extinction coefficients of the drug and antibody at 280 nm and 320 nm.","The conjugate is analyzed for monomer % by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a TSK-Gel G300SWXL column (7.8 mm\u00d7300 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size) using an isocratic mobile phase of 400 mm sodium perchlorate, 150 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 1 ml\/min. The percentage of monomer (% monomer) and aggregate are determined by monitoring the UV absorbance of all antibody species at 280 nm and measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of each antibody peak. Additionally, the percentage (%) of drug on both the monomer and the aggregate are determined by monitoring the UV absorbance of all antibody species at 320 nm and 280 nm and measuring the AUC of each antibody peak.","For free (unconjugated) drug assay, the conjugate is acetone extracted to remove protein, dried, and reconstituted in mobile phase and injected onto a VYDAC 208TP C8 reverse phase HPLC column (4.6\u00d7250 mm, 7 \u03bcm particle size) using a linear gradient of 20% acetonitrile and 80% deionized going up to 100% acetonitrile, all containing 0.025% acetic acid, at 1 ml\/min over 48 min and compared to drug-methyl ester standards. The percentage of free, unconjugated drug in the conjugate is expected to be <1% of conjugated drug.","For the conjugation of 2-NHS ester (a cytotoxic compound) using sodium bisulfite, the 2-NHS ester (cytotoxic compound) is pre-incubated with 0.9 molar equivalents of sodium bisulfite (freshly prepared NaHSOin deionized water) in 66% DMA (dimethylacetamide) in water for 30 min at 25\u00b0 C.

The conjugate is dialyzed in 10 mM histidine, 250 mM glycine, 1% sucrose, pH 6.5 buffer.","The DAR of the conjugate prepared using sodium bisulfite is measured by UV spectrophotometry at 280 and 320 nm and calculated to be about 3 DAR. The % monomer of the conjugate is expected to be about 95% and the % cytotoxic compound on the monomer is about 90%.","The MS of a huMy9-6 conjugate prepared using sodium bisulfite following deglycosylation is expected to show the largest peak of D1 with one linked drug, and possibly D2, D3, D4, D5, D6 peaks with 2-6 linked drugs per antibody.","The conjugate prepared with sodium bisulfite is expected to show a much greater drug incorporation than the conjugate prepared without sodium bisulfite. The MS of the conjugate prepared with sodium bisulfite is expected to show conjugate peaks of 1-6 linked drugs with the highest D1 peak with 1 linked drug. In contrast, the MS of conjugate prepared without sodium bisulfite is expected to show the highest peak of unconjugated antibody (D0) and much smaller D1, D2 and D3 linked drug conjugate peaks. The overall conjugate quality for the conjugate prepared with sodium bisulfite, therefore, is expected to be much superior than by the traditional conjugation procedure without sodium bisulfite.","The conjugate prepared with sodium bisulfite is expected to show a similar in vitro cytotoxicity to the conjugate prepared without sodium bisulfite. Therefore a better quality conjugate of higher DAR and higher % drug on monomer is prepared using sodium bisulfite without any loss of cytotoxic potency.","A huMy9-6 conjugate prepared using sodium bisulfite is analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE using a gel chip analyzer. The conjugate is expected to show only the intact antibody band; no heavy and light chain bands are observed, showing an unexpected advantage that the added sodium bisulfite does not cause any unwanted reduction of native interchain disulfide bonds in the antibody.","2-NHS ester or SPDB-NHS esters of several cytotoxic compounds are pre-incubated with 0.5 to 3 molar equivalents of sodium bisulfite (freshly prepared NaHSO3 in deionized water) in 66-98% DMA (dimethylacetamide) in water from 15 min to 4 h at 25\u00b0 C. Some of these reactions are left overnight at 4\u00b0 C. and used for conjugations 20 h later.","The 2-NHS ester in DMA treated with sodium bisulfite or without added sodium bisulfite is analyzed by HPLC using a VYDAC C8 reversed phase column with a linear gradient of 20% acetonitrile and 80% deionized water going up to 100% acetonitrile, all containing 0.025% acetic acid, at 1 ml\/min over 48 min. No undesirable peak of sulfonated hydrolyzed cytotoxic compound is observed. Therefore, a favorable reaction of sodium bisulfite toward addition to the imine bond without reaction with the NHS ester is expected to be observed.","Similarly drug NHS esters are treated with imine reactive reagents other than sodium bisulfite before conjugation with antibody. An alternative conjugation approach is to treat a mixture of drug-NHS ester and antibody with sodium bisulfite or other imine reactive reagent.","The disulfide-linked antibody-SPDB-cytotoxic compound conjugate is prepared using synthesized SPDB-NHS ester linked cytotoxic compound. The cytotoxic compound-SPDB-NHS ester is pre-treated with 3 molar equivalents of sodium bisulfite (using a freshly prepared NaHSOsolution in water) in 96-98% DMA in water for 4-5 h at 25\u00b0 C. The sodium bisulfite-treated cytotoxic compound-SPDB-NHS ester in DMA is analyzed using VYDAC C8 reversed phase-HPLC column using a linear gradient of 20% acetonitrile and 80% deionized water containing 0.025% acetic acid at 1 ml\/min for 48 mM. The reversed phase HPLC analysis shows only the desired reaction of bisulfite addition to the imine bond without the undesired reaction of bisulfite with the NHS ester.","For conjugation, a humanized antibody at 2 mg\/ml is reacted with 5-7 molar equivalents of cytotoxic compound-SPDB-NHS ester (pre-treated with NaHSO) for 6 h at 25\u00b0 C. in 85% PBS, pH 7.4, aqueous buffer containing 15% N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and then purified over a G25 gel filtration column in PBS, pH 7.4, to remove unreacted or hydrolyzed drug. The humanized antibody-SPDB-cytotoxic compound conjugates are dialyzed in 10 mM Histidine, 250 mM Glycine, 1% sucrose, pH 6.5 buffer. The drug\/antibody ratio (DAR) of the conjugates are measured to be about 2-3 by UV absorbance measurements at 280 and 320 nm and using the extinction coefficients of the drug and antibody at 280 nm and 320 nm. The percentage of monomer in the conjugate preparation is determined by SEC (Size Exclusion Chromatography) as 90%. Based on the UV absorbance of the monomer peak in SEC it is also expected that the monomer conjugate peak has linked drug molecules. The unconjugated drug % by acetone extraction and reversed-phase HPLC is expected to be less than 1%.","The MS of the deglycosylated antibody-SPDB-cytotoxic compound conjugates prepared with sodium bisulfite added before conjugation shows a much superior conjugate than that obtained without sodium bisulfite conjugation. The MS of the conjugate prepared without sodium bisulfite has an average of about 1.5 drug\/Ab ratio, and antibody species with up to three linked drug molecules. In contrast, the MS of the conjugate prepared with sodium bisulfite showed an average of about 2.5 drug\/Ab and antibody species with up to seven linked drug molecules.","The disulfide-linked antibody-SPDB-cytotoxic compound conjugate prepared using sodium bisulfite shows only intact antibody band by non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel chip analysis. The gel chip assay is performed using Agilent Protein 230 Protein Chip and analyzed using an Agilent 2300 Bioanalyzer. No heavy and light chain bands are observed, showing an unexpected advantage that the added sodium bisulfite does not cause any unwanted reduction of native antibody-interchain disulfide bonds. The linked drug obtained in the antibody-SPDB-cytotoxic compound conjugate prepared using sodium bisulfite also demonstrate's that the disulfide linker in the conjugate is stable to the added sodium bisulfite.","For conjugate preparation, cytotoxic compound-SPDB-NHS ester is pre-incubated with 3 molar equivalents of sodium bisulfite (freshly prepared NaHSOin deionized water) in 96% DMA (dimethylacetamide) in water for 5 h at 25\u00b0 C. and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. until needed for conjugation. Humanized antibody at 2-3 mg\/ml is derivatized with 8 molar equivalents of cytotoxic compound-SPDB-NHS ester in the absence or presence of sodium bisulfite (\u2212\/+NaHSO) for 4 h at 25\u00b0 C. in 95% 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, aqueous buffer containing 5% DMA (v\/v) and then both are purified over G25 desalting columns into PBS, pH 7.4, to remove unreacted, hydrolyzed drug.
