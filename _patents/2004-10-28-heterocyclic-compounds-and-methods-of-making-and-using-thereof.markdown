U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/610,163, filed Sep. 15, 2004, which incorporated by reference in its entirety, and India Provisional Patent Application No. 861\/CHE\/2003, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The present invention relates to compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of making and use thereof.","Glycated proteins and advanced glycation end products (AGE) contribute to cellular damage, for example, diabetic tissue injury. This can occur by at least by two major mechanisms: modulation of cellular functions through interactions with specific cell surface receptors, and alteration of the extracellular matrix leading to the formation of protein cross-links. Studies suggest that glycated protein and AGE interactions with cells promote inflammatory processes and oxidative cellular injury. AGE increases lipoprotein oxidisability and atherogenicity. Further, AGE binding to matrix proteins induces synthesis of IL-1, TNFa, VCAM-1, Heme oxygenase, insulin like growth factor, IL-6 and activates NF-?B. Diseases for which glycated protein and AGE accumulation is a suspected etiological factor include, but are not limited to, vascular complications of diabetes, microangiopathies, renal insufficiency, and Alzheimer's disease.","The exact mechanism by which high plasma glucose causes microvascular damage, as seen in diabetes, are not completely understood. One potential mechanism by which hyperglycemia can be linked to microangiopathies is through the process of non-enzymatic glycation of critical proteins. Non-enzymatic glycation of critical proteins is discussed in Nonenzymatic glycosylation and the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, Ann. Intern. Med., 1984(101)527-537; Advanced glycation end products up-regulate gene expression found in diabetic glomerular disease, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 1994 (91)9436-40; Expression of advanced glycation end products and their cellular receptor RAGE in diabetic nephropathy and nondiabetic renal disease, J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 2000 (11)1656-66; and Activation of receptor for advanced glycation end products: a mechanism for chronic vascular dysfunction in diabetic vasculopathy and atherosclerosis., Circ. Res., 1999 (84)489-97).","Non-enzymatic glycation, i.e., the linking of proteins with glucose, leads to the formation of glycated proteins. The first step in this glycation pathway involves the non-enzymatic condensation of glucose with free amino groups in the protein, primarily the epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues, forming the Amadori adducts. These early glycation products can undergo further reactions such as rearrangements, dehydration, and condensations to form irreversible advanced glycation end products (AGE). These are a highly reactive group of molecules whose interaction with specific receptors on the cell-surface that may lead to pathogenic outcomes. Accumulation of glycated proteins have been demonstrated in the basement membrane of patients with diabetes and are thought to be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy. See Immunohistochemical localization of glycated protein in diabetic rat kidney., Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract., 1990(8)215-9; and Role of Amadori-modified nonenzymatically glycated serum proteins in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 1996(7)183-90. See Inhibitors of AGE formation, such as aminoguanidine, have been shown to block the formation of AGE and prevent development of diabetes complications, including diabetic retinopathy (Aminoguanidine prevents diabetes-induced arterial wall protein cross-linking, Science, 1986(232)1629-1632; Prevention of cardiovascular and renal pathology of aging by the advanced glycation inhibitor aminoguanidine, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 1996(93)3902-7; and Potential benefit of inhibitors of advanced glycation end products in the progression of type II diabetes: a study with aminoguanidine in C57\/BLKsJ diabetic mice., Metabolism, 1998(47)1477-80.","One characterized AGE receptor is RAGE, receptor for AGE. See Activation of receptor for advanced glycation end products: a mechanism for chronic vascular dysfunction in diabetic vasculopathy and atherosclerosis, Circ. Res. 1999(84)489-97; and Roles of the AGE-RAGE system in vascular injury in diabetes., Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2000 (902)163-70; discussion 170-2. Several in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that blocking RAGE either by antibodies or by adding a soluble form of the receptor inhibits diabetic vasculopathy including diabetic atherosclerosis. See Receptor-mediated endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetic vasculopathy. Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products blocks hyperpermeability in diabetic rats., J. Clin. Invest., 1996(97)238-43; Advanced glycation end products interacting with their endothelial receptor induce expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in cultured human endothelial cells and in mice. A potential mechanism for the accelerated vasculopathy of diabetes., J. Clin. Invest., 1995(96)1395-403; and Suppression of accelerated diabetic atherosclerosis by the soluble receptor for advanced glycation endproducts, Nat. Med. 1998(4)1025-31. Other than AGE, RAGE appears to mediate the binding of several other ligands that are involved in normal physiology as well as pathology. See Blockade of RAGE-amphoterin signalling suppresses tumour growth and metastases, Nature, 2000(405)354-60; RAGE mediates a novel proinflammatory axis: a central cell surface receptor for S100\/calgranulin polypeptides, Cell, 1999(97)889-901; and Amyloid-beta peptide-receptor for advanced glycation end product interaction elicits neuronal expression of macrophage-colony stimulating factor: a proinflammatory pathway in Alzheimer disease, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA., 1997(94)5296-301. Thus, merely blocking RAGE might have other unintended consequences. Moreover, since blocking RAGE could lead to accumulation of AGE in circulation, the long-term effects of blocking RAGE are unknown and may be more harmful than the pathology sought to be treated.","One useful method to block AGE effects would be to develop inhibitors that block AGE induced signaling. See Activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products triggers a p21 (ras)-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulated by oxidant stress, J. Biol. Chem., 1997(272)17810-4; and Cell activation by glycated proteins; AGE receptors, receptor recognition factors and functional classification of AGEs., Cell. Mol. Biol.(Noisy-le-grand), 1998(44)1013-23. However, the sequence of these signaling events leading to inflammation is not clear. Accordingly, what is needed are compounds that can block AGE-induced activities, particularly AGE-induced inflammation, or more particularly, AGE-induced signaling events.","Other chronic conditions for which adequate and effective therapies do not exist are treatments of antiproliferative disorders. Smooth muscle cell (SMC) hyperplasia is an important factor in the development of atherosclerosis and also is responsible for the significant number of failure rates following vascular procedures such as angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery. See, The comparative pathobiology of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Am. J. Cardiol. 86:6H-11H (2000); and Restenosis: a challenge for pharmacology. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 21:274-9. In the normal vessel, SMC are quiescent, but they proliferate when damage to the endothelium occurs. Naturally occurring growth modulators, many of which are derived from the endothelium, tightly control SMC proliferation in vivo.","Abnormal vascular smooth muscles cell (VSMC) proliferation may contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular occlusive lesions, including atherosclerosis, vessel re-narrowing after successful angioplasty (restenosis), and graft atherosclerosis after coronary transplantation. VSMC is discussed in The comparative pathobiology of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Am. J. Cardiol. 86:6H-11H; and Smooth muscle migration in atherosclerosis and restenosis. J Clin Invest. 100:S87-9. Many humans and animals have limited lifespans and lifestyles because of such conditions. Currently there are no known effective pharmacological treatments available that control these occlusive pathologies, particularly restenosis.","Percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PTCA) procedures are the most common in-patient hospital procedure in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, about one-third of the patients that undergo balloon angioplasty have restenosis of the widened segment within approximately six months. It may be necessary to perform another angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery on restenosed arteries. A key feature of restenosis is an injury response that results in activation of an inflammatory cascade and remodeling of the cells both inside and outside the carotid artery wall. This includes excessive growth of connective tissue and smooth muscle into the lumen of the artery known as neointimal hyperplasia. Currently there are no effective pharmacological treatments available that control the pathogenesis of vascular occlusive lesions, such as, but not limited to, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and graft atherosclerosis after coronary transplantation. Identification of effective therapeutics with minimal side effects will restore quality of life without requiring additional surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass surgery.","Smooth muscle cell (SMC) hyperplasia is a major event in the development of atherosclerosis and also may contribute to failure rates following vascular procedures such as angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery. In the normal vessel, SMC are quiescent, but they proliferate when damage to the endothelium occurs. Naturally occurring growth modulators, many of which are derived from the endothelium, tightly control SMC proliferation in vivo. Accordingly, there is a need for methods and compositions for the alteration of gene expression in arterial wall cells to inhibit thrombosis and SMC proliferation. In particular, what is needed are methods and compositions that inhibit SMC proliferation and related intimal hyperplasia.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,088 is directed to specific thiazolidinedione compounds, which are described as antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory and antiinfective agents. According to the disclosure, these specific compounds are used in the treatment of certain endocrine diseases, malignant, and non-malignant proliferative diseases, and cardiovascular disorders.","Thus, there is a need for treatments of vascular occlusive pathologic conditions, and particularly, restenosis. Since occurrence is frequent, the currently available treatments are costly and the conditions are refractory to many pharmacological therapies. The mechanisms involved in the control of vascular conditions related to SMC function are not clear and no conventional preventive therapy against SMC activation is available. Accordingly, methods and compositions for treatment and prevention of vascular occlusive conditions are needed. In particular, methods and compositions to prevent and treat restenosis following treatments of vascular tissues are needed. The present invention is directed to overcoming these and other deficiencies in the art.","The present invention is related to compounds of formula (I), and to methods and\/or compositions comprising compounds that are effective in modulating inflammatory responses, such as those resulting from AGE and glycated protein accumulation. The present invention also is directed to methods and\/or compositions comprising compounds that are effective in modulating smooth muscle cell proliferation and the diseases or conditions related thereto.","The present invention provides compounds and compositions that inhibit inflammatory responses, particularly those resulting from AGE and glycated protein accumulation. Further, the present invention provides compounds and compositions that inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation, which may be mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1, TNF-a, MCP-1, or by inducing the expression of perlecan, a heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"19.90mm","wi":"55.96mm","file":"US07456288-20081125-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The present invention provides novel compounds of formula (I), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of such compounds, optionally in combination with other active ingredients.","The present invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (I) as defined above, their salts, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof.","The present invention also provides novel compounds of formula (II), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of such compounds, optionally in combination with other active ingredients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0020"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"31.07mm","wi":"72.73mm","file":"US07456288-20081125-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The present invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (II) as defined above, their salts, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof.","The present invention also provides novel compounds of formula (III), including but not limited to, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and pharmaceutical compositions containing them, or their mixtures, or in combination with other active ingredients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0023"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"38.95mm","wi":"73.49mm","file":"US07456288-20081125-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The present invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (III) as defined above, their salts, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof.","The present invention also provides novel compounds of formula (IV), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of such compounds, optionally in combination with other active ingredients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0026"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"28.36mm","wi":"69.34mm","file":"US07456288-20081125-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The present invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (IV) as defined above, their salts, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof.","The present invention provides novel compounds of formula (V), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of such compounds, optionally in combination with other active ingredients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0029"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"23.11mm","wi":"75.44mm","file":"US07456288-20081125-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The present invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (V) as defined above, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and their pharmaceutically acceptable compositions.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method of using a compound of formula (I) comprises treatment and\/or prophylaxis of inflammatory conditions, such as those mediated by AGE or glycated protein accumulation.

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention which will be limited only by the appended claims.","As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms a \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d include plural reference unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a \u201ccompound\u201d is a reference to one or more such compounds and includes equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.","Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time this invention was made.","All publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the presently described invention. The publications discussed above and throughout the text are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention.","As used herein, the term \u201ccompound\u201d includes both the singular and the plural, and includes any single entity or combined entities that have activity that can be measured in the assays of the present invention and combinations, fragments, analogs or derivatives of such entities.","The term \u201cglycated protein\u201d, as used herein, includes proteins linked to glucose, either enzymatically or non-enzymatically, primarily by condensation of free epsilon-amino groups in the protein with glucose, forming Amadori adducts. Furthermore, glycated protein, as used herein, includes not only proteins containing these initial glycation products, but also glycation products resulting from further reactions such as rearrangements, dehydration, and condensations that form irreversible advanced glycation end products (AGE). It should be understood that any agent that causes the cells or components of the assay to respond in a measurable manner is contemplated by the present invention. Enhanced formation and accumulation of glycated proteins and AGE are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, and atherosclerosis, leading to the development of a range of diabetic complications including nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy. There is ample in vivo evidence that suggests that diabetes-related complications can be reduced by (1) preventing glycation of proteins, (2) by breaking the cross-links in glycated proteins (The cross-link breaker, N-phenacylthiazolium bromide prevents vascular advanced glycation end-product accumulation, Diabetologia, 2000(43)660-4) (or (3) by blocking glycated protein interaction with receptors.

Moreover, the polynucleotides of the present invention may be synthetically produced.","Polynucleotides may comprise chemically modified, biochemically modified, or derivatized nucleotides. For example, a polynucleotide may comprise, in part, modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides or nucleotide analogs. Polynucleotides also may comprise sugars, caps, nucleotide branches, and linking groups such as fluororibose and thioate. In addition, the sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. Furthermore, a polynucleotide may be modified after polymerization to facilitate its attachment to other polynucleotides, proteins, metal ions, labeling components, or a solid support.","The backbone of the polynucleotide may comprise modified or optionally substituted sugar and\/or phosphate groups. Alternatively, the backbone of the polynucleotide may comprise a polymer of synthetic subunits such as phosphoramidites and thus may be an oligodeoxynucleoside phosphoramidate or a mixed phosphoramidate-phosphodiester oligomer. See Peyrottes et al., N. AR. (1996) 24:1841-1848, and Chaturvedi et al., N. AR. (1996) 24:2318-2323.","The term \u201chomology\u201d, as used herein, refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary sequence is one that at least partially inhibits an identical sequence from hybridizing to a target polynucleotide; it is referred to using the functional term \u201csubstantially homologous\u201d. The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous sequence or probe to the target sequence under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target sequence which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (for example, less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding, the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target sequence.","The term \u201cgene\u201d refers to a polynucleotide sequence that comprises coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide or precursor, and also may include expression control sequences. The polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the coding sequence. The gene may be derived in whole or in part from any source known to those of ordinary skill in the art including a plant, a fungus, an animal, a bacterial genome or episome, eukaryotic, nuclear or plasmid DNA, cDNA, viral DNA, or chemically synthesized DNA. A gene may constitute an uninterrupted coding sequence or it may include one or more introns, bound by the appropriate splice junctions. Moreover, a gene may contain one or more modifications in either the coding or the untranslated regions that could affect certain properties of the polynucleotide or polypeptide, such as the biological activity or the chemical structure of the expression product, the rate of expression, or the manner of expression control. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, mutations, insertions, deletions, and substitutions of one or more nucleotides. In this regard, such modified genes may be referred to as \u201cvariants\u201d of the \u201cnative\u201d gene (discussed below).","\u201cGene expression\u201d refers to the process by which a polynucleotide sequence undergoes successful transcription and translation such that detectable levels of the nucleotide sequence are expressed.","The term \u201cgene expression profile\u201d refers to a group of genes representing a particular cell or tissue type (for example, neuron, coronary artery endothelium, or disease tissue) in any activation state.

Furthermore, a series of gene expression profiles may be generated from cells treated with a compound of the present invention, specifically, at different doses or a time-course to assess the effects of the compound. A gene expression profile also is known as a gene expression signature.","The term \u201cdifferential expression\u201d refers to both quantitative as well as qualitative differences in the temporal and tissue expression patterns of a gene. For example, a differentially expressed gene may have its expression activated or completely inactivated in normal versus disease conditions.

As used herein, the term \u201cimmunological binding properties\u201d refers to non-covalent interactions of the type which occur between an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific. Indeed, a functional equivalent of a monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin, for example, may inhibit the binding of the parent monoclonal antibody to its antigen. A functional equivalent may comprise F(ab\u2032)fragments, F(ab) molecules, Fv fragments, single chain fragment variable displayed on phage (scFv), single domain antibodies, chimeric antibodies, or the like so long as the immunoglobulin exhibits the characteristics of the parent immunoglobulin.","As used herein, the term \u201cisolated\u201d refers to a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, an antibody, or a host cell that is in an environment different from that in which the polynucleotide, the polypeptide, the antibody, or the host cell naturally occurs.

The concentration of various salts depends on the organ, organism, cell, or cellular compartment used as a reference.","The term \u201ccluster\u201d refers to a group of clones or biomolecular sequences related to one another by sequence homology. In one example, clusters are formed based upon a specified degree of homology and\/or overlap (for example, stringency). \u201cClustering\u201d may be performed with the sequence data. For instance, a biomolecular sequence thought to be associated with a particular molecular or biological activity in one tissue might be compared against another library or database of sequences. This type of search is useful to look for homologous, and presumably functionally related, sequences in other tissues or samples, and may be used to streamline the methods of the present invention in that clustering may be used within one or more of the databases to cluster biomolecular sequences prior to performing a method of the invention. The sequences showing sufficient homology with the representative sequence are considered part of a \u201ccluster\u201d. Such \u201csufficient\u201d homology may vary within the needs of one skilled in the art.","As used herein, the term \u201cinternal database\u201d refers to a database maintained within a local computer network. It contains, for example, biomolecular sequences associated with a project. It also may contain information associated with sequences including, but not limited to, a library in which a given sequence is found and descriptive information about a likely gene associated with the sequence. The internal database is optionally maintained as a private database behind a firewall within an enterprise network. However, the present invention contemplates an internal database that is available to the public. The internal database may include sequence data generated by the same enterprise that maintains the database, and also may include sequence data obtained from external sources.","The term \u201cexternal database\u201d, as understood herein, refers to a database located outside all internal databases. Typically, an enterprise network differing from the enterprise network maintaining the internal database will maintain an external database. The external database may be used, for example, to provide some descriptive information on biomolecular sequences stored in the internal database. For example, the external database may be GenBank and associated databases maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which is part of the National Library of Medicine.","The present invention is directed to compounds of general formula (I), its analogs, tautomeric forms, regioisomers, stereoisomers, polymorphs, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates thereof.

Pulmonary\/Nasal Administration","There are a several desirable features of an inhalation device for administering a compound of the present invention. For example, delivery by the inhalation device is advantageously reliable, reproducible, and accurate. For pulmonary administration, at least one pharmaceutical composition is delivered in a particle size effective for reaching the lower airways of the lung or sinuses. The inhalation device optionally delivers small dry particles, typically less than about 10 \u03bcm, for example, about 1-5 \u03bcm, for good respirability.","The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered by any suitable inhalation or nasal device. Devices capable of depositing aerosolized formulations in the sinus cavity or alveoli of a patient include, but are not limited to, metered dose inhalers, nebulizers, dry powder generators, and sprayers. Other devices suitable for directing pulmonary or nasal administration are also known in the art.","All such devices may be used for the administration of a pharmaceutical composition in an aerosol. Such aerosols may comprise either solutions (both aqueous and non aqueous) or solid particles. Metered dose inhalers like the Ventolin\u00ae metered dose inhaler, typically use a propellent gas and require actuation during inspiration. See, for example, WO 98\/35888; WO 94\/16970. Dry powder inhalers like Turbuhaler\u00ae (Astra), Rotahaler\u00ae (Glaxo), Diskus\u00ae (Glaxo), Spiros\u00ae inhaler (Dura), devices marketed by Inhale Therapeutics, and the Spinhaler\u00ae powder inhaler (Fisons), use breath-actuation of a mixed powder. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,458,135; 4,668,218; WO 97\/25086; WO 94\/08552; WO 94\/06498; and EP 0 237 507, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Nebulizers, for example, AERx\u00ae, Aradigm, the Ultravent\u00ae nebulizer (Mallinckrodt), and the Acorn II\u00ae nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products) produce aerosols from solutions, while metered dose inhalers, and dry powder inhalers generate small particle aerosols. These specific examples of commercially available inhalation devices are intended to be a representative of specific devices suitable for the practice of the invention, and are not intended as limiting the scope of the invention.","Where the carrier is a solid, formulations suitable for nasal administration include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, from about 20 to 500 microns that is administered in the manner in which snuff is administered, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Where the carrier is a liquid, suitable formulations for administration as, for example, a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient.","1. Administration as a Spray","A spray comprising a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be produced by forcing a suspension or solution of a compound contemplated hereby through a nozzle under pressure. The nozzle size and configuration, the applied pressure, and the liquid feed rate are chosen to achieve the desired output and particle size. An electrospray can be produced, for example, by an electric field in connection with a capillary or nozzle feed. Typically, particles of at least one compound delivered by a sprayer have a particle size less than about 20 \u03bcm, less than about 19 \u03bcm, less than about 18 \u03bcm, less than about 17 \u03bcm, less than about 16 \u03bcm, less than about 15 \u03bcm, less than about 14 \u03bcm, less than about 13 \u03bcm, less than about 12 \u03bcm, less than about 11 \u03bcm, less than about 10 \u03bcm, less than about 9 \u03bcm, less than about 8 \u03bcm, less than about 7 \u03bcm, less than about 6 \u03bcm, less than about 5 \u03bcm, less than about 4 \u03bcm, less than about 3 \u03bcm, less than about 2 \u03bcm, less than about 1 \u03bcm.","Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention suitable for use with a sprayer typically include a compound contemplated hereby in an aqueous solution at a concentration of about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg of a compound contemplated hereby per mL of solution or mg\/gm, or any range or value therein including, but not limited to, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 mg\/mL or mg\/gm. The pharmaceutical composition can include agents such as an excipient, a buffer, an isotonicity agent, a preservative, a surfactant, and, for example, zinc. The pharmaceutical composition also can include an excipient or agent for stabilization of the compound, such as a buffer, a reducing agent, a bulk protein, or a carbohydrate. Bulk proteins useful in pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in a sprayer include albumin, protamine, or the like. Typical carbohydrates useful in pharmaceutical compositions include sucrose, mannitol, lactose, trehalose, glucose, or the like. The pharmaceutical composition also can include a surfactant, which can reduce or prevent surface-induced aggregation of the pharmaceutical composition caused by atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various conventional surfactants can be employed such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and polyoxyethylene sorbitol fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range between 0.001 and 10% by weight of the formulation. Suitable surfactants include, but are not limited to, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, or the like. Additional agents known in the art also can be included in the pharmaceutical composition.","2. Administration by a Nebulizer","A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered by a nebulizer such as a jet nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. Typically, in a jet nebulizer, a compressed air source is used to create a high-velocity air jet through an orifice. As the gas expands beyond the nozzle, a low-pressure region is created, which draws a solution of composition protein through a capillary tube connected to a liquid reservoir. The liquid stream from the capillary tube is sheared into unstable filaments and droplets as it exits the tube, creating the aerosol. A range of configurations, flow rates, and baffle types can be employed to achieve the desired performance characteristics from a given jet nebulizer.

Pharmaceutical formulations may contain from about 0.005% to about 10% by weight of the active ingredient, for example, from about 0.01% to 5% by weight of the active ingredient.","D. Prolonged Administration","It may be desirable to deliver the compounds of the present invention to the subject over prolonged periods of time, for example, for periods of one week to one year for a single administration. Certain medical devices may be employed to provide a continuous intermittent or on demand dosing of a patient. The devices may include a pump or diffusion apparatus, or any other device containing a reservoir of drug and optionally diagnostic or monitoring components to regulate the delivery of the drug. Various slow-release, depot, or implant dosage forms can be utilized. For example, a dosage form can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salt of compound contemplated hereby that has a low degree of solubility in body fluids, for example, (a) an acid addition salt with a polybasic acid such as phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalene mono- or di-sulfonic acids, polygalacturonic acid, or any mixture thereof; (b) a salt with a polyvalent metal cation such as zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, or any mixture thereof, or with an organic cation formed from for example, N,N\u2032-dibenzyl-ethylenediamine or ethylenediamine; or (c) combinations of (a) and (b), for example, a zinc tannate salt. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention or a relatively insoluble salt, such as those just described, can be formulated in a gel, for example, an aluminum monostearate gel with, for example, sesame oil, suitable for injection. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited to, zinc salts, zinc tannate salts, pamoate salts, and any mixture thereof. Another type of slow-release depot formulation for injection may contain the compound or salt dispersed or encapsulated in a slow degrading, non-toxic, non-antigenic polymer such as a polylactic acid\/polyglycolic acid polymer, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919. The compounds or relatively insoluble salts thereof also can be formulated in cholesterol matrix silastic pellets, particularly for use in animals. Additional slow-release, depot, or implant formulations, for example, gas or liquid liposomes are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,222; SCRDDS(1978), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Dosage Determination","In general, the compounds contemplated hereby may be used alone or in concert with other therapeutic agents at appropriate dosages to obtain optimal efficacy while minimizing any potential toxicity. The dosage regimen utilizing a compound of the present invention may be selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex, medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition.","Optimal precision in achieving concentrations of drug within the range that yields maximum efficacy with minimal toxicity may require a regimen based on the kinetics of the compound's availability to a target site(s). Distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of a drug may be considered when determining the optimal concentration for a treatment regimen. The dosages of a compound contemplated hereby may be adjusted when combined to achieve desired effects. On the other hand, dosages of these various therapeutic agents may be independently optimized and combined to achieve a synergistic result wherein the pathology is reduced more than it would be if either agent were used alone.","In particular, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of a compound contemplated hereby may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, for example, for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the therapeutic index and it may be expressed as the ratio LD\/ED. Compounds exhibiting large therapeutic indices typically are used. Although compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. Generally, the compounds of the present invention may be administered in a manner that maximizes efficacy and minimizes toxicity.","Data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies may be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosages of such compounds are generally within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose may be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information may be used to determine accurately useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.","Moreover, the dosage administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be optimized using a pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic modeling system. For example, one or more dosage regimens may be chosen and a pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic model may be used to determine the pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic profile of one or more dosage regimens. Next, one of the dosage regimens for administration may be selected which achieves the desired pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic response based on the particular pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic profile. See WO 00\/67776, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Methods are known in the art for determining effective doses for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes for the disclosed pharmaceutical compositions or the disclosed drug combinations, whether or not formulated in the same composition. For therapeutic purposes, the term \u201cjointly effective amount\u201d, as used herein, means that amount of each active compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. For prophylactic purposes (i.e., inhibiting the onset or progression of a disorder), the term \u201cjointly effective amount\u201d refers to that amount of each active compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that inhibits in a subject the onset or progression of a disorder as being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. Thus, the present invention provides combinations of two or more therapeutic agents wherein, for example, (a) each therapeutic agent is administered in an independently therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount; (b) at least one therapeutic agent in the combination is administered in an amount that is sub-therapeutic or subprophylactic if administered alone, but is therapeutic or prophylactic when administered in combination with the second or additional therapeutic agents according to the invention; or (c) both therapeutic agents are administered in an amount that is subtherapeutic or sub-prophylactic if administered alone, but are therapeutic or prophylactic when administered together. Combinations of three or more therapeutic agents are analogously possible. Methods of combination therapy include coadministration of a single formulation containing all active agents; essentially contemporaneous administration of more than one formulation; and administration of two or more active agents separately formulated.","Dosages","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily.

Such vectors are known to those skilled in the art and can be administered in formulations that enhance the uptake of the vector by the cells.","The present invention also comprises methods and compositions for inducing the synthesis or expression of HSPGs, including, but not limited to HSPGs such as Syndecan, Glypican and Perlecan, and also comprises induction and synthesis of active fragments of HSPGs, for example, active fragments of Perlecan. As used herein, when an HSPG is referred to, the entire molecule or fragments are included therein. For example, Perlecan refers to the entire Perlecan molecule or fragments thereof. Fragments of Perlecan may have the same or different effects on cells. All of these fragments and activities are contemplated in the present invention.","A major extracellular HSPG in the blood vessel matrix is Perlecan, a protein originally identified in basement membrane. It interacts with extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors and receptors. Perlecan also is present in basement membranes other than blood vessels and in other extracellular matrix structures. It consists of a core protein of Mr.\u02dc450,000 kDa to which three HS chains of Mr\u02dc70 kDa are attached to one end of the molecule. Perlecan core protein has a complex functional organization consisting of five consecutive domains with homologies to molecules involved in control of cell proliferation, lipoprotein binding and cell adhesion. The N-terminal domain I (aa\u02dc1-195) contains attachment sites for HS chains. Domain II comprises four repeats homologous to the ligand-binding portion of the LDL receptor. Domain III has homology to domains IVa and IVb of laminin and is thought to mediate cell attachment.","SMC hyperplasia is a major event in the development of atherosclerosis and also is responsible for the significant number of failure rates following vascular procedures such as angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery, particularly due to restenosis. Proliferation of arterial wall SMC in response to local injury is a major feature of many vascular proliferative disorders. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is generally thought that the endothelium regulates the growth of the underlying SMC. In the normal vessel, SMC are quiescent, but they proliferate when damage to the endothelium occurs. Naturally occurring growth modulators, many of which are derived from the endothelium, tightly control SMC proliferation in vivo.","Though not wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism, it is believed that extracellular HSPGs mediate quiescence in SMCs. In serum-starved quiescent SMC, Perlecan synthesis is induced. For example, Perlecan inhibits DNA synthesis and SMC proliferation, and blocking Perlecan results in stimulation of DNA synthesis even in the absence of serum and growth factors. Induction of Perlecan and other HSPGs is an important event for the inhibition of SMC growth. Known antiproliferative agents fail to inhibit SMC proliferation when the effects of Perlecan are blocked. Thus, the present invention comprises methods and compositions for mediating Perlecan and other HSPG synthesis, expression and amounts are taught for the maintenance of SMC in a quiescent state. Such methods and compositions of the present invention also comprise treatment and prevention of vascular diseases, more specifically, pathologies related to SMC proliferation. In particular, such pathologies include atherosclerosis and restenosis.","The present invention also comprises methods and compositions for the treatment and prevention of vascular occlusive conditions including, but not limited to, neointimal hyperplasia, restenosis, transplant vasculopathy, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, atherosclerosis, and arteriosclerosis. Such methods and compositions comprise methods for inhibition of smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth and proliferation, and for induction of quiescence in smooth muscle cells. The present invention further comprise methods and compositions for inducing HSPG synthesis and expression including, but not limited to, the induction of HSPGs such as Syndecan, Glypican and Perlecan, for example, Perlecan synthesis and gene expression.","Neointimal hyperplasia is commonly seen after various forms of vascular injury and a major component of the vein graft's response to harvest and surgical implantation into high-pressure arterial circulation. In neointimal hyperplasia, smooth muscle cells in the middle layer of the vessel wall become activated, divide, proliferate, and migrate into the inner layer. The resulting abnormal neointimal cells express pro-inflammatory molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules that further trigger a cascade of events that lead to occlusive neointimal disease and eventually graft failure.","Proliferation of SMC in response to local injury is a major feature of vascular proliferative disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty. Though not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is generally believed that the endothelium regulates the growth of the underlying SMC. In normal vessels, SMC are quiescent, but they proliferate when damage to the endothelium occurs. The endothelium, in addition to producing a variety of growth factors, also generates key growth inhibitors. HSPGs are components of vascular cell membranes and extracellular matrix that are believed to control a variety of vascular functions including functioning as a barrier against cationic molecules and macromolecules, protecting the main structural component of the basement membrane, type IV collagen, from proteolytic attack, binding cytokines and growth factors including, but not limited to, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), functioning as storage for these cytokines, regulating mesodermal cell fate, positioning of the heart, acting in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis after ischemic injury, effecting interactions of cells with adhesive proteins and blood vessels, inducing proliferation of smooth muscle cells during atherogenesis, acting to increase cell spreading, inhibiting chemotaxis, and effecting the metabolism of lipoproteins and nonthrombogenic characteristics of endothelial cells. Additionally, it is believed that the HSPGs have different functions in different locations. For example, while cell surface HSPGs function as co-receptors for growth factors and support cell growth, extracellular HSPG can inhibit cell growth.","Although it is currently believed that endothelial HSPGs inhibit SMC proliferation, it is not known whether SMC synthesize antiproliferative HSPGs that act as autocrine inhibitors. Not wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism, it is currently believed that HSPGs inhibit DNA synthesis and SMC proliferation, and blocking HSPGs results in stimulation of DNA synthesis even in the absence of serum and growth factors. Indeed, known antiproliferative agents fail to inhibit SMC proliferation when the effects of HSPGs are blocked.","Examples of HSPGs include Syndecan, Glypican, and Perlecan, which are generated within the cardiovascular system. Vascular SMCs express Syndecans 1, 2 and 4, Glypican-1 and Perlecan. The regulation of HSPG expression in these cells, however, is not known. Cell growth stimulators such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), thrombin, serum, oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL) and lysolecithin have been shown to decrease HSPG, and in particular, to decrease Perlecan. In contrast, cellular antiproliferative agents, TGF-\u03b2, apolipoprotein E and heparin stimulate HSPGs.","The present invention comprises methods and compositions for the treatment and prevention of smooth muscle cell proliferation, including vascular occlusive pathologies. Such methods comprise administering compositions comprising therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting SMC proliferation. Administration of such therapeutic agents that are effective in inhibiting SMC proliferation, such as the aforementioned thizolidinedione compositions, are administered to humans and animals suspected of having or who have, for example, vasculopathy or who have undergone angioplasty or other procedures damaging to the endothelium. Effective amounts are administered to such humans and animals in dosages that are safe and effective. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intravenous, subcutaneous, transdermal, nasal, and inhalation therapies. Such therapeutic agents may be used in conjunction with other therapeutic agents or altered patient activities, such as changes in exercise or diet.","The compounds of the present invention are also useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of at least one cardiovascular disease in a cell, tissue, organ, animal, or patient including, but not limited to, cardiac stun syndrome, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, diabetic ateriosclerotic disease, hypertension, arterial hypertension, renovascular hypertension, syncope, shock, syphilis of the cardiovascular system, heart failure, cor pulmonale, primary pulmonary hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, atrial ectopic beats, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation (sustained or paroxysmal), post perfusion syndrome, cardiopulmonary bypass inflammation response, chaotic or multifocal atrial tachycardia, regular narrow QRS tachycardia, specific arrythmias, ventricular fibrillation, His bundle arrythmias, atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, myocardial ischemic disorders, coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, dilated congestive cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, valvular heart diseases, endocarditis, pericardial disease, cardiac tumors, aordic and peripheral aneuryisms, aortic dissection, inflammation of the aorta, occulsion of the abdominal aorta and its branches, peripheral vascular disorders, occulsive arterial disorders, peripheral atherlosclerotic disease, thromboangitis obliterans, functional peripheral arterial disorders, Raynaud's phenomenon and disease, acrocyanosis, erythromelalgia, venous diseases, venous thrombosis, varicose veins, arteriovenous fistula, lymphederma, lipedema, unstable angina, reperfusion injury, post pump syndrome, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and dyslipidemia. Such a method optionally comprises administering an effective amount of a composition or pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound to a cell, tissue, organ, animal, or patient in need of such modulation, treatment, or therapy.","1. Assessing HSPG Activity","The present invention comprises methods and compositions for determining therapeutic agents that are capable of effecting SMC proliferation. Such assays are taught herein and can be used as assays to determine agents that affect the amount or activity of HSPGs, for example, Perlecan, in such assays. For example, in one assay, Perlecan is induced in cells by certain inducers, and the response is measured. Potential therapeutic agents are then added to a replicate assay and the effect on Perlecan induction is determined. Using such methods and compositions, therapeutic agents are determined that can either inhibit Perlecan, elevate induction of Perlecan, or that have no effect at all. Such therapeutic agents can then be used in animals with SMC proliferation pathologies.","The present invention also comprises compositions comprising the compounds identified by the methods as having a desired activity. The compositions have utility in treatment of cells, tissues, or whole organisms. Such compositions are formulated for use in methods of administration in an effective amount for treatment of conditions such as biological conditions including, but not limited to, vascular occlusive lesions including atherosclerosis, transplant vasculopathy, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, restenosis, and graft atherosclerosis after coronary transplantation. The compositions may comprise other compounds including compounds with activities and pharmaceutical adjuncts that are needed for administration of the compound or compounds with the desired activity. The compositions may additionally be administered exclusively or in conjunction with other pharmaceutical compositions and surgical methods for treating smooth muscle cell proliferation and vascular occlusive diseases, including, but not limited to, before, during and after PTCA procedures.","In the assays of the present invention, the compound initially has unknown activity, effect, or effects. The activity of the compound is unknown, in that the compound's effects in the assays of the present invention are not yet determined. The compound may have many other known activities, and may be a compound that has other therapeutic uses. Any agent that causes the cells or components of the assay to respond in a measurable manner is contemplated by the present invention.","The present invention comprises methods and compositions for measuring the activity of unknown compounds. Such methods comprise assays for specific activity of biological components involved in a known cellular response. The assays provide a measurable response in which the activity of the unknown compounds is determined. This response can be measured by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, in an ELISA. One aspect of the present invention comprises measurement of the effects of compounds on SMC proliferation in response to an HSPG-inducing agent.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a compound suspected of effecting HSPG synthesis is added to cells in an assay. The response of the cells can be measured by determining levels of HSPG synthesis measured by methods known to those skilled in the art and compared to the amount of HSPG synthesis in untreated cells. The compound may have a stimulating effect, an inhibitory effect, a stabilizing effect, or no effect at all.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a composition suspected of effecting SMC proliferation is added to smooth muscle cells in growth medium or serum-free medium. The change in cell proliferation can be measured by methods known to those skilled in the art and compared to the proliferation of cells which are not treated with the compound. The composition may have a stimulating effect, an inhibitory effect, a stabilizing effect, or no effect at all.","Compositions with HSPG stimulating effects, particularly Perlecan stimulating effects, are useful as anti-proliferative therapeutics, specifically, inhibiting SMC proliferation and thus, treating vascular occlusive conditions. These selective activators of, for example, Perlecan include small organic molecules, peptides, peptoids, or polynucleotides that act directly upon Perlecan to modulate the biological activity or to increase the biological stability of the protein. In addition, the selective activators of Perlecan can increase the biosynthesis of Perlecan by increasing the transcription of the Perlecan gene, increasing the biological stability of the Perlecan mRNA or increasing the translation of Perlecan mRNA into protein. Furthermore, the selective activators of Perlecan can block or decrease the effects of agents or proteins that inhibit the activity of Perlecan.","The present invention also comprises methods and compositions for assays that may be used to identify such selective activators or inhibitors of Perlecan. These assays readily determine the activators that up-regulate and the inhibitors that down-regulate the amount of Perlecan and its biological activity. In general, such assays include, but are not limited to, promoter-based assays to identify compounds that affect Perlecan and assays for Perlecan biological activity in recombinant, partially purified protein, or lysates from cells expressing Perlecan in the presence or absence of compounds of interest. Measurements of Perlecan include biological activity assays and quantitation of Perlecan protein, using ELISA or Western blot determinations, or quantitation of Perlecan RNA using RT-PCR, or Northern blots.","Both indirect and direct methods of measurement of changes in Perlecan are contemplated by the present invention. The assay methods contemplated hereby rely on indirect measurement of Perlecan through measurement of determinants of Perlecan activity or expression.","Additionally, direct determination of the change in the amount of Perlecan protein can be done using other immunological methods, such as Western blots, densitometric measurements or ELISA methods. Alternatively, the direct determination of the change in the amount of Perlecan mRNA can be accomplished using RT-PCR or Northern analysis methods which are known to one skilled in the art. Measurements are also directly made using lysates of cells, and purified or partially purified Perlecan protein that is either a recombinant or natural form of the protein. The means for the measurement of biological activity are known to those skilled in the art.","Another method of identifying and determining compounds that affect Perlecan comprises identifying compounds that interact with the promoter regions of the Perlecan gene, or interact and effect proteins that interact with the promoter region, and are important in the transcriptional regulation of Perlecan expression. In general, the method comprises a vector comprising regulatory sequences of the Perlecan gene and an indicator region controlled by the regulatory sequences, such as an enzyme, in a promoter-reporter construct. The protein product of the indicator region is referred to herein as a reporter enzyme or reporter protein. The regulatory region of the sequence of Perlecan comprises a range of nucleotides from approximately \u22124000 to +2000, where the transcription initiation site is +1, for example, from \u22122500 to +1200, for example, from \u22121500 to +800 relative to the transcription initiation site.","Cells are transfected with the vector and then treated with compounds of interest. For example, the transfected cells are treated with a compound suspected of effecting the transcription of Perlecan and the level of activity of the Perlecan regulatory sequences are compared to the level of activity in cells that were not treated with the compound. The level of activity of the Perlecan regulatory sequences are determined by measuring the amount of the reporter protein or determining the activity of the reporter enzyme controlled by the regulatory sequences. An increase in the amount of the reporter protein or the reporter enzyme activity shows a stimulatory effect on Perlecan, by positively affecting the promoter, whereas a decrease in the amount or the reporter protein or the reporter enzyme activity shows a negative effect on the promoter and thus, on Perlecan.","Additionally, the present invention comprises methods and compositions for identifying selective inhibitors of Perlecan protein or biological activity. These selective inhibitors of Perlecan are small organic molecules, peptides, peptoids, or polynucleotides that act directly upon Perlecan or the promoter region of Perlecan to modulate expression or to decrease the biological stability of the protein. In addition, the selective inhibitors of Perlecan can decrease the biosynthesis of Perlecan by decreasing the transcription of the Perlecan gene, decreasing the biological stability of the Perlecan mRNA or decreasing the translation of Perlecan mRNA into protein. Furthermore, the selective inhibitors of Perlecan can block or decrease the effects of agents or proteins that increase the activity of Perlecan.","Table 1 presents exemplary that have been shown to induce HSPG.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0662","num":"0660"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"238pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Fold induced"]},{"entry":["S.

Heparanase Modulation","HSPGs are important components of the subendothelial extracellular matrix and the basement membrane of blood vessels. Rosenberg et al., 99 J. C. I2062-70 (1997). Basement membranes are continuous sheets of extracellular matrix composed of collagenous and noncollagenous proteins and proteoglycans that separate parenchymal cells from underlying interstitial connective tissue. They have characteristic permeabilities and play a role in maintaining tissue architecture.","In addition to HSPGs, the basal lamina consists predominantly of a complex network of adhesion proteins, fibronectin, laminin, collagen and vitronectin. Wight et al., 6 C. O. L326-334 (1995). Heparan sulfate (HS) is an important structural component of the basal lamina. Each of the adhesion proteins interacts with HS side chains of HSPGs within the matrix. Thus, HSPGs function as a barrier to the extravasation of metastatic and inflammatory cells. Cleavage of HS by the endoglycosidase Heparanase produced by metastatic tumor cells and inflammatory cells destroys the filtering properties of the lamina. In addition, the degradation of the HS may assist in the disassembly of the extracellular matrix and thereby facilitate cell migration by allowing blood bome cells to escape into the bloodstream. Vlodavsky et al., 12 IM112-127 (1992).","Heparanase activity has been described in a number of tissues and cell types including liver, placenta, platelets, fibroblasts, neutrophils, activated T and \u03b2-lymphocytes, monocytes, and endothelial cells (7-16). Nakajima et al., (31) CL277-283 (1986); Nakajima et al., 36 J. C. B157-167 (1988); Ricoveri et al., 46 CR3855-3861 (1986); Gallagher et al., 250 B. J. 719-726 (1988); Dempsey et al., 10 G467 (2000); Goshen et al., 2 M. H. R679 (1996); Parish et al., 76 ICB104-113 (1998); Gilat et al., 181 J. E. M1929-1934 (1995); Graham, et al., 39 B. M. I56371 (1996); Pillarisetti et al., 270 J.B.C29760-29765 (1995).","There is increasing interest in heparan sulfate compounds and their related enzymes due to a possible relationship between changes in normal activity and tumor invasiveness and tumor metastatic activity. An important process in tissue invasion by blood-borne tumor cells and white cells involves their passage through the vascular endothelial cell layer and subsequent degradation of the underlying basal lamina or basement membranes and extracellular matrix with a battery of secreted proteases and glycosidases. Nakajinia et al., 220 S611-613 (1983); Vlodavsky et al.,12 IM112-127 (1992).","Heparanase activity was shown to correlate with the metastatic potential of animal and human tumor cell lines. Nakajima et al., 31 CL277-283 (1986); Nakajima et al., 212 PCBR113-122 (1986); Freeman et al., 325 B. J. 229-237 (1997); Vlodavsky et al., 5 N. M793-802 (1999); Hulett et al., 5 NM803-809 (1999). It also is known to regulate growth factor activity. Many growth factors remain bound to heparan sulfate in storage form and are disassociated by Heparanase during angiogenesis, improving the survival rate of cancer cells.","Serum Heparanase levels in rats were higher by more than an order of magnitude after injection of the rats with highly metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma cells. In addition, Heparanase activity in the sera of rats bearing MTLn3 tumors correlated well with the extent of the metastases. Moreover, serum\/urine Heparanase activity in cancer patients was shown to be 2-4 fold increased in particular where tissue metastases were present. Because the cleavage of HS appears to be essential for the passage of metastatic tumor cells and leukocytes through basement membranes, studies of Heparanase inhibitors provides the potential of developing a novel and highly selective class of anti-metastatic and anti-inflammatory drugs.","Thus, the present invention further relates to compounds that modulate Heparanase activity. Such compounds are useful in treating and\/or preventing cancer including, but not limited to, malignant and non-malignant cell growth, leukemia, acute leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), B-cell, T-cell or FAB ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chromic myelocytic leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia, myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS), a lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, a malignamt lymphoma, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Kaposi's sarcoma, colorectal carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, malignant histiocytosis, paraneoplastic syndrome\/hypercalcemia of malignancy, solid tumors, adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, malignant melanoma, hemangioma, metastatic disease, cancer related bone resorption, cancer related bone pain.","According to another aspect of the present invention, the compounds contemplated hereby are useful in modulating heparanase activity as a means for treating and preventing autoimmune diseases.","By way of background, in the normal course of resolution of a disease in an infected tissue, local resting immune effector cells in the body become activated after recognizing antigens of the infecting organism as foreign. Upon activation these effector cells in the body synthesize and secrete signaling molecules (chemokines, lymphokines and cytokines), which attract additional immune effector cells to the site of infection, where they are also activated. Once activated, these immune effector cells become capable of exiting the vasculature and entering the infected tissue where they begin to attract and destroy the infectious agent and the infected tissue. This process continues until the infection is eradicated.","Occasionally, however, the immune system malfunctions or overreacts to the initial insult, which can lead to the initiation of debilitating and life threatening chronic and acute diseases. This can occur when (1) the immune system mistakenly identifies a cell surface molecule on normal tissue as a foreign molecule, (2) the synthesis and secretion of chemokines, cytokines, and lymphokines is not shut down after the eradication of the disease, or (3) the immune system overreacts to the apparent infection and destroys vast quantities of surrounding normal tissue.","In normal activity, the activated effector cells attract other effector cells to the blood vessels near the infection. To be \u201ceffective\u201d these activated cells must leave the blood vessels and enter the infected tissue. The process of exiting the circulation and entering the inflamed tissue involves two distinct steps. First, the immune effector cells must bind to the luminal\/apical surface of the blood vessel walls. This is accomplished through the interaction of adhesion molecules on the immune effector cells with their locally upregulated cognate receptors on the endothelial cells lining the vasculature near the site of infection.","Second, after binding to the apical surface and before entering the inflamed tissue, the immune effector cells must breach the basement membrane (BM) and extracellular matrix (ECM) that surround the basal portion of the blood vessels and give the vessels their shape and strength. The BM and ECM consists of structural proteins embedded in a fiber meshwork consisting mainly of complex carbohydrate containing structures (glycosaminoglycans), of which the main constituent is heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). In order to breach this barrier the immune effector cell must weaken or destroy it, which is accomplished through the local secretion of proteases and heparanase(s).","Thus, the inhibition of heparanase using the compounds of the present invention finds utitlity in treating arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. More specifically, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of at least one autoimmune-related disease in a cell, tissue, organ, animal, or patient including, but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondilitis, gastric ulcer, seronegative arthropathies, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosis, antiphospholipid syndrome, iridocyclitis\/uveitis\/optic neuritis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic vasculitis\/wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, orchitis\/vasectomy reversal procedures, allergic\/atopic diseases, asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, allergic contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, transplants, organ transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis syndrome, gram positive sepsis, gram negative sepsis, culture negative sepsis, fungal sepsis, neutropenic fever, urosepsis, meningococcemia, trauma\/hemorrhage, bums, ionizing radiation exposure, acute pancreatitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol-induced hepatitis, chronic inflammatory pathologies, Crohn's pathology, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, nephrosis, atopic diseases, hypersensitity reactions, allergic rhinitis, hay fever, perennial rhinitis, conjunctivitis, endometriosis, asthma, urticaria, systemic anaphalaxis, dermatitis, pernicious anemia, hemolytic disesease, thrombocytopenia, graft rejection of any organ or tissue, kidney transplant rejection, heart transplant rejection, liver transplant rejection, pancreas transplant rejection, lung transplant rejection, bone marrow transplant (BMT) rejection, skin allograft rejection, cartilage transplant rejection, bone graft rejection, small bowel transplant rejection, fetal thymus implant rejection, parathyroid transplant rejection, xenograft rejection of any organ or tissue, allograft rejection, anti-receptor hypersensitivity reactions, Graves disease, Raynoud's disease, type B insulin-resistant diabetes, asthma, myasthenia gravis, -meditated cytotoxicity, type III hypersensitivity reactions, POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes syndrome), polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin changes syndrome, anti-phospholipid syndrome, pemphigus, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, idiopathic Addison's disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic active hepatitis, vitiligo, vasculitis, post-MI cardiotomy syndrome, type IV hypersensitivity , contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allograft rejection, granulomas due to intracellular organisms, drug sensitivity, metabolic\/idiopathic, Wilson's disease, hemachromatosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, diabetic retinopathy, hashimoto's thyroiditis, osteoporosis, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis evaluation, primary biliary cirrhosis, thyroiditis, encephalomyelitis, cachexia, cystic fibrosis, neonatal chronic lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), familial hematophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, dermatologic conditions, psoriasis, alopecia, nephrotic syndrome, nephritis, glomerular nephritis, acute renal failure, hemodialysis, uremia, toxicity, preeclampsia, ankylosing spondylitis, Behcet's disease, bullous pemphigoid, cardiomyopathy, celiac sprue-dermatitis, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Churg-Strauss syndrome, cicatricial pemphigoid, CREST syndrome, cold agglutinin disease, discoid lupus, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, fibromyalgia-fibromyositis, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barre, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), IgA nephropathy, insulin dependent diabetes, juvenile arthritis, lichen planus, meniere's disease, multiple sclerosis, pemphigus vulgaris, polyarteritis nodosa, Cogan's syndrome, polychondritis, polyglandular syndromes, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, primary agammaglobulinemia, Raynaud's phenomenon, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatic fever, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, stiff-man syndrome, Takayasu arteritis, temporal arteritis\/giant cell arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis; okt3 therapy, anti-cd3 therapy, cytokine therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy (for example, including but not limited toasthenia, anemia, cachexia), chronic salicylate intoxication.","1.

In addition, the assays of the present invention also can be used to screen for compounds that alter, either stimulate or inhibit, such cellular and enzymatic activities.","Existing Heparanase assays require preparation of the radiolabeled substrate and separation of degraded products from the uncleaved substrate. See Goshen et al., 2 M. H. R679-84 (1996); Nakajima et al., 31 CL277-83 (1986). Other Heparanase assays require the biosynthetic radiolabeling of matrix-associated HSPG and the detection of HS chain degradation by gel-filtration analysis of radiolabeled material released from the matrix. Vlodasky et al., 12 IM112-27 (1992).","Solid-phase Heparanase assays have also been developed where chemically and biosynthetically radiolabeled heparin and HS chains were attached to a solid support, with release of radiolabel from the solid support being a measure of enzyme activity. Assays using such procedures are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,859,581, which is entirely expressly herein incorporated by reference.","Previous studies have also radiolabeled both heparin and HS by iodination at naturally occurring glucosamine residues or by N-acetylation of the partially de-N-sulfated substrate. Such procedures require the use of radioactive iodine, which is a powerful ? emitter and therefore extremely hazardous. For example, one sensitive radioactive assay for Heparanase requires affinity chromatography of the Heparanase-cleaved products on columns of histidine-rich glycoprotein Sepharose. Freeman and Parish, 325 B. J. 229-37 (1997).","There are also some non-radioactive assays available for Heparanase. One assay for Heparanase involves measuring the optical density (at 230 nm) of unsaturated uronic acids formed during degradation of heparin. A color-based assay for measuring Heparanase activity utilizes heparin's ability to interfere with color development during the interaction of protein with the dye Coomassie brilliant blue. Kahn and Newman, 196 A. B373-76 (1991).","In another Heparanase assay, a composition comprising biotin-HS is mixed with a biological sample such as a tumor sample, bodily fluid, or other fluid suspected of having Heparanase activity, to form a reaction mixture. This sample may be pretreated to remove contaminating or reactive substances such as endogenous biotin. After incubation, an aliquot or portion of the reaction mixture is removed and placed in a biotin-binding plate. After washing with buffers, a Streptavidin-enzyme conjugate is added to the biotin-binding plate. Reagents for the enzyme are added to form a detectable color product. For example, a decrease in color formation, from a known standard, indicates there was Heparanase activity in the sample. The biotin-binding plate comprises any means for binding biotin, for example, to a solid surface. See WO 02\/23197, which is entirely expressly incorporated herein by reference.","In general, a method for measuring Heparanase activity comprises attaching one of a binding partner to a substrate for the enzyme to be measured. Incubation with a sample comprising the enzyme to be measured allows for activity by the enzyme to be measured in a reaction mixture. A portion or the whole reaction mixture, depending on the amount needed, is then mixed with the complementary binding partner, so that the binding partners are bound together. This is the first binding reaction. After incubating to allow for binding, washings are performed. A complementary binding partner, complementary to the first binding partner attached to the substrate, is added. This complementary binding partner may or may not be the same as the first complementary binding partner. This is the second binding reaction. The complementary binding partner in the second binding reaction is labeled in a manner that is detectable. For example, the complementary binding partner is labeled with an enzyme that causes a detectable color change when the appropriate reaction conditions exist.","Some methods comprise the use of binding partners including, but not limited to, biotin and Streptavidin. Other ways of binding one of the binding partners such as biotin, can be used at either biotin-binding step, either binding biotin to the plate or in detection of the available biotins. The number of biotins, or other binding partner, that are available for the second binding is the quantitative result of the assay. \u201cComplementary binding partner\u201d means one of the pair of the binding partners, such as biotin and Streptavidin or an antibody and its antigen. The biotin is the complementary binding partner of Streptavidin; Streptavidin is the complementary binding partner of biotin. An antibody that specifically binds biotin also is a complementary binding partner of biotin.","In the above method, the labeled binding partner, i.e., the enzyme labeled-streptavidin, can be labeled with any detectable marker including but not limited to, enzymes, dyes, chemiluminescence, and other methods known in the art. One such method comprises labeling with an enzyme that produces a color change in its substrate that is detectable. This method is safe, easy, and effective and can be used in both qualitative and quantitative methods.","Using the above methods, the amount of enzyme activity in a sample can be determined. Also, the above methods can be used to determine compounds that can inhibit enzyme activity. For example, a composition comprising the candidate compound is added to a known amount of Heparanase either before or during the incubation of the Heparanase and its substrate-binding partner. If the compound alters the activity of the Heparanase, the assay methods of the present invention will show a change in the amount of detectable label. Such assays are used for high throughput determination of the activity of candidate compounds. See WO 02\/23197, which is entirely expressly incorporated herein by reference.","C. Inflammation Modulation","The present invention is directed to methods and compositions comprising compounds or molecules that have specific biological effects and are useful as therapeutic agents. In particular, the present invention is directed to methods and compositions comprising compounds or molecules that are effective in effecting inflammation. More particularly, the present invention is directed to methods and compositions comprising compounds or molecules that are effective in inhibiting inflammation caused by the accumulation or presence of glycated proteins or AGE. The present invention also provides compositions for and methods of treatment of biological conditions including, but not limited to, vascular complications of type I and type II diabetic-induced vasculopathies, other vasculopathies, microangiopathies, renal insufficiency, Alzheimer's syndrome, and inflammation-induced diseases such as atherosclerosis.","The present invention has utility in inhibiting inflammation or cell activation by glycated proteins or AGE. Pharmacological inhibition of AGE-induced cell activation provides the basis for therapeutic intervention in many diseases, most notably in diabetic complications and Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic approaches for inhibition of AGE-induced inflammation include, but are not limited to, blocking the glycation of proteins, blocking AGE interactions with receptors and blocking AGE-induced signaling or signaling-associated inflammatory responses.","For example, a method of the present invention is to block AGE effects by inhibiting AGE induced signaling. The sequence of these signaling events leading to inflammation is not clear, but inhibition of these signaling events leads to reduced or no inflammatory results. Compounds that block AGE-induced up-regulation of inflammatory molecules were determined using screening assays. The present invention comprises methods and compositions comprising compounds or molecules such as the thizolidinedione compounds provided herein.","Other aspects of the present invention comprise methods and compositions comprising compounds that block glycated protein-induced inflammation. Further aspects of the present invention comprise thizolidinedione compounds that are capable of inhibiting AGE effects. Still further aspects of the present invention employ compositions comprising the compounds of the formulae contemplated hereby that block glycated protein-induced inflammation.","Enhanced formation and accumulation of glycated proteins and AGE are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, and atherosclerosis, leading to the development of a range of diabetic complications including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. There is ample in vivo evidence that suggests that diabetes-related complications can be reduced by 1) preventing glycation of proteins, 2) by breaking the cross-links in glycated proteins, or 3) by blocking glycated protein interaction with receptors. Despite the importance of AGE in the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathies, there are no currently available medications known to block AGE formation.","Aminoguanidine, which prevents AGE formation, is actively pursued as a therapy for diabetic vasculopathy. However it is not clear whether this drug would affect normal glucose metabolism or glycosylation of proteins. Moreover, some studies show that although aminoguanidine reduces AGE formation, it did not inhibit glomerular basement thickness in diabetic rats nor improved endothelial function. See, for example, Birrell et al., 43 D110-16 (2000); Wada et al., 42 D743-47 (1999); Soulis et al., 50 KI627-34 (1996).","In addition to the AGE formation inhibitors, AGE cross-link breakers are also actively pursued as a therapy for vasculopathy. N-Phenacylthiazolium bromide (PTB) is a prototype AGE cross-link breaker that reacts with and cleaves covalent AGE-derived protein cross-links. Although PTB reduced AGE accumulation, it did not prevent vascular permeability. Cooper et al., 43 D660-64 (2000); Oturai et al., 49(8) M996-1000 (2000).","Inhibition of reactions with receptors of AGE is an alternative approach to treatment of related pathologies. RAGE, a known receptor for AGE, is a possible therapeutic target. Blocking RAGE also inhibited AGE-induced inflammation. However, because of the multiple functions of RAGE and possible long term side effects of accumulated AGE in plasma, this method is not currently pursued in humans. Using the methods and compositions of the present invention, more specific inhibitory compounds can be used for treatments.","Endothelium is the target organ of damage in diabetes. See Laight et al., 15 DM. R. R274-82 (1999); Stehouwer et al., 34 C55-68 (1997). Up-regulation of molecules involved in endothelial inflammation, such as IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) leads to endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy. See Stehouwer et al., 34 C55-68 (1997); Libby, 247 J. IM349-58 (2000); Van Lente, 293 C. C. A31-52 (2000).","An overall approach to the understanding and treatment of diabetes and its complications is to interfere in the regulation of genes, such as those leading to the production of cytokines, and to inhibit AGE-induced inflammation.","The effectiveness of the compounds of the present invention in inhibiting glycated protein- and AGE-induced inflammation can be determined using the assays described herein and in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/259,306, which is incorporated by reference in herein its entirety. Such assays comprise measurement of the specific activity of biological components involved in a known cellular response. The assays provide a measurable response in which the activity of the compounds is determined. One aspect of the present invention comprises measurement of the effects of compounds on an inflammatory response by cells to the presence of a stimulating agent. Yet another aspect of the present invention includes an assay comprising endothelial cells that are stimulated by the addition of a glycated protein, the stimulating agent. The endothelial cells respond by producing specific cytokines. The amount of cytokines produced is determined by measurement protocols known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of the present invention are then added to the assay and the production of cytokines is measured. From the comparison of the assay without the compound with the assay with the compound, the biological effect of the compound can be determined. The compound may have an inhibitory effect, a stimulatory effect, or no effect at all. Compounds for treatment of inflammation include those that have an inhibitory effect.","Assays comprise endothelial cells that are stimulated in an inflammatory response by the presence of the glycated protein, glycated human serum albumin. Such endothelial cells produce cytokines. A method in accordance with the present invention comprises measurement of the amount of the cytokine IL-6, and another aspect of the present invention comprises measurement of the amount of the cytokine MCP-1. Preferably, although not required, the amount of cytokine produced is determined using immunological methods, such as ELISA assays. The methods of the present invention are not limited by the type of assay used to measure the amount of cytokine produced, and any methods known to those skilled in the art and later developed can be used to measure the amount of cytokines produced in response to the stimulating agent and to the compound having unknown activity.","IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and atherosclerosis. See Horii et al., 39 KIT. S71-5 (1993); Huber et al., 19 AT. V. B2364-67 (1999); Shikano et al., 85 N81-5 (2000); Pickup et al., 8(67) LS291-300 (2000). IL-6 also promotes the growth of renal mesangial cells thus contributing to nephropathy. See Kado et al., 36 A. D67-72 (1999). The serum IL-6 level in diabetic subjects was significantly higher than in normal healthy controls (3.48+\/\u22123.29 pg\/mL vs 0.784+\/\u22120.90 pg\/mL, mean+\/\u2212SD). In addition the urinary IL-6 level is a good indicator of diabetic nephropathy. Serum IL-6 is useful in the evaluation of atherosclerosis and nephropathy.","MCP-1, another pro-inflammatory cytokine is found highly expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions and postulated to play a central in monocyte recruitment into the arterial wall and developing lesions. See Libby, 247 J. I. M349-58 (2000). Recent results show that MCP-1 also is a key pathogenic molecule in diabetic nephropathy. See Eitner et al., 51 KI69-78 (1997); Banba et al. 58 KI684-90 (2000).","Glycated albumin stimulates endothelial production of IL-6 and MCP-1. The effects of glycated albumin on IL-6 production are comparable to that of TNF\u03b1, a known inducer of IL-6. Because of the well established role of these cytokines in vascular diseases, screening for compounds that block AGE-induction of these cytokines provides a novel approach for identifying therapeutic agents that block AGE-induced inflammation in vivo.","Once the baseline response to the stimulating agent for the production of cytokines by the endothelial cells is established, thus comprising the control levels for the screening assay, the methods comprise addition of compounds having unknown activities. The effect of the compound on the baseline response is determined by comparing the amount of cytokine produced in the presence of the stimulating agent and the amount of cytokine produced in the presence of the stimulating agent and the compound of the present invention. In one method, compounds that have inhibitory effects on the inflammation of the cells in the presence of glycated albumin are then used as therapeutic agents. One or more compounds may be added to the screening assay. Combinations or mixtures of compounds can be added. Different amounts and formulations of the compounds are added to determine the effects on the screening assay. The screening assay also may be used to determine stimulatory compounds or compounds that have no effects in the assay.","Table 2 presents examples that have inhibited Proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0707","num":"0705"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00016","num":"00016"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"238pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Proinflammatory","% of","Concentration"]},{"entry":["S.

Hyperproliferative Diseases","Several of the compounds of the present invention have cytotoxic activity and, thus, are also useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of at least one hyperproliferative disease in a cell, tissue, organ, animal, or patient including, but not limited to, malignant and non-malignant cell growth, leukemia, acute leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), B-cell, T-cell or FAB ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chromic myelocytic leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia, myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS), a lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, a malignamt lymphoma, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Kaposi's sarcoma, colorectal carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, malignant histiocytosis, paraneoplastic syndrome\/hypercalcemia of malignancy, solid tumors, adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, malignant melanoma, hemangioma, metastatic disease, cancer related bone resorption, cancer related bone pain, or any combination thereof.","Drug-Coated Medical Devices","The compounds of the present invention may be used alone or in combination with other agents along with delivery devices to effectively prevent and treat vascular disease, and in particular, vascular disease caused by injury and\/or by transplantation. Various medical treatment devices utilized in the treatment of vascular disease may ultimately induce further complications. For example, balloon angioplasty is a procedure utilized to increase blood flow through an artery and is the predominant treatment for coronary vessel stenosis. As stated above, however, the procedure typically causes a certain degree of damage to the vessel wall, thereby potentially exacerbating the problem at a point later in time. Although other procedures and diseases may cause similar injury, exemplary compounds of the present invention will be described with respect to the treatment of restenosis and related complications following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and other similar arterial\/venous procedures, including the joining of arteries, veins and other fluid carrying conduits in other organs or sites of the body, such as the liver, lung, bladder, kidney, brain, prostate, neck and legs.","The local delivery of a compound of the present invention and, optionally, other therapeutic agents, from a stent prevents vessel recoil and remodeling through the scaffolding action of the stent. In addition, drug-coated stents can prevent multiple components of neointimal hyperplasia or restenosis as well as a reduce inflammation and thrombosis. Local administration of a compound of the present invention and other therapeutic agents to stented coronary arteries also may have additional therapeutic benefit. For example, higher tissue concentrations of the compounds of the present invention and other therapeutic agents may be achieved utilizing local delivery rather than systemic administration. In addition, reduced systemic toxicity may be achieved utilizing local delivery rather than systemic administration while maintaining higher tissue concentrations. In utilizing local delivery from a stent rather than systemic administration, a single procedure may suffice with better patient compliance. An additional benefit of combination therapeutic agent and\/or compound therapy may be to reduce the dose of each of the therapeutic agents, thereby limiting their toxicity, while still achieving a reduction in restenosis, inflammation and thrombosis. Local stent-based therapy is therefore a means of improving the therapeutic ratio (efficacy\/toxicity) of anti-restenosis, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic therapeutic agents.","Although exemplary compounds of the present invention are described herein with respect to the treatment of restenosis and other related complications, it is important to note that the local delivery of a compound of the present invention, alone or as part of a therapeutic agent combination, may be utilized to treat a wide variety of conditions utilizing any number of medical devices, or to enhance the function and\/or life of the device. For example, intraocular lenses, placed to restore vision after cataract surgery is often compromised by the formation of a secondary cataract. The latter is often a result of cellular overgrowth on the lens surface and can be potentially minimized by combining a drug or drugs with the device. Other medical devices that often fail due to tissue in-growth or accumulation of proteinaceous material in, on and around the device, such as shunts for hydrocephalus, dialysis grafts, colostomy bag attachment devices, ear drainage tubes, leads for pace makers and implantable defibrillators also can benefit from the device-drug\/drug combination approach. Other surgical devices, sutures, staples, anastornosis devices, vertebral disks, bone pins, suture anchors, hemostatic barriers, clamps, screws, plates, clips, vascular implants, tissue adhesives and sealants, tissue scaffolds, various types of dressings, bone substitutes, intraluminal devices, and vascular supports could also provide enhanced patient benefit using this drug-device combination approach. Any type of medical device may be coated in some fashion with a compound of the present invention, alone or as part of a therapeutic agent combination that enhances treatment over the singular use of the device or therapeutic agent.","In addition to various medical devices, the coatings may be used to deliver a compound of the present invention in combination with other therapeutic agents including antiproliferative\/antimitotic agents including natural products such as vinca alkaloids (for example, vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine), paclitaxel, epidipodophyllotoxins (for example, etoposide, teniposide), antibiotics (dactinomycin (actinomycin D) daunorubicin, doxorubicin and idarubicin), anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, bleomycins, plicamycin (mithramycin) and mitomycin, enzymes (L-asparaginase which systemically metabolizes L-asparagine and deprives cells which do not have the capacity to synthesize their own asparagine); antiplatelet agents such as G(GP) IIb\/IIIa inhibitors and vitronectin receptor antagonists; antiproliferative\/antimitotic alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustards (mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide and analogs, melphalan, chlorambucil), ethylenimines and methylmelamines (hexamethylmelamine and thiotepa), alkyl sulfonates-busulfan, nirtosoureas (carmustine (BCNU) and analogs, streptozocin), trazenes-dacarbazinine (DTIC); antiproliferative\/antimitotic antimetabolites such as folic acid analogs (methotrexate), pyrimidine analogs (fluorouracil, floxuridine, and cytarabine), purine analogs and related inhibitors (mercaptopurine, thioguanine, pentostatin and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine)); platinum coordination complexes (cisplatin, carboplatin), procarbazine, hydroxyurea, mitotane, aminoglutethimide; hormones (e.g. estrogen); anticoagulants (heparin, synthetic heparin salts and other inhibitors of thrombin); fibrinolytic agents (such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase and urokinase), aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, abciximab; antimigratory; antisecretory (breveldin); anti-inflammatory agents such as adrenocortical steroids (cortisol, cortisone, fludrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, 6a-methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone, and dexamethasone), non-steroidal agents (salicylic acid derivatives, i.e., aspirin; para-aminophenol derivatives, i.e., acetominophen; indole and indene acetic acids (indomethacin, sulindac, and etodalac), heteroaryl acetic acids (tolmetin, diclofenac, and ketorolac), arylpropionic acids (ibuprofen and derivatives), anthranilic acids (mefenamic acid, and meclofenamic acid), enolic acids (piroxicam, tenoxicam, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenthatrazone), nabumetone, gold compounds (auranofin, aurothioglucose, gold sodium thiomalate); immunosuppressives (Cyclosporine, tacrolimus (FK-506), sirolimus (rapamycin), azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil); angiogenic agents: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF); angiotensin receptor blockers; nitric oxide donors; anti-sense oligionucleotides and combinations thereof; cell cycle inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and growth factor signal transduction kinase inhibitors.","Although any number of stents may be utilized in accordance with the present invention, for simplicity, a limited number of stents will be described herein. The skilled artisan will recognize that any number of stents may be utilized in connection with the present invention. In addition, as stated above, other medical devices may be utilized.","A stent is commonly used as a tubular structure left inside the lumen of a duct to relieve an obstruction. Typically, stents are inserted into the lumen in a non-expanded form and are then expanded autonomously, or with the aid of a second device in situ. A common method of expansion occurs through the use of a catheter-mounted, angioplasty balloon that is inflated within the stenosed vessel or body passageway in order to shear and disrupt the obstructions associated with the wall components of the vessel and to obtain an enlarged lumen.","A stent may resemble an expandable cylinder and may comprise a fenestrated structure for placement in a blood vessel, duct or lumen to hold the vessel, duct or lumen open, more particularly for protecting a segment of artery from restenosis after angioplasty. The stent may be expanded circumferentially and maintained in an expanded configuration that is circumferentially or radially rigid. The stent may be axially flexible and when flexed at a band, for example, the stent avoids any externally protruding component parts.","The stent may be fabricated utilizing any number of methods. For example, the stent may be fabricated from a hollow or formed stainless steel tube that may be machined using lasers, electric discharge milling, chemical etching or other means. The stent is inserted into the body and placed at the desired site in an unexpanded form. Expansion may be effected in a blood vessel by a balloon catheter, where the final diameter of the stent is a function of the diameter of the balloon catheter used. It should be appreciated that a stent in accordance with the present invention may be embodied in a shape-memory material including, for example, an appropriate alloy of nickel and titanium or stainless steel.","Structures formed from stainless steel may be made self-expanding by configuring the stainless steel in a predetermined manner, for example, by twisting it into a braided configuration. After the stent has been formed it may be compressed to occupy a space sufficiently small as to permit its insertion in a blood vessel or other tissue by insertion means, wherein the insertion means include a suitable catheter, or flexible rod. Upon emerging from the catheter, the stent may be configured to expand into the desired configuration where the expansion is automatic or triggered by a change in pressure, temperature, or electrical stimulation.","Furthermore, a stent may be modified to comprise one or more reservoirs. Each of the reservoirs may be opened or closed as desired. These reservoirs may be specifically designed to hold the therapeutic agent\/therapeutic agent combination to be delivered.","Regardless of the design of the stent, it is preferable to have the therapeutic agent\/therapeutic agent combination dosage applied with enough specificity and a sufficient concentration to provide an effective dosage in the affected area. In this regard, the reservoir size in the bands is sized to apply adequately the therapeutic agent\/therapeutic agent combination dosage at the desired location and in the desired amount.","Alternatively, the entire inner and outer surface of the stent may be coated with therapeutic agent\/therapeutic agent combination in therapeutic dosage amounts. The coating techniques may vary depending on the therapeutic agent\/therapeutic agent combination. Also, the coating techniques may vary depending on the material comprising the stent or other intraluminal medical device.","One or more compounds of the present invention and, in some instances, other therapeutic agents as a combination, may be incorporated onto or affixed to the stent in a number of ways. For example, the compound may be directly incorporated into a polymeric matrix and sprayed onto the outer surface of the stent. The compound elutes from the polymeric matrix over time and enters the surrounding tissue. The compound typically remains on the stent for at least three days up to approximately six months, for example, between seven and thirty days.","Any number of non-erodible polymers may be utilized in conjunction with the compound. According to one aspect of the present invention, the polymeric matrix comprises two layers. The base layer comprises a solution of poly(ethylene-covinylacetate) and polybutylmethacrylate. The compound is incorporated into this base layer. The outer layer comprises only polybutylmethacrylate and acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent the compound from eluting too quickly. The thickness of the outer layer or topcoat determines the rate at which the compound elutes from the matrix. Essentially, the compound elutes from the matrix by diffusion through the polymer matrix. Polymers are permeable, thereby allowing solids, liquids and gases to escape therefrom. The total thickness of the polymeric matrix is from about one micron to about twenty microns or greater. It is important to note that primer layers and metal surface treatments may be utilized before the polymeric matrix is affixed to the medical device. For example, acid cleaning, alkaline (base) cleaning, salinization and parylene deposition may be used as part of the overall process described above.","The poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate), polybutylmethacrylate and compound solution may be incorporated into or onto the stent in a number of ways. For example, the solution may be sprayed onto the stent or the stent may be dipped into the solution. The solution may be sprayed onto the stent and then allowed to dry. The solution may be electrically charged to one polarity and the stent electrically charged to the opposite polarity. In this manner, the solution and stent will be attracted to one another. In using this type of spraying process, waste may be reduced and more precise control over the thickness of the coat may be achieved. Other methods include spin coating and plasma polymerization.","Drug-coated stents are manufactured by a number of companies including Johnson & Johnson, Inc. (New Brunswick, N.J.), Guidant Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.), Medtronic, Inc. (Minneapolis, Minn.), Cook Group Incorporated (Bloomington, Ind.), Abbott Labs., Inc. (Abbott Park, Ill.), and Boston Scientific Corp. (Natick, Mass.). See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,273,913; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 20020051730; WO 02\/26271; and WO 02\/26139, each expressly entirely incorporated herein by reference.","Expression Profiles and Microarray Methods of Use","The present invention contemplates a variety of microarrays that may be used to study and monitor gene expression in response to treatment with the compounds of the present invention. For example, the microarrays of the present invention may be derived from, or representative of, for example, a specific organism or cell type, including human microarrays, vascular microarrays, inflammation microarrays, cancer microarrays, apoptosis microarrays, oncogene and tumor suppressor microarrays, cell-cell interaction microarrays, cytokine and cytokine receptor microarrays, blood microarrays, cell cycle microarrays, neuroarrays, mouse microarrays, and rat microarrays, or combinations thereof. The microarrays may represent diseases including cardiovascular diseases, vasculopathic conditions, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurological diseases, immunological diseases, various cancers, infectious diseases, endocrine disorders, and genetic diseases.","Alternatively, the microarrays useful in assessing the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention may represent a particular tissue type including, but not limited to, heart, liver, prostate, lung, nerve, muscle, or connective tissue; for example, coronary artery endothelium, umbilical artery endothelium, umbilical vein endothelium, aortic endothelium, dermal microvascular endothelium, pulmonary artery endothelium, myometrium microvascular endothelium, keratinocyte epithelium, bronchial epithelium, mammary epithelium, prostate epithelium, renal cortical epithelium, renal proximal tubule epithelium, small airway epithelium, renal epithelium, umbilical artery smooth muscle, neonatal dermal fibroblast, pulmonary artery smooth muscle, dermal fibroblast, neural progenitor cells, skeletal muscle, astrocytes, aortic smooth muscle, mesangial cells, coronary artery smooth muscle, bronchial smooth muscle, uterine smooth muscle, lung fibroblast, osteoblasts, prostate stromal cells, or combinations thereof.","The present invention further contemplates microarrays comprising a gene expression profile comprising one or more polynucleotide sequences including complementary and homologous sequences, wherein said gene expression profile is generated from a cell type treated with a compound of the present invention and is selected from the group comprising coronary artery endothelium, umbilical artery endothelium, umbilical vein endothelium, aortic endothelium, dermal microvascular endothelium, pulmonary artery endothelium, myometrium microvascular endothelium, keratinocyte epithelium, bronchial epithelium, mammary epithelium, prostate epithelium, renal cortical epithelium, renal proximal tubule epithelium, small airway epithelium, renal epithelium, umbilical artery smooth muscle, neonatal dermal fibroblast, pulmonary artery smooth muscle, dermal fibroblast, neural progenitor cells, skeletal muscle, astrocytes, aortic smooth muscle, mesangial cells, coronary artery smooth muscle, bronchial smooth muscle, uterine smooth muscle, lung fibroblast, osteoblasts, and prostate stromal cells.","The present invention contemplates microarrays comprising one or more protein-binding agents, wherein a protein expression profile is generated from a cell type treated with a compound of the present invention and is selected from the group comprising coronary artery endothelium, umbilical artery endothelium, umbilical vein endothelium, aortic endothelium, dermal microvascular endothelium, pulmonary artery endothelium, myometrium microvascular endothelium, keratinocyte epithelium, bronchial epithelium, mammary epithelium, prostate epithelium, renal cortical epithelium, renal proximal tubule epithelium, small airway epithelium, renal epithelium, umbilical artery smooth muscle, neonatal dermal fibroblast, pulmonary artery smooth muscle, dermal fibroblast, neural progenitor cells, skeletal muscle, astrocytes, aortic smooth muscle, mesangial cells, coronary artery smooth muscle, bronchial smooth muscle, uterine smooth muscle, lung fibroblast, osteoblasts, and prostate stromal cells.","More specifically, the present invention contemplates methods for the reproducible measurement and assessment of the expression of specific mRNAs or proteins in, for example, a specific set of cells. One method combines and utilizes the techniques of laser capture microdissection, T7-based RNA amplification, production of cDNA from amplified RNA, and DNA microarrays containing immobilized DNA molecules for a wide variety of specific genes, including HSPGs such as Perlecan, to produce a profile of gene expression analysis for very small numbers of specific cells. The desired cells are individually identified and attached to a substrate by the laser capture technique, and the captured cells are then separated from the remaining cells. RNA is then extracted from the captured cells and amplified about one million-fold using the T7-based amplification technique, and cDNA may be prepared from the amplified RNA. A wide variety of specific DNA molecules are prepared that hybridize with specific polynucleotides of the microarray, and the DNA molecules are immobilized on a suitable substrate. The cDNA made from the captured cells is applied to the microarray under conditions that allow hybridization of the cDNA to the immobilized DNA on the microarray. The expression profile of the captured cells is obtained from the analysis of the hybridization results using the amplified RNA or cDNA made from the amplified RNA of the captured cells, and the specific immobilized DNA molecules on the microarray. The hybridization results demonstrate, for example, which genes of those represented on the microarray as probes are hybridized to cDNA from the captured cells, and\/or the amount of specific gene expression. The hybridization results represent the gene expression profile of the captured cells. The gene expression profile of the captured cells can be used to compare the gene expression profile of a different set of captured cells. For example, gene expression profiles may be generated from cells treated (and not treated) with a compound of the present invention. The similarities and differences provide useful information for determining the differences between the same cell type under different conditions, more specifically, the change in gene expression in response to treatment with a compound of the present invention.","The techniques used for gene expression analysis are likewise applicable in the context of protein expression profiles. Total protein may be isolated from a cell sample and hybridized to a microarray comprising a plurality of protein-binding agents, which may include antibodies, receptor proteins, small molecules,. Using any of several assays known in the art, hybridization may be detected and analyzed as described above. In the case of fluorescent detection, algorithms may be used to extract a protein expression profile representative of the particular cell type. In this regard, the change in protein expression in response to treatment of cells with a compound of the present invention may be evaluated.","Thus, in one aspect, the present invention relates to at least one microarray corresponding to a population of genes isolated from a particular tissue or cell type is used to detect changes in gene transcription levels that result from exposing the selected tissue or cells to a candidate drug such as a compound of the present invention. A biological sample derived from an organism, or an established cell line, may be exposed to the candidate drug in vivo or ex vivo. Thereafter, the gene transcripts, primarily mRNA, of the tissue or cells are isolated by methods well-known in the art. S., MC: A L. M(2001). The isolated transcripts are then contacted with a microarray under conditions where the transcripts hybridize with a corresponding probe to form hybridization pairs. Thus, the microarray provides a model of the transcriptional responsiveness following exposure to a particular drug candidate. A hybridization signal may then be detected at each hybridization pair to obtain a gene expression profile.","Gene and\/or protein expression profiles and microarrays also may be used to identify activating or non-activating compounds of a particular gene such as Perlecan or other HSPG. Compounds that increase transcription rates or stimulate, maintain, or stabilize the activity of a protein are considered activating, and compounds that decrease rates or inhibit the activity of a protein are non-activating. Moreover, the biological effects of a compound may be reflected in the biological state of a cell. This state is characterized by the cellular constituents. One aspect of the biological state of a cell is its transcriptional state. The transcriptional state of a cell includes the identities and amounts of the constituent RNA species, especially mRNAs, in the cell under a given set of conditions. Thus, the gene expression profiles, microarrays, and algorithms discussed herein may be used to analyze and characterize the transcriptional state of a given cell or tissue following exposure to an activating or non-activating compound, specifically, a compound of the present invention.","Microarray techniques and methods for analyzing results are well known in the art.

The present invention further comprises methods of providing diagnostics and predictors relating to the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention. The present invention still further contemplates methods of providing expression profile databases, and methods for producing such databases, for normal and diseased tissues.","The expression profile database may be an internal database designed to include annotation information about the expression profiles generated to assess the effect of the compounds of the present invention and through other sources and methods. Such information may include, for example, the databases in which a given biomolecule was found, patient information associated with the expression profile, including age, cancer or tumor type or progression, information related to a compound of the present invention such as dosage and administration information, descriptive information about related cDNAs associated with the sequence, tissue or cell source, sequence data obtained from external sources, expression profiles for a given gene and the related disease state or course of disease, for example whether the expression profile relates to or signifies a particular disease state, and preparation methods. The expression profiles may be based on protein and\/or polynucleotide microarray data obtained from publicly available or proprietary sources. The database may be divided into two sections: one for storing the sequences and related expression profiles and the other for storing the associated information. This database may be maintained as a private database with a firewall within the central computer facility. However, this invention is not so limited and the expression profile database may be made available to the public.","The database may be a network system connecting the network server with clients. The network may be any one of a number of conventional network systems, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), as is known in the art (for example, Ethernet). The server may include software to access database information for processing user requests, and to provide an interface for serving information to client machines. The server may support the World Wide Web and maintain a website and Web browser for client use. Client\/server environments, database servers, and networks are well documented in the technical, trade, and patent literature.","Through the Web browser, clients may construct search requests for retrieving data from, for example, a microarray database and an expression profile database. For example, the user may \u201cpoint and click\u201d to user interface elements such as buttons, pull down menus, and scroll bars. The client requests may be transmitted to a Web application that formats them to produce a query that may be used to gather information from the system database, based, for example, on microarray or expression data obtained by the client, and\/or other phenotypic or genotypic information. Specifically, the client may submit expression data based on microarray expression profiles obtained from a patient treated with a compound of the present invention and use the system to obtain a diagnosis based on that information based on a comparison by the system of the client expression data with the expression data contained in the database. By way of example, the system compares the expression profiles submitted by the client with expression profiles contained in the database and then provides the client with diagnostic information based on the best match of the client expression profiles with the database profiles. Thus, in one aspect, the comparison of expression profiles aids the clinician in determining the effectiveness of treatment with a compound of the present invention. Based on such a comparison, the clinician may alter or adjust the treatment regimen.","In addition, the website may provide hypertext links to public databases such as GenBank and associated databases maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), part of the National Library of Medicine as well as, any links providing relevant information for gene expression analysis, genetic disorders, and scientific literature. Information including, but not limited to, identifiers, identifier types, biomolecular sequences, common cluster identifiers (GenBank, Unigene, Incyte template identifiers, and so forth) and species names associated with each gene, is contemplated.","The present invention also provides a system for accessing and comparing bioinformation, specifically expression profiles and other information which is useful in the context of the compositions and methods of the present invention. The computer system may comprise a computer processor, suitable memory that is operatively coupled to the computer processor, and a computer process stored in the memory that executes in the computer processor and which comprises a means for matching an expression profile of a biomolecular sequence from a patient with expression profile and sequence identification information of biomolecular sequences in a database. More specifically, the computer system is used to match an expression profile generated from a biological sample treated with a compound of the present invention with expression profile and other information in a database.","Furthermore, the system for accessing and comparing information contained in biomolecular databases comprises a computer program comprising computer code providing an algorithm for matching an expression profile generated from a patient, for example, treated with a compound of the present invention, with expression profile and sequence identification information of biomolecular sequences in a biomolecular database.","The present invention contemplates, for example, the use of a Graphical User Interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) for the access of expression profile information stored in a biomolecular database. The GUI may be composed of two frames. A first frame may contain a selectable list of biomolecular databases accessible by the user. When a biomolecular database is selected in the first frame, a second frame may display information resulting from the pair-wise comparison of the expression profile database with the client-supplied expression profile as described above, along with any other phenotypic or genotypic information.","The second frame of the GUI may contain a listing of biomolecular sequence expression information and profiles contained in the selected database. Furthermore, the second frame may allow the user to select a subset, including all of the biomolecular sequences, and to perform an operation on the list of biomolecular sequences. The user may select the subset of biomolecular sequences by selecting a selection box associated with each biomolecular sequence. The operations that may be performed include, but are not limited to, downloading all listed biomolecular sequences to a database spreadsheet with classification information, saving the selected subset of biomolecular sequences to a user file, downloading all listed biomolecular sequences to a database spreadsheet without classification information, and displaying classification information on a selected subset of biomolecular sequences.","If the user chooses to display classification information on a selected subset of biomolecular sequences, a second GUI may be presented to the user. The second GUI may contain a listing of one or more external databases used to create the expression profile databases as described above. Furthermore, for each external database, the GUI may display a list of one or more fields associated with each external database.
