{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation and claims the benefit of the filing date of an application entitled, \u201cSystems Management Operational Workflow Templates,\u201d Ser. No. 13\/168,999, filed Jun. 26, 2011, assigned to the assignee of the present application, and herein incorporated by reference.","The claimed subject matter relates generally to Information Technology (IT) infrastructure management and, more specifically, to specification templates for orchestration of workflows such as computer system server, storage, network, virtualization and cloud infrastructure resource management operations and tasks.","Provided are techniques for the specification of templates for the orchestration of workflows such as, but not limited to, computer system server, storage, network, virtualization and cloud infrastructure management operations and tasks. Today, many system and enterprise management software applications support some form of \u201corchestration,\u201d which, simply stated, involves an execution of a sequence of simple or complex, but typically arbitrary, management operations, which is termed as \u201cworkflow.\u201d However, most forms of orchestration do not support either non-scripted native representations of the workflows or the addition of new object types or operation sets or services. Workflows in existing orchestration software are also typically hard-coded and support invocation of arbitrary scripts or JAVA\u00ae operations that are typically opaque to an orchestration engine. As a result, existing orchestration cannot support either atomicity or transactional semantics of workflows. In addition, existing orchestration software lacks the ability to configure parameters for execution of workflow, which influences, for example, error, temporal and automation semantics.","Relational database servers have implemented \u201cworkflows\u201d using relational operations that, are orchestrated and automated at runtime. Arbitrary declarative workflow specifications are supported by most relational database servers via structured query language (SQL). For example, new relational tables may be added at any time without requiring the fundamental, model to be re-coded. The procedural\/operational model for SQL is called Relational Algebra, which is a set of well-defined set of relational database operations that support composition of such operations.","Provided are techniques for defining a set of normalized resources corresponding to a plurality of infrastructure resources; defining a set of normalized resource states corresponding to the plurality of infrastructure resources; defining a set of normalized, operations corresponding to the plurality of infrastructure resources, wherein inputs and outputs corresponding to each normalized operation of the set of normalized operations has a defined type of a plurality of types; generating a plurality of operational sequences, each operation sequence generated by composing a plurality of normalized operations of the set of normalized operations with corresponding normalized, resources of the set of normalized resources such that the output of each or the set of normalized operations becomes the input of another of the set of normalized operations, wherein a defined type corresponding to each particular input matches a defined type corresponding to the corresponding output; generating a workflow plan by composing the plurality of operational sequences in conformity with well-defined operational semantics; and storing, in a computer-readable storage medium, the workflow plan for execution on a processor.","This summary is not intended as a comprehensive description of the claimed subject matter but, rather, is intended to provide a brief overview of some of the functionality associated therewith. Other systems, methods, functionality, features and advantages of the claimed subject matter will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","Any combination of one or more computer readable medium(s) may be utilized. The computer readable medium may be a computer readable signal medium or a computer readable storage medium. A computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer readable storage medium, would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document, a computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","A computer readable signal medium may include a propagated data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein, for example, in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, electro-magnetic, optical, or any suitable combination thereof. A computer readable signal medium may be any computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage medium and that can communicate, propagate, or transport a program for use by or in connection, with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","Program code embodied on a computer readable medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc., or any suitable combination of the foregoing.","Computer program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","Aspects of the present invention are described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that, each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data, processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer, other programmable data, processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","Turning now to the figures,  is a block diagram of an example of a resource and infrastructure management architecture  that may implement the claimed subject matter. A management server  includes a central processing unit. (CPU), or \u201cprocessor,\u201d , coupled to a monitor , a keyboard  and a pointing device, or \u201cmouse,\u201d , which together facilitate human interaction with computing system  and management server . Also included in management server  and attached to management server  is a computer-readable storage medium (CRSM) , which may either be incorporated into computing system  i.e. an internal device, or attached externally to management server  by means of various, commonly available connection devices such as but not limited to, a universal serial bus (USB) port (not shown). CRSM  is illustrated storing an operating system  and a Resource and infrastructure Orchestration system (RIOS)  that, may implement the claimed subject matter.","It should be noted that a management server  would typically include more elements than the illustrated components but for the sake of simplicity only the illustrated components are shown. RIOS  is described in more detail below in conjunction with .","Management server  is connected to a management network , which may be, among other options, a local area network (LAN) or the Internet. A data server , coupled to a CRSM  and a CRSM , is also communicatively coupled to a physical managed network . Management network  provides connectivity between management server  and logical and virtual resource  and physical resources . Examples of devices that may be included in logical and virtual resources  include, but are not limited to, a hypervisor (HYVSR) , a virtual memory (VM) , a storage volume (SV) , a virtual disk (VD) , a virtual LAN (VLAN) , a virtual communication Ethernet or PC port, or port, , a virtual managed network , a virtual switch (not shown) or a virtual Ethernet bridge (not shown). Examples of devices that may be included in physical resources  include, but are not limited to, an application server , managed network , data server  with attached CRSMs  and , a CRSM  and a network adaptor (NA) . Physical systems and resources may be connected to each other via physical managed network such as, but not limited to, a LAN, SAN or converged FCoE LAN.","Although in this example, management server , logical and virtual resources  and physical resources  are communicatively coupled via management network , they could also be coupled through any number of communication mediums such as, but not limited to, a wide area network (WAN) (not shown) and direct wire (not shown). Further, it should be noted there are many possible resource and infrastructure management system configurations, of which resource and infrastructure management architecture  is only one simple example.","Resources  and  represent a pool of virtual or logical resource elements of physical devices, or simply a \u201cpool.\u201d In the following examples, the devices of pool are used as examples of computing resources, or objects, that may be orchestrated by means of the claimed technology. Collections of similar objects, such as CRSM  and  are referred to as groups. Relationships among different objects, including groups, such as the relationships among server  and CRSM  and  are referred to as infrastructures or fabrics. A dotted line  indicates that logical and virtual resources  represent various configurations of physical resources .","In addition, in the following example, the disclosed techniques are implemented by RIOS  executing on management server . It should be understood that many types of resources, both hardware and software, and systems may benefit form the claimed subject matter but for the sake simplicity the examples are limited to the types and numbers of components described above.","As the inventors herein have realized, a Resource and Infrastructure Management operational workflow can be written as a composition of resource management operations with well-defined operational semantics and flexible enough to support any hardware and\/or software infrastructure resource, including, for example, servers, storage, networks, virtualization elements and combinations thereof, including a cloud elements.","Throughout the Specification, a \u201cresource\u201d may be an individual atomic or composite objects, physical, logical or virtual computing objects, networking, storage or virtualization objects. Typically, a resource may exist independently and\/or may be provisioned independently. Examples of physical, resources include server systems, storage systems, network, switches, disk drives, adapters and so on. Examples of logical and virtual resources include virtual machines, storage volumes, files, virtual disks and so on. An atomic resource is one that cannot be divided. In a hierarchical definition, a resource may be a composite unit comprising other sub-resources. One examples of a composite resource type is a BladeCenter chassis. A group may be any collection of homogeneous or heterogeneous resources. Examples of groups include server pool, multi-pathing group, HA-redundant pair of network adapters, virtual machine collection and so on. A fabric Is an aggregate of typically logical connections between resources or groups of resources. Examples of fabrics include VLANs, FC SAN zones and so on.","In order to compose resource management operations the resource and infrastructure operational model supports the following;\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["116","116","139","140","141","139","141","139","141","116","102","100"]},"RIOS  also includes an orchestration engine  that stores executable logic for the implementation of aspects of the claimed subject matter including the definition of workflows. A Resource Operation Execution Logic (ROEL)  stores executable logic that implements a defined workflow. A runtime  stores executable logic for the implementation of aspects of RIDS  not handled by orchestration engine  and ROLL .","A management database  is a computer-readable storage medium that stores workflow templates , infrastructure objects  and modeled infrastructure objects . Workflow templates , Infrastructure object  and infrastructure objects  may store parameters such as, but not limited to, definitions of runtime semantics and definitions of normalized resources, resource states and operations. Such definitions may be composed into libraries that are extendable by the addition of additional definitions of runtime semantics and definitions of normalized resources, resource states and operations. Infrastructure objects  represents potential resources that may be discovered by discovery execution logic  at remote locations such as over the Internet. Functionality associated with components - and  are explained in more detail below in conjunction with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The three states include a Static Object Universe  (SOU_) , a Static Infrastructure Universe  (SIU_) , and a Dynamic infrastructure Universe  (DIU_) . Static Object Universe (SOU_)  is the universe of undeployed manageable resource and system objects known to a particular embodiment of the claimed subject matter, SOU_  illustrates objects - in an \u201cundeployed\u201d state, i.e. with no defined relationships. Objects in this universe are static and in a restful state. Static Infrastructure Universe (SIU_)  is the universe of all Deployed (connected) resources and composite resources known to a particular embodiment of the claimed subject matter. In this universe, the relationships and connections between resources are explicit. In this example, SIU_  illustrates objects - in a \u201cdeployed\u201d state and some relationships  among objects -. In general, objects and the corresponding relationships define an \u201cinfrastructure\u201d such as SIU_ . However, infrastructure resources in this universe are still static and not performing any useful function, Dynamic Infrastructure Universe (DIU_)  is the universe of Activated infrastructure resources that are deployed to perform some useful function in an interconnected way and known to a running computer program embodiment of this invention, DIU_  illustrates objects - in an \u201cactivated\u201d state with some relationships . Because DIU_  defines both objects and relationships, DIU_  represents a dynamic infrastructure.","A core set of infrastructure resources may be broadly classified into physical resources (see , ) (e.g. systems or platforms, disk drives, etc.), logical resources (see , ) (e.g. virtual machines, storage volumes, virtual disks, ports, etc.), groups (e.g., disk drive arrays, server system, pools, multi-pathing group, etc.), and fabrics (e.g., VLANs, FC SAN, etc). The rest of the types are composite objects on these basic resource types and in turn represent higher-order resources, groups and\/or fabrics. In this example, infrastructure resource states are reduced to the 3 key states: Undeployed, Deployed, and Activated. Undeployed implies\u2014not usable or exploitable. Deployed implies usable or exploitable. Activated implies being-used or exploited at any point in time. For example, a server in a reserve pool is undeployed, a storage volume attached to a server is deployed, and a virtual memory (VM) that has been started up is in activated state. In some cases, the move from deployed to activated may be a no-operation, or \u201cnop,\u201d but this normalized view across all resources facilitates the definition of an operational workflow. In addition, resources may have other states and status in which an administrator is interested; they maybe handled as before and are not critical to the operational workflow model.","Infrastructure management operations are strongly typed in that they have well-defined Inputs, Outputs and Operation Semantics, inputs are well-defined resource or group or fabric types. Some examples include:\n\n","Operations are strongly typed as follows. One embodiment of the signatures for the operations in this calculus are described below using a procedural programming language flavor such as C, C++ or JAVA\u00ae, Unary operations of the calculus have the following signature:\n\n","The exact implementation of the application programming interface above depends on the implementation. In general, regardless of whether an object is carried around as a reference type and returned as a reference type is up to the implementation. Implementations may vary depending on the language used for implementation. Other embodiments are possible within procedural languages, functional languages (such as Scheme), or logical calculus languages (which are beyond the scope of this invention). With the resource state, typing, and infrastructure management operations being normalized, the calculus comprises an enumerated normalized set of operations (otherwise termed as a library of operations). In general, a core subset of the enumerated set is expected to apply to all resources, groups, and fabrics. For example, Create, Delete, Deploy, Undeploy, Activate, and De-activate are expected to be applicable to all logical resources regardless of whether they are server, storage, or network resources. It is possible for a subset of the calculus to be applicable to only a subset of the resources, for example, Backup and Archive may apply only to storage resource objects. The calculus of operations is not a statis and fixed set\u2014additional operations discovered subsequently can be added to the set as long as it follows the constraints posed by this model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["1","150","161","165","161","165","182","183","184","185","186","187","188","182","188"]},"Create  creates a static database object and possibly a memory object that represents a manageable and provisionabie resource using the attributes, defined ports\/objects and constraints presented in a best practices template for the resource object. Create  is generally used for static creation of a logical resource object. For example, a cluster is a composite resource object that may be statically created, See \u201cReform\u201d which is a dynamic re-formation of a cluster and applies only to clusters. There may be other \u201cadd,\u201d \u201ccreate,\u201d \u201cdiscover,\u201d \u201cdelete\u201d or \u201cremove\u201d operations where end-point instances or group instances are added or created within the database or runtime. These operations do not have any defined input end-point or group. Any end-point\/group specification is performed as part of the constraints for the operation (see below). The output of these operations is an end-point or a group.","Delete  deletes an in-memory and\/or database object. Delete  takes an end-point or group as input and return NULL as output. With respect to Get , filter criteria may be specified in a SemanticsObject and if the filter when applied turns out to be TRUE, then for resources, platforms, fabrics or groups the corresponding objects are returned. Set  performs configuration, state-changing, etc operations on the object. Copy  typically applies to logical resources and causes a clone with a new object ID to be created. In this example, object  has been copied to create a new object .","Update  is a typically a nop for all but for physical Platform objects (also typically termed, as systems or devices). If an object represents an undatable software or hardware platform that requires a systems software or firmware update, then Update  is applicable. Transform  is typically used to transform the type of an object, in this example, object  has been transformed to a new object .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["1","150","1","160","1","170","186"]},"A Deploy  typically refers to the deployment of an atomic or composite resource object.

Fro a composite object, the semantics may provide additional constraints on where to add the member. Drop Member , drops, or removes, a member from a group or composite object. Get Member  applies filter criteria in the SemanticsObject and if the filter when applied turns out to be TRUE, then if a singular object satisfies the filter the member object is returned else NULL or NULL-GROUP is returned. NULL-GROUP implies more than one object was returned. Set Member  involves, if applicable, modifying the state of a particular member that matches a filter (e.g., an identifier) in the group or composite object. A Transfer  moves an object from one universe to another. In this example, Transfer  is illustrated moving both a dynamic object  and a deployed object  between Universe_  and Universe_ .","In addition there may be a GetSubGroup (not shown) that applies to sub-groupings or sub-composite objects within composite objects, respectively. Those member objects that result in a filter being TRUE are returned as a group of the same type as the original group (If the original object was a heterogeneous group and the filter retained only homogeneous objects, the returned group is still a heterogeneous group of the same type as the original group. There may also be a SetSubGroup (not shown) used to set the states of all members in the group that satisfy a filter criteria. A FormGroup (not shown) is used when a grouping or composite object supports a dynamic ability to \u201cform\u201d the group (example: clusters supports dynamic reformation of the group).
