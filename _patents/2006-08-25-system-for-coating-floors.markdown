{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS","EXAMPLES"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/451,466, filed Oct. 14, 2003, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention is concerned with coating systems for floors which, despite regular cleaning and\/or disinfection with agents that contain antimicrobial components, do not turn yellow or become discolored or only undergo such discoloration to a slight extent.","A person skilled in the art generally understands the expression \u2018polymer-based floor-maintenance agents\u2019 to mean, as a rule, classical maintenance agents which are capable of being removed by wet-chemical treatment. These removable maintenance agents are susceptible to disinfectants, particularly those based on alkylamines, quaternary ammonium compounds, alcohols, but also others, and no longer meet the more stringent demands of consumers. In particular, stains caused by skin disinfectants and hand disinfectants, as well as white stains caused by alcohol\/water and colored stains caused by marker substances as well as instances of yellowing caused by surface disinfectants based, for example, on quaternary ammonium compounds and also on amine-type active substances continue to lead to complaints from the persons responsible for buildings, by reason of the visual impairments. These problems are observed, above all, in hospitals. But they also occur in attenuated form in an environment where use is made of cleaning agents and\/or disinfecting agents that contain the indicated components.","By reason of the disadvantages of classical removable maintenance agents, in recent years it has been observed with increasing frequency that polyacrylates coupled to non-metals are being used in coating films, with the consequence that the resulting maintenance films are difficult to remove by wet chemical means or can no longer be removed by such means. \u201cWet chemical means\u201d refers to a traditional floor stripper designed to remove traditional zinc or metal crosslinked acrylic finishes. Examples of traditional strippers include BLAST, CARESTRIP LO, BENDUROL FORTE, and HAWK from Ecolab Inc., and PROSTRIP by SC Johnson Professional Products. Such a floor stripper when used at the recommended use concentration is capable of removing a traditional zinc crosslinked topcoat but not able to remove a non-traditional crosslinked undercoat. Typically a more aggressive chemistry is needed to remove the cross-linked undercoat. Examples of such films are films that are crosslinked with aziridine and based on polyacrylate. Theoretically, these maintenance films would really never have to be removed if the effective film or films were always to be renewed early enough. But practice has shown that this is not actually put into effect or that the non-removable maintenance film is frequently damaged and thereafter has to be removed mechanically in elaborate manner by erosive means. A further consideration is that in the grinding process the control over the grinding action is also limited, and damage to the covering occurs quite often.","Consequently the object of the present invention was to make available coating systems in which the outer layer is intended to serve, as it were, as a sacrificial layer and to be capable of being removed simply by wet chemical means, but in which, at the same time, the susceptibility of this simply removable sacrificial layer to discoloration with regard to antimicrobial components is to be minimal.","As is also evident from the examples section of the present invention, no maintenance films are known which are capable of being removed simply by wet chemical means and which, at the same time, display low susceptibility to discoloration in the sense of the present invention.","All the more surprising were the tests within the scope of the present invention, which showed that hardly any or no susceptibility to discoloration was present in respect of a coating system containing one or more base layers of a certain type that are not capable of being removed by wet chemical means and a maintenance layer or sacrificial layer applied thereon that is capable of being removed simply by wet chemical means and that, considered in itself, is susceptible to discoloration.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a coating system for floors, containing","a) one or more agents in which, together or separately, a polymer or polymer\/wax dispersion and aziridine and, where desired, a flatting component are present, for application on the floor in order to form a crosslinked base film that is not capable of being removed by wet chemical means, as well as","b) an aziridine-free agent containing conventional floor-maintenance components, in particular a polymer or polymer\/wax dispersion, for the purpose of generating a sacrificial film on said base film that is capable of being removed by wet chemical means.","In the system according to the invention, a) is preferably to be understood to comprise at least two agents, one of which contains the said aziridine and another of which contains the said polymer or polymer\/wax dispersion.","In a particularly preferred embodiment of the system according to the invention, a) is even to be understood to comprise at least three agents, a first of which contains the said aziridine, a second of which contains the said polymer or polymer\/wax dispersion and a third of which contains the said flatting component.","In some embodiments, a) and b) are identical compositions except that a) contains aziridine. In some embodiments, a) and b) are different compositions besides the addition of aziridine to a).","In accordance with the present invention, flatting components are preferably to be understood to be those which are selected from the large group comprising the compounds of silicic acid or polymer based materials. For a person skilled in the art, these compounds are those which, for example, are offered for sale by the companies Clariant, BYK CERA, Klein Additec. Additional flatting agents include the SYLOID C-SERIES silica gel flatting agents by Grace Davison, GASIL silica gels by INEOS, ACEMATT series by Degussa, and Lo-Vel flatting silicas from PPG Industries. The supplementary addition of the flatting component can be an advantage because stains in and on the maintenance film can be accentuated by gloss.","An attempt is often made to comply with the desire of consumers for less gloss by incorporating flatting agents. However, none of the products that contain flatting agents and that have been on the market hitherto is stable in storage. By reason of the low viscosity of the polymer dispersions, the flatting agents cream up, partly clot, or settle out on the floor. The products are predominantly offered for sale in 10-liter casks, so that sufficient homogenisation as a result of shaking of the cask does not take place.","In the service industry it is, moreover, not customary to employ stirrers for the purpose of homogenisation, as is customarily done by, for example, those responsible for laying floors and parquet flooring, where multi-component systems, also with flatting agents for example, are more frequently processed directly on site.","Therefore in the sense of the present invention it is an advantage to make the flatting component available, where desired, in the form of a separate agent and to use it only as needed.","In the system according to the invention the volumes of the casks in which the agents stated under a) have been decanted are preferably so chosen that when the complete contents of the casks are intermixed a mixture is present that exhibits precisely the ratio of the essential components for the system according to the invention that is desired for the formation of the base film or films.","In this connection it is particularly preferred if the volume of one of the stated casks, preferably that one in which the largest agent by volume is located, is so chosen that sufficient space is available to accommodate the contents of the additional stated cask or casks and to produce the desired mixture.","It is preferred, moreover, that in the system according to the invention at least two of the agents a) and\/or b) contain conventional floor-maintenance components known to those skilled in the art selected from the group comprising waxes, surfactants, diluents, solvents, surface slip modifiers, defoamers, indicators, UV absorbers\/light stabilizers\/antioxidants, plasticizers, coalescents, adhesion promoters, preservatives\/antimicrobial agents, levelling agents, thickeners, stability enhancers, dispersants, colorants, anti-settling agents, optical brighteners, alkali soluble resins, film-forming polymers and mixtures thereof, in which case, in particular, film-forming polymers are contained having a minimal film-forming temperature between 0 and 90\u00b0 C.","Some non-limiting examples of suitable waxes include oxidized polyethylenes and polypropylenes and copolymers thereof.","Some non-limiting examples of surface slip modifiers include organic or inorganic particles incorporated in the finish itself to reduce slipping.","Some non-limiting examples of defoamers include silicon emulsions such as SE-21 from Wacker Silicons.","Some non-limiting examples of indicators include acid\/base indicators, fluorescent indicators, redox indicators, metallochromic indicators, and photon sensitive dyes.

In the following, the invention summarises the visually recognisable changes to the surface which occur, such as yellowing and\/or staining, generally under the term \u2018discolorations\u2019.","The present invention further provides a process for coating floors, in which, in one process step, a base film containing aziridine-crosslinked polymers, where desired intermixed with flatting components, is applied, and, after drying, a sacrificial film containing conventional maintenance components for floors, in particular a polymer or polymer\/wax dispersion, is applied directly onto the stated base film in a further step. In this connection the subject-matter is to be understood in such a way that it is entirely possible for yet other coatings to be applied beneath the base film. The essential point in the sense of the present invention is that the film serving as basis for the sacrificial film or maintenance film that is not crosslinked with aziridine is to be understood as being the base film.","In the process according to the invention it is preferred that","i) prior to application of the stated base film the agents that are present in conformity with the system according to the invention have been decanted in casks, the volume of which is so chosen that when the complete contents of the casks are intermixed a mixture is present that exhibits precisely the ratio of the essential components in conformity with the system according to the invention that is desired for the formation of the base film, and","ii) the agents are prepared by bringing together and intermixing the entire contents of the stated casks for the application of the stated base film.","In this connection the bringing-together and intermixing of the entire contents of the stated casks are preferably carried out in one of the stated casks, particularly preferably in that cask in which the largest agent by volume is located.","If a) is to be understood to comprise several agents, one of which is, in accordance with the invention, identical with b), there is preferably the possibility of dispensing with one cask. In this case, for the base coating a first portion of the agent b) that is identical with a) would be intermixed with the additional agents a), namely the agents containing aziridine and\/or, where desired, flatting components, and applied. After drying of the base film, the remaining portion of the agent b) that is identical with a) could then be applied partially or wholly by way of sacrificial layer.","The present invention also provides a floor coating in which a sacrificial film containing conventional maintenance components for floors and, preferably, antimicrobial components is applied directly onto a base film containing aziridine-crosslinked polymers and, where desired, a flatting component.","The disclosed coating system can be applied to a variety of substrates, including wood, plastics, metals, concrete, wallboard and other mechanical or architectural substrates. The disclosed finishes are particularly well-suited for application to flooring substrates due to their clean appearance. Representative flooring substrates include resilient substrates such as sheet goods (e.g., vinyl flooring, linoleum or rubber sheeting), vinyl composite tiles, rubber tiles, cork and synthetic sports floors, and non-resilient substrates such as concrete, stone, marble, wood, ceramic tile, grout, Terrazzo and other poured or \u201cdry shake\u201d floors. The coating can be jobsite-applied to a flooring substrate after the substrate has been installed (e.g., to monolithic flooring substrates such as sheet vinyl goods, linoleum, cork, rubber sheeting, synthetic sports floors, concrete, stone, marble, grout or Terrazzo, or to multipiece flooring substrates such as vinyl composite tiles, wood floorboards or ceramic tiles), or can be factory-applied to a flooring substrate before it is installed (e.g., to monolithic flooring substrates such as sheet vinyl goods in roll form, or multipiece flooring substrates such as vinyl composite tiles or wood floorboards). Jobsite application is especially preferred, with suitable jobsites including indoor and outdoor sites involving new or existing residential, commercial and government- or agency-owned facilities.","The disclosed coating system can be applied using a variety of methods, including spraying, brushing, flat or string mopping, roll coating and flood coating. Mop application, especially flat mopping, is preferred for coating most floors. Suitable mops include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,315,734, 5,390,390, 5,680,667 and 5,887,311. Typically, the floor should first be cleaned and any loose debris removed. One or more undercoat layers or coats (diluted if necessary with water or another suitable diluent, plasticizer, coalescent or cosolvent) may be applied to the floor. One to three undercoat layers typically will be preferred. When multiple undercoat layers are employed they can be the same or different. Each undercoat layer preferably will have a dry coating thickness of about 2.5 to about 25 microns, more preferably about 2.5 to about 15 microns. Preferably the overall undercoat dry coating thickness will be about 5 to about 100 .mu.m, and more preferably about 5 to about 50 .mu.m.","In several series of tests the influence on the appearance of various coating systems was investigated in the case of regular treatment with disinfectant solutions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Ingredients of the coating formulations [in wt. %]"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Ingredient","B1","B2","B3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Zn-crosslinked polyacrylate","\u2014","20\u2002","\u2014"]},{"entry":["Non-crosslinked polyacrylate","18\u2002","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["Aziridine-crosslinked polyacrylate","\u2014","\u2014","19\u2002"]},{"entry":["Wax dispersion based on","3","3","3"]},{"entry":"polyethylene\/polypropylene"},{"entry":["Polyurethane dispersion","2","2","2"]},{"entry":["Non-ionic surfactant: fatty alcohol with 6\u20137 EO","2","2","2"]},{"entry":"groups"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Remainder to 100 wt. %: water and additional conventional substances* for floor-coating agents"},{"entry":"*for example, permanent plasticizers (optionally tributoxyethyl phosphate), temporary plasticizers (such as ethyl diglycol), flow promoters (such as non-ionic surfactants or other wetting agents)"}]}}]}}},"The various floor-coating systems to be tested were produced using the floor-coating formulations B1 to B3 according to Table 1.
