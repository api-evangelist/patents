No. 60\/612,374, filed Sep. 23, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to substituted pyrimidine compounds, methods and compositions for making and using substituted pyrimidine compounds, and methods for preventing or treating diseases in humans or animals employing such compounds and compositions.","Novel compounds for new therapeutic interventions are needed for many areas of medicine and disease treatment. For example, chronic and acute inflammatory conditions form the basis for diseases affecting all organ systems including, but not limited to, asthma, acute inflammatory diseases, vascular inflammatory disease, chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, angiopathy, myocarditis, nephritis, Crohn's disease, arthritis, type I and II diabetes and associated vascular pathologies. The incidence of these inflammatory conditions is on the rise in the population as a whole, with diabetes alone affecting 16 million people. Therefore, synthesis of novel compounds leads to new possibilities for discovery of novel therapeutic interventions.","While inflammation in and of itself is a normal immune response, chronic inflammation leads to complications and ongoing system damage due to the interactions of unknown cellular factors. In particular, chronic inflammation can cause endothelial damage resulting in vascular complications. Coronary artery, cerbrovascular and peripheral vascular disease resulting from atherosclerotic and thromboembolic macroangiopathy are the primary causes of mortality in chronic inflammatory diseases.","Many humans and animals have limited lifespans and lifestyles because of conditions relating to lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise, or because of genetic predispositions to develop a disease. For example, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is a common consequence of endothelial injury and is believed to be an early pathogenetic event in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques or complications related to vascular injury or as a result surgical interventions. Abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular occlusive lesions, including arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and graft atherosclerosis after organ transplantation.","One disease that rapidly growing in the industrialized countries is the occurrence of diabetes and all of its attendant sequellae. One of the factors important in the damage associated with diabetes is the presence of glycated proteins. Glycated proteins and advanced glycation end products (AGE) contribute to cellular damage, particularly, diabetic tissue injury. One potential mechanism by which hyperglycemia can be linked to microangiopathies is through the process of non-enzymatic glycation of critical proteins. These are a highly reactive group of molecules whose interaction with specific receptors on the cell-surface which are thought to lead to pathogenic outcomes.","Another major area of unwanted cellular growth, that is unchecked by the body's regulatory systems, is cancer or oncological conditions. Many therapies have been used and are being used in an effort to restore health or at least stop the unwanted cell growth. Many times, therapeutic agents can have an effect individually, but often, therapeutic regimes require combinations of different pharmacological agents with treatments such as surgery or radiation.","There is a present need for treatments of chronic or acute diseases, such as atherosclerosis, unwanted cellular growth or cellular proliferation, diabetes, inflammatory conditions and vascular occlusive pathologic conditions. Because of occurrence is frequent, the currently available treatments are costly and the conditions are refractory to many pharmacological therapies. The mechanisms involved in the control or prevention of such diseases are not clear and there exists a need for preventive and therapeutic treatments of these and other diseases. Thus, what is presently needed are novel compounds that find utility in methods and compositions for treatment and prevention of chronic and acute diseases, to which the present invention is directed.","The present invention is directed to novel pyrimidines, novel compositions comprising pyrimidines, and novel methods employing such pyrimidines and compositions. Disclosed herein are methods for making pyrimidines, compositions comprising pyrimidines, and methods and compositions for using pyrimidines. The pyrimidine compounds and compositions comprising the compounds have utility in treatment of a variety of diseases.","In one aspect, compounds in accordance with the present invention, and compositions comprising these compounds, comprise nitrogen heterocyclic compounds of formula (II):","In one aspect, this disclosure provides for compounds and compositions comprising these compounds, wherein the compounds have the following formula (II):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"24.64mm","wi":"53.85mm","file":"US07820654-20101026-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"wherein:","Yand Y, in each occurrence, are independently >NR, \u2014(CH)n-, \u2014(CH)p-(CH\u2550CH)(CH)q-, >CRR, \u2014(CH)p(C\u2261C)(CH)q-, \u2014O\u2014, >CO, \u2014S\u2014, >SO or >SO;

for identifying the activity and screening for one or more of these compounds or molecules that induce synthesis of proteoglycans such as HSPG are taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/091,357, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Assays of effects of compounds in vivo are also taught in the incorporated references and are known to those skilled in the art. In general, methods comprise the addition of such compounds to assays and measurement of HSPG synthesis including, but not limited to, the production of syndecans, glypicans and perlecans, for example, syndecans 1, 2 and 4; and glypican-1. Other assays that can be used to determine the activity of the compounds of the present invention include other methods for measuring the induction of perlecan synthesis. For example, in one assay, perlecan is induced in cells by certain inducers, and the response is measured. Compounds of the present invention are then added to a replicate assay and the effect on perlecan induction is determined. Using such methods, compounds are determined that can either inhibit perlecan, elevate induction of perlecan, or that have no effect at all. Those compounds that are effective as therapeutic agents can then be used in animals, humans or patients with cellular proliferation disease aspects, such as vascular-associated diseases or SMC (smooth muscle cell) proliferation pathologies.","Another assay for determining compounds having SMC effects comprises adding a composition suspected of effecting SMC proliferation to smooth muscle cells in growth medium or serum-free medium. The change in cell proliferation can be measured by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as incorporation of labeled nucleotides into dividing cells' DNA, and compared to the proliferation of cells which are not treated with the compound. Other measurements include directly determining levels of HSPG synthesis by measuring the amount or change in amount of HSPG such as with ELISA for HSPGs, and compared to the amount of HSPG synthesis in untreated cells. Other indirect or direct measurements are contemplated by the present invention and are known to those skilled in the art. For example, such methods include, but are not limited to, measurement of RNA levels, RT-PCR, Northern blotting, Western blotting promoter-based assays to identify compounds that affect one or more proteoglycans and assays for proteoglycan biological activity shown by recombinant proteins, partially purified proteins, or lysates from cells expressing proteoglycans in the presence or absence of compounds of interest.","An assay for identifying and determining an activity of one or more of the compounds of the present invention comprises identifying compounds that interact with the promoter regions of a gene, or interact and affect proteins that interact with the promoter region, and are important in the transcriptional regulation of the protein's expression. For example, if perlecan were the protein, in general, the method comprises a vector comprising regulatory sequences of the perlecan gene and an indicator region controlled by the regulatory sequences, such as an enzyme, in a promoter-reporter construct. The protein product of the indicator region is referred to herein as a reporter enzyme or reporter protein. The regulatory region of the sequence of perlecan comprises a range of nucleotides from approximately \u22124000 to +2000 wherein the transcription initiation site is +1, more preferably, from \u22122500 to +1200, most preferably, from \u22121500 to +800 relative to the transcription initiation site.","Cells are transfected with a vector comprising the promoter-reporter construct and then treated with one or more compositions comprising at least one compound of the present invention. For example, the transfected cells are treated with a composition comprising a compound suspected of affecting the transcription of perlecan and the level of activity of the perlecan regulatory sequences are compared to the level of activity in cells that were not treated with the compound. The levels of activity of the perlecan regulatory sequences are determined by measuring the amount of the reporter protein or determining the activity of the reporter enzyme controlled by the regulatory sequences. An increase in the amount of the reporter protein or the reporter enzyme activity shows a stimulatory effect on perlecan, by positively effecting the promoter, whereas a decrease in the amount or the reporter protein or the reporter enzyme activity shows a negative effect on the promoter and thus, on perlecan.","Additionally, the present invention comprises methods and compositions that can be used with gene therapy methods and composition, such as those gene therapy methods comprising administering compositions comprising nucleic acids that affect the synthesis or expression of HSPGs, particularly perlecan. Such methods and compositions are taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/091,357, incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention comprises methods and compositions for mediating proteoglycan synthesis, expression and for the maintenance of SMC in a quiescent state. Methods and compositions of the present invention comprise treatment and prevention of vascular diseases and pathologies related to cellular proliferation, such as SMC proliferation. Such methods and compositions comprise methods for inhibition of SMC growth and proliferation, and for induction of quiescence in smooth muscle cells. Aspects of the present invention comprise methods and compositions for inducing proteoglycan synthesis, particularly HSPG synthesis and expression including, but not limited to, the induction of HSPGs such as syndecans, glypicans, and perlecans, and preferably perlecan synthesis and gene expression. Perlecan is a major extracellular HSPG in the blood vessel matrix. It interacts with extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors, and receptors. Perlecan is also present in basement membranes other than blood vessels and in other extracellular matrix structures.","The activities of the compounds included in the present invention affect cells or tissues to increase the synthesis of proteoglycans by those cells or tissues or may act directly upon one or more proteoglycans to modulate the biological activity or to increase the biological stability of the proteoglycan itself, for example, of the protein perlecan. Activities also included herein are ones that increase the biosynthesis of one or more proteoglycans by increasing the transcription of the poteoglycan gene, increasing the biological stability, of the proteoglycan mRNA or increasing the translation of proteoglycan mRNA into protein. Further activites include activities of compounds that can block or decrease the effects of agents or proteins that inhibit the activity of proteoglycans.","The present invention comprises methods and compositions for the treatment and prevention of smooth muscle cell proliferation, including vascular occlusive pathologies.

Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, those disclosed herein. As disclosed herein, compositions comprising such compounds may be used in conjunction with other therapeutic agents or in methods comprising steps such as altered patient activities, including, but not limited to, changes in exercise or diet.","Glycosidase Modulation Activity","The present invention also comprises methods and compositions comprising compounds described herein that have an activity associated with modulation of glycosidase enzymes and thus, affecting the substrates for such enzymes. Glycosidase enzymes and their activity with their substrates, such as proteoglycans or glycated proteins, are aspects of a variety of diseases such as vascular conditions, including those conditions discussed supra, proteoglycan-associated diseases, supra, associated diseases with vascular components, including but not limited to, kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, cardiovascular disease, generalized vascular disease, proliferative retinopathy, macroangeopathy, inflammatory diseases and metastatic diseases such as cancer, cellular proliferative conditions, and solid and blood borne tumors or other oncological conditions.

One or more compounds disclosed herein have at least an activity that has utility in treatment of disease states.","The activity of the compounds of the present invention in inhibiting glycated protein- and AGE-induced inflammation can be determined using the assays described herein and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/026,335, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Such assays comprise measurement of the specific activity of biological components involved in a known cellular response. The assays provide a measurable response in which the activity of the compounds is determined. One assay comprises measurement of the effects of compounds on an inflammatory response by cells to the presence of a stimulating agent. Yet another assay comprises endothelial cells that are stimulated by the addition of a glycated protein, the stimulating agent. The endothelial cells respond by producing specific cytokines. The amount of cytokines produced are determined by measurement protocols known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of the present invention are then added to the assay and the production of cytokines is measured. From the comparison of the assay without the compound with the assay with the compound, the biological effect of the compound can be determined. The compound may have an inhibitory effect, a stimulatory effect, or no effect at all.","The amount and type of cytokine produced can be determined using immunological methods, such as ELISA assays. The methods of the present invention are not limited by the type of assay used to measure the amount of cytokine produced, and any methods known to those skilled in the art and later developed can be used to measure the amount of cytokines produced in response to the stimulating agent and to the compound having unknown activity.","An aspect of the present invention comprises methods and compositions for the treatment of diseases, preconditions, or pathologies associated with inflammatory cytokines and other inflammation related molecules including, but not limited to IL-6, VCAM-1, or AGE-induced MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1).","Assays for determining the activity of compounds capable of modulating inflammation include those taught in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10\/026,335 and 09\/969,013, which are both expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties. In general, once the baseline response to the stimulating agent for the production of cytokines by the endothelial cells is established, thus comprising the control levels for the screening assay, the methods comprise addition of compounds of the present invention. The effect of the compound on the baseline response is determined by comparing the amount of cytokine produced in the presence of the stimulating agent and the amount of cytokine produced in the presence of the stimulating agent and the compound of the present invention. In one aspect of the present invention, compounds that have inhibitory effects on the inflammation of the cells in the presence of glycated albumin are then used as therapeutic agents. One or more compounds may be added to the screening assay. Combinations or mixtures of compounds can be added. Different amounts and formulations of the compounds are added to determine the effects on the screening assay. The screening assay may also be used to determine stimulatory compounds or compounds that have no effects in the assay.","The present invention comprises methods and compositions for the treatment and prevention of disease, conditions and pathologies associated with inflammation. Such methods comprise administration of compositions comprising compounds capable of modulating the activity of molecules associated with inflammation such as AGE or cytokines or other cellular factors, including release rates or activity, and include compositions comprising compounds disclosed herein with inflammation modulating activity. Administration of such compounds that are effective in modulating inflammation are administered to humans and animals suspected of having or who have inflammatory diseases, for example, diabetic-induced vasculopathies, autoimmune diseases, renal insufficiency, Alzheimer's syndrome, and inflammation-induced diseases such as atherosclerosis. Effective amounts are administered to such humans and animals in dosages that are safe and effective, including, but not limited to, the ranges taught herein. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, those disclosed herein.

Though this example focuses on vascular disease, provision of the compounds of the present invention with medical devices for treatment of the diseases and conditions capable of being treated with the compounds is contemplated by the present invention.","Various medical treatment devices utilized in the treatment of vascular disease may ultimately induce further complications. For example, balloon angioplasty is a procedure utilized to increase blood flow through an artery and is the predominant treatment for coronary vessel stenosis. However, the procedure typically causes a certain degree of damage to the vessel wall, thereby creating new problems or exacerbating the original problem at a point later in time. Although other procedures and diseases may cause similar injury, exemplary aspects of the present invention will be described with respect to the treatment of restenosis and related complications following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and other similar arterial\/venous procedures, including the joining of arteries, veins, and other fluid carrying conduits in other organs or sites of the body, such as the liver, lung, bladder, kidney, brain, prostate, neck, and legs.","The local delivery of a compound of the present invention and, in some aspects, along with other therapeutic agents, from a stent prevents vessel recoil and remodeling through the scaffolding action of the stent. The activity of compound provided, with or without other therapeutic agents, helps determine for which application, to treat which disease, the coated medical device is being administered. For example, compound-coated stents can prevent multiple components of neointimal hyperplasia or restenosis as well as reduce inflammation and thrombosis. Local administration of a compound of the present invention and other therapeutic agents to stented coronary arteries may also have additional therapeutic benefit. For example, higher tissue concentrations of the compounds of the present invention and other therapeutic agents may be achieved utilizing local delivery rather than systemic administration. In addition, reduced systemic toxicity may be achieved utilizing local delivery rather than systemic administration while maintaining higher tissue concentrations. In utilizing local delivery from a stent rather than systemic administration, a single procedure may suffice with better patient compliance. An additional benefit of combination therapeutic agent and\/or compound therapy may be to reduce the dose of each of the therapeutic agents, thereby limiting toxicity, while still achieving a reduction in restenosis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Local stent-based therapy is therefore a means of improving the therapeutic ratio (efficacy\/toxicity) of anti-restenosis, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic therapeutic agents.","Although exemplary aspects of the invention will be described with respect to the treatment of restenosis and other related complications, it is important to note that the local delivery of a compound of the present invention, alone or as part of a therapeutic agent combination, may be utilized to treat a wide variety of conditions utilizing any number of medical devices, or to enhance the function and\/or life of the device. For example, intraocular lenses, placed to restore vision after cataract surgery, are often compromised by the formation of a secondary cataract. The latter is often a result of cellular overgrowth on the lens surface and can be potentially minimized by combining one or more compounds of the present invention having activity that is effective in preventing unwanted cellular growth with the device. Other medical devices that often fail due to tissue in-growth or accumulation of proteinaceous material in, on and around the device, such as shunts for hydrocephalus, dialysis grafts, colostomy bag attachment devices, ear drainage tubes, leads for pace makers, and implantable defibrillators can also benefit from the combinations of the compounds of the present invention, possibly other pharmaceutical agents, and the devices. Other surgical devices, sutures, staples, anastomosis devices, vertebral disks, bone pins, suture anchors, hemostatic barriers, clamps, screws, plates, clips, vascular implants, tissue adhesives and sealants, tissue scaffolds, various types of dressings, bone substitutes, intraluminal devices, and vascular supports could also provide enhanced patient benefit using this compound-device combination approach. Essentially, any type of medical device may be coated in some fashion with at least one compound of the present invention, alone or as part of a therapeutic agent combination, which enhances treatment over the use of the device or therapeutic agent without combination with the compound.","As disclosed supra, the compounds of the present invention can be administered in combinational therapies with other therapeutic agents, and are not limited to only the other therapeutic agents disclosed herein. Thus, the present invention also contemplates, in addition to various medical devices, the coatings on these devices may be used to deliver a compound of the present invention in combination with other therapeutic agents. This illustrative list of therapeutic agents can be administered through pharmeutical means or in association with medical devices and such therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antiproliferative\/antimitotic agents including natural products such as vinca alkaloids (e.g., vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine), paclitaxel, epidipodophyllotoxins (e.g., etoposide, teniposide), antibiotics [e.g., dactinomycin (actinomycin D) daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and idarubicin], anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, bleomycins, plicamycin (mithramycin), and mitomycin, enzymes (L-asparaginase which systemically metabolizes L-asparagine and deprives cells which do not have the capacity to synthesize their own asparagine); antiplatelet agents such as G(GP) Ib\/IIIa inhibitors and vitronectin receptor antagonists; antiproliferative\/antimitotic alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustards (e.g., mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide and analogs, melphalan, chlorambucil), ethylenimines and methylmelamines (hexaamethylmelamine and thiotepa), alkyl sulfonates-busulfan, nirtosoureas [carmustine (BCNU) and analogs, streptozocin], trazenes-dacarbazinine (DTIC); antiproliferative\/antimitotic antimetabolites such as folic acid analogs (methotrexate), pyrimidine analogs (e.g., fluorouracil, floxuridine, and cytarabine), purine analogs and related inhibitors [mercaptopurine, thioguanine, pentostatin, and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine)]; platinum coordination complexes (cisplatin, carboplatin), procarbazine, hydroxyurea, mitotane, aminoglutethimide; hormones (e.g., estrogen); anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, synthetic heparin salts and other inhibitors of thrombin); fibrinolytic agents (such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and urokinase), aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, abciximab; antimigratory; antisecretory (breveldin); anti-inflammatory agents such as adrenocortical steroids (e.g., cortisol, cortisone, fludrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, 6\u03b1-methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone, and dexamethasone), non-steroidal agents (salicylic acid derivatives, i.e., aspirin; para-aminophenol derivatives, i.e., acetominophen; indole and indene acetic acids (indomethacin, sulindac, and etodalac), heteroaryl acetic acids (tolmetin, diclofenac, and ketorolac), arylpropionic acids (ibuprofen and derivatives), anthranilic acids (mefenamic acid, and meclofenamic acid), enolic acids (piroxicam, tenoxicam, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenthatrazone), nabumetone, gold compounds (auranofin, aurothioglucose, gold sodium thiomalate); immunosuppressives, (Cyclosporine, tacrolimus (FK-506), sirolimus (rapamycin), azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil); angiogenic agents: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF); angiotensin receptor blockers; nitric oxide donors; anti-sense oligionucleotides and combinations thereof; cell cycle inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and growth factor signal transduction kinase inhibitors.","Although any number of stents may be utilized in accordance with the present invention, for simplicity, a limited number of stents will be described in exemplary aspects of the present invention. The skilled artisan will recognize that any number of stents may be utilized in connection with the present invention. In addition, as stated above, other medical devices may be utilized. For example, though stents are described, sleeves outside the vessels are also contemplated, as are other medical devices that can provide a substrate for administration for at least one of the compounds of the present invention.","A stent is commonly used as a tubular structure left inside the lumen of a duct to relieve an obstruction. Typically, stents are inserted into the lumen in a non-expanded form and are then expanded autonomously, or with the aid of a second device in situ. A common method of expansion occurs through the use of a catheter-mounted, angioplasty balloon that is inflated within the stenosed vessel or body passageway in order to shear and disrupt the obstructions associated with the wall components of the vessel and to obtain an enlarged lumen.","A stent may resemble an expandable cylinder and may comprise a fenestrated structure for placement in a blood vessel, duct or lumen to hold the vessel, duct or lumen open, more particularly for protecting a segment of artery from restenosis after angioplasty. The stent may be expanded circumferentially and maintained in an expanded configuration that is circumferentially or radially rigid. The stent may be axially flexible and when flexed at a band, for example, the stent avoids any externally protruding component parts.","The stent may be fabricated utilizing any number of methods. For example, the stent may be fabricated from a hollow or formed stainless steel tube that may be machined using lasers, electric discharge milling, chemical etching or other means. The stent is inserted into the body and placed at the desired site in an unexpanded form. In one aspect, expansion may be effected in a blood vessel by a balloon catheter, where the final diameter of the stent is a function of the diameter of the balloon catheter used. It should be appreciated that a stent in accordance with the present invention may be embodied in a shape-memory material including, for example, an appropriate alloy of nickel and titanium or stainless steel.","Structures formed from stainless steel may be made self-expanding by configuring the stainless steel in a predetermined manner, for example, by twisting it into a braided configuration. In this aspect, after the stent has been formed it may be compressed so as to occupy a space sufficiently small as to permit its insertion in a blood vessel or other tissue by insertion means, wherein the insertion means include a suitable catheter, or flexible rod. Upon emerging from the catheter, the stent may be configured to expand into the desired configuration where the expansion is automatic or triggered by a change in pressure, temperature, or electrical stimulation.","Furthermore, a stent may be modified to comprise one or more reservoirs. Each of the reservoirs may be opened or closed as desired. These reservoirs may be specifically designed to hold the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination to be delivered. Regardless of the design of the stent, it is preferable to have the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination dosage applied with enough specificity and a sufficient concentration to provide an effective dosage in the affected area. In this regard, the reservoir size in the bands is preferably sized to adequately apply the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination dosage at the desired location and in the desired amount.","In an alternative aspect, the entire inner and outer surface of the stent may be coated with the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination in therapeutic dosage amounts. The coating techniques may vary depending on the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination. Also, the coating techniques may vary depending on the material comprising the stent or other intraluminal medical device.","One or more compounds of the present invention and, in some instances, other therapeutic agents as a combination, may be incorporated onto or affixed to the stent in a number of ways. In one aspect, the compound is directly incorporated into a polymeric matrix and sprayed onto the outer surface of the stent. The compound elutes from the polymeric matrix over time and enters the surrounding tissue. The compound preferably remains on the stent for at least three days up to approximately six months, and more preferably between seven and thirty days.","Any number of non-erodible polymers may be utilized in conjunction with the compound, and such polymeric compositions are well known in the art. In one aspect, the polymeric matrix comprises two layers. The base layer comprises a solution of poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate) and polybutylmethacrylate. The compound is incorporated into this base layer. The outer layer comprises only polybutylmethacrylate and acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent the compound from eluting too quickly. The thickness of the outer layer or topcoat determines the rate at which the compound elutes from the matrix. Essentially, the compound elutes from the matrix by diffusion through the polymer matrix. Polymers are permeable, thereby allowing solids, liquids and gases to escape therefrom. The total thickness of the polymeric matrix is in the range from about one micron to about twenty microns or greater. It is important to note that primer layers and metal surface treatments may be utilized before the polymeric matrix is affixed to the medical device. For example, acid cleaning, alkaline (base) cleaning, salinization and parylene deposition may be used as part of the overall process described above.","The poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate), polybutylmethacrylate, and compound solution may be incorporated into or onto the stent in a number of ways. For example, the solution may be sprayed onto the stent or the stent may be dipped into the solution. Other methods include spin coating and plasma polymerization. In one aspect, the solution is sprayed onto the stent and then allowed to dry. In another aspect, the solution may be electrically charged to one polarity and the stent electrically charged to the opposite polarity. In this manner, the solution and stent will be attracted to one another. In using this type of spraying process, waste may be reduced and more precise control over the thickness of the coat may be achieved.","Drug-coated stents are manufactured by a number of companies including Johnson & Johnson, Inc. (New Brunswick, N.J.), Guidant Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.), Medtronic, Inc. (Minneapolis, Minn.), Cook Group Incorporated (Bloomington, Ind.), Abbott Labs., Inc. (Abbott Park, Ill.), and Boston Scientific Corp. (Natick, Mass.). See e.g., U.S. Pat.
