title: Lateral field excitation of bulk acoustic waves from an IC-compliant low voltage source
abstract: An Interdigital Bulk Acoustic-Wave Transducer (IBAT) device is provided with pairs of exciting electrode fingers disposed sufficiently close together on the piezoelectric substrate and dielectric coating over the exciting electrode fingers to generate an IC-compatible voltage at relatively high electric field strength, resulting in a reduced region of excitation and uniform electric field strength distribution. The IBAT advantageously produces a lateral electric field substantially uniform over a substantial portion of the active BAW structure area, reducing, or virtually eliminating sharp voltage spikes, an electrical field produced by the low voltages resident on integrated circuit (IC) chips, usually of a magnitude of 10 volts, or lower, the planar electrode structure being compatible with IC processing techniques, such as photolithography and the BAWs produced thereby being essentially plane waves, with propagation away from, but with phase progression substantially parallel to, the substrate surface. Numerous IBAT structural arrangements are possible by advantageously over-coating the IBAT electrode finger stripes with an insulating dielectric in different configurations, and any possible configuration achieved through over-coating is considered to be within the contemplation of the devices and methods of the present invention. Interdigital bulk acoustic wave transducers and methods for exciting bulk acoustic waves with interdigital electrode fingers are also provided.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment to us of any royalty thereon.","This invention relates in general to field of Bulk Acoustic Waves. In particular, this invention relates to an Interdigital Bulk Acoustic-Wave Transducer based on lateral field excitation of Bulk Acoustic Waves.","Bulk Acoustic Waves (BAWs) are generated in piezoelectric media by applying a time-varying electric source to a suitable electrode system. The earliest uses of BAWs were in BAW plates, but they were found to be inadequate for higher frequencies because of difficulties in grinding the plates to the requisite thinness. Then, Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs) were tried for the higher frequency ranges, but SAWs could not be generated efficiently, until the Interdigital Transducer (IDT) was introduced. The IDT had the estimable quality of generating SAWs by its geometry. The IDT finger spacing determined the main operating frequency of the SAW device, because it determined the wavelength, and hence frequency, at which resonance occurred. Because the IDT photolithography means, and because very small finger spacings could be obtained thereby, the IDT afforded the ability to reach high frequencies simply by depositing a metallic finger pattern on the surface of the thick, robust substrate. The surface wave \u201cstuck\u201d to the surface, and would not penetrate much into the depth of the substrate. There was no need to grind the substrate into an impossibly thin layer.","Yet, even SAWs suffer from a number of limitations such as beam divergence and triple-transit echoes and the possibility of making BAWs at frequencies to match, or even exceed, those of the SAWs has been investigated. Making BAWs to match the SAW frequencies would require techniques other than mechanical grinding, because the requisite thin dimensions were far too small to grind. Another approach was to fabricate a BAW with thin film. Up until now, IDTs have not been employed to generate BAWs in the thin film because the IDT is generally considered a modality for generating SAWs, not BAWs.","When BAWs are used as an acoustic resonator or filter, one or more of the frequency-determining dimensions of the piezoelectric body yield the desired resonance characteristics. Considering the case of a thin plate made of a single piezoelectric material with electrodes placed on the major surfaces, if the requisite piezoelectric coefficient exists when an electric voltage energizes the plate, it exhibits resonances when the exciting frequency is such that its thickness dimension is an odd integral multiple of one-half of an acoustic wavelength. In this situation, the BAW forms a standing wave pattern in the thickness direction and provides two counter-propagating waves that travel in the thickness direction. Communications technology continues to seek devices operating at increasingly higher frequencies. Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency; therefore one finds increased use of the thickness of piezoelectric materials as the frequency-determining dimension for BAWs with thin film and membrane structures reaching the necessary higher frequencies. These mechanical motions are referred to as thickness modes of vibration. One excitation method is the \u201cthickness excitation\u201d (TE) or \u201cthickness-field excitation\u201d (TFE). When electrodes are placed at the plate edges and produce a field in a direction parallel to the plate surface, and hence perpendicular to the acoustic plane wave direction, this is known as \u201clateral excitation\u201d (LE) or \u201clateral-field excitation\u201d (LFE).","Besides exciting resonators with the SAW generated with an IDT, shallow bulk acoustic waves (SBAWs) or surface skimming bulk waves (SSBWs) have also been used. One characteristic of the SBAW and the SSBW is that surface perturbations, such as corrugations and ridges, placed parallel to the electrode fingers, but outside the IDT region, keep the quasi-BAW waves bound in the region of the surface so they do not escape into the substrate interior. However, devices based on the SBAW and SSBW wave types are not commercially viable. Until now, BAWs generated from IDT would be considered weak, spurious and detrimental because the typical low IC voltages do not provide adequate electric field strength for piezoelectric excitation of conventional electrode structures and result in unacceptable performance. Additionally, a non-uniform electric field further degrades performance. Up until now, the IDT has never been used purposely to generate plane-wave BAWs that propagate away from, and normal to, the substrate surface.","To overcome the disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of the prior art resonating structures, there has been a long-felt need to provide a planar electrode structure that is both IC-compliant and able to be energized by a low-voltage source. It is also critical to achieve an adequate electric field strength that is uniformly distributed over the whole BAW accessible active region. The necessary increased voltage is generally inconsistent with the voltages resident on typical IC chips and in other electronic components. Electric field strength, which produces piezoelectric driving, equals, for a uniform field, applied voltage divided by the electrode separation. For a given applied voltage, requisite electric field strength determines the gap size, or separation. Prior art LFE electrode configurations employ individual electrode pairs placed on, or recessed in, a resonant substrate, causing a relatively large separation. The present inventors have developed a quite different technique for resolving the long-standing problems, difficulties and disadvantages of inadequate excitation strength and non-uniform power distribution.","The present invention provides an advantageous and innovative IDT structure to generate BAWs by modifying the IDT with dielectric structures to make the IDT capable of generating BAWs efficiently. Instead of depositing two electrodes exposing a large fraction of the active area of the resonant structure to the exciting electric field, this invention provides for depositing two exciting IDT electrode structures with finger spacings for LFE sufficiently close together on the piezoelectric substrate to cause a voltage compatible with IC devices for a usefully high electric field strength, which results in a substantial region of excitation covered by the IDT finger structure so as to produce efficient transduction. Depositing the exciting electrodes on the piezoelectric substrate in this manner results in an electrode system that is properly matched to the piezoelectric structure and overcomes the difficulties, disadvantages and shortcomings of the prior art piezoelectric resonators and frequency discriminators.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an Interdigital Bulk Acoustic-Wave Transducer (\u201cIBAT\u201d) that provides relatively high electric field strength.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an IBAT LFE structure that provides relatively high electric field strength by advantageously placing pairs of exciting electrodes sufficiently close together on the piezoelectric substrate to cause IC-compatible voltage with relatively high electric field strength, which results in a reduced region of excitation.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for generating high electric field strength in an IBAT LFE structure by advantageously placing pairs of exciting electrodes sufficiently close together on the piezoelectric substrate to cause IC-compatible voltage with relatively high electric field strength, which results in a reduced region of excitation.","These and other objects and advantages can now be attained by this invention's Interdigital Bulk Acoustic-Wave Transducer (IBAT), comprising pairs of exciting electrode fingers disposed sufficiently close together on the piezoelectric substrate and dielectric coating over the exciting electrode fingers to generate an IC-compatible voltage at relatively high electric field strength, resulting in a reduced region of excitation and uniform electric field strength distribution. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize the advantages of producing a lateral electric field substantially uniform over a substantial portion of the active BAW structure area, reducing, or virtually eliminating sharp voltage spikes, an electrical field produced by the low voltages resident on integrated circuit (IC) chips, usually of a magnitude of 10 volts, or lower, the planar electrode structure being compatible with IC processing techniques, such as photolithography and the BAWs produced thereby being essentially plane waves, with propagation away from, but with phase progression substantially parallel to, the substrate surface. In accordance with the present invention, numerous IBAT structural arrangements are possible by advantageously over-coating the IBAT electrode finger stripes with an insulating dielectric in different configurations, and any possible configuration achieved through over-coating is considered to be within the contemplation of the devices and methods of the present invention. The devices and methods of the present invention include embodiments such as an interdigital bulk acoustic wave transducer device, interdigital bulk acoustic wave transducer and methods for exciting bulk acoustic waves with interdigital electrode fingers, to overcome the disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of prior art devices and techniques.","The simplest interdigital transducer (IDT) consists of two symmetrically interdigitated combs of identical electrode finger stripes, each comb consisting of geometrically parallel metallic fingers. Referring now to the drawings,  are perspective, cross-sectional and exploded views of an illustrative prior art interdigital transducer.  is a perspective view of an IDT piezoelectric plate , comprising a substrate , input terminal , input transducer , SAW , output transducer  and output terminal . Arrow  indicates the preferred direction of propagation in the piezoelectric plate. The  cross-sectional view of substrate  depicts two sets of three finger pairs of IDT electrode fingers stripes  for illustrative purposes. The typical IDT generally includes hundreds of finger pairs. The  exploded view depicts one pair, or period , of IDT finger stripes  and a period gap, or separation, G, between the IDT fingers . The  width A between the centers of each IDT finger  is \u00bd \u03bb, and the width of each IDT finger  is \u00bc \u03bb. Aluminum is often preferred as the electrode finger material because its acoustic impedance closely matches the acoustic impedances of most piezoelectric substrates. All IDT finger stripes  of each comb are connected electrically in parallel via a bus bar electrode, which will be illustrated in more detail in subsequent drawings. The IDT piezoelectric plate  depicted in  is a one-port structure, and the exciting voltage is placed across the two bus bars to energize the electrode fingers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A\u20132F","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIGS. 2C and 2D","FIG. 2E","FIG. 2F"]},"Referring now to , there is depicted a top conceptual view of the Interdigital Bulk Acoustic Transducer (IBAT)  of the present invention. The IBAT  comprises a substrate , a first comb of IDT electrode finger stripes , , ,  and  connected to a first bus bar  and a second comb of IDT electrode finger stripes , , ,  and  connected to a second bus bar . Each set of paired IDT electrode fingers, e.g.  and ,  and  and so on, are also known as a period, and are separated by a period gap G, which has a first edge opposing any of the fingers , , ,  and  of the first comb and a second edge opposing any of the fingers , , ,  and  of the second comb. Each pair of IDT fingers constitutes a one-port structure. An electrode gap G separates the electrode edge of IDT finger  of the \u2013 period and the electrode edge of IDT finger  of the \u2013 period. One of the dielectric coating strips \u2013 cover each period gap G, with the dielectric strips  and  depicted in cut-away style showing the underlying structures in a broken-line format. The electrode gap G is wider than the period gap G. The exciting voltage is placed across the first and second bus bars  and , respectively, at contact points  and  to energize the IDT fingers \u2013 of the first and second combs.","The alternating fingers, such as  and , have opposite polarity because of the interdigitation. When placed on a piezoelectric substrate of appropriate orientation, the IDT pair \u2013 will, when supplied with an AC voltage, produce mechanical surface tractions that are piezoelectric in origin, and that are spatially distributed over the substrate  according to the placement of the first comb of IDT fingers , , ,  and  and the second comb of IDT fingers  and , , ,  and .","Those skilled in the art will readily recognize the mechanism of piezoelectric transduction, and that piezoelectric tractions are primarily produced at the electrode finger edges, where they can be approximated as Dirac delta functions. Consider conducting electrode finger stripes of width m, separated by gaps of width (1\u2212m) and m is known as the metallization ratio. With the coordinate origin taken in the center of period gap G, and potentials of \u00b1\u00bd volt applied to alternate electrodes, the expression for the tangential component of the electric field, which is the component parallel to the substrate surface, normalized to that of a parallel plate capacitor of the same electrode separation, is given as follows:\n\n(\u03c8,)=(2\u03b8)\/(sin\u03b8)\u00b7{\u03a3(cos(2\u03b8)\u00b7cos[(21)\u03c0\u03c8]},\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the normalized distance in the direction perpendicular to the electrode finger lengths, Pare the Legendre polynomials, K is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, \u03b8=[(1\u2212m)\u03c0\/2], and the summation is over n=0, 1, 2 . . . . The periodicity condition\n\n(\u03c8+)=(\u22121)(\u03c8,),\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwith p any integer, along with the symmetry condition\n\n(\u2212\u03c8,)=+(\u03c8,),\u2003\u2003(3)\n\ndescribes e(\u03c8, m) anywhere in terms of \u03c8 in the range \u00bd\u2267\u03c8\u22670.\n","The IBAT  of the present invention is configured for plane-wave BAW excitation. Prior art IDTs produce electric fields that alternate in polarity from one electrode gap to the next, making the traditional IDT configuration unusable for lateral excitation (LE) BAW excitation, because the effect of the spatially alternating lateral fields produces a cancellation for purposes of BAW production. The spatial non-uniformity of the electric field, as discussed above, is an additional impediment to using prior art IDTs. The IBAT  of the present invention solves the problem of spatially alternating lateral fields and the advantageous structure of the first comb of IDT electrode fingers , , ,  and , second comb of IDT electrode fingers , , ,  and  and dielectric coating strips \u2013 efficiently generates both BAWs and suppresses the production of SAWs, or other mode types, to any significant extent. The IBAT devices and methods of the present invention have overcome and resolved two long-standing difficulties of prior art planar electrode structures for LFE excitation of BAW: the spatial asymmetry of electric field direction, i.e. alternating field directions over the active surface area with traditional IDT geometry; and non-uniform electric field strength in the gap regions, evidenced by having the electric field highly concentrated in the vicinity of the electrode finger edges. In accordance with the present invention, by employing suitably placed coatings of material with a high dielectric constant, along with multi-level electrode depositions, the long-standing difficulties, shortcomings and disadvantages of prior art BAW structures have in large measure be obviated.","Referring back to , dimension W is the total width separating the bus bars  and . The first comb of IDT electrode fingers , , ,  and  have a length Land finger width t. The second comb of IDT electrode fingers , , ,  and  have a length Land finger width t. Electrode overlap, or aperture, is (L+L\u2212W), which constitutes the width of the active region producing acoustic waves. A relatively small number of interdigital electrode fingers and related components are depicted in  for the sake of clarity, however the devices of the present invention would ordinarily include hundreds of the IDT electrode fingers.","The dielectric coating strips \u2013 are composed of an insulating material of high dielectric constant (high dielectric permittivity) and are placed over the narrower electrode gaps of width G while the G gaps remain uncoated. In this configuration, where gaps alternate between small (G) and large (G), and where the small gap regions are coated with a dielectric with a high permittivity, the high permittivity dielectric does not change the tangential component of electric field, E, i.e., that parallel to the surface, in the gap, but the normal component, which is perpendicular to the surface, is modified according to the well known relation:\n\n=(\u03b5\/\u03b5)\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nwhere subscript \u201c1\u201d refers to the dielectric, and subscript \u201c2\u201d refers to the substrate. If the permittivity of the coating is greater than that of the substrate, then the total field strength, which is the vector sum of both components, will be reduced in strength. The dielectric coating strips \u2013 should also reduce the danger of dielectric breakdown, or sparking, in the G period gap. In accordance with the present invention, the term \u201chigh dielectric constant\u201d is considered to be a relative dielectric constant of about 10:100.\n","A number of variations are possible and are considered to be within the contemplation of this invention, such as having the first set of IDT electrode fingers , , ,  and  and the second set of IDT electrode fingers , , ,  and  composed of aluminum. Aluminum is often preferred as the electrode material because its acoustic impedance closely matches the acoustic impedances of most piezoelectric substrates. The dielectric coating strips \u2013 can be composed of vacuum deposited plastics. The dielectric coating strips \u2013 can completely cover each period gap G, and the size of the period gap may be varied according to the required electrical field according to the formula G=V\/E.

Metallic fingers constituting the IDT electrodes have thicknesses usually about 100 nanometers (1000 \u212b); thinner electrodes would produce unacceptably high electrical resistance and thicker ones would produce undesired mass loading effects. Electrodes of this thickness produce quite high electric field concentrations at their edges, as seen in . At times, the fields can be high enough to produce migration of the aluminum constituting the IDT electrode fingers, or even cause dielectric breakdown.
