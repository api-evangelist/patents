abstract: A tapered roller bearing is designed to have a roller loading ratio in the range of 0.7 to 0.92 and a ratio of roller length to roller diameter in the range of 1.1 to 1.7 whereby oil agitation loss and rolling viscous resistance are reduced for achieving the reduction of running torque. Crownings are provided which are designed to have an outer-ring crowning parameter (=RCO/LRO) in the range of 30 to 150 and an inner-ring crowning parameter (=RCI/LRI) in the range of 50 to 260, provided that RCO denotes the radius of an outer ring crowning, LRO denotes the raceway length of an outer ring, RCI denotes the radius of an inner ring crowning and LRI denotes the raceway length of an inner ring. Thus, the rolling viscous resistance is reduced for achieving the reduction of running torque.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a tapered roller bearing for use in a differential gear assembly or the like of automotive vehicles and industrial machines.","The tapered roller bearing has higher load carrying capacity and higher rigidity than a ball bearing. Therefore, the tapered roller bearing is used in a vehicular pinion-shaft supporting assembly such as an automotive differential gear assembly or a transaxle assembly. However, the tapered roller bearing also suffers a drawback of having a great running torque (loss). In this connection, proposals have been made to reduce rolling friction by forming crownings on raceways of inner and outer rings or on rolling contact surfaces of tapered rollers (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No.2003-130059 and No.2001-65574).","The above prior-art examples are designed to improve the performance of the tapered roller bearing by defining the configuration of the crowning on the raceway or on the rolling contact surface. However, the crowning has never been approached from the viewpoint of quantity. Hence, no attempt has been made to reduce the running torque of the tapered roller bearing by defining the quantity or the like of the crowning. On the other hand, rolling viscous resistance of the tapered rollers and oil agitation loss constitute major factors of the great running torque of the tapered roller bearing such as mounted in the differential gear assembly or the like. However, a guideline for reducing these resistances has not been defined.","In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the invention to effectively reduce the running torque of the tapered roller bearing by taking multiple factors into considerations.","According to the present invention, a tapered roller bearing comprises: an outer ring; an inner ring; a plurality of tapered rollers interposed between these rings; and a retainer for retaining the tapered rollers, and is characterized in that","a roller loading ratio represented by z\u00b7DW\/(\u03c0\u00b7dm) is in a range of 0.7 to 0.92, and a ratio of roller length to roller diameter as represented by LWR\/DW is in a range of 1.1 to 1.7, provided that z denotes a number of rollers, LWR denotes an effective length of the roller, DW denotes a mean diameter of the roller and dm denotes a Pitch Circle Diameter (PCD) of the roller, and wherein","an outer-ring crowning parameter (=RCO\/LRO) is in a range of 30 to 150, and an inner-ring crowning parameter (=RCI\/LRI) is in a range of 50 to 260, provided that RCO denotes a radius of an outer-ring crowning, LRO denotes a raceway length of the outer ring, RCI denotes a radius of an inner-ring crowning, and LRI denotes a raceway length of the inner ring.","In such a tapered roller bearing, the oil agitation loss and the rolling viscous resistance may be reduced by reducing the roller-length\/roller-diameter ratio with the roller loading ratio maintained in the small numerical range. Furthermore, the rolling viscous resistance may be reduced by setting the above crowning parameters in the aforementioned ranges. Thus, the running torque may be reduced effectively.","According to another aspect of the invention, a tapered roller bearing comprises: an outer ring; an inner ring; a plurality of tapered rollers interposed between these rings; and a retainer for retaining the tapered rollers, wherein","a roller loading ratio represented by z\u00b7DW\/(\u03c0\u00b7dm) is in the range of 0.7 to 0.92 whereas a ratio of roller length to roller diameter as represented by LWR\/DW is in the range of 1.1 to 1.7, provided that z denotes the number of rollers, LWR denotes the effective length of the roller, DW denotes the mean diameter of the roller and dm denotes the Pitch Circle Diameter of the roller, and wherein","raceways of the outer ring and the inner ring and a rolling contact surface of the tapered roller are each provided with a crowning;","a total crowning amount (=an outer-ring crowning amount+an inner-ring crowning amount+a roller crowning amount\u00d72) is 50 \u03bcm or more;","an outer-ring crowning rate (=the outer-ring crowning amount\/the total crowning amount) is 40% or more; and","a roller crowning rate (=(the roller crowning amount\u00d72)\/the total crowning amount) is 20% or less.","In such a tapered roller bearing, the oil agitation loss and the rolling viscous resistance may be reduced by reducing the roller-length\/roller diameter ratio with the roller loading ratio maintained in the small numerical range. Furthermore, the rolling viscous resistance may be reduced by setting the above crowning parameters in the aforementioned ranges.","In the above tapered roller bearing, a roller diameter parameter (2DW\/(D\u2212d)) may be in a range of 0.44 to 0.52, provided that d denotes a bore diameter of the inner ring, and D denotes an outside diameter of the outer ring.","In this case, the bearing has a greater roller diameter than that of a conventional product of the same size. Accordingly, a free space within the bearing is increased in volume to facilitate the oil flow through the bearing, so that the oil agitation loss is reduced.","A tapered roller bearing assembly may comprise oil inflow restricting means for restricting the inflow of oil, the restricting means being provided at an axial one end of space between the inner ring and the outer ring of the above tapered roller bearing. The oil inflow restricting means may comprise a labyrinth seal defined between the inner ring and an annular portion which is formed at an end of a small diameter portion of the retainer as extended radially inwardly from place adjacent to the outer ring and which adjoins the inner ring at an inside circumferential end thereof. The tapered roller bearing assembly may have an alternative constitution wherein an additional member not constituting the tapered roller bearing is provided as the oil inflow restricting means. For example, the labyrinth seal may be provided in a bearing housing.","In this case, the oil inflow into the bearing is restricted, so that the rolling viscous resistance and the oil agitation loss are reduced. In this manner, the running torque is reduced.","In the above tapered roller bearing, a contact angle of the outer ring may be in a range of 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0.","In this case, the bearing is increased in a pumping action to promote the oil discharge, so that the oil agitation loss is reduced. Thus is reduced the running torque.","In the above tapered roller bearing, an inner-ring crowning rate (=the inner-ring crowning amount\/the total crowning amount) may be 10% or more.","In this case, the bearing may be reduced in contact load on areas of axially opposite ends of a contact surface between the inner raceway and the rolling contact surface. In the event of a so-called edge load, as well, the bearing is adapted to reduce the action of the edge load, so that the bearing may be prevented from suffering the decrease of service life.","According to the invention, a vehicular pinion-shaft supporting assembly comprises tapered roller bearings disposed on a pinion-gear side of a pinion-shaft and on the opposite side therefrom, and is characterized in that a tapered roller baring disposed on the pinion-gear side is the tapered roller bearing assembly including the oil inflow restricting means.","In such a vehicular pinion-shaft supporting assembly, the inflow of oil into the head-side tapered roller bearing, which is susceptible to the oil inflow, may be restricted by way of the oil inflow restricting means (such as the labyrinth seal). Hence, the running torque may be reduced.","Next, description is made on preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.  is a sectional view showing an automotive differential gear assembly  which is used as a vehicular pinion-shaft support assembly employing a tapered roller bearing according to an embodiment of the invention. The differential gear assembly  includes a pinion-shaft  driven into rotation by an unillustrated drive shaft and a differential transmission mechanism , the pinion-shaft and the differential transmission mechanism accommodated in a case . A pinion-gear  is disposed at a distal end of the pinion-shaft  and is meshed with a ring gear  of the differential transmission mechanism . The pinion-shaft  is rotatably supported relative to the case  by means of a tapered roller bearing H on a pinion-gear side  (hereinafter, referred to as \u201chead side\u201d) and a tapered roller bearing T on the opposite side therefrom (hereinafter, referred to as \u201ctail side\u201d). The case  is formed with a lubricating oil feeding path  between the pair of tapered roller bearings H, T such as to introduce a lubricating oil as indicated by arrows in the figure for lubricating raceways of the bearings.","Now, description is made on a lubricating operation of the above differential gear assembly . A lubricating oil (not shown) is stored in a bottom of the case  for lubricating the overall interior of the differential gear assembly . The ring gear  of the differential transmission mechanism  is driven into rotation in a direction of an arrow in the figure when a vehicle is driven into forward movement. The lubricating oil stored in the bottom of the case  is lifted upward by way of the rotation of the ring gear . The lubricating oil so lifted is guided through the lubricating oil feeding path  to space between the pair of tapered roller bearings H, T. Thus, the lubricating oil is fed into the bearings. The lubricating oil flowing through the head-side tapered roller bearing H is returned to the bottom of the case . The lubricating oil flowing through the tail-side tapered roller bearing T is returned to the bottom of the case  via an unillustrated return path. In this manner, the lubricating oil is circulated in the interior of the differential gear assembly .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","1","1","1","10","11","20","21","30","40","30"]},"In each of the tapered roller bearings H, T, the inner ring  is formed with a great rib  and a small rib  on a great diameter side thereof (the right-hand side as seen in the figure) and on a small diameter side thereof (the left-hand side as seen in the figure), respectively. The great rib and the small rib serve to restrict an axial movement of the tapered rollers . The head-side tapered roller bearing H shown in  is also formed with a cylindrical portion  which is extended from the small rib  to a left end of the inner ring  and has a smaller outside diameter than that of the small rib . On the other hand, the retainer  is formed with an annular portion  at an end on a small diameter side thereof (the left-hand side as seen in the figure), the annular portion extended radially inwardly from place adjacent to the outer ring. An inside circumferential end of the annular portion  is in adjoining relation with an outer periphery of the cylindrical portion  of the inner ring  and with a side surface of the small rib  of the inner ring, whereby a labyrinth seal S is formed. In this manner, the labyrinth seal S is formed between the retainer  and the inner ring , so that the lubricating oil is prevented from flowing into the bearing from the left-hand side as seen in the figure. It is noted that the tail-side tapered roller bearing T is not provided with such a labyrinth seal.","If the aforesaid labyrinth seal S is not provided in the head-side tapered roller bearing H, a large quantity of lubricating oil is fed through a front side of the bearing H (the left-hand side of the tapered roller bearing H shown in ) and through a back side thereof (the right-hand side as seen in the figure). Hence, the head-side tapered roller bearing H receives a larger quantity of oil inflow than the tail-side tapered roller bearing T. Accordingly, the head-side tapered roller bearing H is increased in the oil agitation loss. On the other hand, the tail-side tapered roller bearing T is supplied with less lubricating oil at cold engine start, so that the bearing is prone to seizing.","On this account, the head-side tapered roller bearing H is provided with the aforesaid labyrinth seal S for restricting the oil inflow therein, so that the tapered roller bearing H is reduced in the oil agitation loss. In the meantime, some of the lubricating oil to be allowed to flow into the head-side tapered roller bearing H without the labyrinth seal S is supplied to the tail-side tapered roller bearing T. Thus, the lubrication of the tail-side tapered roller bearing T is improved so that the bearing is less prone to seizing. In a case where the tail-side tapered roller bearing T is supplied with an excessive quantity of lubricating oil, a suitable labyrinth seal may also be provided in the tapered roller bearing T.","Next, description is made on a specific design guideline.","An effective way to reduce the running torque of the tapered roller bearings H, T is to reduce the oil agitation loss and the rolling viscous resistance. Firstly, the oil agitation loss may be reduced by quickly discharging the lubricating oil flown into the bearing. Therefore, means for promoting oil outflow may be provided. Specifically, a roller loading ratio is decreased to provide an increased circumferential gap between the tapered rollers. However, the decrease of the roller loading ratio leads to the decrease of the load carrying capacity. To compensate for this drawback, the tapered roller is increased in the diameter (mean diameter). In addition, the tapered roller is decreased in the area of contact with the lubricating oil by reducing the length thereof. Furthermore, the bearing may be enhanced in a pumping action by increasing a contact angle of the outer ring. On the other hand, the restriction of the oil inflow itself is thought to contribute to the reduction of the oil agitation loss. Therefore, the labyrinth seal S as inflow restricting means may be provided at least in the head-side tapered roller bearing H, as described above.","The decreased roller loading ratio and the configuration of the roller increased in the diameter but decreased in the length (or the thick, short roller configuration) lead to the reduction of the area of rolling contact surface and hence, the rolling viscous resistance is reduced. Furthermore, the rolling viscous resistance may also be reduced by providing the crowning on the raceway or the rolling contact surface.","While the differential gear assembly has been described as one example of the vehicular pinion-shaft supporting assembly, a transaxle assembly similarly serving to support the pinion-shaft may be constituted the same way.","A concept of the general crowning is described by way of example of the inner ring.  depicts a contour of an axial section of the inner ring  having a crowning provided on the inner raceway , the crowning shown in an exaggerated form. The inner raceway  in rolling contact with the rolling contact surface  (, ) of the tapered roller  (, ) is formed with a crowning slightly projected radially outwardly. The crowning is a composite crowning having a substantial trapezoidal shape, an upper side of which is defined by an arc.","A method of calculating a quantity of the crowning on the inner ring  (hereinafter, also referred to as the inner-ring crowning amount) is described as below. In , SK denotes the width of the inner raceway  with respect to an axial direction of the inner ring ; \u03b2 denotes the taper angle of the inner raceway ; and L, L denote the dimensions of chamfers formed at the opposite ends of the inner raceway . The length LRI of the raceway is calculated based on the following equation (1):\n\n\/cos \u03b2\u2212(12)\u2003\u2003(1)\n","A length LRI\u2032 defined by LRI\u2032=0.6LRI is taken in a manner to extend in opposite directions from a midpoint of the raceway length LRI as shown in the figure, whereas points located on the inner raceway  in correspondence to the opposite ends of the length LRI\u2032 are defined as points A\u2032 and B\u2032. In this case, the points A\u2032, B\u2032 are located inwardly of end points \u201cAe\u201d, \u201cBe\u201d of the arc.

The investigation results are described as below.","The following method was used for taking measurements of the rotational toque of the tapered roller bearing. A bearing testing machine, for example, was used, whereas a tapered roller bearing as an exemplary product of the invention was mounted in the testing machine. Subsequently, either one of the inner ring and the outer ring was rotated while measurement was taken on a running torque acting on the other one of the inner and outer rings. The test conditions are as follows. The tapered roller bearing (equivalent to JIS30306 bearing product) constituted as taught by the above embodiment was used, whereas a gear oil for differential gear assembly was used as the lubricating oil. An axial load of 4 kN was applied to the bearing as a pseudo preload. The bearing was rotated at two rotational speeds of 300[r\/min] and 2000[r\/min].","Lubrication conditions during the test are as follows. In the case of the rotational speed of 300[r\/min], a suitable amount of lubricating oil at normal temperatures was only applied to the bearing prior to the test. While the test was conducted, the bearing was not subjected to the subsequent lubrication. In the case of the rotational speed of 2000[r\/min], on the other hand, the test was conducted with a lubricating oil at a temperature of 323K (50\u00b0 C.) circulatingly supplied at a rate of 0.5 litter per minute. The reason for adopting the method of changing the lubricating oil supplying method according to the rotational speed of the bearing is that the influence of the oil agitation loss, which results from an excessive supply of the lubricating oil, is minimized by supplying only the minimum required amount of lubricating oil with respect to each of the rotational speeds, thereby extracting the running torque based on rolling friction. The tapered roller bearings subjected to the test were exemplary products of the invention, which individually had the total crowning amounts and the respective crowning rates set to different values. Measurement was taken on the running torque of the respective test products so as to determine the respective relations of the running torque to the total crowning amount and to the respective crowning rates.

In the case of the outer-ring crowning rate of 40% or more, the torque ratios are stably distributed in a range of lower values as compared with the case of the outer-ring crowning rate of less than 40%.

Particularly, the difference between the examples and the comparative examples is obvious in respect of the roller-length\/diameter ratio, the outer-ring crowning parameter and the inner-ring crowning parameter, which are apparently predominant factors of the reduction of running torque. It is understood that the rolling viscous resistance may be reduced by setting the crowning parameters of the above factors to some values in the above numerical ranges. Accordingly, the rolling viscous resistance may be reduced by defining the crowning based on a different viewpoint from the aforementioned approach to specify the total crowning amount, the outer-ring crowning rate and the roller crowning rate. That is, the rolling viscous resistance may be reduced by defining the crowning based on the outer-ring crowning parameter and the inner-ring crowning parameter, whereby the reduction of the running torque may be achieved.","It is noted however that the aforesaid numerical ranges of the above crowning parameters should take into account some plus or minus error margin or the numerical differences from those of the comparative example. For achieving the reduction of the running torque, the outer-ring crowning parameter (RCO\/LRO) should be set to a value in the range of 30 to 150, whereas the inner-ring crowning parameter (RCI\/LRI) should be set to a value in the range of 50 to 260.","As to the roller loading rates listed in Table 3, the numerical range of the examples include the numerical range of the comparative examples. That is, the examples exhibit no significant difference from the comparative examples in this respect. However, it is obvious that the increase of the roller loading ratio generally results in the increase of the running torque. Because of the relation with the load carrying capacity, the roller loading ratio may not be simply reduced. The roller loading ratio is closely related with the roller-length\/diameter ratio. Therefore, what produces the effect to reduce the running torque (attributable to the oil agitation loss and the rolling viscous resistance) is to reduce the roller-length\/diameter ratio while maintaining the roller loading ratio as small as possible.","Specifically, the roller loading ratio (z\u00b7DW\/(\u03c0\u00b7dm)) may preferably be in the range of 0.7 to 0.92, which includes the numerical range of the examples shown in Table 3. The reason for defining the lower limit to be 0.7 is that if the roller loading ratio is less than 0.7, the bearing suffers insufficient load carrying capacity or rigidity. The reason for defining the upper limit to be 0.92 is that if the roller loading ratio exceeds 0.92, the bearing is decreased in the oil discharging effect due to an insufficient pumping action, so that the oil agitation loss and the rolling viscous resistance are not fully reduced.","The roller-length\/roller-diameter ratio (LWR\/DW) may preferably be in the range of 1.1 to 1.7, which includes the numerical range of the examples shown in Table 3. The reason for defining the lower limit to be 1.1 is that if the roller-length\/roller-diameter ratio is less than 1.1, the roller diameter is so great that the rolling viscous resistance is increased. The reason for defining the upper limit to be 1.7 is that if the roller-length\/roller-diameter ratio exceeds 1.7, the roller diameter is so small that the load carrying capacity is decreased.","On the other hand, the roller diameter parameter (2DW\/(D\u2212d)) may preferably be in the range of 0.44 to 0.52, which includes the numerical range of the examples shown in Table 3. The reason for defining the lower limit to be 0.44 is that if the parameter is less than 0.44, a free space within the bearing has such a small volume that the oil flow is slowed. Hence, the bearing fails to achieve a sufficient effect to reduce the oil agitation loss. The reason for defining the upper limit to be 0.52 is that if the parameter exceeds 0.52, the roller diameter is too great relative to the bearing size (diameters of the inner and outer rings) so that the configuration of the whole body of the bearing lacks in balance. This makes it difficult to apply the bearing to common machines.","Examples 1 and 2 satisfying the aforementioned conditions determined based on the scatter graphs ( to ) (the total crowning amount of 50 \u03bcm or more, the outer-ring crowning rate of 40% or more and the roller crowning rate of 20% or less) have obvious differences from Comparative Example 1 in respect of the running torques shown in  and . This also demonstrates the fact that the reduction of the running torque may be achieved by satisfying the above conditions.","The restriction of the oil inflow by means of the labyrinth seal is also thought to contribute to the reduction of the running torque. The outer ring is designed to have a great contact angle \u03b1 of 28.811\u00b0 such as to promote the oil discharge. This is also thought to produce the effect to reduce the running torque. The outer ring may have the contact angle \u03b1 in the range of 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 such as to provide a similar effect."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 19"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
