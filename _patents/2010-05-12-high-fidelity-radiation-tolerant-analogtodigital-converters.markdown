title: High fidelity, radiation tolerant analog-to-digital converters
abstract: Techniques for an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using pipeline architecture includes a linearization technique for a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) over 80 deciBels. In some embodiments, sampling rates exceed a megahertz. According to a second approach, a switched-capacitor circuit is configured for correct operation in a high radiation environment. In one embodiment, the combination yields high fidelity ADC (>88 deciBel SFDR) while sampling at 5 megahertz sampling rates and consuming <60 milliWatts. Furthermore, even though it is manufactured in a commercial 0.25-μm CMOS technology (1 μm=12meters), it maintains this performance in harsh radiation environments. Specifically, the stated performance is sustained through a highest tested 2 megarad(Si) total dose, and the ADC displays no latchup up to a highest tested linear energy transfer of 63 million electron Volts square centimeters per milligram at elevated temperature (131 degrees C.) and supply (2.7 Volts, versus 2.5 Volts nominal).

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Plasma waves guide the space weather of the upper atmosphere, including the radiation belts. With the increasing number of assets orbiting the Earth in these regions, interest in plasma wave dynamics has grown. For example, applications such as radiation belt remediation (wherein damaging enhanced radiation levels are reduced by controlled precipitation of energetic particle populations) have spurred recent research. Satellite missions to measure these phenomena in situ are an integral part of these efforts.","Plasma wave signals span a broad range of powers (over 120 deciBels, dB, where a deciBel expresses a range as ten times the difference between the logarithms of the largest and smallest values) over a broad bandwidth (from 0.1 Hz to 1 megahertz, MHz, where Hertz, Hz, is a cycle per second and 1 MHz=10Hz). Furthermore, they evolve dynamically in time (often on millisecond, ms, time scales, where 1 ms=10seconds). To capture as much of this signal in situ as possible, instruments are needed that cover broad ranges of sampling rates, durations and dynamic range under conditions of high radiation.","Therefore, there is a need for a radiation-hardened analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that captures an input bandwidth of 100 Hz to 1 MHz by sampling at 5 megasamples per second (MS\/s, 1 MS=10samples) and maintaining a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of at least 90 dB (assuming a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) bin width of 100 Hz).","According to a first set of embodiments, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using a pipeline architecture includes a linearization technique for a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) over 80 dB. In some embodiments of the first set, sampling rates exceed a megahertz. In some embodiments of the first set, a stage of the pipeline architecture includes a sufficient number of extra sub-ADC transition levels so that discontinuity heights between adjacent segments in a transfer function is strictly less than an input range of a backend ADC comprising all following stages. In some embodiments of the first set, a stage of the pipeline architecture includes a calibration module configured to produce both a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) code difference and an autozero difference between successive phases in a sampling interval. In some of these embodiments, the stage of the pipeline architecture includes a digital logic module configured to populate a calibration lookup table based on the DAC code difference and the autozero difference.","According to a second set of embodiments, a switched-capacitor circuit is configured for correct operation in a high radiation environment. According to some embodiments of the second set, the switched-capacitor circuit includes enclosed terminal layout for n-type metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) components in switches. According to some embodiments of the second set, the switched-capacitor circuit is configured with self-resetting circuitry. In some embodiments of the second set, offset cancellation is incorporated in the self-resetting configuration.

The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A method and apparatus are disclosed for a radiation tolerant, high fidelity analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","Although several embodiments of the invention are discussed with respect to a small footprint, low-power, radiation tolerant, high fidelity, megahertz sampling ADC fabricated using low cost, easily accessible commercial CMOS manufacturing processes, embodiments of the invention are not limited to this context. For example, it is explicitly anticipated that in some embodiments the self-calibration technique of this disclosure is extended to a variety of residue amplifier architectures. Furthermore, it is also explicitly anticipated that the radiation-hardness by design techniques of this disclosure are applied, alone or in some combination, to general switched-capacitor circuits, which are used in a variety of applications (e.g., from filters to ADCs). Furthermore both techniques are applicable to circuits designed in other manufacturing processes.","Furthermore, although several embodiments are described with respect to application on satellites for the measurement of plasma waves, applications are not limited to this context. For example, in other embodiments, the techniques described herein are used for other satellite systems, wherever signal digitization is needed (from sensors on scientific instrumentation to digitization on communication links to monitoring for bus housekeeping); in nuclear power plants (e.g., for monitoring systems); in particle accelerators; in nuclear medicine; in systems that must function at high altitudes; and in digital radio and other wideband, high fidelity communication systems (such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, OFDM, systems) where the low power afforded makes it especially attractive in mobile applications.","Several acronyms used herein have the meanings indicated in the following table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A\/D","analog-to-digital converter"]},{"entry":["ADC","analog-to-digital converter"]},{"entry":["CMOS","complementary metal-oxide semiconductor circuits"]},{"entry":[{},"combining p-channel and n-channel transistors to"]},{"entry":[{},"implement logic gates and other digital components"]},{"entry":["DAC","digital-to-analog converter"]},{"entry":["FFT","fast Fourier transform"]},{"entry":["FPGA","field-programmable gate array"]},{"entry":["JPL","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)"]},{"entry":[{},"Jet Propulsion Laboratory"]},{"entry":["LET","linear energy transfer"]},{"entry":["MOSFET","metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor"]},{"entry":["NMOS","abbreviation for NMOSFET, n-channel metal-oxide"]},{"entry":[{},"semiconductor field-effect transistor"]},{"entry":["OFDM","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing"]},{"entry":["PMOS","abbreviation for PMOSFET, p-channel metal-oxide"]},{"entry":[{},"semiconductor field-effect transistor"]},{"entry":["SFDR","spurious-free dynamic range"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Digital systems include a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information between other internal and external components of the system. Information (also called data) is represented as a physical expression of a measurable phenomenon, typically electric voltages, but including, in other embodiments, such phenomena as magnetic, electromagnetic, pressure, chemical, biological, molecular, atomic, sub-atomic and quantum interactions. For example, north and south magnetic fields, or a zero and non-zero electric voltage, represent two states (0, 1) of a binary digit (bit). Other phenomena can represent digits of a higher base. In some embodiments, information called analog data is represented by a near continuum of measurable values within a particular range. A bus includes one or more parallel conductors of information so that information is transferred quickly among devices coupled to the bus. One or more processors for processing information and memory for storing information are coupled with the bus.","The memory, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, stores information including processor instructions. Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system. RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory is also used by the processor to store temporary values during execution of processor instructions. A read only memory (ROM) or other static storage device is coupled to the bus for storing static information, including instructions, that is not changed by the digital system. Some memory is composed of volatile storage that loses the information stored thereon when power is lost. Some memory is composed of non-volatile (persistent) storage device, such as a magnetic disk, optical disk or flash card, for storing information, including instructions, that persists even when the digital system is turned off or otherwise loses power.","Logic encoded in one or more tangible media includes one or both of processor instructions on a computer-readable storage media and special purpose hardware.","Improvements in various embodiments are grouped into two categories described in more detail below, self-calibration technique for achieving the high linearity implied by the desired SFDR, and the application of radiation-hardness-by-design techniques for achieving the radiation tolerance.","The ADC uses a pipeline architecture. Circuit limitations and manufacturing variations, though, typically limit these architectures to 8-bit to 10-bit resolution. This in turn limits linearity: SFDR is typically just 70 to 80 dB. The novel self-calibration technique, then, presents an economical way to overcome these limitations while incurring minimal increase in power consumption, circuit area, and circuit complexity. Specifically, the self-calibration technique configures and measures the discontinuity heights between adjacent segments of the stage transfer function in novel ways.","A pipeline converter accomplishes quantization through a series of pipeline stages.  is a diagram illustrating a stage  of a pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) , according to one embodiment. It encompasses an analog stage  and accompanying digital reconstruction . The analog stage quantizes its analog input Vin  through a coarse sub-ADC, generating the digital output B. Through a subsequent residue amplifier  comprising a sub-DAC , subtraction element , and gain element (amplifier) , the analog stage then generates a gained version of the quantization error of that coarse quantization\u2014dubbed the analog output residue Vout \u2014which is passed on to any subsequent stages (here represented as a backend ADC ) for further quantization. The DAC outputs a nominal voltage for each digital ouput B value. To construct a digital estimate of Vin, then, the operation of the analog stage is simply reversed in the digital reconstruction : a lookup table  supplies a sub-DAC voltage  (digitally gained by G\u2032) corresponding to digital output B, and the backend ADC  provides V\u2032out , the quantized version of Vout , which are combined in adder element  as shown to produce G\u2032V\u2032in , a quantized version of the analog input Vin . Notably, it is inconsequential here that V\u2032in is gained by digital gain G\u2032 because this linear gain can be easily adjusted and does not harm conversion accuracy.","Techniques that use DAC differences (residue amplifier , for instance) to calibrate residue amplifiers  that are biphasic are not new. However, direct applications of the principle to standard pipeline stages result in DAC difference outputs from residue amplifier  that easily exceed a linear range of the next stage (e.g., backend ADC ). The accompanying increase in estimation error renders the technique useless from a practical perspective for multiple stage ADCs.","To overcome this deficiency, one previous technique opted to decrease the stage gain G supplied by amplifier , diminishing all discontinuity heights in the analog signal (e.g., output from sub-DAC ). While useful for the two-step converter it was applied to, this technique is not practical for pipeline converters, since when applied to multiple stages it severely decreases converter resolution. The combined gain of all the stages, combined with the resolution of the final sub-ADC, determines the overall resolution of the entire pipeline converter. Hence the desired resolution sets the product of the gains of all the stages. For any one stage, the gain G is typically selected by a broad-ranging optimization that takes into account power, speed, accuracy, noise, and the capabilities of the manufacturing process. Typically, the result is a stage gain of 2, for some integer n, and a transfer function wherein the discontinuities are of height VREF. Such stages are considered efficient in that they provide sub-ADC error tolerance while retaining simple digital reconstruction implementations. Changing the gain G changes the overall pipeline resolution.","Alternate solutions include capacitor-splitting and capacitor-based offsetting. In the former, sample capacitors are divided into smaller capacitances and the final DAC difference estimate constructed from the sums of such differences over the smaller capacitors. In the latter, an offset sample capacitor decreases the residue amplifier output during the DAC difference estimate. The offset is then lumped into the autozero measurement. However, in both these techniques, the actual DAC codes of sub-DAC are no longer applied during calibration, and thus these techniques are vulnerable to differences in loading and clocking effects between nominal and calibration operation.","In a new approach applied in some embodiments, configuration of a stage is designed with a modified transfer function that has a sufficient number of extra sub-ADC transition levels and corresponding sub-DAC codes that the discontinuity height between adjacent segments in the transfer function is strictly less than the input range of the backend ADC . For example, a traditional 2.8-bit stage transfer function can be modified by adding 2 extra segments. As a result, the discontinuity heights of the new stage are reduced from VREF to just 0.75 VREF where VREF is a reference voltage.  and  are diagrams  and , respectively, that illustrate voltage outputs by segments of a transfer function for one stage of a pipelined ADC, according to two embodiments. The horizontal axis  is Vin; and the vertical axis  is Vout. Both a trace of the analog output Vout and bins of digital output B are shown. The analog voltage discontinuity from the end of one digital bin to the beginning of the next is shown.  shows the transfer function  of the original 2.8-bit stage, including a residue amplifier gain of 4, 6 sub-ADC transition levels at Vin values of [\u2212\u215d, \u2212\u215c, \u2212\u215b, \u215b, \u215c, \u215d]\u00b7VREF, and 7 sub-DAC output levels (nominal voltages) at Vin values of [\u2212\u00be, \u2212 2\/4, \u2212\u00bc, 0, \u00bc, 2\/4, \u00be] \u00b7VREF, resulting in discontinuities each dropping from +VREF\/2 to \u2212VREF\/2, for a discontinuity height of VREF.  shows the transfer function  of modified sub-ADC  of the resulting 3.1-bit stage, including the same residue amplifier gain, but 8 sub-ADC transition levels at Vin values of [\u2212 21\/32, \u2212 15\/32, \u2212 9\/32, \u2212 3\/32, 3\/32. 9\/32, 15\/32, 21\/32]\u00b7VREF, and 9 sub-DAC output levels (nominal voltages) at Vin values of [\u2212 24\/32, \u2212 18\/32, \u2212 12\/32, \u2212 6\/32, 0\/32, 6\/32, 12\/32, 18\/32, 24\/32]\u00b7VREF, resulting in discontinuities each dropping from +(VREF)*\u215c to \u2212(VREF)*\u215c, for a discontinuity height of VREF*\u00be (0.75 VREF). Function  is generated from a device that has transfer function  by adding two extra segments by adding two extra transition levels in stage sub-ADC  and two extra output levels (nominal voltages) in stage sub-DAC ","Adding stage segments to decrease the nominal sub-DAC difference output is not previously known. This allows the stage  to maintain its gain G and also allows the actual DAC codes in sub-DAC to be used during calibration. Any number of segments can be added in other embodiments. In the illustrated embodiment of , 2 segments are added to reduce the discontinuity height to three-quarters nominal. Adding segments to reduce discontinuity height offers the advantage of maintaining the stage gain and, thus, maintaining the overall ADC resolution without requiring additional stages and still enabling calibration to improve the fidelity of the ADC.","Segments are added by adding transition levels to, and adjusting the existing levels of, the sub-ADC, e.g., by adding comparators; and by adding output levels to, and adjusting the existing output levels of, the sub-DAC so that they are at the zero-crossings of the new transfer function, such as that shown in . At the circuit-level, it depends on the particular circuits used to implement the sub-ADC and sub-DAC. For example, for the residue amplifier of , described below, which implements the sub-DAC, adding another segment would involve increasing R by 1 and then adjusting the ratios of the Cr+ and Cr\u2212 capacitors, r=1, . . . , R, with the CF+ and CF\u2212 capacitors. For the vast majority of sub-ADC and sub-DAC embodiments, the needed addition and adjustment is readily discerned by one of ordinary skill.","In a second, complementary approach used in some embodiments, the reconfigured stage  is augmented with additional components to generate, detect and use additional calibration signals. The additional components include a calibration signal module  interfacing with the residue amplifier  by means of additional circuitry described below, and a calibration logic module  to control the calibration signal module  and correct the lookup table  of the standard digital reconstruction based on the new calibration signals using a method described in more detail below.","It is well known that the quantization accuracy of a pipeline converter is limited by the matching between corresponding parameters in the analog stage and digital reconstruction, and in particular by mismatches between the sub-DAC and gain blocks of the analog stage  and the lookup table  of the digital reconstruction circuit . These can arise due to circuit limitations and manufacturing variations. This typically limits pipeline converters to 8-bit to 10-bit resolution, which in turns limits linearity: SFDR is typically just 70 dB to 80 dB.","In the illustrated embodiment, a self-calibration technique is employed that provides an economical way to overcome the known limitations while incurring minimal increase in power consumption, circuit area, and circuit complexity. Specifically, the technique measures the discontinuity heights between adjacent segments of the stage transfer function. These discontinuity heights encompass the entire meaningful mismatch between a) the sub-DAC and gain blocks of the analog stage , and b) the lookup table  of the digital reconstruction circuit . These measurements are used to update the digital reconstruction lookup table . By introducing the novel stage transfer function modification of adding extra segments as previously detailed, the self-calibration technique can now directly measure the discontinuity heights by direct differencing of DAC codes, instead of relying on the use of additional input voltages or indirect measurements requiring additional digital processing (as in capacitor-splitting and capacitor-based offsetting).","The actual calibration of the stage  revolves around the stage residue amplifier , which is typically a biphasic amplifier that implements the sub-DAC , subtraction , and gain blocks of the analog stage . A modified amplifier is shown in  and .  is a diagram illustrating a modified analog residue amplifier  used as residue amplifier  of , according to one embodiment; and  is a timing diagram  illustrating timing of phases of operation of the analog reside amplifier  of . An example of a fully-differential circuit implementation  is shown in  with modifications for enhanced calibration using a reference signal VREF. Modified analog residue amplifier  includes operational amplifier , switches ,  and , and capacitors , ,  and , as well as leads carrying one or more voltage differences. Vin=Vin+\u2212Vin\u2212; Vout=Vout+\u2212Vout\u2212; and VREF=VREF+\u2212VREF\u2212. Conceptually, VREF is used to set the decision levels of the sub-ADC and the output levels of the sub-DAC: all these levels are designed to be fractions of VREF. The ratios of the various capacitors are determined by the desired sub-DAC output levels. The specific value of a capacitor (once one is chosen, all the rest are determined by said ratios) is chosen based upon a broad system-level optimization. What is shown in  is one particular embodiment of a residue amplifier, including sub-DAC , subtractor and gain block . Different embodiments are possible.","In , the horizontal axis  is time and four vertically offset vertical axes , , and indicate the size of control signals (such as voltages that close switches). The signal that closes switches  (\u03c6) near the amplifier  is plotted on vertical axis as trace . The signal that closes switches  (\u03c6) is plotted on vertical axis as trace . The signal that closes switches  (\u03c6) is plotted on vertical axis as trace . The signal that operates sub-ADC  (in ) is called \u03c6comp and is plotted on vertical axis as trace  for timing reference.","During normal operation, the residue amplifier  processes Vin during the sample phase (time during which \u03c6 signal  and \u03c6signal  are positive). During the amplify phase (time during which \u03c6 signal  is positive), a certain set of the capacitors Cr+ , r=1, . . . , R are switched to VREF+, the remainder are switched VREF\u2212 (the corresponding Cr\u2212  are switched to VREF\u2212 and VREF+, respectively) as shown in . The particular set of Cr+ switched to VREF+ is determined by the sub-ADC decision. In this way, Hence, given a particular sub-ADC result, the residue amplifier  produces a particular sub-DAC output voltage by switching a particular set of Cr+ capacitors to VREF+. The particular set of Cr+ capacitors thus switched is said to implement a particular DAC code, where the DAC code is the sub-DAC input. In addition, the amplifier  is configured to provide an overall gain during the amplify phase.","Under calibration by the calibration logic module , the stage residue amplifier  is reconfigured to reroute signals internal to the stage . In particular, two types of calibration configurations are used: a DAC difference configuration and an autozero configuration. In a configuration called \u201cDAC difference\u201d the calibration signal module  causes the residue amplifier  to implement DAC code m+1, corresponding to the m+1 segment, during the sample phase (\u03c6) and a DAC code m corresponding to the m segment, during the amplify phase (\u03c6). The residue amplifier output during the amplify phase is thus the height of the discontinuity between these two transfer function segments. In a configuration called \u201cautozero\u201d, the calibration signal module  causes the residue amplifier  to implement the same DAC code, say DAC code 0, during both phases. In each calibration configuration, the modified residue amplifier  with calibration signal module  is kept in the configuration for several cycles. Its output is then measured by the backend ADC and averaged to arrive at the calibration logic module  where the DAC difference and autozero estimates are derived.","Conceptually, during calibration, calibration signal module  interrupts the signals to the subtractor  band reroutes various output levels of the sub-DAC to be input to the subtractor as per the desired DAC difference or autozero configuration. In residue amplifier  implementing these configurations simply involves retiming the switches  and : during calibration, switches  are never closed\/connected and switches  are closed\/connected so that they correspond to one DAC code during the sample phase, and another (under the DAC difference configuration) or the same (under the autozero configuration) DAC code during the amplify phase. The control of the switches is handled by calibration signal module , as directed by the calibration controller  embedded in calibration logic module .","The stage  digital reconstruction circuit  is implemented with a lookup table . The procedure is implemented in calibration logic module  configured to execute five steps. In step , the first entry of the stage lookup table is set to an initial offset (typically 0). In step , while the autozero configuration is adopted, the autozero output from the backend ADC is derived, typically by averaging the output of the backend ADC over several cycles, and stored in a cache  within the calibration logic module . In step , while the DAC difference configuration using the first two DAC codes (i.e. DAC code 1 during the sample phase, 0 during the amplify phase) is adopted, a DAC difference output is received from the backend ADC, and an estimate is derived in the calibration logic module , typically by averaging the output of the backend ADC over several cycles, and the stored autozero estimate in cache  is subtracted from this DAC difference estimate. The first entry of the stage lookup table is added to this estimate and the sum result is stored as the second entry of the stage lookup table . In step , while the DAC difference configuration for the next two DAC codes are adopted, the appropriate DAC difference output is received from the backend ADC, and an estimate is derived in the calibration logic module , typically by averaging the output of the backend ADC over several cycles, and the stored autozero estimate is subtracted from this DAC difference estimate. The result of the previous (i.e. last-entered) lookup table entry is added to this estimate and the sum is stored as the next entry of the stage lookup table . In step , step  is repeated until estimates are made for all adjacent pairs of DAC codes. The new values in the lookup table  are used to calibrate the digital signals B received during the next round of sampling.","Calibration is performed at startup. So long as the stage  analog circuit blocks  remain the same, calibration need not be performed again. If analog circuit blocks  component values change, though, and in particular if the analog component values associated with the stage residue amplifier  change, then calibration can be repeated. For example, such changes may occur with large temperature changes or due to accumulated radiation dose effect. In various embodiments, any schedule or condition may be used to initiate the calibration process. For example, in some embodiments, the calibration process is initiated every few hours or upon detection of a certain radiation dose or temperature change. In the satellite applications, the ADC is often kept off when not in use to conserve power, and recalibration is performed every time the ADC is turned on.","The overhead incurred by the technique is simply some additional digital logic  in the stage switches (to implement the calibration configurations) on the analog side (in particular, it requires no additional analog hardware, as it simply repurposes already existent switches). The calibration logic module  includes another control module  that directs and coordinates the calibration signal module  and the calibration logic module . When calibration is invoked, the control module  dictates which lookup table  entry is being worked on, and adjusts the calibration signal module  appropriately. As this controller  is a digital system, in practice it is incorporated into the calibration logic module .","Modification to the digital reconstruction block , involves only some control logic to direct calibration, and signal processing for producing the autozero estimate and DAC difference estimates from the output  of the backend ADC . The signal processing can be very simple: if averaging is used, the technique adds a simple averager (typically over 2samples, N a positive integer, to simplify implementation) and some adders and registers. As such, the technique allows pipeline converters to overcome circuit limitations and manufacturing variations without resorting to power-hungry methods such as increasing device and capacitor sizing.","Using the lookup table  entries measured and filled in this way offers the advantage of more accurate calibration than using a fixed lookup table.","Radiation-hardness by design encompasses a combination of design choices in implementing the analog circuits  of the pipeline, including one or more of: A. Enclosed terminal layout; B. Self-resetting circuitry; C. Latchup prevention; D. Stable generation of master bias current; and E. Analog overdesign.","A. Enclosed Terminal Layout","The enclosed terminal layout has been previously noted for its proficiency in eliminating radiation-induced leakage current. As such leakage would compromise performance of switched-capacitor circuitry, enclosed terminal layout is used for the n-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) components in the switches of such circuits, including the residue amplifier  with switches , , , and comparators.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","450","410","412","414","416","450","412","412","412"]},"Circuit diagram symbols , , respectively, for both devices are shown at bottom. The enclosed terminal is indicated by a box  affixed to the appropriate terminal of the NMOS device. In symbol , the box  is affixed to source terminal S. These enclosed terminal components are then combined with a p-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) components to form complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) switches \u03c6 as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3A"],"b":["510","560","560","512","562","560","300","562","562","300","301","302","320"]},"This is believed to be the first use of the enclosed terminal layout  in a switched-capacitor circuit design, like the residue amplifier . Traditionally, annular component layouts have been used. The enclosed terminal layout, though, has advantages in that it displays less asymmetry than the annular layout. Furthermore, as it cleaves closer to the standard component layout, a model for the enclosed terminal component is easier to derive from the standard component model provided by a manufacturer. This promotes practical use of the device in analog circuits.","B. Self-Resetting Circuitry","To prevent charge accumulation on nodes due to radiation strikes, every node of the circuit is designed to be driven by a strong low-impedance source at least once a cycle. A circuit node is any point where two or more circuit elements meet. This is efficiently done by the use of self-resetting switched-capacitor circuitry, wherein the strong currents of the amplifiers themselves are used for this purpose. In particular, the input nodes of the amplifier  are driven by a strong low-impedance source at least once a cycle by shorting the input and output terminals of the amplifier  by closing switches . In addition, offset cancellation is incorporated into the self-resetting configurations to cancel 1\/f noise. Radiation-induced increases in 1\/f noise would otherwise compromise ADC low-frequency performance at high doses.","C. Latchup Prevention","Latchup refers to inadvertent creation of a low-impedance path between the power supply rails of a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) circuit, triggering a parasitic structure which disrupts proper functioning of the part and possibly even leading to its destruction due to overcurrent. High radiation can cause latchup.","To prevent latchup, extensive guard rings are placed near active components.  is a diagram  illustrating use of guard rings ,  on a CMOS component, according to an embodiment. In  guard rings, identified as  N-diffusions around the PMOS component MP  and  P-diffusions around the NMOS component MN , are illustrated for an inverter, a basic circuit building block. The inverter includes a Vin contact  and a Vout contact . Wherever possible, the guard ring diffusions are metalized, such as metalized guard ring diffusions  to further reduce their parasitic electrical resistance. However, in some embodiments, the metallization is omitted to allow wiring while maintaining the ring. This configuration is seen in the unmetallized diffusions  between the NMOS and PMOS devices. As proposed, the use of guard rings is a general layout technique used throughout the design, and can be applied to any circuit or component.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 6B","b":["680","686","683","684","681","682"]},"D. Stable Generation of Master Bias Current","Many devices experience power consumption increases with radiation. To counter this, the master analog current of the ADC is produced as depicted in .  is a diagram  illustrating a source of a master bias current , according to an embodiment. In , an off-chip resistor  is depicted which proved more convenient in lab testing. The master current  is derived from a stack of PMOS diodes (e.g., PMOS diodes , , . . . ) in series with a current source (e.g., sources , , . . . ). As the threshold voltage of PMOS devices only increases in absolute value with radiation (versus an NMOS device, whose threshold voltage may increase or decrease), the master current  will only decrease with radiation as the PMOS diodes require ever higher threshold voltages to pass the current. This helps limit analog power consumption with increasing radiation dose.","E. Analog Overdesign","Analog circuits are overdesigned in select regards, for example, the bandwidth and gain of the operational amplifiers are extended to compensate for radiation-induced transconductance degradation. As such overdesign does tend to increase power consumption, it is used selectively throughout the design.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["800","800","804","802"]},"The prototype ADC  includes seven pipelined stages  through , numbered 0 through 6, respectively.

If finer correction is needed, more stages can be calibrated, if coarser correction is needed, fewer stages can be calibrated. The amount of correction depends on the desired SFDR and the inherent SFDR achieved by the pipeline in an uncalibrated state. Any method may be used to determine the number of calibrated stages. In an example embodiment, the number of calibrated stages was determined using extensive Monte Carlo simulations.","Well known 2.8 bit analog stages (composed of 7 segments numbered 0 through 6) as depicted in  are used for stages  and  in the uncalibrated stages .
