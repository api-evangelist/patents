{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Implementation of Exemplary Embodiments"],"p":["Ranking functions that rank documents according to their relevance to a given search query are known. In many known systems, query classifiers are used to boost the search results of the ranking function. Known query classifiers utilize machine learning techniques such as Maximum Entropy, Na\u00efve Bayes, Conditional Random Fields, and Support Vector Machines, to model user performance. Typically, the process used for building and deploying models is to gather a lot of data, perform off-line data processing over the entire range of data, build the models, and then deploy the models. These known processes can be computationally expensive. Further, in these processes, there is typically a delay from the time data is gathered to when the data is actually utilized in the deployed models.","Efforts continue in the art to develop ranking functions and ranking function components that provide better search results for a given search query compared to search results generated by search engines using known ranking functions and ranking function components.","Described herein are, among other things, various technologies for ranking documents on a network using an incrementally-updatable, query classifier. The incrementally-updatable, query classifier does not require computationally expensive, off-line data processing, but simply requires periodic updating of a minimum number of query classifier variables. The incrementally-updatable, query classifier utilizes real-time user search query and response data, and may also comprise a time-decay component that weighs more recent user events greater than past user events. The incrementally-updatable, query classifier, alone or in combination with other ranking function components, may be used by a search engine to rank multiple documents in order (typically, in descending order) based on document relevance relative to query search terms.","This Summary is provided to generally introduce the reader to one or more select concepts describe below in the \u201cDetailed Description\u201d section in a simplified form. This Summary is not intended to identify key and\/or required features of the claimed subject matter.","To promote an understanding of the principles of the methods and processes disclosed herein, descriptions of specific embodiments follow and specific language is used to describe the specific embodiments. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the disclosed methods and processes is intended by the use of, specific language. Alterations, further modifications, and such further applications of the principles of the disclosed methods and processes discussed are contemplated as would normally occur to one ordinarily skilled in the art to which the disclosed methods and processes pertains.","Methods of ranking documents on a network using an incrementally-updatable query classifier are disclosed. The relevance of each document, to a given search query, is calculated using an incrementally-updatable query classifier that utilizes real-time user data for each inputted query\/chosen result data combination. The document relevance for each document as determined by the query classifier alone, or in combination with other ranking function components, may be used to rank documents within a given network space (e.g., a corporate intranet space or the Internet). An exemplary search process in which the disclosed methods may be used is shown as exemplary process  in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","80","200","200","10","300","300","10","400","400","10","500"]},"As discussed in more detail below, the methods of ranking documents comprises utilizing real-time \u201cuser response data\u201d or \u201cdocument usage data\u201d related to actual usage (e.g., viewing) of one or more documents within a network space by one or more users. The document usage data is generated and stored by application code on a web server, which is separate from a given search engine. For example, document usage data may be maintained by a web site so that each time a user requests a URL, the server updates a usage counter or count value. The usage counter may maintain document-related data obtained for a given time interval, such as last week, last month, last year, or the lifetime of a given document or set of documents. Application code may be used to obtain the usage data from the web site via (i) a special application programming interface (API), (ii) a web service request, or (iii) by requesting an administration web page that returns usage data for every URL on the web site.","The document relevance may be used to rank documents within a network space, and provide the ranked search results to a user. For example, a method of ranking documents on a network may comprise the steps of determining a document relevance for each document on the network using the incrementally-updatable query classifier; and ranking the documents in a desired order (typically, in descending order) based on the document relevance of each document relative to a user inputted search query.","Application programs using the methods disclosed herein may be loaded and executed on a variety of computer systems comprising a variety of hardware components.
