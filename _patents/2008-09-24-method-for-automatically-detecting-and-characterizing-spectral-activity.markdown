No. 61\/132,341, filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on May 30, 2008.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","The objective of the present invention is to determine the presence of signals in the frequency spectrum and characterize them. These signals are typically represented in terms of parameters such as: energy, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), bandwidth and center frequency.","The prior art has provided spectral estimation techniques where the receiver collects a wide band signal that contains frequency allocated signals in different formats. The wideband signal may contain tones and analog and digital modulation types. Spectral survey estimation methods do a spectral search to identify signals of interests. Thus far, prior art method for the detection of signals requires the use of frequency or time domain techniques.","Referring to , a prior art spectral survey estimator is depicted. The analysis filter bank  decomposes the input signal in narrow band channels to produce a spectral estimate. This step can also be accomplished by using DFT based spectral methods. The output of the channels are sent to a spectral survey estimator  such as the one presented in [3]. The process estimates the number of signals that are present and determines the corresponding frequency and bandwidth estimates. The estimates are used to recover the individual signals.  depicts the flow of the entire process corresponding to the hardware implementation of .","Prior art methods [1, 2] use time domain techniques that require the use of frequency locking devices. These methods are more suitable for a hardware implementation because phase locking techniques are inefficient when applied for digitized samples [17].","Developments in speech processing, for example, [7] have provided some methodology for classifying speech signal spectra. Basu and other authors acknowledge that a special case of the expectation maximization (EM) method known as Gaussian Mixture Models does not always provide a suitable statistical model. In the case of speech processing, it is important to model heavy tailed distributions. Basu also uses several models of non-Gaussian distributions. This particular distribution has a flatter response and provides the convenience of reducing the complexity of the expectation when the log-likelihood is applied. Basu's method is applied on cepstral vectors which are used for extracting formant and vocal track information. There is no implicit or explicit intention to detect and demultiplex signals.","Referring to , prior art Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are a special case of the maximization of expectation process. It defines the model in terms of Gaussian densities. The parameters of the model include: the probability of each mixture element, a vector of the mean and a covariance matrix. While the use of a Gaussian distribution simplifies the maximization of the log-likelihood and produces a matrix equation that is easy to implement, it does not produce acceptable results.","Failings of the Gaussian Mixture Approach for Signal Detection","A frequency spectrum can be treated in the same manner as a mixture of probability density functions. Because the profile of communications signals in the spectrum resembles bell-shape densities (see ), a reasonable first choice would be to model signals using Gaussian distributions. In a one-dimensional space, the mixture probability \u03b1 becomes the amplitude-bandwidth product; the mean \u03bc becomes the center frequency f; and the standard deviation \u03c3, the bandwidth b, the data vector {right arrow over (y)}\u2032 becomes a scalar y\u2032. The data contains the information about the frequencies in the spectrum.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"\u2192"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"1"}},{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"2"}},{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"3"}}]}}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mi":"\u03b1"},{"mi":"\u03bc"},{"mi":"\u03c3"}]}}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mi":"\u03b1"},{"mi":"f"},{"mi":"b"}]}}}],"mo":"\u2192"}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"p","mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"msup":[{"mi":["y","\u2032"]},{"mi":["z","\u2032"]}],"mo":"|"},"mo":";","mover":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"\u2192"}}},{"mi":"P","mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["z","\u2032"]},"mo":";","mover":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"\u2192"}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"msqrt":{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03c0"}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"3"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"exp","mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["y","\u2032"]},"mo":"-","msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"2"}}},"mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":["3","2"]}}}}},"mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"1"}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}]}]}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sub":["j","j

For a Gaussian model, there is no sharp transition between the pass band and the stop band. These wide transitions interfere with ones of the adjacent signals. The process has convergence problems due to the interference between Gaussian mixture elements and the model is not suitable for characterizing communication signals.

Within the context of this invention the terms \u201cmixture elements\u201d, \u201cmean\u201d, \u201cstandard deviation\u201d and \u201chistogram\u201d are the statistical probability density equivalents of \u201csub band\u201d, \u201ccenter frequency\u201d, \u201cbandwidth\u201d and \u201cspectrum\u201d in the frequency domain. Spectral survey should not be confused with channel estimation. The goal of channel estimation is to characterize the channel in terms of parameters like bandwidth, center frequency, delay, distortion and noise [2, 8, 11]. In the case of spectral survey, the attention is focused on the signal profile rather than the channel effects. Channel estimation is used to mitigate the channel effects on the received signal while spectral survey is used for demultiplexing signals in the spectrum.","The present invention, unlike prior art methods including those that employ Gaussian Mixture Models (see ) features additional novel steps that allow processing the frequency spectrum, ensuring convergence to optimal solutions and working independently of the number of signals that may be present in the spectrum. Unlike prior art speech classification techniques, the present invention does not perform signal classification or training for classification. The method used in the present invention is a novel type of curve fitting that matches the spectral signals to a parameterized spectral model.  depicts a frequency spectrum with MPSK, MFSK and tone signals.  depicts the application of the present invention to the frequency spectrum of . The outputs of the process are amplitude, bandwidth and center frequency. When this process is combined with efficient filter banks, other parameters such as SNR and energy can be estimated. If an analytical solution to the maximization problem is not feasible, an alternative numerical method using Newton's algorithm can be developed [15].","The present invention treats the frequency spectrum as a histogram. A broadband spectrum can be seen as a mixture of density distributions. The statistical parameters could be adapted to represent the parameters of a signal.","The present invention employs several novel steps to deal with spectral information. After selecting a statistical model, the maximization of the expectation is found by means of a numerical approximation. The process is initialized and a suboptimal solution is found. Further processing is required to identify the trivial and suboptimal solutions before reconstructing the spectral profile of the signals. With the aid of efficient filter banks, parameter estimation of energy, noise floor and SNR can be derived. One possible embodiment of the present invention is disclosed herein.

the initialization, the process iterates  several times until convergence is reached.

The next step is to calculate the updated parameters that maximize the expectation . At the completion of these two steps, the process applies rules to improve convergence . The rules control the value of the bandwidth of each mixture. One rule prevents the bandwidth of a mixture from taking small values. This feature is needed for detecting tone signals. Without this rule, the bandwidth may approach to zero and cause convergence problems [Eq. 16]. A second rule keeps one of the mixture elements with a wide bandwidth. This mixture is forced to converge to the noise floor of the broad spectrum. The feature is useful for estimating the noise in the receiver and can be used later for the estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio as depicted in .","Recombining Subbands","Rules for recombining channels  can be developed using thresholds on predefined quantities. An upper and lower frequency is defined for each sub-band. Lower cut-off frequency of the mixture i is\n\n()\/2\u2003\u2003Eq. 25\n\nThe higher cut-off frequency of the mixture i is\n\n()\/2\u2003\u2003Eq. 26\n\nAlso, a new feature is defined. The average amplitude level of the mixture i is:\n\n()()\/\u2003\u2003Eq. 27\n\nThe last feature allows prioritizing the search by processing the signals that have the higher amplitude.\n","The rules can be divided in two categories. One set of rules determines whether the sub-band falls inside another sub-band. A second rule will determine if two adjacent sub-bands are candidates for recombination. The rules assist in grouping the sub-bands that belong to a single signal in individual arrays. Once the sub-bands are grouped, they can be sent to a second algorithm that reconstructs the signal.","The reconstruction of the signal profile  is done by reconstructing the signal based on the individual mixture elements (sub-bands) within a group.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0076"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00013","num":"00013"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"mix","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"y"}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"j"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"p","mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["y","z"],"mo":"|"},"mo":"=","mi":"i"},"mo":";","mover":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"\u2192"}}},{"mi":"P","mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["z","i"],"mo":"="},"mo":";","mover":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"\u2192"}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"28"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{}],"sub":["c ","c","(i)","(i)","c"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["f","y","y\u00b7dy","b","y","y\u2212f","\u00b7dx"],"sup":"2"},"Energy, noise and SNR can be estimated once bandwidth and center frequency estimates have been produced by the algorithm.\n\n=\u222b|mix()|\u2003\u2003Eq. 31\n\nThe noise estimate is calculated in a similar manner by processing an area where no signals are found.

The present invention has been tested using MPSK, MFSK and tone signals with different frequency allocations and different noise levels. The signals were sampled at 16 kHz and each signal contains at least 400 cycles. The analysis filter used 256 channels. The signals were processed with a DCT\/DST filter bank to generate in-phase and quadrature channels. The invention was able to identify the bands of interest and reconstruct the individual signals. The use of nearly perfect reconstruction filters allows us to resample and downconvert the signals by adding or shifting channels. The frequency and bandwidth estimates were verified by visual inspection and analysis. The center frequencies and bandwidths were in agreement with the original parameters. The estimated error of the center frequency and bandwidth is inversely proportional to the number of channels in the filter banks.","Referring to  depicts actual results of the present invention sorted by the normalized energy density. The four most significant signals are shown below. These results correspond to the reconstructed signal spectrum in .","While the present invention has been described in reference to specific embodiments, in light of the foregoing, it should be understood that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings is intended to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense and that various modifications and variations of the invention may be constructed without departing from the scope of the invention defined by the following claims.
