The dosage to be administered to a patient can vary depending on several factors, including age, weight, and sex of the patient, and the type and severity of the disease. The ordinarily skilled clinician can determine suitable dosages following evaluation of the patient.","Compounds useful in the subject invention can be formulated according to known methods for preparing pharmaceutically useful compositions. Formulations are described in detail in a number of sources which are well known and readily available to those skilled in the art. For example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science by E. W. Martin describes formulations which can be used in connection with the subject invention. In general, the compositions of the subject invention will be formulated such that an effective amount of the bioactive compound is combined with a suitable carrier in order to facilitate effective administration of the composition.","The compositions used in the present methods can also be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, solid, semi-solid, and liquid dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, powders, liquid solutions or suspension, suppositories, injectable and infusible solutions, and sprays.

To provide for the administration of such dosages for the desired therapeutic treatment, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will advantageously comprise between about 0.1% and 45%, and especially, 1 and 15% by weight of the total of one or more of the compounds based on the weight of the total composition including carrier or diluent.","The compounds and compositions of the subject invention can also be administered utilizing liposome technology, slow release capsules, implantable pumps, and biodegradable containers. These delivery methods can, advantageously, provide a uniform dosage over an extended period of time.","The subject compounds can also be modified by the addition of chemical groups, such as PEG (polyethylene glycol). PEGylated peptides typically generate less of an immunogenic response and exhibit extended half-lives in vivo in comparison to peptides that are not PEGylated when administered in vivo. Methods for PEGylating proteins and peptides are known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337). The subject compounds can also be modified to improve cell membrane permeability. In one embodiment, cell membrane permeability can be improved by attaching a lipophilic moiety, such as a steroid, to the compound. Other groups known in the art can be linked to compounds of the present invention.","The subject invention also concerns a packaged dosage formulation comprising in one or more containers at least one compound of the subject invention formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage. The package can contain discrete quantities of the dosage formulation, such as tablet, capsules, lozenge, and powders. The quantity of compound in a dosage formulation and that can be administered to a patient can vary from about 1 mg to about 2000 mg, more typically about 1 mg to about 500 mg, or about 5 mg to about 250 mg, or about 10 mg to about 100 mg.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":"1"},"The structures of known Rho-kinase inhibitors are shown in .

The known inhibitors showed inhibitory activity at low \u03bcM concentrations but non showed sufficient inhibitory activity at 100 \u03bcM, as shown in .","One aspect invention includes the fast construction of a library of 2-substituted piperazines synthesized from a variety of dipeptides, as shown in . Modifications from a previously reported protocol (see Breitenlechner. et al.

Comm. 2004, 34, 4111-4118, which is incorporated herein by reference, wherein R1=CH3). As it can be seen, the synthesis provides 3-4 moderate to high yielding linear steps from commercially available amino acids or their methyl esters. These findings demonstrate the important interaction between N from pyridine and NH from M156 by comparison with piperazinylmethyl benzene.","Referring again to , the pyridine ring of Y-27632 () occupies the same space as the adenine six-membered ring in other kinase structures. It can also be seen the active site of ROCK and PKA are quite similar. Specifically, the consistent H-bond between backbone NH from M156 and N from pyridine or isoquinoline wing (M156=V123 from PKA).","Following are examples which illustrate procedures for practicing the invention. The disclosed compounds of one embodiment mimic the structures of known inhibitors and are diversified by the variation of hetero aromatic rings and a variety of piperazines. The disclosed designs provide significant benefit over the prior art. For example, piperazines are easily synthesized from dipeptides through the combination of suitable amino acids. Moreover, other bis-functional reagents (such as piperidine carboxylic acid) can be easily incorporated. Also, modifications through the remaining secondary amine afford specificity thereby allowing the discrimination from various kinases (i.e. similar ATP binding sites).","The invention also provides for rapid screening using commercially available bis-functional reagents as key linkers or scaffolds. Such embodiments utilize selective and sequential coupling with heteraromatic and tail groups. Illustrative, but not limiting, commercially available bis-functional reagents include piperazine, homopiperazine and isonipectotae () and chlorosulfonyl isocyanate ().
