title: Generalized inner product method and apparatus for improved detection and discrimination
abstract: Method and apparatus for improving the detection and discrimination of slow moving or stationary range-Doppler spread objects on or in close proximity to the ground (or sea surface). Invention detects, discriminates and separates radar returns from interference including ground clutter discretes via a coherent process for separating target returns from the myriad of received signals. Thus the method and apparatus improves the probability of detecting and declaring the presence or absence of an object at the same time that the probability of false declaration decreases. The method and apparatus may be applied to the processing of any over resolved object, including airborne radar.

No. 61\/211,478, filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Mar. 30, 2009.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","A stationary or slow moving object or objects has a similar spectral nature as the surface clutter from its location. Traditionally, it can only be detected by a moving platform radar (airborne, space-based radar, for example) if their returns sufficiently exceed those from the ground (clutter). This requires that its cross-section exceed that of the competing clutter patch established by the range and cross-range resolutions of the radar. In other words, the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) must be significantly greater than zero dB. To recognize an extended target, this requires the SCNR must be high enough in sufficiently many resolution cells. For point targets, the clutter cell size can be reduced arbitrarily, limited only by the performance limits of the radar. For extended targets the object size limits the reduction of the resolution cell for detection processing without over resolving the target.","Of course, both the object and clutter patch may be resolved using wide bandwidth synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing. This results in an image where some returns from the resolved components of the doubly spread target may exceed those of their respective clutter patch. An \u201cover-resolved\u201d target is defined as one in which the target signal spreads over multiple resolution cells in the range dimension, the Doppler dimension, or n both dimensions. An image is formed and a detection declaration is made by an analyst via a non-coherent, albeit cognitive, process. This imaging process also supports target discrimination. There is no guarantee that the resolution for one section of the extended target is appropriate for other sections and the detection-in-clutter process may not be optimum. For the same reason, the SCNR in each cell may not be optimized for the discrimination process. Even more important, these processes require a man-in-the-loop causing significant delay in the availability of detection declarations while requiring significant communication assets.","Future sensing will be accomplished via unmanned vehicles with limited communications capability. This will require accomplishing the full surveillance mission (detection, track, classification) autonomously.","A technique is proposed to achieve significantly better detection and discrimination for extended targets in clutter. This technique is based upon a generalized inner product (GIP) based approach to data analysis. The GIP was also applied in signal processing to improve the performance of adaptive radars operating in non-homogeneous clutter, by employing multiple templates on limited knowledge of the targets of interest.","The apparatus consists of multiple, iterative GIP analyses, resulting in an improved estimate of the target parameters. It can provide autonomous detection, parameter estimation and discrimination of an extended complex target in colored noise and inhomogeneous clutter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"[1] Barton, D. K., \u201cLand clutter models for radar design and analysis,\u201d Proc. IEEE, vol. 73, no. 3, pp. 198-204, March 1985."}},"The objective of this invention is to provide a method and apparatus for detecting and discriminating among stationary or slowly moving objects, whose echoes are doubly spread over multiple range-Doppler cells, from strong surface clutter via a moving platform radar.","The present invention relates generally to sensor signal processing. It relates to detection and discrimination of targets by active sensors (radar, laser radar, sonar). In particular, it relates to this processing for targets that are \u2018spread,\u2019 that is, to systems that can resolve the targets in the range dimension, the Doppler dimension or in both dimensions. The invention employs a combination of radar hardware, computer hardware, and computer software comprising computer-implementable instructions.","The sensor detection process consists of deciding whether the output of the sensor receiver is due to noise and clutter only, or to a target return plus noise and clutter. For non-spread targets, this process consists of optimized clutter rejection followed by a process that determines whether a signal crosses a predetermined threshold level. For spread targets (resolved in range, Doppler or both) the process is more complex since there are multiple outputs of the sensor receiver to consider in the thresholding processing.","The sensor declaration process consists of determining the type of target that is causing a particular return and of estimating that target's parameters (location and size in various dimensions). This process is accomplished in image analysis either by a human analyst or by computer-based processing that emulates the capability of the analyst. In either case the multiple returns from the spread target are considered separately and then combined non-coherently.","Briefly stated, the present invention discloses an apparatus and method for detection and declaration processing of spread targets in sensor systems of the various types. The invention employs GIP-based processing which coherently combines the multiple returns from the spread target and adaptively rejects interference, including jamming and clutter. Thus the subject apparatus and method improves the probability of detecting the presence (or absence) of a spread target while at the same time it improves the estimation of the parameters of the target. This GIP-based processing can be applied to single-receiver channel systems, multiple spatial channel systems, multiple polarization channel systems or systems with multiple spatial and polarization channels.","The present invention greatly improves the detection process for active sensors viewing spread targets. The returns from a spread target appear in multiple range, Doppler and\/or range-Doppler bins. This GIP-based processing maximizes the signal return by combining these multiple returns coherently while simultaneously using multiple system channels (spatial, polarization), if available, to optimally reject interference. The resulting SCNR is significantly better than that of each resolution cell separately and significantly better than that of these cells combined non-coherently, as currently implemented in modern synthetic aperture radar systems.","The present invention also greatly improves the declaration process for these same sensors viewing these same spread targets. Coherent integration insures that the impact of adding each return from each resolution cell is maximized, thus insuring optimum detection across the various components of the spread target and optimum estimation of the target extent in its various dimensions.","The objective of the present invention and its GIP-based detector and discriminator is to achieve significantly better detection and discrimination for doubly spread targets in the presence of strong surface clutter. Referring to  shows a simplified block diagram for the GIP detector and discriminator of the present invention. An analog radar signal  arrives at the receive channel . A preprocessing unit  receives the analog radar signal , converts it to an intermediate frequency (\u201cIF\u201d), digitally samples them in analog-to-digital converters, and applies traditional radar signal processing to yield baseband frequency, complex-valued, digital in-phase-and-quadrature (\u201cIQ\u201d) radar signal samples  that correspond to each range cell for each transmitted pulse (range-pulse data). The preprocessing unit  also incorporates the digital pulse compression operation, if applicable. The range-pulse data recorded in one coherent processing interval (CPI) are transferred to a buffer memory . One skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be comprised of a combination of dedicated radar hardware components, signal processing components, and computer hardware and software, where the software comprises computer-implementable instructions stored on a suitable computer-readable medium.","Radar signal samples at the krange cell and npulse are denoted as x(n) for n=1, 2, . . . N and k=1, 2, . . . K , where N is the number of pulses in one CPI and K is the number of range cells of interest. The preprocessed and buffered received radar signal  includes target and clutter returns, together with additive uncorrelated interference called noise. Clutter returns are a correlated form of interference. Mathematically, the received radar signal at the nsampling time instant can be expressed as\n\n()=()+()+(), 1, 2\n\nwhere {t(n)}, {c(n)}, and {n(n)} denote the target signal, surface (ground or sea) clutter, and noise components, respectively. Both clutter and noise are assumed to be stationary, ergodic, zero-mean, Gaussian stochastic processes, and independent of each other. The radar signal can be rewritten in vector form:\n\n,\n\nwhere\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["x","k"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}}},{"mtd":{"mi":"\u22ee"}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"N"}}}}]}}},{"msub":{"mi":["t","k"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["t","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["t","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}}},{"mtd":{"mi":"\u22ee"}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["t","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"N"}}}}]}}},{"msub":{"mi":["c","k"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["c","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["c","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}}},{"mtd":{"mi":"\u22ee"}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["c","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"N"}}}}]}}}],"mo":[",","\u2062",",","\u2062",",","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":{}},{"mtext":{}},{"mtext":{}}],"mi":"and"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-2","num":"00001.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["n","k"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["n","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["n","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}}},{"mtd":{"mi":"\u22ee"}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["n","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"N"}}}}]}}}}}],"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"sub":["1 ","2 ","K"],"b":"120"},"Given an observation data matrix X, the radar detection problem is reduced to choosing one of the following two hypotheses:","H: X=C+N, target absent","H: X=T+C+N, target present","where T=[tt. . . t], C=[cc. . . c], and N=[cc. . . c] are N\u00d7K matrices.","A discrete Fourier transform with a low sidelobe window (weighted DFT)  is applied to the signal samples of the preprocessed and buffered received radar signal  for each range cell, which converts the range-pulse data matrix to a range-Doppler data matrix :",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["X","f"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"F","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"X"}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["1","1"],"mo":","}}}},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["1","2"],"mo":","}}}},{"mi":"\u2026"},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":",","mi":"K"}}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["2","1"],"mo":","}}}},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["2","2"],"mo":","}}}},{"mi":"\u2026"},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":",","mi":"K"}}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mi":"\u22ee"},{"mi":"\u22ee"},{"mi":"\u22f1"},{"mi":"\u22ee"}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":",","mn":"1"}}}},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":",","mn":"2"}}}},{"mi":"\u2026"},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["N","K"],"mo":","}}}}]}]}}],"mo":"="}},"mo":","}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"sup":["th ","th "],"b":["140","130"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["T","=F","T","C","=F","C","N","=F","N"],"sub":["f","f","f"]},"In the range-Doppler data matrix, clutter (and noise) could appear in all of these range-Doppler cells, while the target of interest usually appears in a very limited number of cells, determined by its range-Doppler trace.","Referring now to  illustrates an example that depicts the iso-range (rings) and iso-dop (iso-doppler, hyperbolas) contours for the surface clutter () in the defined coordinate system (), where the XOY plane is at the surface of the ground (assumed to be flat) with the origin at the nadir point of the radar Rx, which is flying level at altitude H.

A standard template (in this case, a ring) will be used in the GIP detector\/discriminator.  depicts the range-azimuth GIP images for the square () and triangle () targets, respectively, with the template being a ring of radius r=25 m. The significant difference between the GIP images in , , and  makes the two-dimensional GIP a powerful candidate for automatic discrimination of targets in strong ground clutter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14A","FIG. 14B","FIG. 11B"]},"Furthermore, the two-dimensional GIP images can be used for discrimination between targets with the same shape but different radar reflectivity. To illustrate this, a target model is designed. The target is also assumed to be a square-shaped object that can be inscribed in a circle with r=25 m, as shown in . The radar parameters and object location are the same as described in the last example. The object is modeled by discretes. Assume that each edge or literal includes Nuniformly distributed discretes. All discretes on one literal have the same radar cross-section (RCS), and may have different RCS from those on another literal. Specifically, denote the discrete RCS on each of four literals as \u03c3, \u03c3, \u03c3, and \u03c3, respectively.","Assume that each literal includes N=60 discretes. The following 4 cases are designed for comparison:","Case 1: \u03c3=\u03c3=\u03c3\u03c3=0.5 m.","Case 2: \u03c3=3\u03c3=10 \u03c3=40\u03c3=0.5 m","Case 3: \u03c3=10\u03c3=100\u03c3=1000\u03c3=0.5 m","Case 4: \u03c3=1000\u03c3=1000\u03c3=1000\u03c3=0.5 m.","In Case 1, all discretes on all four literals have the same RCS. In Case 2 and Case 3, the discrete RCS decreases gradually from literal to literal. But the decrement is much smaller in Case 2 than in Case 3. In Case 4, the discrete RCS on one literal (in parallel to the radar moving track) is stronger than those on the other three literals (equally small) by 30 dB. The clutter background is assumed to be farm land. One CPI includes 1024 pulses. The square object spreads over 17 Doppler cells and 52 range bins, a total of 134 range-Doppler cells, as shown in . Because the resolution in cross range is lower than that in slant range in this example, the two literals in parallel to the moving radar spread fewer range-Doppler cells (each includes more discretes) than other two literals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},"The generalized inner product method and apparatus of the present invention improves the detection and discrimination of slow moving or stationary range-Doppler spread objects on or in close proximity to the ground (or sea surface). This robust detector\/discriminator separates radar returns from interference including ground clutter discretes via a coherent process for separating target returns from the myriad of received signals. Thus the apparatus and method improves the probability of detecting and declaring the presence or absence of an object at the same time that the probability of false declaration decreases. The apparatus and method can be used to improve the automatic target recognition (ATR) capabilities for over resolved targets in heavy clutter.","Though developed for airborne radar, the method and apparatus of the present invention can be applied to the processing of any over resolved object(s) in fields other than radar, including other sensors. For example but not as a limitation, the present invention may be applied to sonar, X-ray, ultrasound, or other techniques of medical imaging and industrial inspection which may be improved by the method and apparatus of the present invention.","Clearly, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above description, and it is therefore understood, within the inventive scope of the inventive concept, that the invention may be practiced otherwise than specifically claimed."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 9C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 11A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 11B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 12A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 12B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 13A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 13B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 14A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 14B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 15A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 15B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
