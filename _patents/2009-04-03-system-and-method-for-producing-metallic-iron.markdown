The United States government may have certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates generally to a system and method for producing metallic iron by thermally reducing a metal oxide in a moving hearth furnace.","Metallic iron has been produced by reducing iron oxide such as iron ores, iron pellets and other iron sources. Various such methods have been proposed so far for directly producing metallic iron from iron ores or iron oxide pellets by using reducing agents such as coal or other carbonaceous material.","These processes have been carried out in rotary hearth and linear hearth furnaces. An example of such a rotary hearth furnace is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,443,931. An example of such a linear hearth furnace is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,413,592. Both the rotary hearth furnace and the linear hearth furnace involve making mixtures of carbonaceous material with iron ore or other iron oxide fines into balls, briquettes or other compacts, and heating them on a moving hearth furnace to reduce the iron oxide to metallic iron nuggets and slag.","Hearth furnaces are largely operated with combustion gases from the heating burners flowing counter to the movement of the hearth and the charge materials. Thermal energy is transferred to the charge materials by direct radiation from the burner flame and the furnace walls as well as by direct contact of the combustion gases with the charge materials. The open nature of these systems, even if divided into zones by baffle walls, does not allow much control of the furnace atmosphere, which is predominantly burner combustion products with lesser amounts of reaction products from the charge materials.","Hearth furnaces are generally heated by natural gas burners that provide thermal energy to the system to raise the temperature of the charge materials and initiate the reduction process, that is, the reaction of the carbon in the charge materials with the iron oxides in the charge materials. The carbon dioxide in the combustion gases also reacts with the carbon in the charge materials to produce carbon monoxide through the Boudouard reaction at about 1830\u00b0 F. (1000\u00b0 C.). This reaction removes carbon from the charge materials at relatively low temperatures. At these temperatures the reaction rate between the carbon monoxide formed and the iron oxide is relatively slow. Therefore, carbon is leached from the system before the reduction process can be completed and has a negative effect on the process.","The effect is that final reduction, in the case of forming iron nuggets, relies on production of carbon monoxide through interaction of the combustion gases with the carbon in the charge materials, which requires high temperatures approaching or exceeding 2550\u00b0 F. (1400\u00b0 C.). This high temperature requires both extra burner energy and time to allow completion of the reduction process. These higher temperatures also increase construction and maintenance costs because more costly refractory is required. A further impediment is the removal of carbon from the charge materials before metallization is complete so that the carbon is not available to be absorbed by the metallic iron formed reducing its melting temperature.","An additional limitation of these furnaces, and the methods of operating these furnaces, in the past has been their energy efficiency. Furthermore, the reduction process involved production of volatiles in the furnace that had to removed from the furnace and secondarily combusted to avoid an environmental hazard, which added to the energy needs to perform the iron reduction. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,390,810. What has been needed is a furnace that reduces the energy consumption needed to reduce the iron oxide bearing material such that a large part, if not all, of the energy to heat the iron oxide bearing material to the temperature necessary to cause the iron oxide to be reduced to metallic iron and slag comes from combusting volatiles directly in the furnace itself and otherwise using heat generated in one part of the furnace in another part of the furnace.","A hearth furnace for producing metallic iron material is disclosed that comprises:","(a) a furnace housing having a drying\/preheat zone capable of providing a drying\/preheat atmosphere for reducible material, a conversion zone capable of providing a reducing atmosphere for reducible material, a fusion zone capable of providing an atmosphere to at least partially reduce metallic iron material, and optionally a cooling zone capable of providing a cooling atmosphere for reduced material containing metallic iron material, the conversion zone being positioned between the drying\/preheat zone and the fusion zone,","(b) a hearth capable of being movable within the furnace housing in a direction through the drying\/preheat zone, then the conversion zone, then the fusion zone, and then, if present, the cooling zone,","(c) a hood or separation barrier positioned within at least a portion of the conversion zone, fusion zone or both, separating the conversion and fusion zones where the hood or separation barrier is positioned into an upper region and a lower region with the lower region adjacent the hearth and the upper region adjacent the lower region and spaced from the hearth, and","(d) at least one reductant injector capable of introducing a gaseous reductant into the lower region adjacent the hearth.","Alternatively, the hood or separation barrier may be positioned within at least a portion of the conversion zone, the fusion zone or both, separating the furnace housing where the hood or separation barrier is located into a combustion region and a reducing region with the reducing region adjacent the hearth and the combustion region adjacent the reducing region and spaced from the hearth. In some alternatives, the separation barrier may act as a hood.","In addition, a method of reducing iron ore and other iron oxide sources is disclosed comprised of:","(a) providing a furnace housing having a drying\/preheat zone capable of providing a drying\/preheat atmosphere for reducible material, a conversion zone capable of providing a reducing atmosphere for reducible material, a fusion zone capable of providing an atmosphere to at least partially reduced metallic iron material, and a cooling zone capable of providing a cooling atmosphere for reduced material containing metallic iron material, the conversion zone being positioned between the drying\/preheat zone and the fusion zone,","(b) providing a hearth capable of being movable within the furnace housing in a direction through the drying\/preheat zone, then the conversion zone, then the fusion zone, and then the cooling zone,","(c) positioning a hood or separation barrier within at least a portion of the conversion zone, fusion zone or both separating the atmosphere of the conversion and fusion zones where the hood or separation barrier is positioned into an upper region and a lower region, with the lower region adjacent the hearth and the upper region adjacent the lower region and spaced from the hearth,","(d) injecting a gaseous reductant into the lower region adjacent the hearth, and","(e) moving the hearth containing iron oxide bearing material and carbonaceous material in the furnace housing through the drying\/preheat zone to dry and preheat the iron oxide bearing material and carbonaceous material, then through the conversion zone to heat the iron oxide bearing material and carbonaceous material to at least partially reduce the iron oxide bearing material, then through the lower region of the fusion zone in the presence of the injected gaseous reductant to fuse the reduced iron oxide bearing material to metallic iron material, and then through the cooling zone to cool the metallic iron material.","The gaseous reductant may be selected from the group comprising carbon monoxide, hydrogen, natural gas, syn-gas, or mixtures thereof.","Referring to , a hearth furnace  for producing metallic iron material directly from iron ore and other iron oxide sources is shown. The furnace  has a furnace housing  internally lined with a refractory material suitable to withstand the temperatures involved in the metallic reduction process carried out in the furnace. The hearth furnace  is divided into a drying\/preheat zone  capable of providing a drying\/preheat atmosphere for reducible material, a conversion zone  capable of providing a reducing atmosphere for reducible material, a fusion zone  capable of providing an atmosphere to at least partially form metallic iron material, and optionally a cooling zone  capable of providing a cooling atmosphere for reduced material containing metallic iron material. The conversion zone  is positioned between the drying\/preheat zone  and the fusion zone . The conversion zone  is the zone in which at least the initial reduction of metallic iron material occurs. The entry end of the hearth furnace , at the drying\/preheat zone , is closed by a restricting baffle  that inhibits fluid flow between the outside ambient atmosphere and the atmosphere of the drying\/preheat zone , yet provides clearance so as not to inhibit the movement of reducible material into the furnace housing . The baffle  may be made of suitable refractory material or a metal material if the temperatures are sufficiently low. The exit end of the hearth furnace , at the cooling zone , may be closed by a restricting baffle  that inhibits fluid flow between the outside ambient atmosphere and the atmosphere of the cooling zone , yet provides clearance so as not to inhibit the movement of reducible material out of the furnace housing . The baffle  may be made of a suitable refractory material or a metal material if the temperatures are sufficiently low.","Hearth  provided within the furnace housing  may comprise a series of movable hearth cars , which are positioned contiguously end to end as they move through the furnace housing . Hearth cars  are moved on wheels  which typically engage railroad rails . The upper portion of the hearth cars  are lined with a refractory material suitable to withstand the temperatures for reduction of the iron oxide bearing material into metallic iron as explained herein. The hearth cars are positioned contiguously end to end to move through the furnace housing , so that the lower portions of the hearth cars are not damaged by the heat generated in the furnace as the process of reducing iron oxide-bearing material into metallic iron proceeds. Alternatively, the hearth  may be movement belt or other suitable conveyance medium that with the refractory material described below, is able to within the temperatures of the furnace atmospheres as described below.","The reducible material is positioned on the hearth cars  outside the furnace generally in the form of a mixture of finely divided iron ore, or other iron oxide bearing material, and a carbonaceous material, such as coke, char, anthracite coal or non-caking bituminous and sub-bituminous coal. The reducible material is in mixtures of finely divided iron oxide-bearing material that are formed into compacts. The compacts may be briquettes or mounds preformed or formed in situ on the hearth cars  so that the mixtures of reducible material are presented to the furnace  in discrete portions. Also, a hearth layer of finely divided carbonaceous material, such as coke, char or coal, may be provided on the hearth cars with the reducible material positioned on the hearth layer, to avoid damage to the refractory material used in the upper portion of the hearth cars  from the related slag generated on reducing the metallic iron in the furnace.","The hearth furnace may be linear as generally illustrated in . In this connection, the building in which the furnace is housed, or other considerations, may require that certain parts of the furnace be arcuate or at angles, to accommodate these needs. For these purposes, the hearth furnace is classified as linear if a part of its length, usually the conversion zone , is substantially linear in the direction of travel of the hearth . The hearth furnace may also be a rotary hearth furnace, in which case the hearth cars are pie-shaped or in the form of replaceable sections of a contiguous hearth.","The zones of the furnace  are generally characterized by the temperature reached in each zone. In the drying\/preheat zone , moisture is generally driven off from the reducible material and the reducible material is heated to a temperature short of fluidizing volatiles in and associated with the reducible material positioned on the hearth cars . The design is to reach in the drying\/preheat zone a cut-off temperature in the reducible material just short of significant volatilization of carbonaceous material in and associated with the reducible material. This temperature is generally somewhere in the range of about 300-600\u00b0 F. (150-315\u00b0 C.), depending in part on the particular composition of the reducible material.","The conversion zone  is characterized by heating the reducible material to initiate the reduction process in forming the reducible material into metallic iron material and slag. The conversion zone  is generally characterized by heating the reducible material to about 1500 to 2100\u00b0 F. (815 to 1150\u00b0 C.), depending on the particular composition and form of reducible material.","The fusion zone  involves further heating the reducible material, now absent of most volatile materials and commencing to form metallic iron, to fuse the metallic iron material and separate slag. The fusion zone generally involves heating the reducible material to about 2400 to 2550\u00b0 F. (1315-1370\u00b0 C.), or higher, so that metallic iron nuggets are formed with only a low percentage of iron oxide in the metallic iron. If the process is carried out efficiently, there will also be a low percentage of iron oxide in the slag, since the process is designed to reduce very high percentage of the iron oxide in the reducible material to metallic iron.","The heating of the reducible material in the conversion zone  and fusion zone  may be done by oxy-fuel burners  in the side wall  of the furnace housing  as shown in , A, B and C. The oxy-fuel burners  are positioned to provide for efficient combustion of the volatilized materials in the conversion zone (as described in detail below) and to efficiently reduce the reducible material to metallic iron material in fusion zone . The oxy-fuel burners  should be positioned to provide for efficient heat transfer and efficient reduction of the iron oxide in the reducible material with the least energy consumption. The oxy-fuel burners  may be positioned on about 10 foot centers (about 3 m), staggered along opposite side walls , about a foot down from the roof  of the furnace housing . Alternatively, or in addition, the oxy-fuel burners  may be positioned opposite each other in the side walls  (as shown in , B and C) and\/or in the roof  of the furnace housing . In addition, oxygen lances  may be positioned in the roof  of the furnace housing  of the conversion zone  and the fusion zone  to provide additional energy for generation of heat and efficient conversion of the reducible material in the furnace. Combustion gases are exhausted via an exhaust conduit .  shows an exemplary placement of exhaust conduit . Depending on desired operating conditions, exhaust conduit  may be placed elsewhere in conversion zone , may be placed in fusion zone , or may be placed in drying\/preheat zone  as shown in . There may be a single exhaust conduit , or there may be multiple exhaust conduits placed in diverse locations within furnace .","Cooling zone  cools the metallic iron material from its formation temperature in the conversion zone  and fusion zone  to a temperature at which the metallic iron material can be reasonably handled and further processed. This temperature is generally about 500\u00b0 F. (260\u00b0 C.) or below. The cooling can be achieved by injection of nitrogen through nozzles  in the roofs and\/or side walls of the furnace housing  and\/or indirect water cooling. Also, water spray may be used for the cooling in the cooling zone , if desired and provision made for water handling within the system.","Shown in , a hood or separation barrier  is positioned in the fusion zone , separating the fusion zone into a lower region or reducing region  adjacent the hearth  and upper region or combustion region  adjacent the reducing region  and spaced from the hearth . As shown, for example, in , the separation barrier  may be positioned in the conversion zone  separating the conversion zone into a lower region or reducing region  adjacent the hearth  and upper region or combustion region  adjacent the reducing region  and spaced from the hearth . In yet another alternate, the separation barrier  may be positioned within at least a portion of the conversion zone, the fusion zone or both, the separation barrier separating the furnace housing where the separation barrier is located into an upper region, or combustion region and a lower region, or reducing region with the reducing region adjacent the hearth and the combustion region adjacent the reducing region and spaced from the hearth. As shown in , the separation barrier  may be positioned in a portion of both the conversion zone and the fusion zone. Additionally, while the figures show the separation barrier  positioned as shown, the separation barrier  of each of these alternatives may be positioned in the at least a portion of the conversion zone, the fusion zone or both.","In one embodiment, the separation barrier  may comprise spaced pipes or hollow beams , positioned transverse between the furnace side walls as shown in . The spaced pipes or hollow beams  may have a square cross section, a rectangular cross section or a round cross section. The beams  may abut one another or be spaced from another. The spacing may be sufficient to accommodate growth from thermal changes, or it may be, for example, 2 feet on center (about 0.6 m). A plate or grate  may be provided on top of the beams . The plate or grate  may be made of a ceramic, silicon carbide, refractory or another suitable material. In the separation barrier , there may also be provided intermediately along its length and at its end gaps  and , respectively, such as shown in . The gaps are typically positioned to facilitate flow of the fluidized volatile material from the reducible material in the reducing region  to the combustion region  of the conversion zone , for efficient combustion of the volatiles to produce heat that can be transferred to the reducing region  and reducible material in the reducing region  of the conversion zone . To provide for this flow from the reducing region  to the combustion region , a flow is created through the atmosphere of the reducing region  in the direction of travel of the moving hearth , and in a part of the combustion region  in a direction counter to the direction of movement of the hearth through the furnace housing .","The separation barrier  may be of a heat conductive material capable of conducting the heat generated in the combustion region  above the separation barrier to the reducing region  below the separation barrier to reduce the reducible material positioned on the hearth , or heat radiating material capable of absorbing heat from the combustion of the fluidized volatile material in the combustion region  above the separation barrier and radiating heat into the reducing region  below the separation barrier to reduce the reducible material, or both. The separation barrier  may be made of silicon carbide or other such higher heat conductive refractory material.","Alternatively, or in addition to gaps , the separation barrier  may be perforated, as with a grate for example, or otherwise discontinuous to allow for controlled flow of fluidized material from the region below the separation barrier into the region above the separation barrier.","Alternatively, or in addition to gaps , the separation barrier  may be a gas curtain as shown in  or B. As shown in , the gas curtain forming the separation barrier  is a gas flow from one side wall of the furnace housing  (at ) to the opposite side wall of the furnace housing  (at ) in a transverse direction to movement of the hearth  through the furnace housing . The gas curtain forming the separation barrier may be either a closed system as shown in , where the gas is continually re-circulated with gas supplements, or a single pass through system as shown in  where the gas enters through the side wall  of the furnace housing  at  and exits through the opposite side wall  of the furnace housing  at .","In another embodiment, the separation barrier  may be formed by a gas curtain simultaneously flowing from opposite side wall  of the furnace housing  at  and , but angled upwardly to flow transverse the direction of travel of the hearth  through the furnace housing . In this embodiment, the separation barrier  may be formed by the flow from oxy-fuel burners positioned in the side walls  of the furnace housing  at  and . Oxy-fuel burners (not shown) may be positioned at  and  a few inches above the reducible material on the hearth  as shown in , B and C. The gas curtain forming the separation barrier  may be comprised of a gas selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, combustion gas, effluent gas from the furnace or a mixture of two or more of these gases.","Alternatively, or in addition to gaps  and , the separation barrier may be perforated, as with a grate for example, or otherwise discontinuous to allow for efficient flow of fluidized volatile material from the reducing region  into the combustion region  of the conversion zone . To provide for efficient flow of the volatile material fluidized in the reducing region  into the combustion region  of the conversion zone , the separation barrier  may also ascend upwardly in the direction of movement of the hearth  through the furnace . Such an ascending separation barrier may be as shown in  where the separation barrier is angled. Alternatively, the separation barrier  may be provided in ascending steps (not shown) to facilitate construction of an ascending separation barrier  in sections along the furnace housing . In any case, the separation barrier is ascending to allow for increased volume of fluidized volatile material in the reducing region  as the temperature increased in the reducible material with the hearth  moving the reducible material through the conversion zone  of the furnace.","The separation barrier  impedes direct impingement of combustion gases with the reducible material on the hearth  and impedes reaction of furnace combustion gases with the reducible material.","The separation barrier  may operate as a hood. Reductant injectors are provided to inject gaseous reductants under the hood or separation barrier  to react with the reducible materials to accelerate the reduction of iron oxide and supplement the reduction potential provided by solid reductants such as coal, coke, coke breeze, or coal char that have been mixed with the iron oxide materials. The reducing gases are injected at a high temperature and then the temperature is increased further to allow fusion and separation of both the iron and slag on the hearth. The process includes preheating and reduction as the temperature is increased from ambient to about 2400\u00b0 F. (1315\u00b0 C.), injection of the reducing gases at 2400\u00b0 F. to 2500\u00b0 F. (1315\u00b0 C. to 1371\u00b0 C.), and final fusion and iron-slag separation.","In one embodiment, the furnace burners  are operated at near stoichiometric conditions to produce a furnace atmosphere in the reduction and fusion zones that has a low oxygen content. Under such conditions, the iron oxide is fully reduced to metallic iron as it is brought up to temperatures of about 1400\u00b0 F. (1315\u00b0 C.). At this point, the iron oxide is essentially fully reduced as it passes under the separation barrier . As it passes under the separation barrier , a reducing gas is introduced. This forms a gaseous layer and reduces or prevents the potential for back-oxidation of the metallized charge to FeO. Prevention of FeO formation is important to the process, because, if present, the FeO will react with other slag making components such as alumina, lime or magnesia to form a liquid Fe-rich slag phase. An Fe-rich slag phase will inhibit the partition of sulfur from the iron phase to the slag and produce high sulfur metallic iron. The primary purpose of the reducing gas blanket is to prevent FeO formation.","Carburization of the iron is critical to all of these processes, but has been found to primarily take place at the contact between the agglomerated charge and the underlying carbonaceous hearth layer. The segregation and nucleation of solid iron is observed to take place at the hearth layer contact and progressively incorporate the overlying porous iron while segregating the slag making components. Carbon transfer from the hearth to the iron is essential to produce molten iron and formation of metallic iron. Both CO and CH(natural gas) are used in conventional carburization of iron, albeit at lower temperatures than this process for practical reasons. The carburization rates are low, but in this process the temperature is much higher so that the rate may not be insignificant. Further the lace-work of metallized iron formed in the initial reduction stage provides a very large surface area for the reaction so even if the carburization rate is slow it will still be a significant factor in carburization and promote early iron fusion, final coalescence and formation of metallic iron.","Sulfur transfer from the iron to slag is logically most rapid at the contact between the liquid iron and liquid slag. As carburization of the iron proceeds at the hearth layer briquette interface and fusion to form metallic iron proceeds liquid slag migrates out and up into the overlying sponge iron. The path length for de-sulfurization is measured in microns at this stage and if a CaO-rich slag were available de-sulfurization would be quite efficient. Injection of a gaseous reductant is a way to prevent back oxidation of Fe to FeO and maintain the integrity of the slag so that sulfur partition can be effective.","Further, as the slag migrates up through the sponge iron, it makes close contact with the iron. Sulfur transfer from the iron to the slag during this stage should not necessarily be discounted entirely because of the intimate contact and near fusion temperature involved.","The gaseous reductant may be selected from the group consisting of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, combustion gases, synthetic gases, natural gas, or mixtures thereof. Synthetic gases include reducing gases generated from coal, coke, or char by partial oxidation at high temperatures, or by injecting steam or carbon dioxide into a preheated bed of coal, coke, or char.","The reductant injectors may be positioned close to the upper surface of the reducible materials on the moving hearth  to provide for efficient reduction of the reducible material. For example the reductant injectors may be placed within 8\u2033 (about 200 mm) or 6\u2033 (about 150 mm) of the materials on the hearth , or may be placed within 2\u2033 or 3\u2033 (about 50 mm or about 75 mm) of the materials on the hearth . In the embodiment shown in , the reductant injectors may be apertures in the spaced pipes, or hollow beams  spaced along the length of the beam as the beam extends from adjacent one side wall of the furnace to adjacent the opposite side wall of the furnace. The apertures may be directed upstream, directed downstream, or directed up or down. The reductant injector may inject the gaseous reductant at any angle. The injection points and direction may be selected to reduce direct impingement on the injected gaseous reductant onto the materials on the hearth  and\/or to promote mixing of the injected gaseous reductant with the atmosphere below the hood .","The injected reductant gases can include carbon monoxide, natural gas, hydrogen, effluent gases or mixtures of any of these gases. Where the furnace temperatures are lower, i.e., below about 2000\u00b0 F. (1100\u00b0 C.), carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas are better choices than natural gas.","Where the hood  is comprised of a plurality of spaced pipes or hollow beams , the beams may have apertures such that any reductant gases introduced into the beams  will flow out of the beams to the area below the hood . Depending upon the spacing of the beams , every beam may include apertures or only certain beams may include apertures. Conduits, injectors, or other devices may also be provided to effect the injection of reductant gases below the hood .","In one particular instance, the hood  can be installed towards the feed end of the furnace where the temperatures are relatively low, i.e., 2280\u00b0 F. (1250\u00b0 C.). The injection of a gaseous reductant at this point in the process will allow addition of less than stoichiometric amounts of solid reductant in the reducible materials, if desired, and also allows the carryover of some solid carbonaceous material into the fusion zone of the furnace where reduction of the iron oxides is typically completed, and provides carbon to be absorbed by the metallic iron formed, which will reduce the melting point of the metallic iron and facilitate separation of the metallic iron and slag on the hearth.","Preferably, the hood  can be installed towards the fusion end of the furnace where the temperatures are about 2450\u00b0 F. (1343\u00b0 C.). To provide for control of the flow of fluids in the conversion zone , a first baffle  is provided between drying\/preheat zone  and conversion zone . This first baffle  is capable of inhibiting direct fluid communication between the atmosphere of the conversion zone  and the atmosphere of the drying\/preheat zone . First baffle  may be made of a suitable refractory material, such as silicon carbide, and may extend downwardly to within a few inches of the reducible material on the hearth . The design is to provide for efficient inhibiting of direct fluid communication between the conversion zone  and the drying\/preheat zone  in the furnace , without interfering with movement of reducible material on hearth  through furnace housing .","A first communication passageway  is also provided and capable of carrying fluids from the combustion region  of the conversion zone  to the drying\/preheat zone . The first communication passageway  may be a chamber or chambers laterally positioned in the side(s) of the furnace housing  with a double refractory wall, or ducting which extends through the side(s) of the furnace housing  as shown in .","The inlet  to first communication passageway  may be located to provide for efficient combustion of the fluidized volatile material in combustion region , and to efficiently move the combusted fluids from the combustion region . As shown in , the flow through first communication passageway  may facilitate flow of volatile fluids from the reducing region  to the combustion region , to provide flow of the fluidized volatile material within the reducing region  in the direction of travel of hearth  through the furnace housing , and to provide for flow of the fluidized volatile material and combusted fluids through the combustion region  counter to the direction of travel of the hearth  through the furnace housing  to facilitate flow from the outlet  of the first communication passageway .","In the alternatives shown in , a process fan  may be provided with its inlet  adjacent the entrance baffle  of the reducible material on the hearth cars  into the furnace  for efficient use of the transported fluids in the drying\/preheat zone , and to provide for efficient heat transfer in drying\/preheating the reducible material. The outlet  of first communication passageway  is provided adjacent the first baffle , and near the reducible material, to provide for efficient use of the fluid flow from passageway  in drying and preheating the reducible material in drying\/preheat zone . To provide flow of the fluid through drying\/preheat zone  counter to the movement of the hearth  through the furnace housing , a generally horizontal baffle  may extend from first baffle  into the drying\/preheat zone  to direct flow of the fluid from outlet  of first communication passageway  through the drying\/preheat zone , to efficiently transfer heat from the transported fluid to dry and preheat the reducible material on the hearth .","The temperature of the combusted fluids through first communication passageway  is generally too high for effective use of the drying\/preheat zone . For this reason, a temperature controller  is positioned in first communication passageway  and is capable of controlling the temperature of the fluid flowing from the combustion region  of the conversion zone  to the drying\/preheat zone . The temperature controller  may cool the fluid transported through first communication passageway  by mixing with a cooling gas such as tempering air or nitrogen transported from cooling zone . Alternatively, the temperature controller  may be in the form of a heat exchanger capable of controlling the temperature of the fluid flowing through first communication passageway  by extracting and recovering heat from the fluid flow in the first communication passageway . The extracted and recovered heat may be transferred to a secondary fluid in the heat exchanger  and transferred by a duct  to a heater (not shown) capable of heating gas supplied to the burners  in the combustion region  and the fusion zone , or the gas supplied to burners  may be heated directly in heat exchanger .","A second baffle  is provided either between conversion zone  and fusion zone  or part way into fusion zone . Second baffle  is capable of inhibiting direct fluid communication between the atmosphere of the part of the fusion zone  downstream of the baffle to the atmosphere of the conversion zone . The second baffle  may be a refractory material, such as silicon carbide, and extend to within a few inches of the reducible material positioned on the hearth  as it moves through the furnace housing , to effectively inhibit the direct fluid communication across the second baffle .","Alternatively or in addition, a second communication passageway  may be provided capable of carrying fluid from the fusion zone  to the combustion region  of the conversion zone  adjacent the first baffle  as shown in . The inlet  to second communication passageway  is positioned in fusion zone  downstream of second baffle  to provide flow of fluid through the fusion zone counter to the travel of the hearth  through fusion zone . This provides for efficient transfer of the heat in reducing and melting of the metallic iron material in the fusion zone . For this purpose, a horizontal baffle  of refractory material may extend from second baffle  downstream into the fusion zone  to facilitate the counter current flow of fluid through the fusion zone and avoid turbulence in the vicinity of the reducible material as it passes under second baffle . The outlets  from second communication passageway  into the combustion region  of conversion zone  may be distributed as shown in  for more effective transfer of heat from the fluids transported from the fusion zone  to the combustion region  for their efficient use in combusting fluidized volatile material and produce heat assist in reducing the reducible material in the reducing region .","The cooling zone  within the furnace housing  is optional, since it may be desired in certain embodiments to perform the cooling of the metallic iron material outside the furnace housing  to reduce furnace costs and other considerations. Alternatively, a third baffle  may be provided between the fusion zone  and the cooling zone . Third baffle  is capable of inhibiting direct fluid communication between the atmosphere of at least part of the cooling zone  and the atmosphere of the fusion zone . The third baffle  may be made of a refractory material, such as silicon carbide, and may extend to within a few inches of the reducible material positioned on the hearth  as reducible material moves through the furnace housing . The third baffle  together with third communication passageway  provides for efficient movement of fluid through the atmosphere of cooling zone  counter to the direction of travel of the hearth , through the furnace housing, and to extract heat from the metallic iron material in the cooling zone  for use in the drying\/preheat zone  to dry and preheat the reducible material. Third communication passageway  is positioned downstream adjacent third baffle , with inlet  positioned adjacent third baffle , and a horizontal baffle  may extend from third baffle  to efficiently direct the flow of fluid through the cooling zone . The outlet  from the third communication passageway  is adjacent the first baffle . Alternatively, if desired, all or part of the fluid flow through the third communication passageway  may be directed to temperature controller  in first communication passageway  and mixed with a fluid flow through communication passageway  to lower and control the temperature of that fluid flow.","Both second communication passageway  and third communication passageway  may be provided in lateral chambers as part of the furnace housing  or by separate ducting through the roof  or side walls  of furnace housing . In either case, these communication passageways should be insulated so as to minimize the loss of heat and to provide for efficient transfer of heat from one part of the furnace  to another, and in turn increase the efficiency of the furnace  in reducing the iron oxide to metallic iron (while efficiently combusting volatiles from the reducible material to heat the reducible material in the conversion zone ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["30","30","60","14","50","30","14","14","14","50","14","30","20","20","30","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 2 and 3"],"b":["10","30","50","36","30","42","41","32","50","32","31","35","32","31","35","20","31","35","50","52","51","14","51","32","40","32","35","31"]},"As an additional feature, as shown in , weir  may be positioned contiguous with the separation barrier  adjacent intermediate gap .
