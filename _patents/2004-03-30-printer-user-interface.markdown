title: Printer user interface
abstract: A multifunction printer enables the printing of time-based media and is operated via a user interface. The user interface includes a touch screen for accepting command inputs and providing information to a user. Time-based media data is received by the printer from a media source specified via the user interface. A user specifies one or more multimedia processing functions for the printer to apply to the data. The printer performs the specified functions, and previews the output to the user via a display of the user interface. If the user decides to print the previewed output, the user specifies one or more output devices, such that the printer can print conventional printed output and/or to a specified electronic output.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to printers that have embedded functionality for printing time-based media, and in particular to a user interface for operating a printer that prints time-based media resulting in a combination of a printed output and a related electronic data output.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventional printers receive documents in a variety of formats and print the contents of the documents in accordance with a proper format. For example, a printer enabled to print Portable Document Format (PDF) documents will correctly recreate the original appearance of the document, regardless of the platform being used to view the document.","Today, as more databases and computer networks are interconnected, people often have multiple data systems and destinations in which to store information. For example, a person may receive an email containing information that he wants to retain. The person may want to print some or all of the information. The person may further want to add the information to a database or to send the information to other people or destinations or to add the information to a web page. Currently, the person will need to execute several different software programs and will need to type multiple commands into the programs. He may also need to re-enter the information into one or more programs. This is not efficient and is prone to human error, since human beings occasionally forget to perform one of more of the tasks usually associated with a received document and are also prone to making typographical errors.","Some conventional printers incorporate a management function in which the printer monitors its own internal functions and displays an alert if, for example, its toner is low or it is out of paper. This action is based on the printer doing \u201cself-monitoring,\u201d not on any monitoring of the documents to be printed.","While conventional printers can print documents in a wide variety of formats, these printers are fundamentally limited in their ability to reproduce different kinds of media. For example, it is standard technology for a printer to produce images of static text, pictures, or a combination of the two. But because these printers print onto paper or another similar fixed medium, they cannot record the nuances of time-based media very well.","In developing a printer that is equipped to print time-based media without the limitations of conventional printers, a user interface for such a printer is needed. It is further desirable that such a user interface be operable with a printer that performs at least some of the necessary processing itself rather than require an attached computer or other device to perform all of the processing.","A multifunction printer enables the printing of time-based media. In a typical hardware configuration for such a multifunction printer, a printer includes a print engine that produces a paper or other printed output and one or more electronic devices the produce a related electronic output. Together, the printed and electronic outputs provide an improved representation of the time-based media over that of a convention paper printer.","A user interface provides access to functionality of the printer. In a preferred embodiment, the user interface includes a touch screen for accepting command inputs and providing information to a user. In an alternative embodiment, input is provided by way of a keypad, keyboard, or other input device.","Time-based media data is received by the printer from a media source specified via the user interface. A user specifies one or more multimedia processing functions for the printer to apply to the data. The printer performs the specified functions, and previews the output to the user via a display of the user interface. If the user decides to print the previewed output, the user specifies one or more output devices, such that the printer can print conventional printed output and\/or to a specified electronic output.","The figures depict preferred embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","Various embodiments of a multifunction printer enable the printing of time-based media in a useful and intelligent format. To create a representation of this time-based media, the printer produces a printed output and a related electronic output, which together provide a representation of the received media. Depending on the desired application for the printer, the printer may include any number of devices for receiving the media, printing the printed output, and producing the electronic output. The described user interface is meant to be generally applicable not only to the specific combinations of input and output devices described herein, but also to additional combinations not specifically disclosed, as would be understood by those of skill in the art from the present disclosure.","Printer Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","110","115","120","125","150","105","115","120","160","170"]},"In one embodiment, the media processing system  includes a memory , a processor , and one or more embedded functionality modules .
