{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to persistent network connections and, more particularly, to techniques for determining an optimal connection duration for a connection between a client and a server across a network.","Most modern remote management solutions attempt to maintain persistent network connections between management servers and managed endpoints (e.g., client devices). Ideally, these persistent network connections would remain live indefinitely. Unfortunately, many network devices (e.g., firewalls) located between the management servers and managed endpoints frequently terminate such network connections for various reasons. For example, a network device may terminate a network connection between a management server and a managed endpoint based on a determination that the machines have been connected and silent (e.g., sending low or no traffic) for too long. As a result, many managed endpoints resort to using inefficient polling mechanisms to maintain a live, persistent network connection.","In view of the foregoing, it may be understood that there may be significant problems and shortcomings associated with current network connection technologies.","Techniques for determining an optimal connection duration for a connection between a client and a server across a network are disclosed. In one particular embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a method for determining an optimal connection duration for a connection between a client device and a server across a network comprising: identifying, using the client device, a network access point that communicatively couples the client device to a network; selecting a sever connection time period; initiating the connection between the client device and the server via the network based on the sever connection time period; determining whether a sever connection notification was received from the server within the sever connection time period; and adjusting the sever connection time period based on the determination.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular embodiment, identifying the network access point may include identifying a Media Access Control (MAC) address associated with the network access point.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular embodiment, the sever connection time period may indicate an amount of time the server should wait before gracefully severing the connection between the client device and the server.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular embodiment, initiating the connection between the client device and the server may include transmitting the sever connection time period to the server via the network.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular embodiment, the sever connection notification may be configured to notify the client device that the server is preparing to sever the connection between the client device and the server.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular embodiment, the sever connection notification may be configured to instruct the client device to initiate a new connection between the client device and the server.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular embodiment, whether the sever connection notification was received within a total time period that comprises a sum of the sever connection time period and a threshold time period may be determined.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular embodiment, adjusting the sever connection time period may include increasing the sever connection time period based on the determination that the sever connection notification was received from the server within the sever connection time period.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular embodiment, adjusting the sever connection time period may include decreasing the sever connection time period based on the determination that the sever connection notification was not received from the server within the sever connection time period.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular embodiment, the sever connection time period may be adjusted until the optimal connection duration is determined.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular embodiment, a keep alive frequency may be selected.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular embodiment, one or more keep alive messages may be transmitted based on the keep alive frequency.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular embodiment, the keep alive frequency may be adjusted until an optimal keep alive frequency is determined.","In another particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as an article of manufacture for determining an optimal connection duration for a connection between a client device and a server across a network, the article of manufacture comprising: at least one non-transitory processor readable medium; and instructions stored on the at least one medium; wherein the instructions are configured to be readable from the at least one medium by at least one processor and thereby cause the at least one processor to operate so as to: identify a network access point that communicatively couples the client device to a network; select a sever connection time period; initiate the connection between the client device and the server via the network based on the sever connection time period; determine whether a sever connection notification was received from the server within the sever connection time period; and adjust the sever connection time period based on the determination.","In another particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a system for determining an optimal connection duration for a connection between a client device and a server across a network comprising: one or more processors communicatively coupled to a network, wherein the one or more processors are configured to: identify a network access point that communicatively couples the client device to a network; select a sever connection time period; initiate the connection between the client device and the server via the network based on the sever connection time period; determine whether a sever connection notification was received from the server within the sever connection time period;

While the present disclosure is described below with reference to embodiments, it should be understood that the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Those of ordinary skill in the art having access to the teachings herein will recognize additional implementations, modifications, and embodiments, as well as other fields of use, which are within the scope of the present disclosure as described herein, and with respect to which the present disclosure may be of significant utility.","Currently, modern remote management solutions may attempt to maintain persistent network connections between management servers (e.g., servers) and managed endpoints (e.g., client devices) in order to provide the management servers with immediate access to the managed endpoints. Many network devices (e.g., firewalls) located between these management servers and managed endpoints, however, may frequently terminate such network connections without warning or notification (e.g., ungracefully). For example, a network device may terminate a network connection between a management server and a managed endpoint based on a determination that the machines have been connected and silent (e.g., sending low or no traffic) for too long. In another example, a network device may terminate a network connection between a management server and a managed endpoint to conserve the network device's memory.","As a result, many managed endpoints may be configured to use polling mechanisms (e.g., regular reconnections, keep alive requests) to maintain a live, persistent network connection to a management server. Such polling mechanisms, however, create a substantial amount of unnecessary traffic that consumes Central Processing Unit (CPU) resources and bandwidth resources. Furthermore, these polling mechanisms may introduce latency between the management server and the managed endpoint. For example, if the managed endpoint polls every 10 minutes, then it could take up to 10 minutes before the management server can successfully initiate a conversation with the managed endpoint in the case of a terminated connection.","In one embodiment, certain techniques for determining an optimal connection duration for a connection between a client and a server across a network are provided. In such an embodiment, a connection duration system may operate on a client device to enable the client device to determine an optimal connection duration, an optimal keep alive frequency, or a combination of both. The optimal connection duration may indicate the greatest amount of time that the client device can assume that a connection between the client device and a server on a particular network is still live. The optimal keep alive frequency may indicate the lowest frequency at which the client device can transmit a keep alive message in order to maintain a live connection between the client device and a server on a particular network.","When a client device is initially connected to a network, the connection duration system may identify the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the network access point associated with the network. Based on the identified MAC address, the connection duration system may determine whether an optimal connection duration or an optimal keep alive frequency has been previously determined for the network. For example, the connection duration system may access a storage mechanism (e.g., memory) located on the client device to determine whether the identified MAC address is associated with an optimal connection duration or an optimal keep alive frequency that was previously determined by the client device. If, for example, the MAC address is associated with an optimal connection duration or an optimal keep alive frequency that were previously determined, the connection duration system may use the previously determined optimal connection duration or optimal keep alive frequency to maintain a live, persistent connection between the client device and a server across the network. If, however, the MAC address is not associated with an optimal connection duration or an optimal keep alive frequency that were previously determined, the connection duration system may initiate a process to determine an optimal connection duration, an optimal keep alive frequency, or a combination of both.","In one embodiment, the connection duration system may determine an optimal connection duration by selecting a sever connection time period (e.g., an initial sever connection time period). A sever connection time period may indicate an amount of time a server should wait before gracefully severing a connection between a client device and the server. For example, the connection duration system may select an initial sever connection time period of 6 hours. The connection duration system may then initiate a connection with a server across the network based on the selected sever connection time period. That is, the connection duration system may initiate the connection with the server and transmit the selected sever connection time period to the server across the network.","The connection duration system may then determine whether a sever connection notification was received from the server within the sever connection time period. In one embodiment, a sever connection notification may include a notification to the client device that the server is preparing to sever the connection between the client device and the server. In another embodiment, a sever connection notification may include an instruction to the client device to initiate a new connection between the client device and the server.","If, for example, the connection duration system determines that a sever connection notification was received from the server within the sever connection time period (i.e., the connection is still live), the client device may increase the sever connection time period (e.g., increase the sever connection time period from 6 hours to 9 hours) and initiate a new connection between the client device and the server. If, however, the connection duration system determines that a sever connection notification was not received from the server within the sever connection time period (i.e., the connection is not still live), the client device may decrease the sever connection time period (e.g., decrease the sever connection time period from 6 hours to 3 hours) and initiate a new connection between the client device and the server. The client device may continue adjusting the sever connection time period (e.g., by increasing and decreasing the sever connection time period) until the optimal connection duration is determined.","In another embodiment, the connection duration system may determine an optimal keep alive frequency by selecting an initial keep alive frequency (e.g., 30 minutes). The connection duration system may then transmit one or more keep alive messages based on the selected keep alive frequency. The connection duration system may then determine whether a sever connection notification was received from the server within the sever connection time period. If, for example, the connection duration system receives a sever connection notification within the sever connection time period (i.e., the connection is still live), the client device may decrease the keep alive frequency (e.g., decrease the keep alive frequency from 30 minutes to 1 hour) and initiate a new connection between the client device and the server. If, however, the connection duration system does not receive a sever connection notification within the sever connection time period (i.e., the connection is not still live), the client device may increase the keep alive frequency (e.g., increase the keep alive frequency from 30 minutes to 15 minutes) and initiate a new connection between the client device and the server. The client device may continue adjusting the keep alive frequency until the optimal keep alive frequency is determined. Based on the optimal connection duration, optimal keep alive frequency, or a combination of both, the connection duration system may maintain the appearance of an indefinitely persistent connection by initiating a new connection with a server at the end of the optimal connection duration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","110","120","140","140","200","110","120","140","140","150","140","160","1","140","160","1","140","142","144","140","140","170","170","180","1","140","140","110","120","150","140","190","120","122","124","126","128"]},"With reference to computer system  of , modem , network interface , or some other method may be used to provide connectivity from one or more of client  and client  to network .

Accordingly, the optimal connection duration storage module  may store a first optimal connection duration, a first optimal keep alive frequency, or a combination of both, that were previously determined while the client device was connected to the first network. In addition, the optimal connection duration storage module  may store a second optimal connection duration, a second optimal keep alive frequency, or a combination of both, that were previously determined while the client device was connected to the second network. Furthermore, the optimal connection duration storage module  may store a third optimal connection duration, a third optimal keep alive frequency, or a combination of both, that were previously determined while the client device was connected to the third network.","In one embodiment, each optimal connection duration and optimal keep alive frequency may be associated with a corresponding MAC address of a network access point of a corresponding network.

In certain embodiments, the initial sever connection time period may be selected based on any, or a combination, of the client device's previous interactions with the network, the client device's previous interactions with similar networks, and design preferences.","At block , a connection between the client device and the server may be initiated via the network based on the sever connection time period. That is, the optimal connection duration determination module  may initiate the connection between the client device and the server and transmit the selected sever connection time period to the server across the network.","At block , whether a sever connection notification was received from the server within the sever connection time period may be determined.","At block , the sever connection time period may be adjusted based on the determination. In certain embodiments, the sever connection time period may be adjusted by increasing the sever connection time period based on the determination that the sever connection notification was received from the server within the sever connection time period. In other embodiments, the sever connection time period may be adjusted by decreasing the sever connection time period based on the determination that the sever connection notification was not received from the server within the sever connection time period.","At block , the method  may end.","At this point it should be noted that determining an optimal connection duration for a connection between a client and a server across a network in accordance with the present disclosure as described above may involve the processing of input data and the generation of output data to some extent. This input data processing and output data generation may be implemented in hardware or software. For example, specific electronic components may be employed in an optimal connection duration determination module or similar or related circuitry for implementing the functions associated with determining an optimal connection duration for a connection between a client and a server across a network in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. Alternatively, one or more processors operating in accordance with instructions may implement the functions associated with determining an optimal connection duration for a connection between a client and a server across a network in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. If such is the case, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that such instructions may be stored on one or more processor readable storage media (e.g., a magnetic disk or other storage medium), or transmitted to one or more processors via one or more signals embodied in one or more carrier waves.","The present disclosure is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein. Indeed, other various embodiments of and modifications to the present disclosure, in addition to those described herein, will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings. Thus, such other embodiments and modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.
