The invention also relates to methods of using the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.","Phosphatidylinositol (hereinafter abbreviated as \u201cPI\u201d) is one of a number of phospholipids found in cell membranes. In recent years it has become clear that PI plays an important role in intracellular signal transduction. Cell signaling via 3\u2032-phosphorylated phosphoinositides has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, e.g., malignant transformation, growth factor signaling, inflammation, and immunity (Rameh et al (1999) J. Biol Chem, 274:8347-8350). The enzyme responsible for generating these phosphorylated signaling products, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (also referred to as PI 3-kinase or PI3K), was originally identified as an activity associated with viral oncoproteins and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at the 3\u2032-hydroxyl of the inositol ring (Panayotou et al (1992) Trends Cell Biol 2:358-60).","Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) are lipid kinases that phosphorylate lipids at the 3-hydroxyl residue of an inositol ring (Whitman et al (1988) Nature, 332:664). The 3-phosphorylated phospholipids (PIP3s) generated by PI3-kinases act as second messengers recruiting kinases with lipid binding domains (including plekstrin homology (PH) regions), such as Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Binding of Akt to membrane PIP3s causes the translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane, bringing Akt into contact with PDK1, which is responsible for activating Akt. The tumor-suppressor phosphatase, PTEN, dephosphorylates PIP3 and therefore acts as a negative regulator of Akt activation. The PI3-kinases Akt and PDK1 are important in the regulation of many cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, proliferation, survival, apoptosis and motility and are significant components of the molecular mechanisms of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and immune inflammation (Vivanco et al (2002) Nature Rev. Cancer 2:489; Phillips et al (1998) Cancer 83:41).","The main PI3-kinase isoform in cancer is the Class I PI3-kinase, p110 \u03b1 (alpha) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,492; U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,824; U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,327). Other isoforms are implicated in cardiovascular and immune-inflammatory disease (Workman P (2004) Biochem Soc Trans 32:393-396; Patel et al (2004) Proceedings of the American Association of Cancer Research (Abstract LB-247) 95th Annual Meeting, March 27-31, Orlando, Fla., USA; Ahmadi K and Waterfield Md. (2004) Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry (Lennarz W J, Lane M D eds) Elsevier\/Academic Press).","The PI3 kinase\/Akt\/PTEN pathway is an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would be expected to inhibit proliferation, reverse the repression of apoptosis and surmount resistance to cytotoxic agents in cancer cells. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been reported (Folkes et al (2008) J. Med. Chem. 51:5522-5532; Yaguchi et al (2006) Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 98(8):545-556; U.S. Pat. No. 7,173,029; U.S. Pat.

Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. E.g., proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate \u201cmesylate\u201d, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1\u2032-methylene-bis(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound.

possible by a number of direct and indirect detection methods. Certain exemplary compounds described herein were assayed for their p110\u03b1 (alpha), and other isoform, PI3K binding activity (Example 601) and in vitro activity against tumor cells (Example 602). Certain exemplary compounds of the invention had PI3K binding activity ICvalues less than 10 nM. Certain compounds of the invention had tumor cell-based activity ICvalues less than 100 nM.","The cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of Formula I exemplary compounds was measured by: establishing a proliferating mammalian tumor cell line in a cell culture medium, adding a Formula I compound, culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability (Example 602). Cell-based in vitro assays were used to measure viability, i.e. proliferation (IC), cytotoxicity (EC), and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation).","The in vitro potency of Formula I exemplary compounds was measured by the cell proliferation assay, CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, commercially available from Promega Corp., Madison, Wis. (Example 602). This homogeneous assay method is based on the recombinant expression of luciferase (U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,024; U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,713; U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,670) and determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88; U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677). The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay was conducted in 96 or 384 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) Anti Cancer Drugs 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells\/well in a 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing.","The homogeneous \u201cadd-mix-measure\u201d format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay generates a \u201cglow-type\u201d luminescent signal, produced by the luciferase reaction, which has a half-life generally greater than five hours, depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). The substrate, Beetle Luciferin, is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. The extended half-life eliminates the need to use reagent injectors and provides flexibility for continuous or batch mode processing of multiple plates. This cell proliferation assay can be used with various multiwell formats, e.g. 96 or 384 well format. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as relative light units (RLU), measured over time.","The anti-proliferative effects of Formula I exemplary compounds were measured by the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay (Example 602) against several tumor cell lines. Potency ECvalues were established for the tested compounds. The range of in vitro cell potency activities was about 100 nM to about 10 \u03bcM. Certain tested compounds had ECvalues of less than 1 micromolar (1 \u03bcM) in stopping proliferation of certain tumor cell lines.","Certain ADME properties were measured for certain exemplary compounds by assays including: Caco-2 Permeability (Example 603), Hepatocyte Clearance (Example 604), Cytochrome P450 Inhibition (Example 605), Cytochrome P450 Induction (Example 606), Plasma Protein Binding (Example 607), and hERG channel blockage (Example 608).","Certain exemplary compounds were tested for efficacy by a dose escalation studies by administration in tumor xenograft Taconic nude mouse models (Example 609). The breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-361.1 mouse model was administered certain exemplary Formula I compounds along with Vehicle (MCT, negative control). The tumor growth delay was measured when dosed orally daily for 21 days at 50 and 100 mg\/kg. Body weight change over the course of treatment was measured as an indicator of safety. Treatment of the MDA-MB-361.1 mouse model with certain exemplary Formula I compounds caused tumor growth stasis, inhibition, or regression when dosed orally daily for 21 days.","Exemplary Formula I compounds Nos. 101-512 in Table 1 and Nos. 513-548 in Table 2, were made, characterized, and tested for inhibition of PI3K alpha (ICp110 alpha less than 1 micromolar, \u03bcM) and selectivity according to the methods of this invention, and have the following structures and corresponding names (ChemDraw Ultra, Version 9.0.1, CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge Mass.).

administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary and intranasal. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be administered by intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with e.g. the condition of the recipient. Where the compound is administered orally, it may be formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Where the compound is administered parenterally, it may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form, as detailed below.","A dose to treat human patients may range from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of Formula I compound. A typical dose may be about 100 mg to about 300 mg of the compound. A dose may be administered once a day (QID), twice per day (BID), or more frequently, depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors may influence the dosage and administration regimen. When administered orally, the pill, capsule, or tablet may be ingested daily or less frequently for a specified period of time. The regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy.","Methods of Treatment with Formula I Compounds","Compounds of the present invention are useful for treating hyperproliferative diseases, conditions and\/or disorders including, but not limited to, those characterized by over expression of lipid kinases, e.g. PI3 kinase. Accordingly, another aspect of this invention includes methods of treating or preventing diseases or conditions that can be treated or prevented by inhibiting lipid kinases, including PI3. In one embodiment, the method comprises administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In one embodiment, a human patient is treated with a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle, wherein said compound of Formula I is present in an amount to detectably inhibit PI3 kinase activity.","Cancers which can be treated according to the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, breast, ovary, cervix, prostate, testis, genitourinary tract, esophagus, larynx, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, stomach, skin, keratoacanthoma, lung, epidermoid carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), small cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, bone, colon, adenoma, pancreas, adenocarcinoma, thyroid, follicular carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, seminoma, melanoma, sarcoma, bladder carcinoma, liver carcinoma and biliary passages, kidney carcinoma, myeloid disorders, lymphoid disorders, hairy cells, buccal cavity and pharynx (oral), lip, tongue, mouth, pharynx, small intestine, colon-rectum, large intestine, rectum, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin's and leukemia.","Another aspect of this invention provides a compound of this invention for use in the treatment of the diseases or conditions described herein in a mammal, e.g., a human, suffering from such disease or condition. Also provided is the use of a compound of this invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of the diseases and conditions described herein in a warm-blooded animal, such as a mammal, e.g. a human, suffering from such disorder.","Pharmaceutical Formulations","In order to use a Formula I compound for the therapeutic treatment (including prophylactic treatment) of mammals including humans, it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.","A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a Formula I compound and a carrier, diluent or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and\/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).","The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. E.g., the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the Formula I compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.","The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.","Pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared for various routes and types of administration. E.g., a compound of Formula I having the desired degree of purity may optionally be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous solution. Formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may range from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.","The compound of this invention for use herein is preferably sterile. In particular, formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. Such sterilization is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","The compound ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprising a Formula I compound will be formulated, dosed and administered in a fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the coagulation factor mediated disorder. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host or renders the host significantly more susceptible to bleeding.","As a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the inhibitor administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg\/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20 mg\/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg\/kg\/day.","Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, e.g., by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, e.g., hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (e.g., liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations of Formula I compounds may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula I, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Formulations of a compound of Formula I suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of Formula I.","Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.","Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared for oral use. Formulations of compounds of Formula I intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, e.g., inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. E.g., a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.","For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, e.g., 0.075 to 20% w\/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.","If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs.","The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween\u00ae 60, Span\u00ae 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.","Aqueous suspensions of Formula I compounds contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","The pharmaceutical compositions of compounds of Formula I may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. E.g., a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. E.g., an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 \u03bcg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL\/hr can occur.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.","Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w\/w, e.g. about 0.5 to 10% w\/w, e.g. about 1.5% w\/w.","Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.","Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising e.g. cocoa butter or a salicylate.","Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size e.g. in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis disorders as described below.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, e.g. sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, e.g. water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.","Combination Therapy","The compounds of Formula I may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula I is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound that has anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of Formula I such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment, a composition of this invention comprises a compound of Formula I, in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent such as described herein.","The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.","The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes, separate pills or capsules, or separate infusions. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","In a particular embodiment of anti-cancer therapy, a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, may be combined with other chemotherapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents such as those described herein, as well as combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound(s) of Formula I and the other pharmaceutically active chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.","Metabolites of Formula I Compounds","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of Formula I described herein. Such products may result e.g. from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of Formula I, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., C or H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, may be useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.","Articles of Manufacture","In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or \u201ckit\u201d, containing materials useful for the treatment of the diseases and disorders described above is provided. The kit comprises a container comprising a compound of Formula I. The kit may further comprise a label or package insert, on or associated with the container. The term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. Suitable containers include, e.g., bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container may hold a compound of Formula I or II or a formulation thereof which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (e.g., the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a compound of Formula I. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. In addition, the label or package insert may indicate that the patient to be treated is one having a disorder such as a hyperproliferative disorder, neurodegeneration, cardiac hypertrophy, pain, migraine or a neurotraumatic disease or event. In one embodiment, the label or package inserts indicates that the composition comprising a compound of Formula I can be used to treat a disorder resulting from abnormal cell growth. The label or package insert may also indicate that the composition can be used to treat other disorders. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","The kit may further comprise directions for the administration of the compound of Formula I and, if present, the second pharmaceutical formulation. E.g., if the kit comprises a first composition comprising a compound of Formula I, and a second pharmaceutical formulation, the kit may further comprise directions for the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the first and second pharmaceutical compositions to a patient in need thereof.","In another embodiment, the kits are suitable for the delivery of solid oral forms of a compound of Formula I or II, such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number of unit dosages. Such kits can include a card having the dosages oriented in the order of their intended use. An example of such a kit is a \u201cblister pack\u201d. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are widely used for packaging pharmaceutical unit dosage forms. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, e.g. in the form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered.","According to one embodiment, a kit may comprise (a) a first container with a compound of Formula I contained therein; and optionally (b) a second container with a second pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second pharmaceutical formulation comprises a second compound with anti-hyperproliferative activity. Alternatively, or additionally, the kit may further comprise a third container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","In certain other embodiments wherein the kit comprises a composition of Formula I and a second therapeutic agent, the kit may comprise a container for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet, however, the separate compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically, the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.","Preparation of Formula I Compounds","Benzoxepin compounds of Formula I may be synthesized by synthetic routes that include processes analogous to those well-known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wis.) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, , v. 1-23, Wiley, N.Y. (1967-2006 ed.), or 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database).","In certain embodiments, compounds of Formula I may be readily prepared using well-known procedures to prepare benzoxepin compounds (Sekhar et al (1989) Sulfur Letters 9(6):271-277; Katsura et al (2000 J. Med. Chem. 43:3315-3321; Rueeger et al (2004) Biorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 14:2451-2457; Reiter et al (2007) Biorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 17:5447-5454; Banaszak et al (2006) Tetrahedron Letters 47:6235-6238) and other heterocycles, which are described in: Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II, Editors Katritzky and Rees, Elsevier, 1997, e.g. Volume 3; Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, (9):1910-16, (1985); Helvetica Chimica Acta, 41:1052-60, (1958); Arzneimittel-Forschung, 40(12):1328-31, (1990).","Compounds of Formula I may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2, e.g. 5 to 1,000 compounds, or 10 to 100 compounds. Libraries of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a combinatorial \u2018split and mix\u2019 approach or by multiple parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry, by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.","For illustrative purposes, the General Procedures show general methods which may be applied for preparation of Formula I compounds, as well as key intermediates. The Figures and Examples sections contain more detailed description of individual reaction steps. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although certain starting materials and routes are depicted in the Schemes, General Procedures and Examples, other similar starting materials and routes can be substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and\/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art.","In preparing compounds of Formulas I, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, Third Ed., 1999.","Methods of Separation","In the methods of preparing the compounds of this invention, it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, e.g.: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.","Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid\/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like.","Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. E.g., boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr., 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: \u201cDrug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology,\u201d Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. J. Org. Chem. (1982) 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (\u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography\u201d (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, J. Chromatogr., (1990) 513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","General Preparative Procedures","General Procedure A",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0272","num":"0270"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00461","num":"00461"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00461","he":"80.69mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US09175009-20151103-C00461.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Benzoxepin intermediates, 4,5-dihydrobenzo[b]thieno[2,3-d]oxepine-2-carboxylate esters, A-1 can be selectively brominated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in DMF to give 9-bromo-4,5-dihydrobenzo[b]thieno[2,3-d]oxepine-2-carboxylate esters A-2.","General Procedure B",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0275","num":"0273"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00462","num":"00462"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00462","he":"143.51mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US09175009-20151103-C00462.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Benzoxepin carboxylic acid intermediates B-1 are converted to the acid chloride B-2 and reacted with primary or secondary amines with triethylamine, DMAP, and solvent such as dichloromethane.

Alamar Blue\u2122 was subsequently added to the assay medium, and cells were incubated for 6 hr before reading at 544 nm excitation, 590 nm emission. ECvalues were calculated using a sigmoidal dose response curve fit. The term ECrefers to the half maximal effective concentration and is the concentration at which a drug induces a response halfway between the baseline and maximum after some specified exposure time. It is commonly used as a measure of drug potency.","The anti-proliferative effects of Formula I exemplary compounds were measured by the CellTiterGlo\u00ae Assay against various tumor cell lines, including the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1152","num":"1150"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},"EC50","EC50","EC50","EC50","EC50"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Mutation","(\u03bcmole)","(\u03bcmole)","(\u03bcmole)","(\u03bcmole)","(\u03bcmole)"]},{"entry":["Cell line","Tissue Type","Status","127","193","375","440","463"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["AU565","Breast","WT","0.037","0.493","0.241","1.235","0.225"]},{"entry":["BT474","Breast","PI3K(amped",{},{},"0.428","1.634","0.638"]},{"entry":["CAL120","Breast","WT",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["CAL51","Breast","PI3K\/PTEN",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["EFM19-2A","Breast","WT",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["EVSA-T","Breast","PTEN","0.147","2.741","0.225","4.932","0.746"]},{"entry":["HCC1954","Breast","PI3K",{},{},"0.348","1.616","0.340"]},{"entry":["KPL4","Breast","PI3K",{},{},"0.151","0.338","0.103"]},{"entry":["MCF7","Breast","PI3K",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["MDA-MB-231","Breast","K-RAS",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["MDA-MB-","Breast","PI3K","0.060","0.943","1.088","2.606","0.855"]},{"entry":["361.1",{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["MFM223","Breast","PI3K",{},{},"0.739","4.414","0.559"]},{"entry":["SKBR3","Breast","WT",{},{},{},"1.728",{}]},{"entry":["T47D","Breast","PI3K",{},{},"0.145","0.569","0.185"]},{"entry":["Colo205","Colon","B-Raf",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["HCT116","Colon","PI3K\/KRAS",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["KM12","Colon","PTEN",{},{},"1.749",{},"0.321"]},{"entry":["MDST8","Colon","PTEN",{},{},"1.738",{},"1.721"]},{"entry":["RKO","Colon","PI3K",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["LN229","Glioma","PI3K",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["U87MG","Glioma","PTEN",{},{},"0.858",{},"2.093"]},{"entry":["H1703","Lung(NSCLC)","WT",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["H2122","Lung(NSCLC)","K-RAS",{},{},"1.174","10","0.542"]},{"entry":["H520","Lung(NSCLC)","PTEN",{},{},"0.226",{},"0.972"]},{"entry":["537MEL","Melanoma","PTEN",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["A2058","Melanoma","PTEN",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["A375","Melanoma","B-Raf",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["IGROV1","Ovarian","PI3K",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["TOV21GX1","Ovarian ","PI3K\/PTEN",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["PC3","Prostate ","PTEN",{},{},"0.145","3.029","0.185"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Caco-2 cells are seeded onto Millipore Multiscreen plates at 1\u00d710cells\/cm, and cultured for 20 days. Assessment of compound permeability is subsequently conducted. The compounds are applied to the apical surface (A) of cell monolayers and compound permeation into the basolateral (B) compartment was measured. This is performed in the reverse direction (B-A) to investigate active transport. A permeability coefficient value, P, for each compound, a measure of the rate of permeation of the compound across the membrane, is calculated. Compounds are grouped into low (P<\/=1.0\u00d710cm\/s) or high (P>\/=1.0\u00d710cm\/s) absorption potential based on comparison with control compounds with established human absorption.","For assessment of a compound's ability to undergo active efflux, the ratio of basolateral (B) to apical (A) transport compared with A to B was determined. Values of B\u2212A\/A\u2212B>\/=1.0 indicate the occurrence of active cellular efflux.","Suspensions of cryopreserved human hepatocytes are used. Incubations are performed at compound concentration of 1 mM or 3 \u03bcM at a cell density of 0.5\u00d710viable cells\/mL. The final DMSO concentration in the incubation is about 0.25%. Control incubations are also performed in the absence of cells to reveal any non-enzymatic degradation. Duplicate samples (50 \u03bcL) are removed from the incubation mixture at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes (control sample at 60 minutes only) and added to methanol containing internal standard (100 \u03bcL)\u2014to terminate the reaction. Tolbutamide, 7-hydroxycoumarin, and testosterone may be used as control compounds. Samples are centrifuged and the supernatants at each time point pooled for analysis by LC-MSMS. From a plot of ln peak area ratio (parent compound peak area\/internal standard peak area) against time, intrinsic clearance (CL) is calculated as follows: CL(\u03bcl\/min\/million cells)=V\u00d7k, where k is the elimination rate constant, obtained from the gradient of ln concentration plotted against time; V is a volume term derived from the incubation volume and is expressed as uL 10cells.","Formula I compounds may be screened against CYP450 targets (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4) at about 10 concentrations in duplicate, with a top concentration of about 100 uM. Standard inhibitors (furafylline, sulfaphenazole, tranylcypromine, quinidine, ketoconazole) may be used as controls. Plates may be read using a BMG LabTechnologies PolarStar in fluorescence mode.","Freshly isolated human hepatocytes from a single donor may be cultured for about 48 hr prior to addition of Formula I compound at three concentrations and incubated for 72 hr. Probe substrates for CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are added for 30 minutes and 1 hr before the end of the incubation. At 72 hr, cells and media are removed and the extent of metabolism of each probe substrate quantified by LC-MS\/MS. The experiment is controlled by using inducers of the individual P450s incubated at one concentration in triplicate.","Solutions of Formula I compound (Sum, 0.5% final DMSO concentration) are prepared in buffer and 10% plasma (v\/v in buffer). A 96 well HT dialysis plate is assembled so that each well is divided in two by a semi-permeable cellulose membrane. The buffer solution is added to one side of the membrane and the plasma solution to the other side; incubations are then conducted at 37\u00b0 C. over 2 hr in triplicate. The cells are subsequently emptied, and the solutions for each batch of compounds are combined into two groups (plasma-free and plasma-containing) then analyzed by LC-MSMS using two sets of calibration standards for plasma-free (6 points) and plasma-containing solutions (7 points). The fraction unbound value for the compound is calculated.","Formula I compounds are evaluated for ability to modulate rubidium efflux from HEK-294 cells stably expressing hERG potassium channels using established flux methodology. Cells are prepared in medium containing RbCl, plated into 96-well plates and grown overnight to form monolayers. The efflux experiment is initiated by aspirating the media and washing each well with 3\u00d7100 \u03bcL of pre-incubation buffer (containing low [K]) at room temperature. Following the final aspiration, 50 \u03bcL of working stock (2\u00d7) compound is added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Stimulation buffer 50 \u03bcL (containing high [K+]) is then added to each well giving the final test compound concentrations. Cell plates are then incubated at room temperature for a further 10 minutes. Supernatant 80 \u03bcL from each well is then transferred to equivalent wells of a 96-well plate and analyzed via atomic emission spectroscopy. The compound is screened as 10 pt duplicate ICcurves, n=2, from a top concentration of 100 \u03bcM.","Animals suitable for transgenic experiments can be obtained from standard commercial sources. Groups of Taconic nude mice (were implanted subcutaneously in the hind flank with MDA-MB-361.1 (PI3K mutant) breast cancer cells. Mouse xenografts were dosed daily for 21 days with drug or vehicle. Tumor sizes were recorded twice weekly over the course of the study. Mouse body weights were also recorded twice weekly, and the mice were observed regularly. Tumor volume was measured in two dimensions (length and width) using Ultra Cal-IV calipers (Model 54-10-111; Fred V. Fowler Co., Inc.; Newton, Mass.) and analyzed using Excel v.11.2 (Microsoft Corporation; Redmond, Wash.). Tumor inhibition graphs were plotted using KaleidaGraph, Version 3.6 (Synergy Software; Reading, Pa.). The tumor volume was calculated with formula: Tumor size (mm)=(longer measurement\u00d7shorter measurement)\u00d70.5","Animal body weights were measured using an Adventurera Pro AV812 scale (Ohaus Corporation; Pine Brook, N.J.). Graphs were generated using KaleidaGraph Version 3.6. Percent weight change was calculated using formula: Group percent weight change=(1\u2212(initial weight\/new weight))\u00d7100.","Mice whose tumor volume exceeded 2000 mmor whose body weight loss was >20% of their starting weight were promptly euthanized according to regulatory guidance.","The percent tumor growth inhibition (% INH) at the end of study (EOS) was calculated using formula: % INH=100\u00d7(EOS mean volume of tumors in animals given vehicle\u2212EOS mean volume of tumors in animals given the drug)\/EOS mean volume of tumors in animals given vehicle.","Tumor incidence (TI) was determined based on the number of measurable tumors remaining in each group at the end of the study. A partial response (PR) was defined as a >50% but <100% reduction in tumor volume, compared with the starting tumor volume, observed on any day of the study. A complete response (CR) was defined as a 100% reduction in tumor volume, compared with the initial tumor volume, observed on any day of the study. Data were analyzed and p-values were determined using the Dunnett's test with JMP statistical software, version 5.1.2 (SAS Institute; Cary, N.C.). Individual tumor volumes at end of study and mean tumor volume\u00b1SEM values were calculated using JMP statistical software, version 5.1.2. Body weight data were graphed based on the mean percentage of change from initial body weights\u00b1SEM.","In a 6-well tissue culture plate cells were seeded at 5\u00d710cells per well overnight. Cells were treated with an ECof the Formula I compound. Following treatment, cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in 1\u00d7 Cell Extraction Buffer from Biosource (Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mM PMSF, and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 1 and 2 from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.).
