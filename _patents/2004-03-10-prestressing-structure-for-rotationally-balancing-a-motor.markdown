{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a prestressing structure for rotationally balancing a motor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a motor rotor and a motor stator employing a balancing magnet and a magnetically conductive member to generate a prestressing force therebetween so that rotary balance of the motor is maintained.","2. Description of the Related Art","Referring initially to , Taiwanese Patent Publication No. 383818, entitled \u201cHEAT DISSIPATION FAN STRUCTURE HAVING A MAGNETICALLY POSITIONING DEVICE,\u201d discloses a conventional rotational balance structure for a motor. The motor includes a motor stator , an axial tube , a motor rotor  and a magnetically conductive metal plate . The motor stator  employs the axial tube  to mount on a hub base , and provides with a plurality of pole plates . The axial tube  accommodates a bearing member  that allows a rotary member. The motor rotor  consists of an axial shaft  and an annular magnet . In assembling, the axial shaft  of the motor rotor  extends through an elongated hole of the axial tube  and the annular magnet  of the motor rotor  corresponds pole faces of the pole plates  of the motor stator . The magnetically conductive metal plate  is attached to an inner surface of the motor rotor  in proper and combined therewith. Meanwhile, the magnetically conductive metal plate  has an outer circumference corresponding to top portions of the pole plates  of the motor stator . When the motor is operated, the pole plates  of the motor stator  magnetize the magnetically conductive metal plate  that may maintains rotary balance of the motor rotor . Consequently, it reduces operational vibration the motor and abrasion of the bearing member  that may increase the useful life of the motor.","However, there exist several drawbacks as follows:","1. The magnetically conductive metal plate  may result in reduction of excitation efficiency of the pole plates  due to magnetic loss of the magnetically conductive metal plate  with respect to the motor rotor .","2. The mass of the magnetically conductive metal plate  may also result in a heavy burden of the motor rotor  that may result in reduction of motor speed.","3. In starting the motor, the magnetically conductive metal plate  fails to provide with an attractive force on the motor stator  a short period for balancing rotary movement of the motor rotor . Consequently, it may result in abrasion of the bearing member  in long-term use.","Other Examples of such a rotational balance structure for a motor are illustrated by U.S. Pat. No. 6,097,120 to Homg, entitled \u201cBRUSHLESS DC MOTOR ASSEMBLY,\u201d Taiwanese Patent Publication No. 422365, entitled \u201cHEAT DISSIPATION FAN STRUCTURE HAVING A MAGNETICALLY POSITIONING DEVICE,\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/366,636, entitled \u201cPOSITIONING STRUCTURES FOR A MOTOR ROTOR.\u201d In these patents, a magnetically conductive metal plate is mounted on a bottom portion of a motor stator and corresponding to an annular magnet of a motor rotor. An attractive force between the magnetically conductive metal plate and the annular magnet maintains rotational balance of the motor when operated. However, the magnetically conductive metal plate may result in reduction of excitation efficiency of pole plates of the motor stator which is in connection with the magnetically conductive metal plate. Moreover, the magnetically conductive metal plate may result in a short circuit of a printed circuit board which is in connection with the magnetically conductive metal plate.","Another conventional rotational balance structure for a motor, U.S. Pat. No. 6,483,209 to Homg et al., entitled \u201cBALANCE RINGS FOR MOTORS,\u201d it discloses a magnetically conductive metal plate mounted on a bottom portion of a motor stator. The magnetically conductive metal plate includes at least one upright wall corresponding to an annular magnet of a motor rotor. An attractive force between the upright wall of the magnetically conductive metal plate and the annular magnet maintains rotational balance of the motor when operated. However, the upright wall of the magnetically conductive metal plate may occupy a partial space for distributing blades of the motor rotor when the upright wall of the magnetically conductive metal plate is corresponding to an outer end circumference of the annular magnet. Alternatively, the upright wall of the magnetically conductive metal plate may result in reduction of excitation efficiency of pole plates of the motor stator when the upright wall of the magnetically conductive metal plate is corresponding to an inner circumference of the annular magnet. Consequently, the upright wall of the magnetically conductive metal plate may increase a total radius of the motor that may increase its dimensions of the motor.","Another conventional rotational balance structure for a motor, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/304,761, entitled \u201cPOSITIONING DEVICE FOR PRESTRESSING MAGNET OF SPINDLE MOTOR,\u201d it discloses positioning means for mounting a prestressing magnet on a pole plate of motor stator in proper. The prestressing magnet attracts a metal casing of a motor rotor that balances rotary movement of the motor. However, the prestressing magnet is disposed proximate the pole plate of motor stator that may result in reduction of excitation efficiency of pole plate of the motor stator.","Another conventional rotational balance structure for a motor, U.S. Pat. No. 6,448,675 to Homg et al., entitled \u201cROTATIONALLY BALACING STRUCTURE FOR AN AC MOTOR,\u201d it discloses an inner rotor type ac motor. The motor includes a balance plate and a permanent magnet ring each of which selectively mounted to distal ends of an outer stator and an inner rotor. An attractive force between the balance plate and the permanent magnet ring maintains rotational balance of the motor when operated. However, the prestressing magnet is disposed proximate the pole plate of motor stator that may result in reduction of excitation efficiency of pole plate of the motor stator.","The present invention intends to provide a motor rotor and a motor stator employing a balancing magnet and a magnetically conductive member to generate a prestressing force therebetween. The balancing magnet and the magnetically conductive member provide with an appropriate prestrssing force for balancing rotary movement and minimize a gap formed therebetween for prevent dust from entering therethrough. The positions of the balancing magnet and the magnetically conductive member are separated from pole plates of the motor stator to avoid magnetic loss in such a way to mitigate and overcome the above problem.","The primary objective of this invention is to provide a prestressing structure for rotationally balancing a motor, which includes a motor rotor and a motor stator employing a balancing magnet and a magnetically conductive member to generate a prestressing force therebetween so that rotary balance of the motor is maintained.","The secondary objective of this invention is to provide the prestressing structure for rotationally balancing the motor, which includes a shaft seat of a motor rotor mounting a balancing magnet and a motor stator mounting a magnetically conductive member to minimize a gap therebetween so that foreign dust is obstructed.","The prestressing structure for rotationally balancing the motor in accordance with the present invention includes a motor stator, a motor rotor, a magnetically conductive member and a balancing magnet. The motor stator has an axial hole and an axial tube extending therethrough. An end of the axial tube provides with the magnetically conductive member. The motor rotor has an inner surface and a shaft seat mounted thereon. A top portion of the shaft seat provides with the balancing magnet which has at least one surface successively attracting at least one surface of the magnetically conductive member for stabilizing rotary movement of the motor.","Other objectives, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.","Referring to , reference numerals of the first through sixth embodiments of the present invention have applied the identical numerals of the conventional motor members, as shown in . The construction of motor members in accordance with embodiments of the present invention have similar configuration and same function as that of the conventional motor members and detailed descriptions may be omitted.","Referring to , a prestressing structure for rotationally balancing a motor in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention includes a motor stator , a magnetically conductive member , a motor rotor  and a balancing magnet .","Referring again to , construction of the motor stator  shall be described in detail. The motor stator  consists of at least one pole plate  and at least one coil . The pole plate  of the motor stator  may be alternatively magnetized when a current and a counter current pass through the coil  in turn. The motor stator  further has an axial hole (not labeled) and an axial tube  extending therethrough.","Referring again to , construction of the axial tube  shall be described in detail. The motor stator  employs the axial tube  for connecting to a motor member, a casing for example. Preferably, the axial tube  is made of magnetically conductive material and integrally formed a radial flange at its top end to constitute the magnetically conductive member . The radial flange of the axial tube  is used to mount the motor stator .","Referring again to , construction of the motor rotor  shall be described in detail. The motor rotor  consists of a rotary shaft , an annular magnet  and a shaft seat .

Moreover, the shaft seat  forms a stepped portion  adapted to engage or adhere with the balancing magnet . The rotary shaft  longitudinally projects downwardly from the shaft seat  and extends through a bearing member (sleeve bearing or ball bearing)  contained in the axial tube  after assembling. The annular magnet  surrounds pole faces (not labeled) of the pole plate  of the motor stator  so that the alternatively magnetized pole plate  is able to drive the motor rotor  for rotation.","Referring again to , assembling operation of the motor with the balancing magnet  shall be described in detail. The balancing magnet  is fixed on the stepped portion  of the shaft seat  of the motor rotor  in proper. Correspondingly, the magnetically conductive member  is provided on the top end of the axial tube  that faces the balancing magnet . Whenever the motor is operated, stopped or restarted, the balancing magnet  has at least one lower surface successively attracting an upper surface of the magnetically conductive member  that balances and thus stabilizes rotary movement of the motor properly. Preferably, dimensions of the balancing magnet  can be selectively adjusted and sized that avoids an additional burden of the balancing magnet  on the motor rotor . Consequently, the rotational efficiency of the motor rotor  is unaffected. Moreover, the balancing magnet  is a permanent magnet that can successively attract the magnetically conductive member  when the motor rotor  is in a stopped state. Consequently, an initially rotational movement of the motor rotor  can avoid a short period of unbalance during restarting operation. Furthermore, a gap extending between the balancing magnet  and the magnetically conductive member  can be adjusted its distance obviously smaller than that extending between an inner surface of the motor rotor  and a top surface of the motor stator .
