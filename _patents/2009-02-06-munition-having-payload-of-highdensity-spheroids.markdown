{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61\/060,148, filed Jun. 10, 2008, which application is hereby incorporated by reference.","The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to anti-personnel ammunition.","The Multi-Role, Anti Armor Weapon System (MAAWS) Area Deterrent Munition (ADM) 401 is an 84 mm shoulder-fired munition (round) for use with the recoilless M3 (Carl-Gustaf) weapon system. The MAAWS ADM 401 was developed by SAAB Bofors Dynamics. The MAAWS ADM 401 is an anti-personnel round containing a payload of flechettes.","The known ADM 401 round includes a canister filled with flechettes. The flechettes have a limited range and are typically used at engagement distances of 50-100 meters. It has been observed that a large number of the flechettes may become embedded in the separation plate upon launch of the round. The separation plate full of flechettes then flies downrange and may overshoot the target completely. Because the separation plate may be embedded with up to \u2153 of the total number of flechettes per round; the embedded flechettes significantly limit the potential of the round. Thus, there is a need to increase the engagement distance and lethality of the ADM 401 anti-personnel round.","It is an object of the invention to provide a munition with increased lethality, compared to the MAAWS ADM 401 munition.","It is another object of the invention to provide a payload that may be used with the canister and cartridge case of the MAAWS ADM 401 munition.","One aspect of the invention is a munition round comprising a cartridge case and a canister disposed at a forward end of the cartridge case. The canister may include a piston movable in the canister. The munition round may further comprise a plurality of high-density spheroids having a diameter in a range of about 0.25 inches to about 0.5 inches; a rear container disposed in the canister adjacent the piston and fully loaded with the high-density spheroids; and a front container disposed in the canister and partially loaded with the high-density spheroids. The remaining volume of the front container may be occupied by a spacer disc disposed atop the high-density spheroids. A cap may close a forward end of the canister.","Another aspect of the invention is a method of loading a canister comprising providing a rear container, a front container, a separation plate, and a spacer disc; weighing the rear container, the front container, the separation plate, and the spacer disc; and determining a weight of spheroids to be loaded in the canister by subtracting a combined weight of the rear container, the front container, the separation plate, and the spacer disc, from a fixed weight.","A further aspect of the invention is a payload comprising a canister, the canister including a piston movable therein; a plurality of high-density spheroids having a diameter in a range of about 0.25 inches to about 0.5 inches; a rear container disposed in the canister adjacent the piston, and fully loaded with the high-density spheroids; a front container disposed in the canister and partially loaded with the high-density spheroids, a remaining volume of the front container occupied by a spacer disc disposed atop the high-density spheroids; and a cap that closes a forward end of the canister.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","A munition or round intended for area denial may spread approximately 300 generally spherical objects (spheroids) against the target area. The spheroids may be disposed in a canister and arranged in two layers above a moving plunger. The moving plunger may expel the spheroids out of the canister during flight. A cushioning material, for example, felt, may be disposed forward of the spheroids. The cushioning material may occupy the space between the spheroids and the canister. The round may closely match the flight trajectory of the MAAWS ADM 401 round.","The novel round may have increased kinetic energy, compared to the ADM 401 round. The increased kinetic energy may be due to the high-density spheroids that do not become imbedded in the separation plate upon launch. The increased kinetic energy may result in a greater range for the payload, which may increase the maximum engagement distance. The increase in maximum engagement distance may allow soldiers to fire the round at increased ranges, without unnecessarily putting themselves in danger. That is, the soldiers need not wait until the target is within 50-100 meters to fire.","Comparative testing of the flechette and spheroid payloads showed that, at 100 meters, the flechettes had a velocity of 125 meter\/second and the spheroids had a velocity of 163 meter\/second. Although the total number of spheroids per round was approximately \u2153 of the total number of flechettes per round, there were a similar number of penetrations for both spheroid payloads and flechette payloads. About half of all total spheroid hits resulted in a penetration, while about one third of all flechette hits resulted in a penetration. The spheroid payload has a longer range and more penetrations per hit than the flechette payload.","Previous attempts to substitute spheroids for the flechettes in the ADM 401 round were not successful. Numerous configurations, materials, and sizes of spheroids, as well as cushioning material, have been attempted. The spheroid payload must use the known ADM 401 round propulsion system. Therefore, the weight and center of gravity of the spheroid payload round must be similar to the weight and center of gravity of the flechette payload round. Because high-density spheroids are denser than flechettes, there is excess space in the canister when using spheroids as the payload. Previous attempts often failed due to, the placement of the filler material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","12","16","12","12","14","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["16","16","26","16","28","12","10","12","30","16","28","16","30","26"]},"Disposed adjacent piston  is a rear container , and disposed adjacent rear container  is a front container .

High-density means a density in the range of metal densities, for example, about 3000 to about 20,000 kg\/m. Preferably, the density of the spheroids  is in the range of stainless steel, for example, about 6500 to about 9000 kg\/m, and more preferably, the density of the spheroids  is about 7400 to about 8000 kg\/m.

Separation plate  may include a generally centrally located opening  therein to allow pressure equalization between the areas on opposite sides of the separation plate . Separation plate  may be made of, for example, aluminum.","The quantity of high-density spheroids  required in a round  may be determined by first weighing the front and rear containers ,  (each container ,  including a support disc ), the spacer disc , and the separation plate . Then, enough high-density spheroids  are added such that the combined weight of the front and rear containers ,  (each container ,  including a support disc ), the spacer disc , the separation plate , and the plurality of high-density spheroids  is preferably about 1.2 kilograms, plus or minus about 10 grams.","If the spheroids  are made of stainless steel and have a diameter of about 0.375 inches, the number of spheroids  is about 300. An important criterion is the combined weight of the components. The combined weight is preferably about 1.2 kilograms, plus or minus about 10 grams.
