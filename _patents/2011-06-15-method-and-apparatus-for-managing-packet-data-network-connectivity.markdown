title: Method and apparatus for managing packet data network connectivity
abstract: Methods and apparatuses are provided for managing packet data network (PDN) connectivity for a device. PDN connectivity to a local gateway can be managed at an access point with which the device is communicating based at least in part on received PDN connectivity parameters. The PDN connectivity parameters can include access points, related closed subscriber groups, public land mobile networks, etc., from which a device can request a PDN connection. The PDN connectivity parameters can be specific for the device and/or for one or more access point names. In addition, a subscription server or other core network device can communicate the PDN connectivity parameters to the device and/or the device can receive PDN connectivity parameters as a result of a failed PDN connection attempt to an access point.

Field","The following description relates generally to wireless network communications, and more particularly to managing packet data network connectivity.","2. Background","Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as, for example, voice, data, and so on. Typical wireless communication systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, . . . ). Examples of such multiple-access systems may include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like. Additionally, the systems can conform to specifications such as third generation partnership project (3GPP), 3GPP long term evolution (LTE), ultra mobile broadband (UMB), evolution data optimized (EV-DO), etc.","Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems may simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device may communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations may be established via single-input single-output (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth. In addition, mobile devices can communicate with other mobile devices (and\/or base stations with other base stations) in peer-to-peer wireless network configurations.","To supplement conventional base stations, additional base stations can be deployed to provide more robust wireless coverage to mobile devices. For example, wireless relay stations and low power base stations (e.g., which can be commonly referred to as Home NodeBs or Home eNBs, collectively referred to as H(e)NB, femto access points, femtocells, picocells, microcells, etc.) can be deployed for incremental capacity growth, richer user experience, in-building or other specific geographic coverage, and\/or the like. In some configurations, such low power base stations are connected to the Internet and the mobile operator's network via broadband connection (e.g., digital subscriber line (DSL) router, cable or other modem, etc.). Some H(e)NBs provide closed subscriber group (CSG) access that restricts access to certain devices or related users that are members of the CSG. A home subscriber server (HSS), home location register (HLR), or one or more other nodes of a device's home network can store CSG subscription information for the device (e.g., in addition to general subscription information for the device), which can include one or more lists of CSGs of which the device is a member or can otherwise access.","In addition, by virtue of the broadband connection utilized by H(e)NBs, H(e)NBs can additionally acquire access to services or access to resources over a local network. In an example, where an H(e)NB utilizes (or provides) a gateway or router that can allow other devices to access the Internet or another packet data network (PDN), the devices and the H(e)NB can participate in a local PDN that is served by the gateway or router. In this example, the gateway or router can provide services or access to resources over the local PDN, such as storage devices, printers or other output devices, etc. The H(e)NB, in some examples, can provide local internet protocol (IP) access (LIPA) to one or more mobile devices communicating with the H(e)NB over a mobile network interface such that the one or more mobile devices can access local resources on the PDN as well via the H(e)NB (e.g., and\/or devices on the local network can access resources of the one or more mobile devices). In another example, an H(e)NB can implement selected IP traffic offload (SIPTO) for filtering traffic related to one or more devices over the Internet using the router in the PDN without forwarding the traffic through the mobile network.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding disclosure thereof, various aspects are described in connection with managing packet data network (PDN) connectivity, such as local internet protocol (IP) access (LIPA), selected IP traffic offload (SIPTO), etc., for one or more devices. For example, one or more parameters related to PDN connectivity can be provided to a device for determining whether a PDN connection is allowed with one or more access points with which the device is communicating. For example, the one or more parameters can specify a list of access points with an indication of whether PDN connectivity (e.g., in the form of LIPA, SIPTO, etc.) to a gateway is allowed for the device, a list of access points for which certain PDN connectivity is allowed, a list of access point names (APN) related to one or more access points\u2014or a grouping of access points, such as a closed subscriber group (CSG), public land mobile network (PLMN), etc.\u2014and indications of whether PDN connectivity is allowed for the device, a list of APNs for which certain PDN connectivity is allowed at one or more access points, and\/or the like.","In addition, for example, the parameters can be specified in device subscription information, CSG information related to the device, and\/or the like. In any case, the device can determine whether to request or initiate a PDN connection from an access point based at least in part on the one or more parameters. This can mitigate unnecessary signaling where a device may otherwise request a PDN connection via an access point with which PDN connectivity is not allowed.","According to an example, a method for utilizing PDN connectivity in a wireless network is provided.

The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.","Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details.","As described further herein, packet data network (PDN) connectivity can be managed for one or more devices. For example, a device can determine whether to request or initiate PDN connectivity with a gateway from an access point based at least in part on one or more parameters received from one or more mobile network components. For example, the one or more parameters can specify whether PDN connectivity is allowed at one or more access points or groups of access points (e.g., a closed subscriber group) for the device, whether one or more access point names (APN) allow PDN connectivity, and\/or the like. The device can receive the one or more parameters in subscription information, closed subscriber group (CSG) subscription information, etc., from one or more core mobile network nodes, as part of a rejected PDN connection attempt, and\/or the like. Thus, the device can accordingly determine whether to request or initiate a PDN connection using a given access point and\/or using a specific APN to prevent unnecessary signaling in situations where a PDN connection from the device would otherwise be rejected.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201csystem\u201d and the like are intended to include a computer-related entity, such as but not limited to hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets, such as data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal.","Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a terminal, which can be a wired terminal or a wireless terminal. A terminal can also be called a system, device, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile, mobile device, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, terminal, communication device, user agent, user device, or user equipment (UE). A wireless terminal may be a cellular telephone, a satellite phone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, a computing device, or other processing devices connected to a wireless modem. Moreover, various aspects are described herein in connection with a base station. A base station may be utilized for communicating with wireless terminal(s) and may also be referred to as an access point, a Node B, evolved Node B (eNB), or some other terminology.","Moreover, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.","The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA and other systems. The terms \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), cdma2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. Further, cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM\u00ae, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE and GSM are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP). Additionally, cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project 2\u201d (3GPP2). Further, such wireless communication systems may additionally include peer-to-peer (e.g., mobile-to-mobile) ad hoc network systems often using unpaired unlicensed spectrums, 802.xx wireless LAN, BLUETOOTH and any other short- or long-range, wireless communication techniques.","Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.","Referring to , illustrated are several nodes of a sample communication system . For illustration purposes, various aspects of the disclosure are described in the context of one or more devices, access points, and network nodes that communicate with one another. It is to be appreciated, however, that aspects herein may be applicable to other types of apparatuses or other similar apparatuses that are referenced using other terminology. For example, access points can be referred to or implemented as base stations, eNodeBs (eNB), Home Node Bs (e.g., in UMTS) or Home eNBs (e.g., in LTE), collectively referred to as H(e)NBs, femtocell or picocell access points, mobile base stations, relay nodes, hot-spots, routers, gateways, etc., while devices may be referred to or implemented as user equipment (UE), mobile devices, access terminals, modems (or other tethered devices), or may be a portion thereof, and so on.","Device  can receive one or more services (e.g., network connectivity) from access point . Device  can be a wired or wireless device installed within and\/or traveling throughout a coverage area provided by access point  and\/or one or more access points of the system . For example, at various points in time, device  can connect to an access point  or some other access point in the system  (not shown) over a wired or wireless interface. Each of these access points can communicate with one or more network nodes (represented, for example, by network node(s) ) to facilitate wide area network connectivity. Network nodes  can include one or more radio and\/or core network nodes in a mobile network, for example. Thus, in various examples, network nodes  can represent functionality such as at least one of: network management (e.g., via an operation, administration, management (OAM), and\/or provisioning entity), call control, session management, mobility management, subscription management, gateway functions, interworking functions, or some other suitable network functionality. Network nodes  can include a mobility manager , which can be a mobility management entity (MME), serving general packet radio services (GPRS) support node (SGSN), mobile switching center (MSC), visitor location register (VLR), etc., a subscription server , which can be a home subscriber server (HSS), home location register (HLR), etc., and\/or the like, that can be part of a one or more PLMNs accessible by device .","In some cases, device  can access a restricted group access point (e.g., access point ) associated with a wireless cell set. In general, a wireless cell set comprises a set of one or more cells (e.g., provided by at least one access point, such as access point ) having a defined relationship. An example of a wireless cell set is a CSG. For convenience, the discussion that follows may simply refer to the term CSG, rather than the more general term wireless cell set. It should be appreciated, however, that the described concepts may be applicable to other types of defined sets or groups (e.g., restricted groups) of wireless cells or other similar entities. Also, restricted groups can provide a diminished level of access to non-members (which can be referred to as hybrid-mode access, or the cells within the group as hybrid cells), to which aspects described herein can apply as well. In addition, it is to be appreciated that an access point, such as access point , can provide one or more cells within which devices can communicate with the access point.","As depicted, access point  can be coupled to a router  or other device to access Internet , and access point  can allow device  to communicate with network nodes  via Internet . In another example, access point  can connect to Internet  using a direct broadband connection (e.g., via a modem). Moreover, for example, access point  can be coupled to a gateway , which can be a local gateway that allows communication between one or more local network devices  and , and access point , allows access to router , etc. Though shown as co-located with access point  in the depicted example, it is to be appreciated that gateway  can be implemented within access point , as a separate entity from access point , and\/or the like. Moreover, for example, router  can be similarly co-located with access point  and\/or gateway , implemented within access point , and\/or the like. In any case, access point  can receive communications from device  intended for nodes in a mobile network and can forward the communications to network nodes  through router  and via Internet  to provide mobile network access to device . For example, the communications can be associated with one or more communications tunnels, and access point  can determine that the packets are intended for one or more of network nodes  based on the one or more communications tunnels (e.g., based on one or more parameters, such as a tunnel identifier, destination address, etc., in packet headers).","For example, to facilitate communicating between device  and gateway , a radio bearer can be established between access point  and device . For example, a first mobile network bearer between gateway  and another component of the mobile network, such as one or more of network node(s) , can be established, as well as a second mobile network bearer between access point  and the other component of the mobile network (e.g., before, after, and\/or as part of establishing the radio bearer). Thus, in one example, communications related to device  intended for gateway  can traverse the other component of the mobile network (e.g., via router  and Internet ) from access point  to arrive at gateway .","In addition, in one example, access point  may provide PDN connectivity to facilitate at least one of decreasing load on the network nodes , providing access to local network resources, and\/or the like. For example, the access point  may provide local internet protocol (IP) access (LIPA), selected IP traffic offload (SIPTO), etc., to one or more devices for allowing access to local IP components, offloading traffic from the one or more devices to a connection to Internet , etc. without traversing network nodes . Where access point  provides PDN connectivity, for example, device  can access router , local network device  and\/or , etc. using a local gateway  directly without traversing any of network node(s) . In this example, device  can initiate a PDN connection to access point , which can initially be received by mobility manager  to ensure device  is allowed to initiate the PDN connection. Where device  is permitted to initiate PDN connectivity with access point , a PDN bearer or other communication tunnel can be established between access point  and gateway  for allowing device  communications with one or more nodes, such as router , local network devices  and\/or , etc. In one example, data received over the radio bearer between device  and access point  can be sent over the PDN bearer between access point  and gateway , and similarly, communications intended for device  can be received from router , local network devices  and\/or , etc., and gateway  can forward the communications to the device  via the PDN bearer with access point .","For example, gateway  additionally communicates with local network devices  and  to provide sharing of resources therebetween, access to Internet  via router , and\/or the like. For example, local network devices  and  can be substantially any device operable to communicate in a network, such as a local area network (LAN) or wireless LAN (WLAN) device (e.g., a computer, server, printer, digital video recorder (DVR), mobile device, a portion thereof, or substantially any device with a processor (or access to a processor) and a network interface, etc.), and\/or the like. Moreover, since access point  is coupled with gateway , for example, access point  participates in the local network with local network devices  and , and can thus access resources or services offered by local network devices  and\/or  in the local network, and\/or can allow access to resources related to access point  or provide services thereto. In another example, local network devices  and  can be connected to router , which can similarly provide access thereto.","In this regard, gateway  can provide PDN connectivity in the form of LIPA where the access point  can establish LIPA bearers with gateway  for device . In this example, devices, such as device , can perform actions such as at least one of accessing the services or resources of the local network, providing local network devices with  and  with services or access to resources of the device via access point , and\/or the like through gateway  via access point  without traversing network node  or similar nodes of the mobile network. Gateway  can also provide PDN connectivity in the form of SIPTO, as described, by offloading communications from device  via access point  to router .","For example, access point  may or may not allow PDN connectivity to device  or to any devices, and\/or may provide PDN connectivity for certain APNs. As described further herein, device  can receive PDN connectivity parameters  that specify whether device  can initiate a PDN connection to a gateway  from access point , from one or more CSGs that may include access point , from one or more networks (e.g., public land mobile networks (PLMN)) that may include access point , and\/or using one or more APNs that can be used for initiating the PDN connection. For example, device  can receive the PDN connectivity parameters  as part of subscription information and\/or CSG subscription information (e.g., from subscription server ), upon initiating a PDN connection with access point  (e.g., from mobility manager ), and\/or the like. If the PDN connectivity parameters  indicate that device  cannot initiate a PDN connection through access point , using a certain APN or otherwise, device  can refrain from requesting the PDN connection, which can mitigate unnecessary signaling.","Additionally, device  can determine an alternative action where device  is unable to request the PDN connection from access point . Moreover, for example, device  can receive PDN connection parameters from mobility manager  as part of a rejected PDN connection attempt to access point , as described further herein. These PDN connectivity parameters, for example, can specify a CSG or PLMN for which device  cannot request PDN connections (e.g., relating to certain APNs or otherwise). Moreover, though described in terms of establishing PDN connections (e.g., in LTE networks), it is to be appreciated that aspects described herein can be similarly applied to establishing packet data protocol (PDP) contexts (e.g., in UMTS networks).","Turning to , an example wireless communication system  is illustrated that facilitates determining whether to initiate PDN connections in a wireless network. System  can include a device  that can communicate with one or more access points to receive access to a mobile network, an access point  that provides open or restricted access or a combination thereof to one or more devices, and a gateway  that facilitates communicating with one or more networks. System  also comprises a router  that can facilitate communications between access point  or gateway  and an Internet , as described, as well as a network device  that can be coupled to gateway . Moreover, system  comprises a subscription server  that provides subscription information related to a device, and a mobility manager  that authenticates one or more devices to communicate with one or more core network components.","In one example, device  can be a UE, modem (or other tethered device), a portion thereof, and\/or the like, and access point  can be a femtocell, picocell, H(e)NB, or similar access point, a portion thereof, etc., as described. In addition, for example, gateway  can be a substantially any gateway or router, such as but not limited to a serving gateway (S-GW) packet data network (PDN) gateway (P-GW), a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN), etc., and mobility manager  can be a MME, SGSN, MSC, VLR, or similar node. In addition, as described, gateway  can be co-located and\/or implemented within access point  in another example. Subscription server  can be an HSS, HLR, or similar component. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that additional components or nodes can be present between those shown (e.g., one or more gateways or routers can be present between access point  and gateway , between access point  and mobility manager , between mobility manager  and subscription server , etc.) to facilitate access.","As described, in one example, access point  can provide PDN connectivity to device  in the form of LIPA with gateway  for communicating with network device  through gateway , in the form of SIPTO with gateway  for offloading packets to router  for communicating over Internet , etc., without traversing core components of a mobile network, such as mobility manager  (e.g., other than for authentication of device  in initially establishing the PDN connection). In one example, as described above however, access point  may not allow PDN connections, may allow PDN connections for certain APNs, etc. for a given device.","Device  can comprise a parameter receiving component  for obtaining PDN connectivity parameters from one or more core components of a mobile network, a PDN request determining component  for obtaining a request for initiating a PDN connection, and a PDN connection requesting component  for determining whether to initiate a PDN connection with the access point based at least in part on the PDN connectivity parameters. Subscription server  can comprise a subscription data component  for communicating subscription information to a device. Mobility manager  can optionally include a PDN connection request receiving component  for obtaining a PDN connection request from a device, a PDN connectivity determining component  for determining whether the device is permitted to establish a PDN connection with an access point, and\/or a PDN connectivity indicating component  for communicating PDN connectivity parameters to the device based at least in part on the PDN connection request.","According to an example, device  can communicate with access point  to receive access to a mobile network, as described. In an example, upon requesting mobile network access from access point , access point  can communicate with one or more core network components through router  and Internet , such as mobility manager  and\/or subscription server . For example, mobility manager  can be utilized to authenticate device  to communicate in the mobile network. In addition, subscription data component  can retrieve subscription information corresponding to the device  for communicating thereto. The subscription information can be general subscription information for device , CSG subscription information relating to CSGs of which device  is a member, and\/or the like. In addition, for example, subscription data component  can communicate PDN connectivity parameters  as part of device  subscription information or CSG subscription information. For example, subscription server  can communicate the PDN connectivity parameters \u2014e.g., along with or as part of the subscription information\u2014to device  via connection with access point  (e.g., through Internet , router , etc).","As described, the PDN connectivity parameters  can relate to whether certain access points, a set of access points (e.g., access points corresponding to the same CSG, PLMN, etc.), and\/or the like allow PDN connections to a local gateway, for example gateway , APNs for which PDN connections are allowed at the access points, CSGs, PLMNs, etc., and\/or the like, which can be specific for the device . As described, for example, gateway  can be a local gateway that allows access to router , network device , etc., and\/or to\/from access point  depending on one or more parameters, as described herein. Thus, for example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can include a list of access points (e.g., by identifier) from which device  can initiate a PDN connection (e.g., a LIPA and\/or SIPTO PDN connection) to a local gateway. In another example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can include a list of CSGs (e.g., by identifier) with which device  can initiate a PDN connection. In yet another example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can include a list of APNs for each access point or CSG in the list for which device can initiate a PDN connection.","In another example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can be an extension of a list, such as one or more parameters in a list that specify whether the device  is able to initiate a PDN connection for a given list item. Thus, for example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can include an indicator for one or more CSGs listed in CSG subscription information specifying whether PDN connections to a local gateway are allowed for the CSG and\/or which type of PDN connections are allowed (e.g., LIPA, SIPTO, etc.). In another example, thus, the PDN connectivity parameters  can be a list of APNs relating to each CSG listed in the CSG subscription information for which PDN connections (or certain types of PDN connections) are allowed, and\/or the like. Again, the list of APNs can be a list of all APNs with indicators for those APNs for which PDN connections are allowed, a list of those APNs for which PDN connections are allowed, and\/or the like.","In any case, parameter receiving component  can obtain the PDN connectivity parameters  for determining whether to request a PDN connection in one or more instances. In another example, parameter receiving component  can obtain the PDN connectivity parameters  from one or more other core mobile network components (e.g., as part of an open mobile alliance (OMA) device management (DM) procedure that includes the PDN connectivity parameters for one or more corresponding access points, CSGs, etc., and\/or the like). For example, PDN request determining component  can obtain a request for a PDN connection from within device , a system utilizing device  (e.g., a computer where device  is a modem), and\/or the like. In this example, PDN connection requesting component  can determine whether to initiate a PDN connection from an access point, determine an APN to utilize for requesting the PDN connection from the access point, and\/or the like based at least in part on the PDN connectivity parameters .","For example, device  can be communicating with access point , which can include an active mode connection to access point  for accessing the mobile network, an idle-mode connection to access point  for receiving paging signals from the mobile network, and\/or the like. Upon PDN request determining component  obtaining a request for PDN connectivity to a local gateway, PDN connection requesting component  can determine whether to request PDN connectivity to the local gateway (e.g., gateway ) from access point  based on the PDN connectivity parameters . For example, where the PDN connectivity parameters  specify that access point  does not allow PDN connections to a local gateway, PDN connection requesting component  can refrain from requesting a PDN connection. In this example, device  can take an alternative action, such as requesting a PDN connection from one or more neighboring access points (not shown) if permitted. Where PDN connectivity parameters  specify that access point  does allow PDN connections to a local gateway, PDN connection requesting component  can initiate a PDN connection with access point  by transmitting a PDN connectivity request (e.g., a LIPA PDN connectivity request, SIPTO PDN connectivity request, etc.) thereto, as described.","In a more specific example, PDN connection requesting component  can determine whether the device  is allowed to request a PDN connection to a local gateway from access points of a CSG or PLMN related to access point . For example, device  can receive an indication of the CSG or PLMN of access point  by virtue of communicating therewith, and PDN connection requesting component  can determine whether PDN connectivity parameters  specify that a PDN connection (e.g., or a certain type of PDN connection, such as LIPA, SIPTO, etc.) is allowed for the CSG or PLMN. PDN connection requesting component  can accordingly initiate or refrain from initiating a PDN connection to gateway  via access point .","In yet another example, PDN request determining component  can obtain a APN related to the requested PDN connection. PDN connection requesting component  can accordingly determine whether a PDN connection is allowed for the APN at access point , at the corresponding CSG or PLMN, etc., based at least in part on the PDN connectivity parameters . PDN connection requesting component  can accordingly initiate or refrain from initiating the PDN connection.","In another example, based on PDN request determining component  obtaining a request for a PDN connection to a local gateway, PDN connection requesting component  can select an APN for specifying in requesting a PDN connection with access point . For example, PDN connection requesting component  can determine one or more APNs for which PDN connections (e.g., and\/or certain types of PDN connections) are allowed at access point . For example, this can include PDN connection requesting component  determining the one or more APNs specified in the PDN connectivity parameters  relating to allowing PDN connectivity for device  at access point , at a CSG of which access point  is a member, at a PLMN of access point , and\/or the like. PDN connection requesting component  can accordingly select the APN based at least in part on the request for the PDN connection (e.g., and\/or a type of PDN connection specified in the request for the PDN connection) to specify in requesting the PDN connection.","Moreover, in an example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can specify differing levels of PDN connectivity, and PDN connection requesting component  can further determine whether to initiate a PDN connection to the local gateway, such as gateway , from access point  based on the levels of PDN connectivity. For example, where the PDN connectivity parameters  correspond to LIPA, an indication of whether LIPA is allowed via access point  can correspond to levels of allowance, such as LIPA only, LIPA conditional, or LIPA prohibited. For example, a level of allowance can be associated with one or more APNs related to access point , a CSG of access point , a PLMN of access point , etc., in the PDN connectivity parameters . In this example, PDN connection requesting component  can refrain from establishing a PDN connection for a related APN (e.g., received at PDN request determining component ) using access point  where LIPA prohibited is specified for the APN. In another example, where LIPA conditional is specified, PDN connection requesting component  can refrain from establishing the PDN connection using access point  where the respective condition is not met. In one example, the condition can relate to a location of device , a network within which the device  is communicating (e.g., a network related to gateway ) or a related address, and\/or the like.","Furthermore, for example, where PDN request determining component  obtains a request for a PDN connection without an APN specified, PDN connection requesting component  can select a PDN in the PDN connectivity parameters  for which LIPA only is specified (e.g., or LIPA conditional so long as the condition is specified) for requesting the PDN connectivity, if such an APN exists in the PDN connectivity parameters .","In another example, PDN connection requesting component  can attempt to initiate a PDN connection to access point  where access point  may not allow such connections from device . For example, the device  may not have been provisioned with PDN connectivity parameters , incorrectly provisioned, etc. In another example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can be removed from device  (e.g., by PDN connection requesting component  or another component) based at least in part on expiration of a timer, powering down device , removal of a subscriber identity modulate (SIM) card from the device , based on device  communicating with one or more other access points, and\/or other events or triggers. In any case, access point  can communicate with mobility manager  on behalf of device  to authenticate the device  for the PDN connection. For example, PDN connection request receiving component  can obtain the PDN connection request of device  from access point .","In this example, PDN connectivity determining component , for example, can determine the request is for PDN connectivity (e.g., based on the APN specified in the request). For example, PDN connectivity determining component  can determine the APN in the request is a PDN connectivity APN based at least in part on information received for access point . Thus, PDN connectivity determining component  can also determine whether device  is permitted to initiate PDN connections to a local gateway at the access point . This can be based at least in part on PDN connectivity parameters  received for device  (e.g., during device  initialization on the mobile network), PDN connectivity parameters  can be received from access point  or an access point management server, an indication from access point  that device  is not allowed to request PDN connectivity from access point , and\/or the like. For example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can be different from PDN connectivity parameters , as described below, while still indicating information related to whether device  can request PDN connectivity with certain access points, CSGs, PLMNs, etc.","In any case, where PDN connectivity determining component  determines that device  is not allowed to initiate a PDN connection to a local gateway, such as gateway , using access point , PDN connectivity indicating component  can specify PDN connectivity parameters  to device  along with an indication that device  is unable to initiate a PDN connection using access point . PDN connectivity parameters , for example, can specify that device  is not permitted to initiate a PDN connection using access point , using any access points in the same CSG as access point , using any access points in the same PLMN as access point , and\/or the like. For example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can include a specific CSG and\/or PLMN identifier and an indication that device  cannot initiate PDN connections from access points advertising or otherwise related to the CSG or PLMN identifier.","In one example, PDN connectivity indicating component  can communicate the PDN connectivity parameters  to device using one or more non-access stratum (NAS) messages. In an example, the PDN connectivity parameters  can correspond to a cause code in the one or more NAS messages for rejecting the PDN connectivity request from device . In one example, PDN connection requesting component  can obtain the cause code and can determine the PDN connectivity parameters . For example, the cause code can indicate that device  is unable to establish PDN connections to a local gateway using any access point in the CSG or PLMN of access point . In this example, PDN connection requesting component  can store a CSG and\/or PLMN identifier related to access point  for subsequently comparing to one or more other access points in determining whether to attempt PDN connection using the one or more other access points. Parameter receiving component  can obtain the PDN connectivity parameters , and PDN connection requesting component  can utilize the PDN connectivity parameters  in subsequently determining whether to initiate a PDN connection using one or more other access points, as described above with respect to PDN connectivity parameters .","For example, when communicating with another access point (not shown), PDN connection requesting component  can determine whether the other access points are in the same CSG or part of the same PLMN as access point ; if so, PDN connection requesting component  can refrain from initiating a PDN connection thereto based at least in part on the PDN connectivity parameters  indicating PDN connections are not allowed in the CSG or PLMN. In one example, PDN connectivity parameters  can be or can be similar to or a subset of PDN connectivity parameters  as related to device , access point , one or more CSGs or PLMNs, etc. Furthermore, device  can remove PDN connectivity parameters  based at least in part on one or more events or triggers, as described in connection with PDN connectivity parameters .","Referring to , example methodologies relating to determining whether to initiate PDN connections in a wireless network are illustrated. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance with one or more embodiments, occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein.

Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with one or more embodiments.","Referring to , an example methodology  is displayed that facilitates determining whether to initiate a PDN connection to an access point. At , one or more parameters can be received specifying whether PDN connectivity to a local gateway is allowed at one or more access points. For example, the one or more parameters can correspond to PDN connectivity parameters received in subscription information, CSG subscription information, etc., received from a network component as part of a NAS message rejecting a request for a PDN connection using an access point, and\/or the like. In addition, the one or more parameters can correspond to indicators specifying whether PDN connections are allowed at an access point, at access points related to a CSG, at access points related to a PLMN, etc., and can be device-specific. Moreover, the one or more parameters can indicate a level of PDN connectivity to a local gateway (e.g., LIPA only, LIPA conditional, LIPA prohibited, etc.).","At , a request to establish a PDN connection to the local gateway can be received while connected to at least one of the one or more access points.

For example, this can be part of one or more cause codes in a NAS rejection message rejecting establishment of the PDN connection. As described, the concepts can be applied for PDP contexts as well, and thus where the above steps correspond to a PDN connection, it is to be appreciated that the steps can be modified for PDP contexts.","Referring to , an example methodology  for communicating a request to establish a PDN connection is illustrated.

System  comprises a base station  that can include multiple antenna groups. For example, one antenna group can include antennas  and , another group can comprise antennas  and , and an additional group can include antennas  and . Two antennas are illustrated for each antenna group; however, more or fewer antennas can be utilized for each group. Base station  can additionally include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as is appreciated.","Base station  can communicate with one or more mobile devices such as mobile device  and mobile device ; however, it is to be appreciated that base station  can communicate with substantially any number of mobile devices similar to mobile devices  and .

Moreover, mobile device  is in communication with antennas  and , where antennas  and  transmit information to mobile device  over a forward link  and receive information from mobile device  over a reverse link . In a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, forward link  can utilize a different frequency band than that used by reverse link , and forward link  can employ a different frequency band than that employed by reverse link , for example. Further, in a time division duplex (TDD) system, forward link  and reverse link  can utilize a common frequency band and forward link  and reverse link  can utilize a common frequency band.","Each group of antennas and\/or the area in which they are designated to communicate can be referred to as a sector of base station . For example, antenna groups can be designed to communicate to mobile devices in a sector of the areas covered by base station . In communication over forward links  and , the transmitting antennas of base station  can utilize beamforming to improve signal-to-noise ratio of forward links  and  for mobile devices  and . Also, while base station  utilizes beamforming to transmit to mobile devices  and  scattered randomly through an associated coverage, mobile devices in neighboring cells can be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single antenna to all its mobile devices. Moreover, mobile devices  and  can communicate directly with one another using a peer-to-peer or ad hoc technology as depicted.

According to an example, each data stream can be transmitted over a respective antenna. TX data processor  formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.","The coded data for each data stream can be multiplexed with pilot data using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. Additionally or alternatively, the pilot symbols can be frequency division multiplexed (FDM), time division multiplexed (TDM), or code division multiplexed (CDM). The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and can be used at mobile device  to estimate channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream can be modulated (e.g., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), etc.) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream can be determined by instructions performed or provided by processor .","The modulation symbols for the data streams can be provided to a TX MIMO processor , which can further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor  then provides Nmodulation symbol streams to Ntransmitters (TMTR) through . In various embodiments, TX MIMO processor  applies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.","Each transmitter  receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. Further, Nmodulated signals from transmitters through are transmitted from Nantennas through , respectively.","At mobile device , the transmitted modulated signals are received by Nantennas through and the received signal from each antenna  is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) through .

In addition, an access terminal  can be capable of operating both in macro environments and in smaller scale (e.g., residential) network environments. Thus, for example, depending on the current location of the access terminal , the access terminal  can be served by an access node  or by any one of a set of femto nodes  (e.g., the femto nodes A and B that reside within a corresponding user residence ). For example, when a subscriber is outside his home, he is served by a standard macro cell access node (e.g., node ) and when the subscriber is at home, he is served by a femto node (e.g., node A). Here, it should be appreciated that a femto node  can be backward compatible with existing access terminals .","A femto node  can be deployed on a single frequency or, in the alternative, on multiple frequencies. Depending on the particular configuration, the single frequency or one or more of the multiple frequencies can overlap with one or more frequencies used by a macro cell access node (e.g., node ). In some aspects, an access terminal  can be configured to connect to a preferred femto node (e.g., the home femto node of the access terminal ) whenever such connectivity is possible. For example, whenever the access terminal  is within the user's residence , it can communicate with the home femto node .","In some aspects, if the access terminal  operates within the mobile operator core network  but is not residing on its most preferred network (e.g., as defined in a preferred roaming list), the access terminal  can continue to search for the most preferred network (e.g., femto node ) using a Better System Reselection (BSR), which can involve a periodic scanning of available systems to determine whether better systems are currently available, and subsequent efforts to associate with such preferred systems. Using an acquisition table entry (e.g., in a preferred roaming list), in one example, the access terminal  can limit the search for specific band and channel. For example, the search for the most preferred system can be repeated periodically. Upon discovery of a preferred femto node, such as femto node , the access terminal  selects the femto node  for camping within its coverage area.","A femto node can be restricted in some aspects. For example, a given femto node can only provide certain services to certain access terminals. In deployments with so-called restricted (or closed) association, a given access terminal can only be served by the macro cell mobile network and a defined set of femto nodes (e.g., the femto nodes  that reside within the corresponding user residence ). In some implementations, a femto node can be restricted to not provide, for at least one access terminal, at least one of: signaling, data access, registration, paging, or service.","In some aspects, a restricted femto node (which can also be referred to as a Closed Subscriber Group H(e)NB) is one that provides service to a restricted provisioned set of access terminals. This set can be temporarily or permanently extended as necessary. In some aspects, a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) can be defined as the set of access nodes (e.g., femto nodes) that share a common access control list of access terminals. A channel on which all femto nodes (or all restricted femto nodes) in a region operate can be referred to as a femto channel.","Various relationships can thus exist between a given femto node and a given access terminal. For example, from the perspective of an access terminal, an open femto node can refer to a femto node with no restricted association. A restricted femto node can refer to a femto node that is restricted in some manner (e.g., restricted for association and\/or registration). A home femto node can refer to a femto node on which the access terminal is authorized to access and operate on. A guest femto node can refer to a femto node on which an access terminal is temporarily authorized to access or operate on. An alien femto node can refer to a femto node on which the access terminal is not authorized to access or operate on, except for perhaps emergency situations (e.g., 911 calls).","From a restricted femto node perspective, a home access terminal can refer to an access terminal that authorized to access the restricted femto node. A guest access terminal can refer to an access terminal with temporary access to the restricted femto node. An alien access terminal can refer to an access terminal that does not have permission to access the restricted femto node, except for perhaps emergency situations, for example, 911 calls (e.g., an access terminal that does not have the credentials or permission to register with the restricted femto node).","For convenience, the disclosure herein describes various functionality in the context of a femto node. It should be appreciated, however, that a pico node can provide the same or similar functionality as a femto node, but for a larger coverage area. For example, a pico node can be restricted, a home pico node can be defined for a given access terminal, and so on.","A wireless multiple-access communication system can simultaneously support communication for multiple wireless access terminals. As mentioned above, each terminal can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on the forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link can be established via a single-in-single-out system, a MIMO system, or some other type of system.","The various illustrative logics, logical blocks, modules, components, and circuits described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with a general purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein.
