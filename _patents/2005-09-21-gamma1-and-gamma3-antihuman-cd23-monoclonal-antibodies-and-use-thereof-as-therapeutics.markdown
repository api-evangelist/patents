No. 7,033,589, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/803,085, filed Feb. 20, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,138","The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies containing human gamma-1 constant domains which specifically bind human CD23, the low affinity receptor for IgE (FceRII\/CD23) and their usage as therapeutic agents.","IgE is a member of the immunoglobulin family that mediates allergic responses such as asthma, food allergies, type 1 hypersensitivity and the familiar sinus inflammation allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, and as a result, causes widespread suffering throughout the general population. IgE is secreted by, and expressed on the surface of, B-cells. IgE synthesized by B-cells can be anchored in the B-cell membrane by a short transmembrane domain linked to the mature IgE sequence. Membrane and secreted versions of IgE are formed in the same cell by differential splicing of the IgE RNA transcript.","IgE also can be bound to B-cells (and T cells, monocytes, Langerhans cells, follicular dendritic cells, natural killer cells, eosinophils and platelets) through its Fc region to a low affinity IgE receptor (FceRII, hereafter \u201cFCEL\u201d, and to mast cells and basophils through its Fc region to a high affinity IgE receptor FceRI, (hereinafter \u201cFCEH\u201d). The low affinity IgE receptor is generally referred to in the literature as CD23.","Upon exposure of a mammal to an allergen, antigen presenting cells process the antigen for presentation to helper T cells. These helper T cells secrete cytokines such as IL-4 which assist B-cells to undergo clonal amplification and secrete more allergen-specific IgE. This newly synthesized IgE in turn is released into the circulation where it binds to mast cells and basophils through the high affinity receptor on their cell surface. Such mast cells and basophils are thereby sensitized to the specific allergen. The next exposure to the same allergen causes binding to specific IgE on the surface of mast cells, and basophils, thereby cross-linking the FceRI on these cells and thus activating their release of histamine and other factors which are responsible for clinical hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis.","The art has reported antibodies capable of binding to FCEL (CD23)-bound IgE but not IgE bound to FCEH (see, for example, WO 89\/00138 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,940,782). These antibodies are disclosed to be clinically advantageous because they bind to IgE which is bound to the low affinity receptor (FCEL) or to circulating IgE's, but do not bind to IgE bound to the high affinity receptor (FCEH). Therefore, these antibodies will not activate mast cells or basophils.","Moreover, anti-CD23 antibodies have been reported to have potential as therapeutics, e.g., for the treatment of allergic disorders, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune diseases. For example, Bonnefoy et al., WO 9612741, report that ligands which bind CD23, e.g., monoclonal antibodies, are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of inflammatory, autoimmune and allergic diseases.","The usage of monoclonal antibodies to CD23, as both IgE agonists and antagonists has been reported. IgE antagonists have been reported to have potential utility in treatment of conditions or diseases wherein IgE suppression is therapeutically desirable, e.g., allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis and conjuntivitis, atopic dermatitis and asthma. For example, Bonnefoy et al., WO 8707302 (1987), report monoclonal antibodies to human CD23, which are assertedly useful for assaying the presence of IgE receptors on cell types and as therapeutics in diseases wherein modulation of IgE is therapeutically desirable.","In part because of their potential as therapeutics and diagnostics, many groups have reported the generation of monoclonal antibodies to CD23. See, e.g., Rector et al., 55:481-488 (1985); Suemura et al., 137:1214-1220 (1986); Noro et al., 137:1258-1263 (1986); Bonnefoy et al., 138:2170-2178 (1987); Flores-Romo et al., 261:1038-1046 (1993); Sherr et al.; 142:481-489 (1989); and Pene et al., 85:6880-6884 (1988). Moreover, as discussed supra, the usage of such antibodies specifically to inhibit IgE production in systems where IgE synthesis is cytokine (IL-4) induced has also been reported. (Flores-Romo et al (Id.); Sherr et al. (Id.); Bonnefoy et al. (WO 8707302); Bonnefoy et al. (WO 8707302); Bonnefoy et al. (WO 9612741)); Bonnefoy et al., 20:139-144 (1990); Sarfati et al., 141:2195-2199 (1988) and Wakai et al., 12:25-43 (1993). Also, Flores-Romo et al. (Id.) disclose that Fabs prepared from anti-CD23 antibodies inhibit antigen-specific induced IgE responses in vivo in the rat. However, notwithstanding what has been reported, the mechanism by which anti-CD23 antibodies modulate IgE expression and in particular, the manner by which they block IL-4 induced IgE production remains unclear.","It has been suggested that anti-CD23 antibodies inhibit IgE production by signaling through CD23 present on the surface of IgE secreting B cells. It has been proposed that the function of CD23, which is upregulated on IgE secreting B cells, is feedback inhibition of IgE production (Yu, et al. 369, 753-756 (1994)). This has been theorized because mice in which the CD23 gene has been removed have increased and sustained IgE production compared to controls (Yu, et al.). In addition, it has been reported that binding to CD23 by IgE complexes or by a monoclonal antibody to anti-CD23 suppresses ongoing IgE synthesis by a lymphoblastoid cell line that constitutively secretes IgE (Sherr et al. (Id.)). It appears that this is due to down regulation of the messenger RNA for the secreted IgE heavy chain in this cell (Saxon et al., 147:4000-4006 (1991)). However, the exact mechanism by which IgE expression is inhibited has yet to be explained in systems in which IgE secretion is IL-4 induced.","It has also been reported that crosslinking of Fc gamma RII with surface Ig (B cell receptor) on B cells leads to down regulation of Ig expression. (D'Ambrosia et al., 268:293-297 (1995).) A similar mechanism can be proposed for B cells secreting IgE which also have cell surface CD23 and Fc gamma RII. An anti-human CD23 antibody bound to a cell by antigen (CD23) and also bound to Fc gamma RII through Fc interactions could transmit a signal to suppress IgE secretion through Fc gamma RII.","Mechanisms involved in IgE inhibition by anti-CD23 antibodies have been proposed that include blocking interactions other than the interaction between membrane CD23 and IgE. Related to this, CD23, which is a member of the C-type lectin family, has been shown to interact with several other ligands such as CD21, CD11b and CD11c present on a variety of cell types including T cells and monocytes. In this context CD23 can be envisioned as a cellular adhesion molecule.","Therefore, it has been proposed that the CD21-CD23 interaction may be involved in antigen presentation and subsequent IgE production. Models suggest CD21 on B cells sending an activation signal for IgE production after binding to CD23 on activated T cells present primarily in atopic individuals. (Leconant et al., 88:35-39 (1996); and Bonnefoy et al., 107:40-42 (1995).) Blocking this interaction with an anti-CD23 could block induced IgE production. (Aubry et al., 358:505-507 and 5:944-949 (1993); Grosjean et al. (1992); Bonnefoy et al., 24:2982-2988 (1994); Henchoz-Lecoanet et al., 88:35-39 (1996) Nambu et al., 44:163-167 (1995); Bonnefoy et al., 107:40-42 (1995).)","Yet another mechanism which would potentially explain the effects of CD23 on IgE production involves soluble forms of CD23. It has been reported that CD23 is cleaved from the cell surface releasing several different forms of soluble CD23 or IgE binding factors. (Sarfati et al., 53:197-205 (1984).) Soluble CD23 is a cytokine, with one of its reported activities being the augmentation of IL-4 induced IgE production from B cells. (Pene et al., 39:253-269 (1989); Pene et al., 18:929-935 (1988); Sarfati et al., 141:2195-2197 (1988); Sarfati et al. (1984) (Id.); (Saxon et al., 86 (3 pt 1) 333-344 (1990). Also, certain forms of soluble CD23 have been reported to inhibit IgE production (Sarfati et al., 76:662-667 (1992)). Accordingly, anti-CD23 antibodies potentially may block IgE production by 1) inhibiting the IgE augmenting effects of soluble CD23 and\/or 2) blocking the proteolytic release of soluble CD23 from the cell surface.","Thus, based on the foregoing, it is clear that there is significant complexity and uncertainty in the art with respect to the functions of more specifically CD23 and effects on IgE production, and further with respect to the means by which ligands specific thereto affect IgE production.","Thus, it is an object of the invention to produce novel ligands (antibodies) specific to CD23 and to use such antibodies to elucidate the mechanism by which anti-CD23 antibodies modulate IgE expression.","It is another object of the invention to produce novel ligands (antibodies) which bind CD23, in particular human CD23, having improved ability to inhibit induced IgE expression.","It is a more specific object of the invention to produce anti-human CD23 antibodies containing human gamma-1 constant domains.","It is another object of the invention to produce multivalent anti-human CD23 antibodies which may be more effective by virtue of their enhanced potential for cross linking CD23 and Fc receptors.","It is another object of the invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions containing anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibodies comprising human gamma-1 constant domains which are capable of inhibiting induced IgE production.","It is another object of the invention to use an anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibody comprising human gamma-1 constant domains for treatment or prophylaxsis of disease conditions wherein inhibition of induced IgE production is therapeutically desirable.","More specifically, it is an object of the invention to treat or prevent allergic conditions, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases using an anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibody comprising human gamma-1 constant domains.","Chimeric Antibody:","A recombinant antibody containing regions from two different antibodies, usually different species antibodies, most typically rodent variable sequences and human constant domain sequences.","Anti-Human CD23 Gamma 1 Antibody","An antibody that specifically binds human CD23 which contains a human gamma 1 constant region or fragment or modification thereof which inhibits induced IgE production. This includes, in particular, antibodies containing rodent or primate variable domains or antigen binding portions, humanized, PRIMATIZED\u00ae, and human anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibodies which comprise a human gamma 1 constant domain, fragment, or modification thereof, which inhibit induced IgE production in vitro.","PRIMATIZED\u00ae Antibody","A recombinant antibody containing primate variable sequences or antigen binding portions, and human constant domain sequences.","Humanized Antibody:","A recombinant antibody containing a non-human variable region or antigen binding portion which has been modified to more closely mimic a human antibody variable region and thereby eliminate or minimize potential immunogenicity if administered to humans without sacrificing the specificity or affinity of the immunoglobulin. There are several known methods of humanization, including, \u201cveneering\u201d which comprises select modification of surface residues, framework replacement, (CDR grafting) and molecular modeling.","Gamma 1 Constant Domain:","A particular type constant domain sequence which confers upon an antibody specific effector activities. In the present application, gamma 1 constant domain refers to a human gamma 1 constant domain, fragment or modification thereof, which retains gamma 1 effector functions in combination with anti-CD23 variable domain sequences or antigen binding portions. Modifications include human gamma-1 constant domains which comprise the deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acid residues. This effector function is manifested by the ability of an antibody containing such a constant domain to inhibit induced IgE production.","CD23:","This refers to the low affinity receptor for IgE, FceRII\/CD23.","Anti-CD23 Antibody:","An antibody that specifically binds CD23, preferably human CD23.","As discussed supra, while many groups have previously reported the production of anti-CD23 antibodies and the use thereof as antagonists and agonists for modulating IgE production, the exact mechanism by which such antibodies modulate IgE expression in systems where IL-4 induces IgE production remains unclear. Thus, it would be beneficial if the means by which such antibodies modulate IgE expression were elucidated, or at least better explained, as such information would be potentially useful in designing therapeutics for treatment of diseases wherein modulation of IgE production is therapeutically desirable. In particular, it would be beneficial if improved antibodies specific to CD23 were obtained having improved capacity to inhibit induced IgE production, as enhanced IgE levels are believed to be involved in numerous disease processes, e.g., allergic conditions, inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. Such diseases include by way of example, atopic dermatitis, eczema, allergic rhinitis and conjuntivitis, Job's syndrome, and asthma.","Toward that end, the present inventors have surprisingly discovered that anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibodies which contain human gamma-1 constant domains inhibit IgE production in systems where IgE production is induced by IL-4 significantly better than CD23 monoclonal antibodies of other effector types, e.g., those comprising human gamma-4 constant domains or CD23 monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments lacking effector functions altogether.","While Fc mediated effector functions are sometimes significant to the therapeutic activity of antibodies, this discovery was surprising in the case of anti-CD23 antibodies because the role of effector function in the IgE inhibitory activity of anti-CD23 antibodies had not been previously reported. In fact, previous evidence had suggested that antibody effector function was not significant to the ability of anti-CD23 antibodies to inhibit induced IgE production. For example, Flores-Romo et al., 261:1038-1041 (1993) had reported that Fabs prepared from a polyclonal anti-CD23 antibody inhibited an in vivo induced IgE antigen-specific response.","This discovery was made after the present inventors isolated various primate antibodies specific to CD23 having anti-IgE inhibiting activity and compared these antibodies to PRIMATIZED\u00ae versions with respect to their ability to inhibit IL-4 induced IgE production in vitro and in vivo.","More specifically, and as described in greater detail infra, five primate monoclonal antibodies which specifically bound both cellular and soluble CD23 were isolated from an Old World monkey (macaque) according to the methodology which is disclosed in commonly assigned application Ser. No. 08\/379,072 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,570), which application is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. This application described in detail a means for producing monoclonal antibodies to desired antigens, desirable human antigens, in Old World monkeys and their advantages in relation to antibodies of other species as therapeutics, for example reduced or potentially lack of immunogenicity in humans because of the phylogenetic closeness of humans and Old World monkeys. In fact, because of the phylogenetic closeness of these species, it is difficult to distinguish Old World monkey immunoglobulins from human immunoglobulins by sequence comparison.","Four of these five primate monoclonal anti-human CD23 antibodies were demonstrated to be capable of inhibiting IL-4 induced IgE production in an in vitro B cell assay described in detail infra and the most potent was also shown to inhibit IL-4 induced IgE in a SCID mouse animal model (also described in detail infra). Based on this IgE inhibitory activity, and expected low immunogenicity in humans, such antibodies are potentially suitable as therapeutics for treating diseases wherein inhibition of IgE production is therapeutically desirable.","However, in order to further reduce immunogenicity, it was elected to PRIMATIZE\u00ae two primate monoclonal antibodies (a type of chimerization of antibodies) according to the methodology which is disclosed in commonly assigned application Ser. No. 08\/379,072 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,570), incorporated by reference herein. PRIMATIZATION\u00ae essentially refers to the production of recombinant antibodies developed by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation which comprise primate variable regions and human constant regions. PRIMATIZATION\u00ae of the two primate anti-human CD23 monoclonal (5E8 and 6G5) antibodies having potent IgE inhibiting activity was effected in order to eliminate any potential immnunogenicity attributable to the primate constant domains in humans.","Because of the inventors' initial expectation from published literature that Fc effector function was not necessary for induced IgE inhibition, human gamma 4 versions of these particular antibodies were initially produced. However, quite surprisingly, it was found that the gamma-4 versions produced from both of these primate monoclonal antibodies were ineffective, i.e., they required significantly higher concentrations of PRIMATIZED\u00ae gamma 4 antibody than the primate antibody to inhibit IL-4 induced IgE production in vitro assays.","Moreover, even more surprising was the discovery that when the same two primate antibodies were then converted to human gamma-1 versions (by substitution of the primate constant domains with human gamma-1 constant domains), that these gamma-1 antibodies very effectively inhibited induced IgE production in vitro. Thus, our results suggested that Fc effector function is apparently significant to the ability of anti-human CD23 antibodies to inhibit induced IgE production. This hypothesis was confirmed when a third primate anti-human CD23 monoclonal, i.e., the 2C8 antibody, which was shown by us to inhibit IgE production in vitro, was converted to a F(ab\u2032), which was found to be substantially incapable of inhibiting induced IgE production in vitro. In fact, this F(ab\u2032)was found to antagonize the suppressive effects on induced IgE blocking activity of the primate anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibody 2C8.","In addition, it was found that removing a glycosylation site in the heavy chain variable region of one of the antibodies (5E8) had no effect on binding of the antibody to CD23 (as evidenced by obtained Kd values), or on induced IgE inhibition. Thus, the differences in IgE inhibition were shown to apparently not involve glycosylation differences.","The PRIMATIZED\u00ae gamma 1 version of primate 6G5 was found to inhibit induced IgE expression in SCID mice while the same concentration of either the primate 6G5 or the PRIMATIZED\u00ae p6G5G4p did not inhibit induced IgE expression. Therefore, an antibody containing human gamma-1 constant domains was found to be even more effective in an in vivo animal model than the primate monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, the inventors anticipate that anti-CD23 antibodies containing human gamma-3 constant domains will be just as effective as those having gamma-1 constant domains, because gamma-1 and gamma-3 constant domains have affinity for the same classes of Fc receptors.","Accordingly, based on these results, it has been surprisingly discovered that an active Fc region, in particular that of human gamma 1, is significantly involved in the mechanism of IL-4 induced IgE inhibition by anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibodies. This discovery is quite unexpected especially based on earlier reports that Fabs derived from polyclonal anti-CD23 antibodies were capable of inhibiting induced IgE production, and also based on the various theories as to how CD23 affects induced IgE expression.","Accordingly, the present invention relates to anti-human CD23 antibodies containing human gamma-1 constant domains and their use as therapeutics based on their ability to effectively inhibit IgE expression.","The skilled artisan can prepare anti-human CD23 antibodies containing human gamma-1 constant domains by methods which are well known in the art for the manufacture of chimeric antibodies. Essentially, such methods comprise producing anti-human CD23 antibodies in a desired host or in vitro, cloning a hybridoma or cell line which produces an anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibody exhibiting desirable characteristics, e.g., adequate CD23 binding affinity, cloning the nucleic acid sequences which encode such antibody from said hybridoma or cell line, e.g. by polymerase chain reaction using suitable primers, isolating the variable domains contained therein, recombining such variable domains with human gamma-1 constant domains and the appropriate human light chain constant domain, and expressing the resultant nucleic acid sequence encoding a chimeric anti-human CD23 gamma-1 immunoglobulin in a suitable expression system. Preferably, the anti-human CD23 antibodies of the invention will have apparent CD23 binding affinities ranging from 0.1 nM to 1000 nM, more preferably at least 50 nM, and most preferably at least 5 nM.","Host cells suitable for expression of recombinant immunoglobulins are well known in the art. For example, recombinant antibodies may be expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, DG44 or DUXB11; or CHO cells CHO K-1; mouse myeloma cells SP2\/0 or X63-Ag8.653 or NSO; rat myeloma cells YB2\/0; baby hamster kidney cells, BHK; human embryonic kidney line, 293; monkey kidney cells, CV1; human lung fibroblasts, WI38; human cervical carcinoma cells, HELA; insect cells, plant cells, yeast or in bacteria. Further, vectors suitable for expression of immunoglobulins are also well known in the art and are commercially available.","A particularly preferred vector system is the translationally impaired vector system disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 08\/147,696 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,267), which comprises a translationally impaired dominant selectable marker (neo) containing an intron into which a desired heterologous DNA is inserted. This vector system has been found to provide for very high yields of recombinant proteins, e.g., immunoglobulins. However, the subject anti-CD23 antibodies may be produced in any vector system which is suitable for expression of functional immunoglobulins.","Also, the present invention embraces human monoclonal antibodies of the gamma-1 type which are specific to human CD23. Methods for isolation of human monoclonal antibodies are also well known in the art and include in vitro methods, e.g., in vitro immunization of human B cells in tissue culture, and in vivo methods, e.g. synthesis of human monoclonal antibodies in SCID mice. A preferred means of producing human monoclonal antibodies in SCID mice which combines in vitro priming of human spleen cells which are then introduced into SCID mice is disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 08\/488,376 (incorporated by reference in its entirety herein). This method is advantageous as it provides for the reproducible recovery of monoclonal antibodies having high affinity against a desired antigen, e.g., a human antigen.","Also, the present invention embraces human monoclonal antibodies which compete with the primate anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibodies 5E8 and 6G5 for binding to CD23.","Five primate monoclonal antibodies specific to CD23 were isolated from macaques substantially according to the methodology disclosed in Ser. No. 08\/379,072, which has been incorporated by reference herein. The exact techniques utilized are described in detail below.","Purification of the Immunogen sCD23 from 8866 Cells","During purification, soluble CD23(sCD23) was quantified by a three-step ELISA using a murine anti-CD23 antibody (Binding Site; catalog # MC112) as a capture. The antigen was partially purified from cultures of 8866 cells maintained in suspension bioreactors using RPMI 1640 (JRH Biosciences; catalog # 56-509) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences) and 4 mM glutamine (JRH Biosciences; catalog # 90114) at 37\u00b0 C. Carbon dioxide was used to maintain pH 7.1. After removing cells by 0.45 \u03bcm filtration, phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (final concentration 0.2 mM, Sigman Chemical Co.; catalog # P-7626) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (final concentration 3 mM, Sigma Chemical Co.; catalog # EDS) were added to the supernate and the solution stored at 2-8\u00b0 C. The cell-free supernate was concentrated approximately 15 to 20-fold using a hollow-fiber ultrafiltration cartridge (A\/T Technology; catalog # UFP-10-C-9A; 10,000 d MWCO) or tangential flow ultrafiltration cartridge (Filtron Corporation; 10,000 d MWCO) at ambient temperature. The concentrated supernate was sterile filtered and stored at -70\u00b0 C. Thawed concentrates were de-lipidated by adding SM-2 BioBeads (BioRad Industries; catalog # 152-3920) at 5 g\/L and stirring overnight at 2-8\u00b0 C. The resin was removed by filtration and the solution stored at 2-8\u00b0 C. For some preparations of sCD23, concentrates were fractionated using ammonium sulfate (35-70% (w\/v); Fisher; catalog # A702-3) before or after de-lipidation.","The de-lipidated solution was subsequently purified using affinity chromatography at 2-8\u00b0 C. The affinity matrix was prepared by covalently linking a murine anti-CD23 monoclonal antibody (BU38) to Sepharose using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma Chemical Co.; catalog # C-9142). The BU38 antibody was purified to >90% homogeneity from ascites (Binding Site; catalog # CUS830) using Protein A chromatography. The de-lipidated solution was applied to the affinity column (1.5\u00d75 cm) equilibrated with 1\u00d7PBS (Gibco BRL; catalog # 70013-0.32), pH 7.2 and the column washed with 1\u00d7PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.05% NP40 (Sigma Chemical Co.) to remove non-bound protein. Soluble CD23 was eluted using 3.5 M MgCl(Fisher; catalog # M33-500). Fractions containing sCD23 were combined and dialyzed (Baxter Spectra\/Por; catalog # D1615-1) against 1\u00d7PBS, pH 7.2 at 2-8\u00b0 C. After dialysis, the protein solution was concentrated by centrifugation using Centriprep 10 spin filters (Amicon Corporation; MWCO 10,000 d) and preparations stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. The purity of sCD23 was estimated to be >70% using SDS-PAGE analysis (4-20% precast gels, Novex Corporation) and Coomasie staining.","Immunization of Primates and Isolation of Immune Cells","Cynomolgus monkeys (White Sands Research Center, Alamogordo, New Mexico) were immunized with soluble CD23 which had been purified from the supernatant of human RPMI 8866 cells (B cell lymphoma, Hassner and Saxon, 132:2844 (1984)). Each monkey was immunized every third week with 200 \u03bcg soluble CD23 in 500 \u03bcl PBS mixed with 167 \u03bcl Temuritide (adjuvant peptide) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., Catalog # A-9519) and 333 \u03bcl 3\u00d7 PROVAX\u00ae (IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation). Immunization was effected intradermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly and subcutaneously. The titer of anti-CD23 antibodies in the serum of the monkeys was measured by ELISA on 8866 cells and compared to a pre-bleed from the same monkeys.","Monkey PRO 978, with a serum titer of fifty thousand was sacrificed, and the spleen and lymph nodes were surgically removed, and shipped on ice to IDEC pharmaceuticals, submerged in sterile RPMI-1640 (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Md., Catalog # 21870-050) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 2 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 \u03bcg\/ml gentamicin. Immediately upon arrival the spleen was homogenized by squeezing it through a wire mesh with a glass pistil. Red blood cells were lysed in an ammonium chloride based hypotonic buffer and the remaining lymphocytes collected and washed in RPMI-1640 at least three times. Lymph nodes were homogenized similarly into a single cell suspension, collected and washed at least three times in RPMI-1640.","Production of Hybridomas","After the last wash, the cells were counted, and the primate cells obtained above were then somatically fused to the mouse-human heterohybridoma cell line H6K6\/B5 (Carroll et al., 89:61 (1986)) using standard techniques (Boerner et al., 147:86) (1991)) and plated into 96 well dishes (175 dishes or 14,700 wells for the spleen, and 17 dishes or 1386 wells for the lymph nodes) at 300,000 cells per well.","This procedure involved the mixing of lymphocytes and the above-identified fusion partner, at a 2:1 ratio, which cells were slowly resuspended into 50% PEG 1500 (Sigma, Catalog # P5402) for 1 minute. These cells were then allowed to rest for 1 minute and then slowly further resuspended in excess RPMI-1640. Afterward, the cells were again allowed to rest, this time for 15 minutes before a light spin at 250\u00d7g. The cells were then resuspended in RMPI-1640 growth media, which was supplemented with 20% Fetal Calf Serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, Sodium Pyruvate, Non-Essential Amino Acids and 50 \u03bcg\/ml Gentamicin, containing 100 \u03bcM Hypoxanthine, 16 \u03bcM Thymidine (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany, # 623091) and 5.8 \u03bcM Azaserine (Sigma, Catalog # A 1164) (HTA). HTA is a selection agent which provides the survival of successfully fused cells (primate lymphocyte fused with heterohybridoma fusion partner).","Approximately 65% of the wells showed growth (10,500 wells). These wells were then screened for the presence of anti-human CD23 antibody by a three step cell ELISA.","ELISA Procedure","The first step of the ELISA comprised the transferral of fifty microliters of supernatant from each well to ninety-six well plates which had previously been coated with 108866 cells (CD23 positive cell line) per well. These plates were made by first coating the plates with 50 \u03bcl of aqueous solution containing twenty \u03bcg\/ml Poly L-Lysine (Sigma Catalog # P1399, MW 150,000-300,000) for thirty minutes at room temperature. The remaining solution was removed (\u201cflicked out\u201d) and the plates left to dry. Once dry, fifty \u03bcl of 8866 cells in PBS were transferred and spun at 600 g for five minutes. The 8866 cells were covalently bound to the plate by adding fifty \u03bcl 0.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma Catalog # G6257) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 minutes. The glutaraldehyde was removed (flicked out) and the plates blocked with one hundred fifty \u03bcl 100 mM glycine (Sigma Catalog # G-2879) in 0.1% BSA-PBS. After the addition of supernatants, the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for one to two hours and washed seven to nine times with tap water, and a goat anti-human IgG antibody coupled to horse radish peroxidase (HRPO) (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala., Catalog # 2040-05) diluted 1:2000 into 1% dry skimmed milk (Vons) in PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma, Catalog # P1379) was added. The plates were incubated for forty-five minutes at 37\u00b0 C., and again washed seven to nine times in tap water. The presence of the HRPO was detected by a color development after the addition of a TMB reagent (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, Md., Catalog # 50-76-02 and 50-65-02), 100 \u03bcl\/well. The reaction was stopped by adding twenty-five \u03bcl 4N HSO. Optical density (OD) was measured at 470 nM on a spectrophotometer (Titertek Multiscan). The OD values greater than two times the background were scored as positive.","The second step in the ELISA was effected to confirm that the supernatants which had been scored positive in the first ELISA reacted to CD23 and not to some irrelevant antigen. This was effected by testing the supernatants on SupT1 cells (ERC BioServices Corporation, Rockville, Md., Catalog # 100), a CD23 negative human cell line, using the same ELISA procedure. Supernatants that scored similarly in both tests were discarded. These results indicated that fifty-six of the 10,500 wells with growth showed the presence of a primate monoclonal antibody that bound to 8866 cells in two separate screenings at different times and did not bind to SupT1 cells.","The third step of the ELISA was conducted to determine whether the supernatants identified according to the first two ELISA steps, reacted with soluble CD23. In this third ELISA, 96 well plates were coated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight with 2 \u03bcg\/ml BG-6 (Biosource International, Camarillo, Calif., Catalog # CT-CD23-CF), a mouse monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble CD23 but does not block CD23-IgE binding, contained in a 50 mM bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.3. After removing the coating buffer, fifty \u03bcl of semi-purified soluble CD23 at a predetermined dilution in PBS were added to the plate and incubated for two hours at room temperature. After washing the plate with tap water seven to nine times, 50 \u03bcl supernatants from selected wells were added. After washing the plate in tap water seven to nine times, 50 \u03bcl rabbit anti-human IgG (mouse adsorbed)-HRPO (Southern Biotech, Catalog # 6145-05) diluted 1:4000 in 1% dry skimmed milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 were added, incubated for two hours at 37\u00b0 C., washed seven to nine times in tap water and developed with TMB as described above. Wells with OD's greater than two times the background were again scored as positive.","Twenty-one of the fifty-six wells that showed binding to 8866 cells also bound to sCD23 in the ELISA. These wells were expanded and subcloned at least twice by plating out cells at one cell per three wells. After approximately three months, five stable hybridomas producing primate monoclonal antibodies to CD23 were obtained.","Antibody Purification by Protein A Methods","Essentially, antibodies are purified by centrifugation of the culture supernatant to remove cells and debris. The resultant centrifuged samples are then filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. A protein A sepharose Fast flow column is then prepared and equilibrated using PBS (pH 7.4). The supernatant is then loaded on the column at an appropriate flow rate (2 ml\/min). After loading, the wash column is washed with 10 column volume of PBS (pH 7.4). The antibody is then eluted from the column with elution buffer (0.2 M acetic acid, 0.1 M glycine pH 3.5) at 1 ml\/min flow rate. One milliliter fractions\/tube (2.0 M Tris-Hcl pH 10.0) including 100 \u03bcl of Tris, are then collected. Afterward, spectrophotometer readings are taken at 280 nm. The resultant fractions with high absorbance at 280 nm containing the antibody are then collected and dialyzed against PBS overnight. The product is then sterilized by filtration through 0.22 \u03bcm membrane and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C.","Four of these five primate anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibodies (1H6, 2C8, 5E8 and 6G5) were demonstrated to inhibit IgE production in an in vitro assay which measures IgE production by IL4-hydrocortisone induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures.

The predominant isotype of human immunoglobulin (Ig) produced in hu-PBMC-SCID mice is IgG. Generally, IgM, IgA and IgE isotypes are found in very low or non-detectable levels except in cases where PBMC is obtained from donors with certain autoimmune or allergic disease conditions. It has also been reported that manipulation of hu-PBMC SCID mouse model with certain cytokines may be provided for the generation of significant levels of non-IgG isotypes, including IgE (Kilchherr et al., 151:241 (1993); Spiegelberg et al., 93:711 (1994); and Carballido et al., 155:4162 (1995)).

No. (NIH) 86-23, Bethesda, Md., NIH, 1985).","Human PBMC: PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats obtained from a blood bank by centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque (Histopaque-1077) as recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma Diagnostics Catalog # 1077-1). Lymphocyte preparation at the interface of the gradient were harvested and washed three times in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Bio-Whittaker Catalog # 10-527F). For each experiment PBMCs were obtained from two separate donors and cultured separately in vitro. PBMCs were resuspended at 1-3\u00d710cells\/ml concentration in HB-Basal medium plus 1% HB101 lyophilized supplement (Irvine Scientific Catalog # T000 & T151) containing 5% FCS plus 1000 IU\/ml of IL-4 (Genzyme, Inc. Catalog # 2181-01) and incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO. After incubation, the cells from different buffy coats were harvested, pooled and used to reconstitute SCID mice.","Groups of mice (four to five per group) were injected with fifty-sixty\u00d710lymphocytes in 200-300 \u03bcl volume of HBSS intraperitoneally (i.p.) on day zero. For the groups that received anti-CD23 antibody, on day zero, PBMCs were mixed with anti-CD23 antibody (200 to 400 \u03bcg\/mouse) before i.p., injection and the second injection was given on day seven. All mice received 5000 IU per mouse of IL-4 i.p., between day zero to day five. A group which was not injected with antibody served as the control group. Mice were bled from a retro-orbital vein and the serum was analyzed for IgG and IgE on days fourteen, twenty-one, twenty-eight and thirty-five by ELISA.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0188"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"In order to clone primate immunoglobulin variable domains, Poly A+ RNA was separately isolated from approximately 2\u00d710cells from the primate heterohybridomas secreting the anti-human CD23 monoclonal antibodies 6G5 and 5E8 by using the Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation Kit (Invitrogen Catalog # K1520-02) according to methods set forth by the manufacturer.","The first strand of cDNA was synthesized from the poly A+ RNA by using the cDNA Cycle Kit (Invitrogen Catalog # L1310-01) according to conventional methods.","The light and heavy chain variable regions of 6G5 and 5E8 were then isolated by PCR from cDNA using PCR primers that were selected based upon different consensus families of human immunoglobulins. 5\u2032 primers were selected which corresponded to the beginning of the leader sequences of the light and heavy variable region and 3\u2032 primers were selected which corresponded to the J region (The specific primers used to PCR amplify the lambda light chain variable domain of 6G5, the kappa light chain variable domains of 5E8, and the heavy chain variable domains of 6G5 and 5E8 are set forth in Tables 1-3). PCR was performed according to standard methods (30 cycles with 1 minute at 94\u00b0 C., 1.5 minutes at 54\u00b0 C. and 2 minutes at 72\u00b0 C. in a Hot start 100 tube (Gibco BRL Catalog # 10332-013). PCR was set up in 50 \u03bcl reactions containing 5 \u03bcl out of 80 \u03bcl cDNA (from 2\u00d710cells) as a template, 2 \u03bcl of 5 nM dNTP, 1 \u03bcl of Taq polymerase, 5 \u03bcl of Taq polymerase buffer, 2 \u03bcl of the 5\u2032 primer (25 pmoles\/\u03bcl), 2 \u03bcl of the 3\u2032 primer (25 pmoles\/\u03bcl), and 36 \u03bcl of water. (Taq polymerase and buffer were obtained from Stratagene Catalog # 600131, dNTP from Boehringer Mannheim Catalog #1581295.)","A) Construction of the Plasmids N5LG1+6G5 and N5LG4P+6G5","1) Cloning the Light Chain Variable Domain of Primate Monoclonal Anti-human CD23 Antibody 6G5 by PCR","The first PCR amplification of the light chain variable region from the cDNA of primate monoclonal antibody 6G5 showed bands which were consistent in situ with the lambda light chain variable region. These bands appeared in all reactions using the three different early leader sequence primers. (See Tables 1-3.) However, the PCR product obtained using primer 745 (Family 2) was considered more specific because of the relatively greater intensity of the PCR product band.","This PCR product was isolated using a Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Catalog # 28704). The purified PCR fragment was digested with Bgl II and Avr II restriction endonucleases, and ligated into the mammalian expression vector N5LG1 which was digested with the same restriction endonucleases. Twenty microliters of the ligation mixture containing the purified PCR product from one fifty microliter PCR reaction, 100 mg N5LG1 vector, two microliters of 10\u00d7 ligation buffer (NEB Catalog # 202S) and two microliters of T4 ligase (NEB Catalog # 202S), were then incubated at 14\u00b0 C. overnight.","The mammalian expression vector N5LG1 contains genetic sequences (e.g., regulatory sequences, coding sequences) which provide for the expression of four separate proteins in a mammalian cell. They are:","(i) a partial immunoglobulin light chain with the human lambda light chain constant region and unique restriction endonuclease sites for inserting light chain variable domains;","(ii) a partial immunoglobulin heavy chain with the and human gamma 1 chain constant region coding sequences and unique restriction endonuclease sites for inserting heavy chain variable domains;","(iii) a neomycin phosphotransferase gene used to select for cells that have incorporated the plasmid and are resistant to the antibiotic Geneticin (Gibco BRL Catalog # 10131-1209); and","(iv) a murine dihydrofolate reductase gene (DHFR) which provides for the selection and genomic amplification when cells are cultured in the presence of methotrexate (MTX, Sigma Catalog # A-6770) (Reff et al., 83:433-445 (1994).","After ligation, the mixture was digested using Pme I restriction endonuclease, which digests the parent N5LG1 plasmid, but not the N5LG1 plasmid which has been ligated to the light variable domain of 6G5. After digestion, the mixture was transformed into \u00ae XL1-Blue competent cells (Stratagene Catalog # 200249) as follows.","One hundred microliters of competent cells were mixed with 10 \u03bcl of the above ligation mixture, set on ice for 30 minutes, then heated at 45\u00b0 C. for 30 seconds. This mixture was placed on ice for 2 minutes, and 900 \u03bcl of SOC, prewarmed to room temperature, was then added. (SOC is LB broth Gibco BRL Catalog # 10855-013, plus 0.02 M MgCl, 0.02 M MgSOand 0.02 M D-glucose.) After incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for an hour, the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 g for a minute, and 800 \u03bcl of supernatant discarded. The rest of the mixture was plated onto a LB agar (Gibco BRL Catalog # 12945-044) dish containing 50 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin (Amp, Gibco BRL Catalog # 13075-015). Plasmid DNA was isolated from individual colonies of that grew on the Amp plate by using the Wizard\u00ae Miniprep DNA purification system (Promega Catalog # A7510).","The isolated plasmid DNA was then characterized by digestion with Bgl II and Avr II followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. An ethidium stained DNA band of 400 bp was indicative of a potential successful cloning of a light chain variable domain.","To confirm this was an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain, sequencing was done using the Sequenase 7-Deaza-dGTP DNA Sequencing Kit (USB catalog # 70990) with sequencing primers 607 and GE 108. (See Sequencing Primers in Table 4.)","A second independent PCR amplification of the light chain from cDNA of primate monoclonal antibody 6G5 was effected using a 5\u2032 primer early leader sequence of lambda light chain family 2 (primer 745) (SEQ ID NO: 15) and the 3\u2032 J region primer 926 (SEQ ID NO: 17). (See Primers for PCR of the lambda light chain variable domain of 6G5 in Tables 1-3 (SEQ ID NOs: 9-25). The isolated PCR product (see technique above) was cloned into TA vector by using the Original TA Cloning( Kit (Invitrogen Catalog # K2000-01). The isolated miniprep DNA (see technique above) was examined under agarose gel electrophoresis after digestion with EcoR I restriction endonuclease. The resultant PCR product comprised in the TA vector was then sequenced (as described previously) using Sp6 (SEQ ID NO: 26) and M13(-40) (SEQ ID NO: 27) forward primers (See Sequencing primers in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOs: 26-35)).

domains of 6G5 into a mammalian expression vector, the heavy chain variable domain in the TA vector (obtained in the 3rd independent PCR) was digested with Nhe I and Sal I and cloned into the N5LG1 vector which was digested with the same restriction enzymes and which vector already contains the light chain variable domain. The resultant mammalian expression vector was named N5LG1+6G5.","To construct the N5LG4P+6G5 vector, both the light and heavy chain variable domains were isolated from N5LG1+6G5 by digestion of Bgl II and Avr II, and Nhe I and Sal I respectively. The mammalian expression vector N5LG4P vector is identical to the N5LG1 vector described above, except the human gamma 1 was replaced with a human gamma 4 constant region containing a mutation of a serine to a proline in the hinge region to increase stability of the immunoglobulin and improve pharmacokinetics in vivo (\u201cP\u201d mutation). The light chain variable domain was cloned in the plasmid first and the heavy chain variable domain was cloned into the vector containing the light chain variable domain using techniques previously described. This mammalian expression vector was named N5LG4P+6G5.","B. Construction of the Plasmids N5KG4P+5E8, N5KG1+5E8, N5KG4P+5E8N\u2212, and N5KG1+5E8N\u2212","1. Cloning the Light Chain Variable Domain of Primate Monoclonal Anti-Human CD23 Antibody 5E8 by PCR","The first PCR reaction of the light chain variable domain from FEE cDNA was carried out using a set of kappa early leader sequence primers and the 3\u2032 J region primer GE204 (SEQ ID NO: 13). (See primers for PCR of the kappa light chain variable domain of 5E8 in Tables 1-3 (SEQ ID NOs: 9-25)). A 420 base PCR product was obtained. The isolated 420 base PCR product was digested with Bgl II and BsiW I restriction endonucleases, cloned into the mammalian expression vector N5KG4P and sequenced using GE108 (SEQ ID NO: 29) and 377 (SEQ ID NO: 30) primers (which are contained in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOs: 26-35)): The mammalian expression vector N5KG4P is identical to the vector N5LG4P except it contains the human kappa light chain constant region in place of the human lambda light chain constant region. Sequencing of this 420 polynucleotide DNA revealed that it contains the entire kappa light chain variable domain.","A second independent PCR of the light chain variable region was performed using the 5\u2032 family 1 primer GE201 (SEQ ID NO: 9) and the 3\u2032 primer GE204 (SEQ ID NO: 13). (See primers for PCR of the kappa light chain variable domain of 5E8 in Tables 1-3 (SEQ ID NOs: 9-25)). The isolated PCR product was cloned into the TA vector (using methods previously described) and sequenced using Sp6 (SEQ ID NO: 26) and T7 promoter (SEQ ID NOs: 28) primers. Sequencing revealed that this PCR product was identical to that obtained from the first PCR.

of 5E8 was performed using a set of 5\u2032 early leader heavy chain sequence primers and the 3\u2032 primer GE210 (SEQ ID NO: 24). (See primers for PCR of the heavy chain variable domain of 6G5 and 5E8 in Table 1 (SEQ ID NOs: 9-13)). A 420 base PCR product appeared in the family 3 primer reaction. The PCR product was purified and then digested with Nhe I and Sal I and cloned into the mammalian expression vector N5KG4P vector (as described previously). The PCR product was sequenced using the 268 (SEQ ID NO: 33) and 928 (SEQ ID NO: 35) primers. (See sequencing primers in Table 4 (SEQ ID NOs: 26-35).)","A second independent PCR of the heavy chain variable domain of 5E8 was performed using the family 3 5\u2032 primer GE207 (SEQ ID NO: 20) and the 3\u2032 primer GE210 (SEQ ID NO: 24). (See primers for PCR of the, heavy chain variable domain of 6G5 and 5E8 in Tables 1-3 (SEQ ID NOs: 9-25)). The isolated PCR product was cloned into a TA vector using the same techniques previously described and sequenced by-using Sp6 (SEQ ID NO: 26) and T7 (SEQ ID NO: 28) primers. Sequencing revealed that the TAC at codon 91 had been changed into TGC.","In order to determine the appropriate codon at 91, a third independent PCR was performed using the same primers as the second PCR (see above). The PCR product was again cloned into a TA vector and sequenced using Sp6 (SEQ ID NO: 26) and T7 (SEQ ID NO: 28) primers. The sequence was found to be identical to the heavy chain variable sequence obtained in the first PCR. Therefore, the TGC at position 91 in the second independent PCR product is apparently the result of an error introduced during PCR. This entire sequence of the heavy chain variable domain of primate monoclonal anti-human CD23 antibody 6G5 is presented below (SEQ ID NOs: 7-8).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0189","num":"0223"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"0pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Heavy

This plasmid was then digested with the restriction endonucleases as previously described. This resulted in a vector containing both the light and heavy variable domain of 5E8. This vector was named N5KG4P+5E8. The heavy and light variable domains of N5KG4P+5E8 were then both inserted into the mammalian expression vector N5KG1 to create the N5KG1+5E8 vector.","4) Alteration of an Amino Acid in the Heavy Chain Variable Region of Primate Monoclonal Antibody 5E8 by Site Specific Mutagenesis and Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors","Based upon the sequence of the 5E8 heavy variable domain, there is a potential glycosylation site of the immununoglobulin at asparagine codon 75 (numbering according to Kabat, as shown above, which corresponds to position 78 of SEO ID NO:8). This potential glycosylation sire corresponds to a conserved asparagine-linked glycosylation motif having the following tripeptide sequence: (Asn)\u2014(Any amino acid except proline)\u2014(Serine or threonine). Therefore, a glycosylation mutant of 5E8, which would be unable to be glycosylated at this position because of modification of this glycosylation motif, was generated by replacing the asparagine codon 75 with a lysine (which is found in many human immunoglobulins at this position). Site specific mutagenesis was effected by the following methods.","A first PCR was done using N5KG4P+5E8 as a template and a 3\u2032 primer (corresponding to codon 71 to 79) and which contains a mutation at codon 75 (AAC changed to AAG, Primer MB1654 (SEQ ID NO: 39), and a 5\u2032 primer at the beginning of the leader sequence (Primer MB1650) (SEQ ID NO: 36). (See PCR Primers Used for the Generation of a Glycosylation Mutant of the Heavy Chain Variable Region 5E8 set forth in Table 5 (SEQ ID NOs: 36-39)).","A second PCR was performed on the same template by using a 5\u2032 primer (corresponding to codon 71 to 79) containing the same mutation (Primer MB1653) (SEQ ID NO: 38) and a 3\u2032 primer from the end of framework 4 (Primer MB1651) (SEQ ID NO: 37) (See PCR Primers Used for the Generation of a Glycosylation Mutant of the Heavy Chain Variable Region of 5E8 in Table 5 (SEQ. ID NOs: 36-39).)","These two PCR products were isolated and mixed in equal molar ratios. A third independent PCR was then carried out by using the mixture of the first and second PCP products as a template with a 5\u2032 primer used in the first PCR (MB1650) (SEQ ID NO: 36) and a 3\u2032 primer used in the second PCR (MP 1651) (SEQ ID NO: 37) (See PCP Primers Used for the Generation of a Glycosylation Mutant of the Heavy Chain Variable Region in Table 5 (SEQ ID NOs: 36-39).) The PCR product obtained in third PCR was found to contain the heavy variable domain coding region of 5E8 wherein the asparagine 75 had been changed to lysine.","The third PCR product was purified, digested with restriction endonucleases Sal I and Nhe I, and cloned into the N5KG4P containing the light variable domain only. The PCR product was sequenced to confirm that it comprised the mutant heavy variable domain. This mammalian expression plasmid was named N5KG4P+5E8N\u2212.","To construct of N5KG1+5E8N\u2212, both light and heavy variable domains from N5KG4P\u22125E8N\u2212 were digested with Bgl II and BsiW I, and Nhe I and Sal I respectively. The light variable domain was cloned first and then the heavy variable domain was inserted into the mammalian expression plasmid N5KG1, to create the plasmid N5KG1+5E8N\u2212.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0198","num":"0232"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"0pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

This was effected using the in vitro IL-4 IgE assay described supra.","These assay results surprisingly indicated that both human gamma-4 anti-human CD23 antibodies were not as active as the corresponding primate anti-human CD23 antibodies, i.e., they did not significantly inhibit induced IgE production in vitro.","However, because primate 5E8 and p5E8G4P have a potential asparagine linked glycosylation site in the heavy chain variable region, the effects of glycosylation at this site were investigated. (It was found that both these antibodies contain N-linked oligosaccharides at this site. (Data not shown.)) Therefore, in order to prevent glycosylation, the asparagine in the glycosylation site was changed to a lysine in order to eliminate carbohydrate addition. This mutated antibody was named p5E8G4PN-. Assay results demonstrated that this antibody behaved identically to p5E8G4P in the IL-4 IgE assay (see ) and also exhibited an identical apparent affinity Kd for human CD23. (See .) Therefore, these results indicated that the difference in IgE inhibition observed from the 5E8 gamma 4 PRIMATIZED\u00ae antibody in comparison to primate 5E8 antibody was not attributable to glycosylation differences.","The three primate antibodies (p5E8G4P, p5E8G4PN\u2212, and p6G5G4P) were then expressed as human gamma-1 versions using substantially the same methodology. All three human gamma-1 anti-human CD23 antibodies, respectively designated p5E8G1, p5E8G1N\u2212 and p6G5G1, were found to be active in the in vitro IL-4\/IgE\u2032 assay ().","p5E8G1 was found to be statistically more suppressive than p5E8G4P at a concentration of 0.3 \u03bcg\/ml (P[T,t] one tail+0.0055) and at 3 \u03bcg\/ml (p[T<t] one tail+0.0019).

(These results are in ).","Thus, these results suggested that an active Fc region, in particular that of human gamma-1, is significant for induced IgE inhibition by anti-human CD23 antibodies.","To confirm our hypothesis as to the involvement of the Fc effector portion in IgE inhibition of anti-human CD23 antibodies, a third primate antibody, designated 2C8, also shown to inhibit IgE in vitro) was converted to a F(ab\u2032).

Four milliliters of digestion buffer are then added. The pepsin is then separated from the buffer using the serum separator. The buffer is then discarded and the wash procedure repeated using another four milliliters of buffer. The immobilized pepsin is then resuspended in 0.5 ml of digestion buffer.","Preparation of Immobilized Protein A Column","Protein A AffinityPak\u00ae columns and ImmunoPure Binding and Elution buffers are brought to room temperature.","Preparation of 2C8 F(ab\u2032)Fragments","2C8 F(ab\u2032)fragments are prepared by methods well known in the antibody art. The inventors elected to use a commercially available kit, ImmunoPure F(ab\u2032)Preparation Kit (Pierce Catalog # 44888), using the manufacturer's protocols.","Ten milligrams of lyophilized 2C8 antibody were dissolved in one milliliter of a digestion buffer (20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5). One milliliter of the antibody containing sample was than added to a tube containing immobilized pepsin.","The antibody and immobilized pepsin were then incubated for four hours in a high speed shaker water bath at 37\u00b0 C. (at high speed), taking care to maintain the mixing constant during the incubation.","The resultant solubilized F(ab\u2032)and Fc fragments and the undigested IgGs were then recovered from the immobilized. pepsin gel using a serum separator. The crude digest is then decanted into a clean tube.","In order to enhance recovery of F(ab\u2032)fragments, the immobilized pepsin desirably is then washed with 1.5 of milliliters of the ImmunoPure IgG binding buffer. The wash is then added to the crude digest.","The antibody fragments were then recovered using a protein A column. This is effected by opening an immobilized protein A column. Care is taken to avoid air bubbles from being drawn into the gel. The storage solution (which contains 0.02% sodium azide) is discarded.","The immobilized protein A column was then equilibrated using twelve milliliters of binding buffer (contained in ImmunoPure Preparation Kit). The column was then transferred to a 17\u00d7100 mn test tube contained in the kit (labeled \u201cF(ab\u2032)\u201d) to collect eluate.","Three milliliters of the crude digest was then applied to a column and are allowed to flow completely into the gel. The use of AffinityPak\u2122 columns is desirable as these columns stop flowing automatically when the level reaches the top frit.","The column is then washed using six milliliters of binding buffer. The eluate which contains F(ab\u2032)fragments was then collected. This eluate also contains small Fc fragments that can no longer bind protein A (which are not bound to the Protein A column). However, the substantial portion thereof was eliminated by dialysis.","Dialysis was effected by taking the F(ab\u2032)containing eluate and dialyzing the eluate against pH 7.4 phosphate buffered saline, using dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut-off of 50,000 so as to eliminate the small Fc fragment containments (Spectra Pur. Catalog # 132 128).","This resulted in a F(ab\u2032)fraction having an optical density of 280 nm of 0.707 (6 ml). After dialysis and concentration with Centricon-50 concentrators (Amicon Catalog # 4225), the 2C8 F(ab\u2032)product was assayed for protein content using a BCA protein assay (Pierce Catalog # 23224). The protein content was found to be 3.76 mg per milliliter.","The 2C8 F(ab)'S were assayed for IgE inhibitory activity and were found to be substantially incapable of inhibiting IgE production in the same in vitro assays described previously. These results are contained in . In fact, the F(ab\u2032)was found to antagonize the suppressive effects of induced IgE on the monoclonal antibody 2C8. These results are in .","The PRIMATIZED\u00ae gamma 1 and gamma 4P versions of primate monoclonal 6G5 were both evaluated for their effect on inhibition of induced IgE production in vivo in the SCID mouse model described previously. p5E8G1N\u2212 was found to be as efficient as primate 5E8 in inhibiting induced IgE. (See ). While neither provide 6G5 nor the primatized p6G5G4P were effective at inhibiting induced IgE in vivo, primatized p6G5G1 inhibited induced IgE production. (See .) These results further substantiate our conclusion that an active Fc region is significant to the ability of an anti-human CD23 antibody to effectively inhibit induced IgE production.","The subject anti-human CD23 antibodies which comprise human gamma-1 constant domains, because of their ability to effectively inhibit IgE production, are effective in treating any disease wherein inhibition of IgE production is therapeutically desirable.
