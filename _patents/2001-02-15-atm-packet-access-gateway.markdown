title: ATM packet access gateway
abstract: An ATM Packet Access Gateway (ATM PAG) system manages an ATM bearer path extending between ATM endpoints participating, for example, in a VoATM call. The system includes an ATM PAG having a first ATM bearer connection termination for terminating a first bearer connection with a first ATM endpoint, and a second ATM connection termination for terminating a second bearer connection with a second ATM endpoint. A call control entity is associated with the ATM PAG and communicates call control instructions thereto. The call control instructions include instructions for logically concatenating the first and second ATM bearer connections into an active ATM bearer path extending between the first ATM endpoint and the second ATM endpoint. A Media Access Gateway (MAG) function of the ATM PAG is responsible for establishing the connections that form the ATM bearer path. An ATM switch function of the ATM PAG moves bearer traffic ATM packet payloads over the active ATM bearer path.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present application is related to commonly assigned copending application Ser. No. 09\/784,497, entitled IP Packet Access Gateway, filed on even date with the present application.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to telecommunication networks. More particularly, the invention concerns the control of voice calls in an ATM network.","2. Description of the Prior Art","By way of background, ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) packet networks are now being used to provide bearer pathways for voice communications. In these systems, voice calls between communicating parties are placed on through-connections established by ATM network switching nodes. Such connections are generally under the control of the parties' subscriber equipment, whose call state (on-hook or off-hook) determines connection status (setup, release, etc.).","What is lacking in conventional VoATM (Voice over ATM) systems is an interface for implementing bearer path connection control and manipulation at network points of entry or within the network. In particular, there is no mechanism for positive enforcement of bearer connection establishment and teardown. Connections cannot be terminated except by one or both of the communicating parties. This means that the parties might continue to talk even though billing for a call has stopped (i.e., because the bearer path remains open). Conversely, billing might continue after the parties have ended the call.","Conventional VoATM systems also lack ability to provide pivot points for VoATM lines and trunks carrying ATM bearer traffic into and out of an ATM backbone network. Such pivot points are currently only provided by LAGs (Line Access Gateways) and TAGs (Trunk Access Gateways) that interwork between TDM bearer traffic and packet-oriented (e.g., ATM, IP) bearer traffic. Without a pivot point on the trunk side of an ATM entry point of a switching node, the switching node needs to be aware of when another switching node in a call manipulates the bearer path. The bearer path thereby becomes a shared resource that all switching nodes jointly use to provide their own services. This greatly increases the complexity of implementing services because feature interactions cross switch boundaries. Without a pivot point on the line side of an ATM network entry point, the switching node cannot perform call redirection and insert\/remove service circuits in established connections to provide the usual features available to traditional TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) calls. Such services include N-way bridging, announcement playback, tone generation, tone detection, speech recognition, and multicasting.","In addition to the foregoing disadvantages of conventional VoATM systems, certain law enforcement statutes, such as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) (47 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), require that a call involving a surveillance subject remain under surveillance even after the subject is no longer a participant in the call. Because court orders for CALEA surveillance may limit the geographic scope over which the surveillance may be performed, there is a need to ensure that the bearer path for a call stays within the geographic bounds within which it may be surveilled. If calling parties are able to establish a bearer path using conventional ATM connections, there is no such guarantee.","Accordingly, there is a need in an ATM network providing VoATM service for an interface system that implements bearer path connection control and manipulation at ATM points of entry of a switching node. The same capability is also needed when data and video calls are transported over ATM.","The foregoing problems are solved and an advance in the art is obtained by an ATM Packet Access Gateway (ATM PAG) system for managing an ATM bearer path extending between ATM endpoints participating in an ATM call. The system includes an ATM PAG having a first ATM connection termination for terminating a first bearer connection with a first ATM endpoint, and a second ATM connection termination for terminating a second bearer connection with a second ATM endpoint. A call control entity is associated with the ATM PAG and communicates call control instructions thereto. The call control instructions include instructions for logically concatenating the first and second ATM bearer connections into an active ATM bearer path extending between the first ATM endpoint and the second ATM endpoint. A Media Access Gateway (MAG) function of the ATM PAG is responsible for establishing the connections that form the ATM bearer path. An ATM switch function of the ATM PAG moves bearer traffic ATM packet payloads over the active ATM bearer path.","Turning now to the Drawing, wherein like reference numbers indicate like elements in all of the several views,  illustrates an ATM PAG system  for managing an ATM bearer path between communicating ATM endpoints. The system  includes an ATM PAG  having a first ATM connection termination  for terminating a first bearer connection  with a first ATM endpoint  via an ATM Access Network . The ATM PAG  further includes a second ATM connection termination  for terminating a second bearer connection  with a second ATM endpoint  via an ATM backbone network . A call control entity  is associated with the ATM PAG  and communicates call control instructions thereto. The call control instructions include instructions for logically concatenating (see reference numeral ) the first and second bearer connections  and  into an active ATM bearer path  extending between the first ATM endpoint  and the second ATM endpoint .","Turning now to , the ATM PAG  preferably includes an ATM switch  and a Media Access Gateway . The ATM switch  acts as an ATM bearer traffic packet handler that moves bearer traffic ATM packet payloads over the active ATM bearer path . The ATM bearer traffic carried over the first bearer connection  is transported via a physical interface  between the ATM Access Network  and the ATM Switch . The ATM bearer traffic carried over the second bearer connection  is transported via a physical interface  between the ATM Backbone Network  and the ATM Switch . Preferably, the ATM switch  is configured to carry at least CBR (Constant Bit Rate) traffic. The ATM switch  is preferably further configured to deliver UNI (User Network Interface) or NNI (Network to Network Interface) signaling traffic to and from the MAG . UNI\/NNI signaling traffic is carried over a signaling channel  (via the interface ) between the ATM Access Network  and the ATM Switch . UNI\/NNI signaling traffic is carried over a signaling channel  (via the interface ) between the ATM Backbone Network  and the ATM Switch . The ATM switch  is configured to deliver ATM cells on the signaling channel  to\/from the Media Access Gateway  on a signaling channel . The ATM switch  is configured to deliver ATM cells on the signaling channel  to\/from the Media Access Gateway  on a signaling channel . Thus the Media Access Gateway  controls the UNI\/NNI signaling channel for the interfaces  and .  further shows a UNI signaling channel  between the ATM switch  and the MAG . The MAG  uses proxy signaling on the UNI signaling channel  to control the establishment of connection  in the ATM switch .","The MAG  thus has three signaling channels. The MAG  uses signaling channel to send\/receive UNI\/NNI signaling messages to\/from the ATM Access Network  in order to control ATM bearer connection establishment on the interface . The MAG  uses signaling channel to send\/receive UNI\/NNI signaling messages to\/from the ATM Backbone Network  in order to control ATM bearer connection establishment on the interface . The MAG  uses proxy signaling on the UNI signaling channel  to control the establishment of ATM bearer connections within the ATM switch , e.g. connection . Thus, the MAG  contains 3 signaling entities, one for each signaling channel. Each of these signaling entities will have a different address. The address designation \u201caddr_mag_bb\u201d will be used to signify the address known by the ATM backbone network  for the signaling channel . The address designation \u201caddr_mag_acc\u201d will be used to signify the address known by the ATM access network  for the signaling channel . The address designation \u201caddr_mag_px\u201d will be used to signify the address known by the ATM switch  for the signaling channel .","The ATM PAG  can be implemented as a nonintegrated system wherein the ATM switch  and the MAG  reside on separate computer platforms, and communicate using UNI proxy signaling (see below) or a suitable API (Application Programming Interface). The ATM PAG  may also be implemented as an integrated system wherein the ATM switch  and the MAG  reside on the same computer platform and communicate via an internal interface. This platform can include a conventional ATM hardware board (not shown) for implementing the ATM switch , such that all ATM bearer traffic is hardware switched. The functions of the MAG  can be implemented in software. Signaling packets may then be routed over a local bus from the ATM switch's hardware board to a local CPU for processing. The same (or different) bus may be used for passing call control messages between the CPU and the communication link .","The call control entity  can be implemented using a conventional CFS (Call Feature Server)\/MGP (Media Gateway Proxy) with appropriate software modifications being made to implement the call control functions described herein. The call control entity  can communicate with the ATM PAG  using the IPDC (Internet Protocol Device Control) protocol, or any other suitable media gateway control protocol (e.g. H.248 (also known as the Media gateway control (Megaco) protocol)). The IPDC protocol is well known in the art, but extensions are required to support the ATM-PAG functions described herein. The call control entity  may be implemented on a separate computer platform froth the ATM PAG , or on the same platform.","Turning now to , an embodiment of the invention is shown for use in a network switching node . In this embodiment, an ATM PAG system  includes an ATM PAG  connected to an ATM backbone network , and a call control entity  connected to an SS7 (Signaling System 7) network  supporting BICC (Bearer Independent Call Control) messaging.","The switching node  further includes a Trunk Access Gateway (TAG)  that terminates one or more TDM trunks (not shown) and a Line Access Gateway (LAG)  that terminates one or more TDM lines (not shown). Both the trunk side of the TAG  and the line side of the LAG  handle TDM traffic. The TAG  and the LAG  also have an ATM side adapted to handle ATM traffic, and an internal interworking function for interworking between the TDM and ATM traffic. Note that the switching node  could be alternatively implemented as a tandem switch having multiple PAGs and no TAG or LAG.","A MultiMedia Resource Server (MMRS) is shown at . It provides multimedia content such as tones, announcements, and the like to communicating parties. Other devices, such as interworking gateways, interworking units, and data termination systems, could likewise be added to the switching node , depending on the services that are required. Like the TAG  and the LAG , the MMRS  has an ATM side that adapts the MMRS' stored multimedia content to the ATM AAL1 protocol.","An ATM access network  interconnects the ATM PAG , the TAG , the LAG  and the MMRS . The ATM access network  can be implemented using the GX\u2122550 Core ATM switch product from Lucent Technologies, Inc., or any other suitable switching platform. The ATM access network  allows bearer connections to be established between any of the aforementioned entities that it interconnects. Such connections are setup under the control of the call control entity , which communicates not only with the ATM PAG , but also the TAG , the LAG  and the MMRS . As described above, the IPDC protocol can be used (but is not necessarily required) for control signaling sent by the call control entity  to the other entities of the switching node .","The ATM PAG , together with the call control entity , performs the ATM PAG functions described above relative to . Namely, the ATM PAG  and the call control entity  implement per-call control of bearer paths between the TAG , the LAG , and other (remote or local) ATM endpoints. For example, as shown in , ATM bearer traffic may be carried on a bearer path that includes an intra-office connection between the TAG  or the LAG  and the ATM PAG . This connection extends through the ATM access network . The same bearer path also includes an inter-office connection between the ATM PAG  and a counterpart ATM PAG  located at a peer office . This connection extends through the ATM backbone network .","An exemplary call set-up sequence to establish the foregoing bearer path will now be described with continuing reference to FIG. . It will be assumed that an end user (not shown) has connected to the office  via a TDM interface with the TAG  or the LAG . It will be further assumed that the end user has requested the office  to set up a call to a party represented by the peer office . In response, the call control entity  sends a BICC message to the peer office . This message contains the ATM backbone network address of the ATM PAG . Note that the peer office  includes a counterpart call control entity  that receives the BICC message from the call control entity . The counterpart call control entity  instructs the counterpart ATM PAG  to send an ATM UNI\/NNI SETUP message toward the ATM PAG  via the ATM backbone network . This results in an inter-office SVC (Switched Virtual Circuit) connection being established between the ATM PAG  and the counterpart ATM PAG . Note that as an alternative to the foregoing, the call control entity  could provide the address of the counterpart ATM PAG  to the ATM PAG  (if the address was provided to call control entity  in a BICC message from the call control entity ) and request the latter to initiate the inter-office SVC connection.","Substantially simultaneously with the inter-office SVC connection being established, the call control entity  instructs the TAG  or the LAG , depending on which entity made the call request, to send an ATM UNI SETUP message with the ATM Access Network address of the ATM PAG  to the ATM Access Network . An intra-office SVC connection is negotiated and established in response to this request. Note that the call control entity  could also request the ATM PAG  to originate an ATM UNI SETUP message to the TAG  or the LAG . Once both of the foregoing SVC connections are established, the call control entity  instructs the ATM PAG  to through-connect the connections and establish an end-to-end bearer path between the TAG  or LAG , representing a first ATM endpoint, and the counterpart ATM PAG  in the peer office , representing a second ATM endpoint.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["60","56","48","44","56","44","56","48","44","44","60","62","44","56","56","60","48","52","54","44","52","54","44"]},"The above-described connection scenarios illustrate that the ATM PAG  can act as a bearer traffic pivot point that supports call redirection and the insertion\/removal of service circuits in established connections. This means that features such as conferencing and transfer, call waiting, multiple call appearances, shared DN (Directory Number), and call pickup can all be supported for VoATM calls. More particularly, the ATM PAG  can be used to support functions such as (1) bearer-hold-and-alternate, (2) bearer-move, (3) bearer bridging, (4) dial tone, (5) stutter dial tone, (6) reorder tone, (7) call waiting tone, (8) digit collection\/flash detection, (9) audible ringing toward a caller for incoming calls, and (10) comfort noise toward a caller when a bearer path is placed on hold. Wiretapping support is also provided due to the ability keep bearer connections routed through the fixed location of the ATM PAG .","Turning now to , an exemplary call set-up procedure will be described for a BICC call involving an ATM PAG in accordance with the invention. In , a switching node  in a VoATM communication system includes an ATM PAG  comprising a MAG  and an ATM switch . In addition, there is a call control entity  and a LAG  serving a caller who shall be designated as \u201cuser_a.\u201d An ATM access network  interconnects the LAG  and the ATM PAG . An ATM backbone network  allows a remote caller, who shall be designated as \u201cuser_b,\u201d to communicate with user_a through the switching node . User_b is assumed to be served by a remote ATM PAG  in a peer network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["76","74","82","74","83","74","74","78","80","78","84","72"]},"It is at this point that step of  is implemented. In this step, the remote ATM PAG  sends an ATM UNI SETUP message to the ATM Backbone Network . The message sent to the ATM Backbone Network  contains the destination address of the MAG  (addr_mag_bb) for that network and a correlation tag (ct). In step , the ATM Backbone Network  processes this message and forwards it to the ATM PAG , and specifically to the MAG . The message sent to the MAG  contains the destination address of the MAG  (addr_mag_bb), a virtual path connection identifier (vpci), a virtual channel identifier (vci), and a correlation tag (ct). The message is sent on the usual ATM signaling channel (vpi\/vci=0\/5) to the ATM switch . There, it is intercepted at a signaling intercept point  and directed to the MAG  on a local (intra-pag) signaling channel  (vpi\/vci\u22600\/5). Note that the correlation tag is a known ATM message parameter that allows the ATM bearer setup messages to be correlated with the BICC call control messages. In step , the MAG  sends an IPDC message (ipdc conn_ind(ct)) to the call control entity  to advise that an SVC connection request from the remote ATM PAG  has been received. In step , the call control entity  sends an IPDC message (ipdc conn_reply(accept, ct) to the MAG  instructing it to accept the requested SVC connection. In step , the MAG  sends an ATM UNI CONNECT message to the ATM Backbone Network . This message is sent on the local (intra-pag) signaling channel  to the ATM switch and is placed on the normal ATM signaling channel (vpi\/vci=0\/5) at the signaling intercept point . In step , the ATM Backbone Network  sends an ATM UNI CONNECT message to the remote ATM PAG , thereby establishing the SVC connection. Note that this connection is terminated at an ATM connection termination  in the ATM switch , and not at the MAG  itself.","In step , the call control entity  initiates setup of the next SVC connection by sending an IPDC message (ipdc conn_req(addr_lag, ct) to the MAG . This message instructs the MAG  to set up an SVC connection to the LAG  and to assign the connection a correlation tag (ct). In step , the MAG  sends an ATM UNI SETUP message to the ATM access network . This message contains the destination address of the LAG  (addr_lag) and the correlation tag (ct) specified by the call control entity  in step . It is sent on a local (intra-pag) signaling channel  (vpi\/vci\u22600\/5) to a signaling intercept point  in the ATM switch . From there, the message is sent the ATM access network  on the normal ATM signaling channel (vpi\/vci=0\/5). In step , the ATM access network  generates its own ATM UNI SETUP message and sends it to the LAG . This message includes the destination address of the LAG  (addr_lag), a virtual path connection identifier (vpci) a virtual channel identifier (vci), and the correlation tag (ct). In step , the LAG  responds to the UNI SETUP request of step with a UNI CONNECT message. In step , the ATM access network  sends a UNI CONNECT message which contains a virtual path connection identifier (vpci), a virtual channel identifier (vci) to the MAG , and the second SVC connection is established. Note that this connection is terminated at the ATM switch  at an ATM connection termination , and not at the MAG  itself. In step , the MAG  sends an IPDC message (ipdc conn_conf(addr_lag, ct) to the call control entity , advising that the second SVC connection has been set up.","In step , the call control entity  sends an IPDC message (ipdc tconn_req (ct,ct)) which instructs the MAG  to concatenate the two connections within the ATM switch . This message instructs the MAG  to concatenate the two connections identified by ct and ct. In step , MAG  sends a UNI SETUP message to ATM switch  using proxy signaling. This message is sent on a local (intra-pag) proxy signaling channel (vpi\/vci=0\/5) . It contains the proxy destination address of the MAG  (addr_mag_px), the correlation tag (ct\u2014which is an internal identifier assigned by MAG ), a virtual path connection identifier (vpci1%) and a virtual channel identifier (vci1). The Switch  is configured such that the VPCI value vpci1% identifies the interface and VPI value identified by vpci1 in step . In step , the ATM switch  generates its own ATM UNI SETUP message and sends it to the MAG  over the proxy signaling channel . This message includes the proxy destination address of the MAG  (addr_mag_px) and the correlation tag (ct3). Based on the identifier ct3, the MAG  knows this message was a result of the message it sent in step . In step , the MAG  responds to the UNI SETUP request of step with a UNI CONNECT message. This message contains a virtual path connection identifier (vpci2%) and a virtual channel identifier (vci). The ATM switch  is configured such that the VPCI value vpci2% identifies the interface and VPI value identified by vpci in step . The connections are now through-connected between the ATM termination points  and . In step , the MAG  sends an IPDC message (ipdc tconn_conf(ct,ct) to the call control entity , advising that the two SVC connections have been concatenated. The LAG  generates a ringback tone to the remote ATM PAG , and the ATM bearer path is ready for use.","Accordingly, an ATM Packet Access Gateway (ATM PAG) system has been disclosed for managing an ATM bearer path between ATM endpoints. Advantageously, by serving as a point of connection mediation, the disclosed ATM PAG system provides per-call control of ATM bearer paths independently of the actions of the communicating endpoints. When implemented in a VoATM communication network, the ATM PAG system of the invention provides feature independence by allowing each switching node to implement calling features independently of features being implemented at other switching nodes. Without the ATM PAG system, activation of call feature requests from ATM endpoints would require cooperation between the switching nodes involved in a call. Because each switching node operates independently of the other, there would be a possibility of simultaneous and conflicting feature requests being implemented. The ATM PAG system of the invention eliminates the possibility of such conflicts as well as the need for negotiation when activating feature requests. Support for communications assistance for law enforcement is also provided by virtue of the fact that a bearer path can be held within a geographic boundary in which it may be surveilled. By comparison, in VoATM calls handled by traditional routers, there is no such guarantee of geographic control.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it should be apparent that many variations and alternative embodiments could be implemented in accordance with the invention. As briefly mentioned above, for example, instead of using UNI proxy signaling between a nonintegrated MAG and ATM switch comprising an ATM PAG, a specialized API could be developed to handle the concatenation of bearer connections. It will also be appreciated that the call control entity disclosed herein could be a distributed system, with one call control entity component controlling the ATM PAG and another controlling a TAG or a LAG. In addition, as also mentioned above, the MAG can be integrated into an ATM switch, which would make the interface between the ATM switch function and the ATM MAG function an internal interface. In addition to Voice over ATM calls, there could be data and video over ATM calls and the invention would also apply to these calls. It is understood, therefore, that the invention is not to be in any way limited except in accordance with the spirit of the appended claims and their equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["The foregoing and other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying Drawing, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
