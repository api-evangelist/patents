The management of vehicles within a fleet as well as assets involves obtaining information, generally in real-time, about the location and movement of these objects. The fleet manager utilizes this information to maximize use of fleet resources. With the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) supported by a constellation of satellites, a vehicle may determine its location with great accuracy and convenience if no obstruction exists between the GPS receiver within the vehicle and the satellites. Additionally, the infrastructure investment by service providers to implement a fleet and asset management system is significant. Consequently, such service providers are continually seeking new and enhanced services to derive maximal benefit (e.g., profits) from this large investment. Therefore, these service providers seek to offer an efficient, cost-effective fleet and asset management service with robust capability by effectively integrating GPS technology with wireless networks as to minimize bandwidth in the exchange of telemetry data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1101","1103","1103","1101","1103","1105","1107","1107","1105","1105"]},"Specifically, a GPS device  may determine three-dimensional geolocation from signals obtained from at least four satellites. Measurements from satellite tracking and monitoring stations located around the world are incorporated into orbital models for each satellite to compute precise orbital or clock data. GPS signals are transmitted over two spread spectrum microwave carrier signals that are shared by all of the GPS satellites . The device  must be able to identify the signals from at least four satellites , decode the ephemeris and clock data, determine the pseudo range for each satellite , and compute the position of the receiving antenna. The time required to acquire a position depends on several factors including the number of receiving channels, processing power of the receiving device, and strength of the satellite signals.","The above arrangement, as an autonomous GPS environment, has a number of drawbacks that can hinder its effectiveness as a fleet management system. Because the GPS device  must obtain all of the ephemeris data from the satellite signals, weak signals can be problematic. A building location or a location in any area that does not have clear view of the satellite constellation  can prevent the GPS device  from determining its geolocation. Also, cold start acquisition may consume a few seconds to as much as a few minutes, which is a significant delay for the device's ability to log positional information and evaluate its position against pre-configured alert conditions.","The vehicles  then need to transmit the location information to the wireless network . These transmissions can consume large amounts of bandwidth of the wireless network  if the location information is continually transmitted without attention to the polling scheme and the underlying transmission protocol used to transport such data.","Therefore, there is a need for a fleet and asset management system that effectively integrates GPS technology to ensure timely acquisition of location information. There is also a need to efficiently utilize precious resources of the wireless network in support of fleet and asset management services.","These and other needs are addressed by the present invention, in which an approach for configuring telemetry devices over a wireless network (e.g., paging system) is provided. The telemetry device includes a programmable input\/output (I\/O) port, which can be either digital or analog, that interfaces with an object (vehicle or asset). A fleet and asset management system transmits a configuration message over the wireless network to one of the telemetry devices for configuring the I\/O port of the telemetry device. The telemetry device sets parameters (e.g., pin settings, electrical values, etc.) relating to the I\/O port according to the configuration message. The fleet and asset management system can also issue a control message to the telemetry device to control operation of the telemetry device based on the state of the I\/O port. Further, the fleet and asset management system can supply Assisted-Global Positioning System (A-GPS) data to the telemetry device, which itself is capable of autonomously obtaining GPS data from GPS satellites. The above arrangement advantageously provides flexibility and increased functionality for tracking telemetry devices in support of fleet and asset management.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method for configuring telemetry devices over a wireless network is disclosed. The method includes storing transmitting a configuration message over the wireless network to one of the telemetry devices for configuring an input\/output (I\/O) port of the one telemetry device, wherein the I\/O port couples to an object, and the one telemetry device sets parameters relating to the I\/O port according to the configuration message. The method also includes receiving data corresponding to the I\/O port of the one telemetry device for managing a plurality of objects corresponding to the telemetry devices.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a fleet and asset management system for configuring telemetry devices over a wireless network is disclosed. The system includes a presentation server configured to generate a configuration message for transmission over the wireless network to one of the telemetry devices for configuring an input\/output (I\/O) port of the one telemetry device, wherein the I\/O port couples to an object, and the one telemetry device sets parameters relating to the I\/O port according to the configuration message. Additionally, the system includes a messaging server configured to transmit the configuration message and to receive data corresponding to the I\/O port of the one telemetry device for managing a plurality of objects corresponding to the telemetry devices.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a computer-readable medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions for configuring telemetry devices over a wireless network is disclosed. The one or more sequences of one or more instructions including instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the step of transmitting a configuration message over the wireless network to one of the telemetry devices for configuring an input\/output (I\/O) port of the one telemetry device, wherein the I\/O port couples to an object, and the one telemetry device sets parameters relating to the I\/O port according to the configuration message. Another step includes receiving data corresponding to the I\/O port of the one telemetry device for managing a plurality of objects corresponding to the telemetry devices.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for configuring telemetry devices over a wireless network is disclosed. The method includes communicating with a fleet and asset management system to obtain information about a plurality of objects. The method also includes receiving a user input relating to configuration of one of a plurality of telemetry devices corresponding to the plurality of objects. Further method includes, in response to the user input, transmitting the user input to the fleet and asset management, wherein the fleet and asset management generates a configuration message based on the user input for transmission over the wireless network to the one telemetry device for configuring an input\/output (I\/O) port of the one telemetry device, the I\/O port being coupled to a corresponding one of the objects, and the one telemetry device setting parameters relating to the I\/O port according to the configuration message.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a client device for configuring telemetry devices over a wireless network is disclosed. The device includes means for communicating with a fleet and asset management system to obtain information about a plurality of objects; means for receiving a user input relating to configuration of one of a plurality of telemetry devices corresponding to the plurality of objects; and means for transmitting the user input to the fleet and asset management, in response to the user input. The fleet and asset management generates a configuration message based on the user input for transmission over the wireless network to the one telemetry device for configuring an input\/output (I\/O) port of the one telemetry device, the I\/O port being coupled to a corresponding one of the objects, and the one telemetry device setting parameters relating to the I\/O port according to the configuration message.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The present invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawing and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A system, method, and software for configuring a telemetry device in support of fleet and asset management are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 11"],"b":["100","100","101","103","105","103","107","103","101","107","103","100"]},"According to one embodiment of the present invention, the wireless network  provides over the air encrypted messages.","The NOC  provides the necessary fleet and asset management functions, such as user account creation and management, access control, and deployment of business rules; these functions are more fully described below with respect to . The NOC  also supports remote management capabilities by hosts  over a data network , such as the global Internet.","To better understand the hybrid A-GPS environment of the system , it is instructive to describe the operation of the general operation of a mobile-centric A-GPS system. The telemetry device  has GPS hardware and intelligence, whereby the network  in conjunction with the NOC  employs mechanisms for providing GPS aiding data (or assistance data). The network  includes base transmitters and some base receivers containing GPS hardware from which the ephemeris and approximate location can be obtained, constituting a GPS reference network .","The assistance data that is transmitted to the devices , in an exemplary embodiment, can include ephemeris data differential GPS correct data, timing data and\/or other aiding data. Using the aiding (or assistance) data, the telemetry devices  perform geolocation calculations, yielding a number of advantages. For example, the telemetry devices  can generate real-time speed and route adherence alerts. Additionally, transmission of geolocation data need not be frequent. Transmission of geolocation data is more compact because it is true location rather than pseudo range data. Also, the telemetry devices  themselves can determine when the ephemeris data is no longer valid.","The hybrid A-GPS system  thus permits fast and precise geolocation when in network coverage of the network , while providing immunity from obstructed view of the sky. Also, when the switch is made to autonomous GPS mode (when outside of the coverage area of the network ), the devices  can still obtain geolocation data. This data can be stored within the device  and transmitted to the NOC  when the associated vehicle  returns to the network coverage area.","As noted earlier, the telemetry devices  may be attached to a host entity such as a vehicle or other valuable asset. The device may be used to track, monitor, and control aspects of the host entity. These devices  are configurable with respect to the existence and number of digital inputs\/outputs (I\/O), analog inputs\/outputs (I\/O), and device port interfaces for connection with peripheral devices. By way of examples, the digital inputs can be used to monitor various components of the vehicles : ignition status, door lock status, generic switch status, headlight status, and seat occupancy status. The digital outputs can be used to control, for example, the starter, and door locks, and to monitor such parameters as engine temperature, cargo temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, ambient temperature, and battery voltage. The exact configuration of the telemetry devices  can be based on cost consideration and\/or applications.","The telemetry devices , in an exemplary embodiment, employ a wireless protocol to receive commands and transmit data and alerts (e.g., high speed alert) over the radio network . The telemetry devices  can queue alerts, message responses, and scheduled data, whereby if the devices  are unable to send the messages, the messages are queued and sent when the device  returns to wireless network coverage. Prioritized queues are used and include, for example, queues for high, normal, and low priority messages. In the exemplary implementation, critical device status changes are given highest priority, while other alerts and responses are given normal priority. Scheduled data messages are given the lowest priority. The queues are configured, as first in yields first out, wherein new messages are dropped when its corresponding queue is full. This arrangement advantageously allows for the status of the device  at the time of transmission failure to be known even when the data stored in the data log at time of the transmission has been overwritten.","The telemetry devices  can also respond to status (e.g., of position, speed, digital I\/O port status, analog input channel status, peripheral status or other device status) queries transmitted by the NOC . The status query may request either current status or status within a time and date range. The device  responds to the query with either the current status or all status within the date and time range that is currently stored in the device's data log.","As regards data logging, the devices  support use of one or more schedules for the data acquisition. The data logging involves storing of the data locally on the device . This data, which can include position, speed, digital I\/O port status, analog input channel status, peripheral status or other device status is not automatically transmitted over the air. Instead, the data is stored for a finite period of time and made available for use by scheduled data acquisitions, data acquisitions on demand, and data acquisitions associated with alerts. The data log is circular in that when the last available memory for the data logger has been written, the data logger begins recording new data at the first location of memory available for the data logger.","With scheduled acquisitions of the data collected by the data logger, the data within the data log is transmitted by the device  according to a configurable schedule at the configured transmission rate. Multiple schedules may be configured on the device . Schedules are configured to obtain data at a regular interval based upon calendar time and date. Schedules may be configured such that they are enabled and disabled based upon status of a digital input. For example, an ignition status input may be used to turn a schedule on when the engine is on and turn the schedule off when the engine is off. A Response (or Data) Message Window value can be configured on the device , such that the device  delays sending scheduled data using an Offset within the Data Message Window (shown in ). That is, the scheduled transmit time is adjusted by the Offset, the device  delays queuing the scheduled data until the time is equal to the transmit time plus the Offset. Use of the Data Message Window helps prevent overwhelming the wireless network when many devices are scheduled to transmit data at the same time. For example, it is likely that many schedules will be based upon transmitting on the hour, half past the hour, or at fifteen minute intervals. Using the Offset ensures that the scheduled data transmissions from all of the devices with similar schedules are not sent at precisely the same time. Given the precision of the telemetry device's clock (as it is based upon GPS time), this randomization of regularly scheduled device transmissions is particularly useful.","As mentioned previously, the telemetry devices  can be configured to monitor a variety of information relating to the vehicle or asset through the digital I\/O and analog I\/O. For instance, alerts can be used to indicate status change of the digital inputs. Each Digital Input Status Change Alert can be enabled and disabled through configuration. The alert may be configured to transmit other device status recorded at the time of the alert such as position, speed, status of other digital I\/O ports, analog input status, peripheral status, or other device status. As regards the digital output, the status of each available digital output can be changed or read.","Similarly, the statuses of analog inputs of the devices  are monitored for change. In an exemplary embodiment, multiple threshold levels (e.g., high and low) can be set, whereby alerts are generated (e.g., Low Range Entry alert, Low Range Exit, High Range Entry, and High Range Exit). That is, if the value of the Analog Input falls below the Low Threshold, a Low Range Entry Alert is generated. If the value of the Analog Input rises above the Low Threshold plus a Hysteresis is value, a Low Range Exit Alert is generated. In similar fashion, if the value of the Analog Input rises above the High Threshold, a High Range Entry Alert is output from the device . Also, if the value of the Analog Input falls below the High Threshold minus a Hysteresis value, a High Range Exit Alert is generated. The alert may be configured to transmit other device status recorded at the time of the alert such as position, speed, status of other digital I\/O ports, analog input status, peripheral status, or other device status.","By way of example, the devices  can be used to monitor excessive speed via a High Speed Alert Control, whereby a High Speed Threshold can be set by a fleet manager. In addition, a duration parameter (i.e., High Speed Duration) can be utilized to specify the time at which the High Speed Threshold must be exceeded before an alert is generated. Further, a configurable High Speed Hysteresis parameter is set as the delta change below the High Speed Threshold used to determine when the High Speed Threshold has no longer been exceeded. The alert may be configured to transmit other device status recorded at the time of the alert such as position, speed, status of other digital I\/O ports, analog input status, peripheral status, or other device status.","The system  also permits users via the hosts  to specify and configure areas of interest within the coverage area of the network  such that alerts can be generated when a device  enters or exits the configured areas. The alert may be configured to transmit other device status recorded at the time of the alert such as position, speed, status of other digital I\/O ports, analog input status, peripheral status, or other device status.","The data collected and transmitted by the telemetry devices  are processed by the NOC , the components of which are described in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["103","107","103"]},"In this exemplary embodiment, the telemetry device  includes a two-way wireless modem  for receiving and transmitting signals over the wireless network  according to the communication protocols supported by the wireless network , such as the Motorola ReFLEX\u2122 protocol for two-way paging. By way of example, a Karli ReFLEX\u2122 module by Advantra International can be used for the modem . The two-way wireless modem  couples to a two-way wireless antenna (not shown) that can be placed local to the device  or remote from the device  (e.g., 12 or more feet) to enhance flexibility in installation.","The telemetry device  also contains a GPS module  that is capable of operating in the multiple GPS modes: autonomous GPS mode, and mobile-based A-GPS mode. The GPS module  can employ, for example, a GPS receiver manufactured by FastraX-iTrax02\/4. In autonomous mode, GPS data may be acquired with no assistance data provided by the wireless network . The GPS module  operates in the A-GPS mode when the device  is in wireless network coverage, in which assistance data is supplied and can include ephemeris data and data to obtain location in obstructed view locations (in building, wooded areas, etc.). Further, the assistance can include differential GPS (DGPS) to enhance location accuracy under some conditions. The GPS module  couples to a GPS antenna (not shown) that can be placed local to the device  or remote from the device  (e.g., 12 or more feet) to enhance flexibility in installation.","Attachment of peripheral modules to the telemetry device  are supported by one or more peripheral ports . The ports , for example, can be used to connect to intelligent peripherals that operate according to business rules and logic. These business rules and logic can be housed in a vehicle harness (not shown), which include an On-Board Diagnostic (OBDII) interface and intelligence. Under this arrangement, a user (e.g., fleet manager) can query any parameter available through the OBDII interface. For example, data obtained for each tracking record can include any combination of the following items: RPM (Revolutions Per Minute), oil pressure, coolant temperature, etc. Such data recorded by the telemetry device  is stored in memory . The acquisition period for the data is configurable, as well as the transmission interval to the NOC . Furthermore, the monitoring and subsequent data exchange can be governed by a configurable schedule, which can specify such parameters as start date, start time, end time, recurrence (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), and duration.","Data is logged by a data logger , made available for use by scheduled data acquisitions, data acquisitions on demand, and data acquisitions associated with alerts. As mentioned, the telemetry device  also can be configured to include digital I\/O  and analog I\/O  for monitoring and control of the vehicle or asset. The data logger  also collects data associated with these I\/O ports , .","The telemetry device  also includes a processor  that may handle arithmetic computations, and may support operating system and application processing. The processor , while shown as a single block, may be configured as multiple processors, any of which may support multipurpose processing, or which may support a single function.","The memory  of the telemetry device  can be organized to include multiple queues for prioritizing the messages to be processed by the device . In an exemplary embodiment, the memory  includes a High Priority queue , a Medium Priority queue , and Low Priority queue . The memory , while shown as a single block, may be configured as multiple memory devices, any of which may support static or dynamic storage, and may include code for operating system functionality, microcode, or application code.","Data recorded by the telemetry device  may additionally be stored in a storage medium other than the prioritized queues , , and , such as in a flash memory . A log (not shown) of information may be kept so that the information may be transmitted according to a schedule, as discussed above, or, e.g., upon receipt of a request to send all data that has been collected. Storage devices have only a finite amount of space for storage of information, and thus the information for only a finite number of messages may be stored in either the prioritized queues , ,  or the flash memory .","To improve availability of the telemetry device , an internal battery  is optionally included. With the internal battery, the telemetry device  can continue to monitor and transmit alerts and status information to the NOC  even if the electrical system of a vehicle is inoperable. Additionally, the internal battery  can be used by the device  to gracefully report power status wirelessly and shut down gracefully when the energy level of the internal battery is becoming to low to sustain operation of the device","The functions of the NOC , which interacts with the telemetry devices  to exchange information for supporting fleet and asset management, are detailed with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","103","101","301","103","101","103","303","305","307","307","309","311","101","111","109","109","313"]},"Although a single server is shown for the presentation server , in the alternative, the server  can functionally be implemented as three separate servers: a database server, a middleware server, and a web server. The database server is responsible for data storing, data updating, and data retrieval as well as providing a set of interfaces to achieve these functions. The web server is responsible for serving maps, presenting user interfaces to manage and control user administration, device configuration, and etc. The middleware server can be deployed between the database server and the web server, and has the following responsibilities: 1) converting the web server's data retrieval requests to database server APIs and then sending to database server, 2) receiving the responses from the database server and then sending back to web server, 3) receiving data from gateway  and then sending requests to the database to store\/update data records. Because of the modularity in this design, these three components can reside on the same machine, as shown in , or reside in multiple platforms.","Messages from the telemetry devices  are forwarded by the messaging server  to either the A-GPS server  or the routing server . If the message is an assist request, this message is sent to the A-GPS server . In response to the GPS assist request, the A-GPS server  determines GPS assistance data for transmission to the requesting telemetry device . Page: 18","The A-GPS server  obtains ephemeris data from the GPS reference network , and determines satellite configuration for each of the geographic zones comprising the wireless network. The A-GPS server  also determines the assistance data for each geographic zone. The NOC  then periodically broadcasts the assistance data to each geographic zone. In addition, the A-GPS server  supplies GPS assistance data to any telemetry device  that requests the GPS assistance data. When supporting this request, the NOC  determines approximate location of the requesting device  (based upon base receivers that received the request, using a type of triangulation. Subsequently, a GPS Assistance message is generated by the A-GPS server  to send to the telemetry device  based upon its approximate location. The messaging server  sends the GPS Assistance message to the particular telemetry device .","Thus, the A-GPS server  delivers GPS assistance data through two mechanisms by periodically broadcasting GPS assistance data to all devices  in each of the geographic zones covered by the wireless network , or by responding to specific requests by the telemetry devices  for GPS assistance data.","The routing server  has responsibility for routing of the messages from the telemetry devices , and managing such messages from the devices  to their server destinations. Each device  can be configured to have messages directed to one or more destination servers. The routing server , upon receiving message from a telemetry device , determines a destination address that has been configured for the device  and modifies the destination address accordingly. The message is then forwarded to the configured destination. By default, the messages are directed to the gateway .","The gateway  interfaces with the presentation server  to permit the desktop client  access to the fleet and asset management system. The gateway  provides translation of wireline messages and commands from the presentation server  to the wireless protocol for communication with the telemetry devices . For example, the gateway  supports an extensible Markup Language (XML) interface, such that XML commands submitted to the gateway  over wireline are converted to the wireless protocol commands and sent over the paging network  to the devices . In turn, the wireless protocol messages received from the devices  are converted to wireline XML messages. The gateway  provides translation of wireline messages and commands from the host  to the wireless protocol for communication with the telemetry devices . In turn, the wireless protocol messages received from the devices  are converted to wireline XML messages and sent to host .","The presentation server  provides the following functions: fleet and asset tracking, and general purpose I\/O monitoring and control. The server  also maintains a database (not shown) for user accounts and other related data (e.g., configuration data, user management information, device management, and data acquired from the devices ). The presentation server , as mentioned, also generates the maps corresponding to where the devices  are tracked and the mapping preferences configured. Using the desktop client , a user can even issue requests to command a particular device , such as requesting location of the device .","With the presentation server  as a front end, a user via the desktop client  can configure the telemetry devices  via web interfaces. In an exemplary embodiment, the server  is a World Wide Web (\u201cweb\u201d) application server to support a web browser based front-end for the desktop clients . The web application server (not shown) can be deployed to support such web interfaces as a set of Java Server Pages (JSP) and Java Applet to interact with the user on the desktop client . On the backend, based on data collected by JSP and Java Applet, the web server can generate the proper XML commands that are compliant with Application Programming Interface (API) of the presentation server . Consequently, the collected records can be stored in the database of the presentation server . The database also stores the properties of the telemetry devices , such as the alerts and thresholds earlier described.","The desktop client  interfaces to the system  through the presentation server . From the desktop client , the user logs in to the system . The presentation server  can also perform authentication as well as administration tasks such as adding new users or devices . The user can also configure business rules executed by the presentation server , wherein the business rules logic uses this user supplied configuration to configure the devices , acquire, and process data from the devices .","Additionally, the presentation server  provides a reporting capability based on the stored information in the database. The presentation server  can support standard reports or customize reports to the user via the desktop client .","Instead of using a desktop client , the user, if associated with a large organization, can utilize an enterprise server to obtain all of the user functionality through the gateway  using the API of the fleet and asset management system . Accordingly, the enterprise server would possess the functional capabilities of the presentation server , but would be managed by the customer (or user) at the customer's premise, as shown in .","As noted, the wireless protocol supports communications between the NOC  and the telemetry devices . In an exemplary embodiment, the messaging is performed according the FLEXsuite Uniform Addressing & Routing (UAR) protocol (developed by Motorola). The wireless protocol message, which can be encapsulated with an UAR message, is unencrypted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["401","401","401","401","401","401","401"],"i":["a","b","c","d","a","c"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Field","Definition","Data Type","Size"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["SIF","Identifies the application protocol","Integer","\u20028 bits"]},{"entry":[{},"used to encode the remaining data in"]},{"entry":[{},"the message; indicates UAR"]},{"entry":[{},"addressing is used"]},{"entry":["To","Destination Address","UAR \u201cTo","Variable"]},{"entry":["Address",{},"Address\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Encoding"]},{"entry":["Content","Identifies the format of the attached","UAR","24 bits"]},{"entry":["Type","Data","Content"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Type"]},{"entry":["Data","UAR format data payload","UAR data","Variable"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"With respect to the \u201cTo Address\u201d field , this address can be further specified the following fields: an End-To-End field , a Host field , a Port field , and a Path field . The End-To-End field is utilized for device to server routing. It is noted that no addressing is needed for device to server routing with the exception of an Assisted GPS Request message. Because the routing server  controls message routing from the telemetry device , some of the address information requirement is specific to UAR. Path Addressing, per the Path field , is used for server to device routing, as in the case, for example, addressing of a peripheral device attached to the telemetry device . As shown in , for server to device messaging, message  can be used and includes a SIF field , a To Address field specifying the path, and a Data field . A device to server message  utilizes a SIF field , a To Address field specifying the End-to-End address, and a Data field . In the case of a device to server transmission relating to acquisition of Assisted GPS (e.g., in form of an Assisted GPS request), a message  is provided, and includes a SIF field , a To Address field specifying the End-to-End address and Port , and a Data field ","As regards UAR messages in general, the Data field contains binary formatted data, which is the unencrypted Wireless Protocol (WP) message (as described in ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["501","501","103","101","103","107","501","103","103","103","103"],"i":["a ","a "]},"The message  also provides a Message Data field for specifying the data (such as data within the data log, and alerts).

The Pin field identifies the digital I\/O Pin, and the Pin Type field defines the type of I\/O Pin. Pin types can include, for instance, digital low output, digital high output, analog value, positive pulse, negative pulse, pulse width modulation (PWM), sinusoidal waveform, etc. The Trigger Date field and the Trigger Time field specify the date and time when the output action is to occur.

A low state for the Pin could be Ignition Off, while a high state may be ignition On. Other I\/O's may have names associated with other states. For example, a door lock pin may be locked using a negative pulse and unlocked using a positive pulse. Hence, the Pin could be named \u201cDoor Lock\u201d and the state (or action\/pin type as described in previously); a Negative Pulse could be named \u201cLock\u201d and a Positive Pulse could be named \u201cUnlock.\u201d","Further, Analog I\/O can similarly be named.

For example, an analog temperature sensor may be used such that the function converts 0 to 0 degrees Celsius, 511 converts to 50 degrees Celsius, and 1023 converts to 100 degrees Celsius.","Further, when data is presented to the user, this configuration is used to represent status rather than using generic names such as Digital Input , status Low or High. The functionality described above allows the system  to be utilized in many applications through configuration rather than through rewriting code to fit the specific application. It is also noted that the naming configuration is not transmitted to the device , such names or labels are used to associate names to particular I\/O pins and states for presentation to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1000","1001","1003","1001","1000","1005","1001","1003","1005","1003","1000","1007","1001","1003","1009","1001"]},"The computer system  may be coupled via the bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display, active matrix display, or plasma display, for displaying information to a computer user.

Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the present invention. Thus, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted in , multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the present invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the present invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.","The following patent applications are incorporated by reference in their entireties: co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.
