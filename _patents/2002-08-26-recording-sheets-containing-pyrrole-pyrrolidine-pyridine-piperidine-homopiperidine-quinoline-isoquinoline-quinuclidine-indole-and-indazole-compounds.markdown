For example, the coating can be applied with a KRK size press (Kumagai Riki Kogyo Co., Ltd., Nerima, Tokyo, Japan) by dip coating and can be applied by solvent extrusion on a Faustel Coater. The KRK size press is a lab size press that simulates a commercial size press. This size press is normally sheet fed, whereas a commercial size press typically employs a continuous web. On the KRK size press, the substrate sheet is taped by one end to the carrier mechanism plate. The speed of the test and the roll pressures are set, and the coating solution is poured into the solution tank. A 4 liter stainless steel beaker is situated underneath for retaining the solution overflow. The coating solution is cycled once through the system (without moving the substrate sheet) to wet the surface of the rolls and then returned to the feed tank, where it is cycled a second time. While the rolls are being \u201cwetted\u201d, the sheet is fed through the sizing rolls by pressing the carrier mechanism start button. The coated sheet is then removed from the carrier mechanism plate and is placed on a 12 inch by 40 inch sheet of 750 micron thick Teflon for support and is dried on the Dynamic Former drying drum and held under restraint to prevent shrinkage. The drying temperature is approximately 105\u00b0 C. This method of coating treats both sides of the substrate simultaneously.","In dip coating, a web of the material to be coated is transported below the surface of the liquid coating composition by a single roll in such a manner that the exposed site is saturated, followed by removal of any excess coating by the squeeze rolls and drying at 100\u00b0 C. in an air dryer. The liquid coating composition generally comprises the desired coating composition dissolved in a solvent such as water, methanol, or the like. The method of surface treating the substrate using a coater results in a continuous sheet of substrate with the coating material applied first to one side and then to the second side of this substrate. The substrate can also be coated by a slot extrusion process, wherein a flat die is situated with the die lips in close proximity to the web of substrate to be coated, resulting in a continuous film of the coating solution evenly distributed across one surface of the sheet, followed by drying in an air dryer at 100\u00b0 C.","Recording sheets of the present invention can be employed in ink jet printing processes. One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a process which comprises applying an aqueous recording liquid to a recording sheet of the present invention in an imagewise pattern. Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a printing process which comprises (1) incorporating into an ink jet printing apparatus containing an aqueous ink a recording sheet of the present invention, and (2) causing droplets of the ink to be ejected in an imagewise pattern onto the recording sheet, thereby generating images on the recording sheet. Ink jet printing processes are well known, and are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,601,777, 4,251,824, 4,410,899, 4,412,224, and 4,532,530, the disclosures of each of which are totally incorporated herein by reference. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the printing apparatus employs a thermal ink jet process wherein the ink in the nozzles is selectively heated in an imagewise pattern, thereby causing droplets of the ink to be ejected in imagewise pattern. In another preferred embodiment, the substrate is printed with an aqueous ink and thereafter the printed substrate is exposed to microwave radiation, thereby drying the ink on the sheet. Printing processes of this nature are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,220,346, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference.","The recording sheets of the present invention can also be used in any other printing or imaging process, such as printing with pen plotters, handwriting with ink pens, offset printing processes, or the like, provided that the ink employed to form the image is compatible with the ink receiving layer of the recording sheet.","Recording sheets of the present invention exhibit reduced curl upon being printed with aqueous inks, particularly in situations wherein the ink image is dried by exposure to microwave radiation. Generally, the term \u201ccurl\u201d refers to the distance between the base line of the arc formed by recording sheet when viewed in cross-section across its width (or shorter dimension\u2014for example, 8.5 inches in an 8.5\u00d711 inch sheet, as opposed to length, or longer dimension\u2014for example, 11 inches in an 8.5\u00d711 inch sheet) and the midpoint of the arc. To measure curl, a sheet can be held with the thumb and forefinger in the middle of one of the long edges of the sheet (for example, in the middle of one of the 11 inch edges in an 8.5\u00d711 inch sheet) and the arc formed by the sheet can be matched against a pre-drawn standard template curve.","Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail. These examples are intended to be illustrative, and the invention is not limited to the materials, conditions, or process parameters set forth in these embodiments. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.","The optical density measurements recited herein were obtained on a Pacific Spectrograph Color System. The system consists of two major components, an optical sensor and a data terminal. The optical sensor employs a 6 inch integrating sphere to provide diffuse illumination and 8 degrees viewing. This sensor can be used to measure both transmission and reflectance samples. When reflectance samples are measured, a specular component may be included. A high resolution, full dispersion, grating monochromator was used to scan the spectrum from 380 to 720 nanometers. The data terminal features a 12 inch CRT display, numerical keyboard for selection of operating parameters and the entry of tristimulus values, and an alphanumeric keyboard for entry of product standard information.","Transparency sheets were prepared as follows. Blends of 70 percent by weight hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (K35LV, obtained from Dow Chemical Co.) and 30 percent by weight of various additive compositions, each obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co., were prepared by mixing 56 grams of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and 24 grams of the additive composition in 1,000 milliliters of water in a 2 Liter jar and stirring the contents in an Omni homogenizer for 2 hours. Subsequently, the solution was left overnight for removal of air bubbles. The blends thus prepared were then coated by a dip coating process (both sides coated in one operation) by providing Mylar\u00ae base sheets in cut sheet form (8.5\u00d711 inches) in a thickness of 100 microns. Subsequent to air drying at 25\u00b0 C. for 3 hours followed by oven drying at 100\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes and monitoring the difference in weight prior to and subsequent to coating, the dried coated sheets were each coated with 1 gram, 10 microns in thickness, on each surface (2 grams total coating weight for 2-sided transparency) of the substrate. For comparison purposes, a transparency sheet was also prepared in which the coating consisted of 100 percent by weight hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and contained no additive composition.","The

In addition, the papers coated with the additives exhibited lower curl values compared to the curl value for the paper treated with water alone.","Paper recording sheets were prepared as follows. Coating compositions containing various additive compositions, each obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co., were prepared by dissolving 50 grams of the additive in 500 milliliters of water in a beaker and stirring for 1 hour at 25\u00b0 C. The additive solutions thus prepared were then coated onto paper by a dip coating process (both sides coated in one operation) by providing paper base sheets in cut sheet form (8.5\u00d711 inches) in a thickness of 100 microns. Subsequent to air drying at 100\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes and monitoring the difference in weight prior to and subsequent to coating, the sheets were each coated on each side with 500 milligrams, in a thickness of 5 microns (total coating weight 1 gram for two-sided sheets), of the additive composition.
