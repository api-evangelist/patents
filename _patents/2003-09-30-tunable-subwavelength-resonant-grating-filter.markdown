No. 60\/415,048 filed by Stephen Y. Chou et al. on Sep. 30, 2002 and entitled \u201cOptical Filters With Fixed and Tunable Frequency,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with government support under DARPA contracts 341-6086 and 341-4131. The government has certain rights to this invention.","This invention relates to optical filters known as subwavelength resonant grating filters (SRGFs) and, in particular, to tunable SRGFs.","Optical filters are key components in a wide variety of optical systems including optical telecommunications, optical displays and optical data storage. An optical filter is used to selectively reflect or transmit light of a predetermined wavelength. Typical uses include channel selection in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) systems, multiplexers, demultiplexers, switches and wavelength selective laser cavity reflectors.","Subwavelength resonant grating filters (SRGFs) are highly promising for many optical filter applications. SRGFs typically comprise a linear array of grating lines overlying an optical waveguide. The spacing between successive grating lines is smaller than the wavelength of the light they process, hence they are called subwavelength gratings. They are highly reflective for light of a specific wavelength that resonates with the spaced grating lines. Further details concerning such filters can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,680 issued to Magnusson et al. on Jan. 1, 1993 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,598,300 issued to Magnusson et al. on Jan. 28, 1997, which are incorporated herein by reference.","While SRGF's are compact and highly reflective, they are typically fixed in resonant wavelength at their fabrication. Efforts have been made provide a tunable SRGF by disposing an electro-optic medium adjacent the grating. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,215,928 issued to A. Friesem et al. on Apr. 10, 2001. Unfortunately the Friessem et al structures do not perform sufficiently well for practical application. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved tunable subwavelength resonant grating filter.","In accordance with the invention, a tunable subwavelength resonant grating filter comprises a liquid crystal cell having a pair of major surface walls. One wall of the cell is a coated subwavelength grating of the filter. The coating fills the grating trenches to facilitate uniform alignment of the liquid crystal material. The refractive index of the LCD material in the cell can then be electrically or thermally adjusted to tune the resonant wavelength.","It is to be understood that these drawings are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and are not to scale.","Applicants have discovered that the grating structure in an LCD cell can prevent proper alignment of the liquid crystal material, interfering with proper functioning of an LCD tunable SRGF. This interference can be substantially eliminated by planarizing the grating, as by coating it with a polymer to fill the grating trenches.","Referring to the drawings,  is a schematic cross section of a tunable subwavelength resonant grating filter  comprising, in essence, an LCD cell  having as one major surface wall a coated subwavelength grating  of a SRGF . The cell  comprises a second major surface wall  and is filled with LCD material . The SRGF comprises, in addition to the grating layer , a planar waveguide  parallel to the grating plane. In this embodiment, transparent electrodes  and  are disposed on opposite sides of the LCD material to permit voltage control of the LCD index of refraction. A polymer coating layer  fills the trenches in grating , and surfactant coatings  on the major cell wall surfaces are provided to permit alignment of the liquid crystal material (homeotropic alignment). A voltage source  between electrodes ,  can control the index of the LCD material  and thus tune the resonant wavelength of the filter . Advantageously a cladding layer  separates the electrode  from the waveguide layer . The SRGF may conveniently be disposed on a transparent substrate .","The major surface walls ,  comprise transparent dielectric materials such as glass. The grating layer  and the planar waveguide  are also transparent dielectric materials with the waveguide material having a higher index of refraction than the grating material. The grating itself can be patterned as a conventional linear array of parallel grating lines or as a two dimensional array of nanoscale diffraction elements with subwavelength spacing. The advantage of the two dimensional array grating is substantial polarization independence.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell wall  and the substrate  are comprised of glass, and the electrodes ,  are advantageously deposited coatings of transparent conductor such as indium tin oxide (ITO). The SRGF preferably comprises a patterned silicon nitride (SiN) grating layer  deposited and patterned to work as a resonant filter on an SiOwaveguide layer . An appropriate polymer to fill the trenches is a polystyrene based resist (NP 60) and a compatibe surfactant is a silicone surfactant alignment agent such as ZLI 3334.","The operation of the tunable SRGF can be understood by consideration of  showing the device with different levels of electrical field strength between the electrodes ,. In , where no electrical field is applied, the liquid crystal molecules are aligned primarily by the effect of surfactant coatings . The LC material aligns parallel to the normal direction between the coatings . In this state, light entering the cell through either transparent cell wall experiences the minimum refractive index of the variable index LCD material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 3"]},"Referring to  the filter  comprises a waveguide layer  and a grating layer  adjacent the waveguide layer. The grating layer is patterned into a two-dimensional array of nanoscale diffraction elements . The array of elements  forms a two-dimensional grating structure that is periodic in two orthogonal directions (x,y). It has a period Din the x-direction less than a wavelength of the light to be processed and a period Din the y-direction less than a wavelength. The subwavelength periods Dand Dare preferably but not necessarily equal. The waveguide layer  can be conveniently formed overlying an optional substrate layer .","Each of the layers , ,  advantageously comprises a transparent dielectric material. The waveguide layer index of refraction, n, should be greater than the grating layer effective index, n, and greater than the substrate index, n.","The diffraction elements  (also referred to as grating elements) are advantageously circular pillars of nanoscale diameter, but could alternatively be nanoscale elements of other shape such as rectangular pillars, pyramids, cones or holes so long as the array exhibits subwavelength periodicity in two orthogonal directions. The diffraction elements are coated with a planarizing layer , such as a polymer, and the planarized surface is coated with a layer of surfactant (not shown).","In an exemplary device for light of 1.55 micrometer wavelength, the substrate can be glass, the waveguide layer SiOand the grating layer composed of nanoscale diameter pillars of silicon nitride. Typical dimensions are: pillar diameter\u2014100 to 600 nanometers; pillar height\u201420\u2013200 nanometers; pillar spacing 200 nanometers to 1.2 micrometers. Alternatively, the device can be implemented in semiconductor materials such as InGaAsP\/InP. Such devices can be readily fabricated using the nanoimprint lithographic techniques described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,482,742 (Nov. 19, 2002) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,905 (Jun. 30, 1998) which are incorporated herein by reference. The fabrication of such filters using nanoimprint techniques is described in applicants' U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/674,607 filed contemporaneously herewith and entitled \u201cMethod of Making Subwavelength Resonant Grating Filter\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference.","In operation, light is shone onto the filter , typically at normal incidence to the plane of the grating layer. Since the grating elements are arrayed with subwavelength spacing, the light will experience the grating layer as an effectively homogenous layer with an effective index n, and, except for light at a certain resonant wavelength \u03bb, the light will transmit through the device as if it were a thin-film structure.","For light at the resonant wavelength \u03bb, the diffraction from the grating elements produces an evanescent wave along the x-y plane. The evanescent wave couples with a waveguide mode supported by the waveguide layer, propagating a waveguide mode within the waveguide layer. Due to the phase matching of the grating elements, the waveguide mode radiates energy transverse to the waveguide layer at a phase that interferes constructively with the reflection and destructively with the transmission. The result is that substantially all energy at \u03bbis reflected and substantially no energy \u03bbis transmitted.","An important advantage of this device is its polarization-independence. In conventional gratings with one-dimensional grating periodicity, only one polarization component of the light can be coupled into the waveguide at a resonant wavelength \u03bb. This is due to the difference between the TE and TM modes in the waveguide are different. Thus conventional filters are polarization dependent and transmit some of the light at \u03bb.","With the two-dimensional grating filters described herein, both polarization components can be coupled into two orthogonal directions due to the symmetry of the grating. Therefore the filters are polarization independent and substantially all light at \u03bbis reflected.","In designing such a filter for a particular application, the location of the resonant wavelength is determined primarily by the value of the grating period. In general,\n\n","The bandwidth of the filter is determined primarily by the thickness h() of the grating layer. In general, the Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of the filter follows a quadratic relationship of the grating thickness. It is thus possible to obtain a very narrowband filter by using a very thin grating layer. For example, a sub-nanometer FWHM can be obtained with grating thickness less than 60 nanometers.","For use with light incidence other than normal, polarization-independence is achieved by grating periods that are different in two orthogonal directions.","The advantages of this tunable filter are manyfold. It is easy to fabricate, potentially low in cost and provides good performance. The free spectral range can be large, making the device highly advantageous for DWDM systems. The large E-O efficiency of LC materials permits achievement of a relatively large tuning range with relatively low voltages, and with the use of the  SRGF, the tunable filter can be polarization independent.","It is understood that the above-described embodiments are illustrative of only a few of the many possible specific embodiments, which can represent applications of the invention. Numerous and varied other arrangements can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The nature, advantages and various additional features of the invention will appear more fully upon consideration of the illustrative embodiments not to be described in connection with the accompanying drawings.
