title: Method and system for a dynamic adjustment of a data request channel in a communication system
abstract: Method and a system method and system for a dynamic adjustment of a data request channel in a communication system are disclosed. A value of at least one variable affecting the data request channel margin is determined in accordance with conditions in the communication system. The at least one variable is then set to the determined value. The value of the at least one variable is then conveyed to a subscriber station in an adjustment message. The subscriber station determines whether the adjustment message was transmitted by a serving sector or a non-serving sector; and adjusts at least one attribute of the communication channel in accordance with the determination, thus adjusting the DRC channel margin.

Field","The present invention relates to communications in a wireline or a wireless communication system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system for a dynamic adjustment of a data request channel in such a communication system.","2. Background","Communication systems have been developed to allow transmission of information signals from an origination station to a physically distinct destination station. In transmitting an information signal from the origination station over a communication channel, the information signal is first converted into a form suitable for efficient transmission over the communication channel. Conversion, or modulation, of the information signal involves varying a parameter of a carrier wave in accordance with the information signal in such a way that the spectrum of the resulting modulated carrier wave is confined within the communication channel bandwidth. At the destination station, the original information signal is reconstructed from the modulated carrier wave received over the communication channel. In general, such a reconstruction is achieved by using an inverse of the modulation process employed by the origination station.","Modulation also facilitates multiple-access, i.e., simultaneous transmission and\/or reception, of several signals over a common communication channel. Multiple-access communication systems often include a plurality of remote subscriber units requiring intermittent access of relatively short duration rather than continuous access to the common communication channel. Several multiple-access techniques are known in the art, such as time division multiple-access (TDMA), and frequency division multiple-access (FDMA). Another type of a multiple-access technique is a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) spread spectrum system that conforms to the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wide-Band Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d hereinafter referred to as the IS-95 standard. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple-access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE-ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d both assigned to the present assignee.","A multiple-access communication system may be wireless or wireline and may carry voice traffic and\/or data traffic. An example of a communication system carrying both voice and data traffic is a system in accordance with the IS-95 standard, which specifies transmitting voice and data traffic over a communication channel. A method for transmitting data in code channel frames of fixed size is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,773, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE FORMATTING OF DATA FOR TRANSMISSION,\u201d assigned to the present assignee. In accordance with the IS-95 standard, the data traffic or voice traffic is partitioned into code channel frames that are 20 milliseconds wide with data rates as high as 14.4 Kbps. Additional examples of communication systems carrying both voice and data traffic comprise communication systems conforming to the \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP), embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3G TS 25.211, 3G TS 25.212, 3G TS 25.213, and 3G TS 25.214 (the W-CDMA standard), or \u201cTR-45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems\u201d (the IS-2000 standard).","The term base station is an access network entity, with which subscriber stations communicate. With reference to the IS-856 standard, the base station is also referred to as an access point. Cell refers to the base station or a geographic coverage area served by a base station, depending on the context in which the term is used. A sector is a partition of a base station, serving a partition of a geographic area served by the base station.","The term \u201csubscriber station\u201d is the entity with which an access network communicates. With reference to the IS-856 standard, the base station is also referred to as an access terminal. A subscriber station may be mobile or stationary. A subscriber station may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example fiber optic or coaxial cables. A subscriber station may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. A subscriber station that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with a base station is said to be in a connection setup state. A subscriber station that has established an active traffic channel connection with a base station is called an active subscriber station, and is said to be in a traffic state.","The term access network is a collection of at least one base station (BS) and one or more base stations' controllers. The access network transports information signals between multiple subscriber stations. The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport information signals between each base station and such outside networks.","In the above-described multiple-access wireless communication system, communications between users are conducted through one or more base stations. The term user refers to both animate and inanimate entities. A first user on one wireless subscriber station communicates to a second user on a second wireless subscriber station by conveying information signal on a reverse link to a base station. The base station receives the information signal and conveys the information signal on a forward link to the second subscriber station. If the second subscriber station is not in the area served by the base station, the base station routes the data to another base station, in whose service area the second subscriber station is located. The second base station then conveys the information signal on a forward link to the second subscriber station. The forward link refers to transmissions from a base station to a wireless subscriber station and the reverse link refers to transmissions from a wireless subscriber station to a base station. Likewise, the communication can be conducted between a first user on a wireless subscriber station and a second user on a landline station. A base station receives the data from the first user on the wireless subscriber station on a reverse link, and routes the data through a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to the second user on a landline station. In many communication systems, e.g., IS-95, W-CDMA, and IS-2000, the forward link and the reverse link are allocated separate frequencies.","Study of voice traffic only services and data traffic only services revealed some substantial differences between the two types of services, e.g., requirements on delay in delivery of the information content, grade of service (GOS), a reliability of a communication link, and other known differences.","The above-mentioned differences lead to a development of a data traffic only communication system, e.g., a communication system known as the High Data Rate (HDR) communication system. Such a communication system is disclosed in detail in co-pending application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d filed Nov. 3, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211, issued Jun. 3, 2003, assigned to the present assignee. The HDR communication system was standardized as a TIA\/EIA\/IS-856 industry standard hereinafter referred to as the IS-856 standard.","The IS-856 standard defines a set of data rates, ranging from 38.4 kbps to 2.4 Mbps, at which an access point (AP) may send data to a subscriber station (access terminal). Because the access point is analogous to a base station, the terminology with respect to cells and sectors is the same as with respect to voice systems. In accordance with the IS-856 standard, the data to be transmitted over the forward link are partitioned into data packets, with each data packet being transmitted over one or more intervals (time-slots), into which the forward link is divided. The term packet is a group of bits, including data (payload) and control elements, arranged into a specific format. The control elements comprise, e.g., a preamble, a quality metric, and others known to one skilled in the art. Quality metric comprises, e.g., a cyclical redundancy check (CRC), a parity bit, and other quality metrics known to one skilled in the art. At each time-slot, data transmission occurs from an access point to one and only one access terminal, located within the coverage area of the access point, at the maximum data rate that can be supported by the forward link and the communication system. The access terminal is selected in accordance with forward link conditions between the access point and an access terminal. The forward link conditions depend on interference and path loss between an access point and an access terminal, both of which are time-variant. The path loss and the variation of the path loss are exploited by scheduling the access point's transmissions at time intervals, during which the access terminal's forward link conditions to a particular access point satisfy determined criteria that allow for transmissions with less power or higher rate of data than transmissions to the remaining access terminals, thus improving spectral efficiency of forward link transmissions. Even if a transmission from an access point to an access terminal fails, because of relaxed transmission delay requirement, as compared to a voice services, the transmit power and resources used to support soft handoff on the forward link can be used for transmission of additional data, thus, increasing average throughput rate by increasing efficiency.","In contrast, according to the IS-856 standard, data transmissions on the reverse link occur from multiple access terminals located within a coverage area of an access point. Furthermore, because the access terminals' antenna patterns are omni-directional, any access terminal within the coverage area of the access point may receive these data transmissions. Consequently, the reverse link transmissions are subjected to several sources of interference: code-division multiplexed overhead channels of other access terminals, data transmissions from access terminals located in the coverage area of the access point (same-cell access terminals), and data transmissions from access terminals located in the coverage area of other access points (other-cell access terminals). Because re-transmission of packets from a subscriber station requires additional power from a power limited source (a battery), it may be efficient to support soft handoff on the reverse link by allocating resources at several base stations to receive and process the data packets transmitted from the subscriber station. Such a utilization of soft handoff increases both coverage and reverse link capacity as discussed in a paper by Andrew J. Viterbi and Klein S. Gilhousen: \u201cSoft Handoff Increases CDMA coverage and Increases Reverse Link Capacity,\u201d IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, Vol. 12, No. 8, October 1994. The term soft handoff is a communication between a subscriber station and two or more sectors, wherein each sector belongs to a different cell. In the context of the IS-856 standard, data transmission on the forward link is non-simultaneously carried out between one of the two or more sectors and the access terminal.","Additionally, a softer handoff may be used for this purpose. The term softer handoff is a communication between a subscriber station and two or more sectors, wherein each sector belongs to the same cell. In the context of the IS-856 standard, data transmission on the forward link is non-simultaneously carried out between one of the two or more sectors and the access terminal.","In a communication system in accordance with the IS-856 standard, an Access Terminal indicates an estimate of the highest data rate on a forward link between an Access Point and the Access Terminal to the Access Network via a data request (DRC) channel transmitted over a reverse link. An access point that is selected for data communication the access terminal or an access point that is communicating data to the particular access terminal is serving access point. To maximize forward link utilization, an access terminal attempts to select an access point having a best quality metric of the forward link as determined at the access terminal. The DRC channel has a margin, designed to assure correct reception of the DRC channel for varying conditions on the reverse link. However, the margin cannot be infinite, consequently, if the reverse link conditions worsen beyond the condition under which the DRC channel can be sustained given the margin, correct reception of the DRC channel cannot be assured. Consequently, the access terminal may select an access point with lower quality metric forward link\u2014an event referred to as imbalance. Even in situations unaffected by imbalance, a high erasure rate of the DRC channel may result in underutilization of the forward link. The term erasure is a failure to recognize a message.","Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide a method and an apparatus to minimize the occurrence of imbalance and underutilization of forward link.","The above and further features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims and together with advantages thereof will become clearer form considerations of the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention given by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings.","In one aspect the above stated needs are addressed by determining values of variables for dynamic adjustment of a communication channel by determining whether an active set size changed; and determining a value of at least one variable in accordance with the determination whether the active set size changed.","In another aspect the above stated needs are addressed by determining values of variables for dynamic adjustment of a communication channel by determining a first metric of a first link; determining a second metric of a second link; and determining a value of at least one variable in accordance with the first metric and the second metric.","In another aspect the above stated needs are addressed by dynamically adjusting a communication channel, the method comprising: receiving an adjustment message; determining whether the adjustment message was transmitted by a serving sector or a non-serving sector; and adjusting at least one attribute of the communication channel in accordance with the determining.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","104","106","1","104","108","1","102","104","106","2","104","108","2","100","102","110","112","1","112","2"]},"After registration, which allows an access terminal to access an access network, the access terminal  and one of the access points, e.g., the access point , establish a communication link using a predetermined access procedure. In the connected state, resulting from the predetermined access procedure, the access terminal  is able to receive data and control messages from the access point , and is able to transmit data and control messages to the access point . The access terminal  continually searches for other access points that could be added to the access terminal's  active set. An active set comprises a list of access points capable of communication with the access terminal . When such an access point is found, the access terminal  calculates a quality metric of the access point's forward link, which may comprise a signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). An SINR may be determined in accordance with a pilot signal. The access terminal  searches for other access points and determines access points' SINR. Simultaneously, the access terminal  calculates a quality metric of a forward link for each access point in the access terminal's  active set. If the forward link quality metric from a particular access point is above a predetermined add threshold or below a predetermined drop threshold for a predetermined period of time, the access terminal  reports this information to the access point . Subsequent messages from the access point  may direct the access terminal  to add to or to delete from the access terminal  active set the particular access point.","The access terminal  selects a serving access point from the access terminal's  active set based on a set of parameters. A serving access point is an access point that is selected for data communication a particular access terminal or an access point that is communicating data to the particular access terminal. The set of parameters may comprise any one or more of present and previous SINR measurements, a bit-error-rate, a packet-error-rate, for example, and any other known parameters. Thus, for example, the serving access point may be selected in accordance with the largest SINR measurement. The access terminal  then broadcasts a data request message (DRC message) on a data request channel (DRC channel). The DRC message can contain a requested data rate or, alternatively, an indication of a quality of the forward link, e.g., measured SINR, a bit-error-rate, a packet-error-rate and the like. The access terminal  may direct the broadcast of the DRC message to a specific access point by the use of a code, which uniquely identifies the specific access point. Typically, the code comprises a Walsh code. The DRC message symbols are exclusively OR'ed (XOR) with the unique Walsh code. This XOR operation is referred to as Walsh covering of a signal. Since each access point in the active set of the access terminal  is identified by a unique Walsh code, only the selected access point which performs the identical XOR operation as that performed by the access terminal  with the correct Walsh code can correctly decode the DRC message.","The data to be transmitted to the access terminal  arrive at the controller . Thereafter, the controller  may send the data to all access points in the access terminal  active set over the backhaul . Alternatively, the controller  may first determine, which access point was selected by the access terminal  as the serving access point, and then send the data to the serving access point. The data are stored in a queue at the access point(s). A paging message is then sent by one or more access points to the access terminal  on respective control channels. The access terminal  demodulates and decodes the signals on one or more control channels to obtain the paging messages.","At each forward link interval, the access point may schedule data transmissions to any of the access terminals that received the paging message. An exemplary method for scheduling transmission is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,229,795, entitled \u201cSystem for allocating resources in a communication system,\u201d assigned to the present assignee. The access point uses the rate control information received in the DRC message from each access terminal to efficiently transmit forward link data at the highest possible rate. Because the rate of data may vary, the communication system operates in a variable rate mode. The access point determines the data rate at which to transmit the data to the access terminal  based on the most recent value of the DRC message received from the access terminal . Additionally, the access point uniquely identifies a transmission to the access terminal  by using a spreading code which is unique to that mobile station. This spreading code is a long pseudo noise (PN) code, for example a spreading code defined by the IS-856 standard.","The access terminal , for which the data packet is intended, receives and decodes the data packet. Each data packet is associated with an identifier, e.g., a sequence number, which is used by the access terminal  to detect either missed or duplicate transmissions. In such an event, the access terminal  communicates the sequence numbers of the missing data packets via the reverse link data channel. The controller , which receives the data messages from the access terminal  via the access point communicating with the access terminal , then indicates to the access point what data units were not received by the access terminal . The access point then schedules a re-transmission of such data packets.","When the communication link between the access terminal  and the access point , operating in the variable rate mode, deteriorates below a predetermined reliability level, the access terminal  first attempts to determine whether another access point in the variable rate mode can support an acceptable rate of data. If the access terminal  ascertains such an access point (e.g., the access point ), a re-pointing to the access point  to a different communication link occurs. The term re-pointing is a selection of a sector that is a member of an access terminals' active list, wherein the sector is different than a currently selected sector. The data transmissions continue from the access point  in the variable rate mode.","The above-mentioned deterioration of the communication link can be caused by, e.g., the access terminal  moving from a coverage area of the access point  to the coverage area of the access point , shadowing, fading, and other well known reasons. Alternatively, when a communication link between the access terminal  and another access point (e.g., the access point ) that may achieve a higher throughput rate than the currently used communication link becomes available, a re-pointing to the access point  to a different communication link occurs, and the data transmissions continue from the access point  in the variable rate mode. If the access terminal  fails to detect an access point that can operate in the variable rate mode and support an acceptable data rate, the access terminal  transitions into a fixed rate mode. In such a mode, access terminal transmits at one rate. The term fixed rate mode is used exclusively herein to mean that a particular sector transmits a Forward Traffic Channel to the AT at one particular rate.","The access terminal  evaluates the communication links with all candidate access points for both variable rate data and fixed rate data modes, and selects the access point, which yields the highest throughput.","The access terminal  will switch from the fixed rate mode back to the variable rate mode if the sector is no longer a member of the access terminal  active set.","The above-described fixed rate mode and associated methods for transition to and from the fixed rate data mode are similar to those disclosed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,205,129, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR VARIABLE AND FIXED FORWARD LINK RATE CONTROL IN A MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM\u201d, assigned to the present assignee. Other fixed rate modes and associated methods for transition to and from the fixed mode can also be contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention.","One skilled in the art recognizes that an AP can comprise one or more sectors. In the description above, the term AP was used generically to allow clear explanation of basic concepts of the HDR communication system. However, one skilled in the art can extend the explained concepts to AP comprising any number of sectors. Consequently, the concept of sector will be used throughout the rest of the document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"The forward link  is defined in terms of frames. A frame is a structure comprising 16 time-slots , each time-slot  being 2048 chips long, corresponding to a 1.66 ms time-slot duration, and, consequently, a 26.66 ms frame duration. Each time-slot  is divided into two half-time-slots A, B, with pilot bursts A, B transmitted within each half-time-slot A, B. Each pilot burst A, B is 96 chips long, centered about a mid-point of its associated half-time-slot A, B. The pilot bursts A, B comprise a pilot channel signal covered by a Walsh cover with index 0. A forward medium access control channel (MAC)  forms two bursts, which are transmitted immediately before and immediately after the pilot burst  of each half-time-slot . The MAC is composed of up to 64 code channels, which are orthogonally covered by 64-ary Walsh codes. Each code channel is identified by a MAC index, which has a value between 1 and 64, and identifies a unique 64-ary covering Walsh code. A reverse power control channel (RPC) is used to regulate the power of the reverse link signals for each subscriber station. The RPC is assigned to one of the available MACs with MAC index between 5 and 63. The forward link traffic channel or the control channel payload is sent in the remaining portions A of the first half-time-slot A and the remaining portions B of the second half-time-slot B. The traffic channel carries user data, while the control channel carries control messages, and may also carry user data. The control channel is transmitted with a cycle defined as a 256 slot period at a data rate of 76.8 kbps or 38.4 kbps. The term user data, also referred to as traffic, is information other than overhead data. The term overhead data is information enabling operation of entities in a communication system, e.g., call maintenance signaling, diagnostic and reporting information, and the like.","In a wireless communications system, e.g., a wireless communications system in accordance with , an imbalance may occur between a forward link and a reverse link. Imbalance occurs when a first sector's forward link quality metric is greater than a second sector's forward link quality metric as measured at an AT, and the AT's reverse link quality metric as measured at the first sector is less than a reverse link quality metric as measured at the second sector. It has been observed that low levels of imbalance, e.g., less than 1 dB are almost always present in a communication system. This level of imbalance appears to have little impact either on the forward link requested\/served rate or on the DRC erasure rate on the reverse link. As used herein the term DRC erasure rate indicates a percentage of DRC messages that were erased at the AP. Consequently, such an imbalance is accepted because the cost, e.g., outage associated with re-pointing DRC from one sector to another sector in a dynamic communication system environment (changing channel conditions, AT mobility), far exceeds the small penalty in forward link sector throughput that may result. The term outage is a time interval during which the likelihood that a subscriber station will receive service is reduced.","As the imbalance increases, the sector with the better forward link quality metric has a higher DRC erasure rate, due to worse reverse link quality metric. Consequently, the advantage of an AT pointing the AT's DRC to a sector with a better forward link quality metric is reduced because the DRC erasure rate at the sector with the better forward link quality metric may be so large as to reduce the forward link throughput significantly. In an extreme case, if the DRC erasure Rate is 100%, regardless of the forward link quality metric, the AT is not served. On the other hand, re-pointing the AT's DRC to a sector with a better reverse link quality metric may not improve the forward link throughput because the sector's forward link quality metric is reduced.","The above-described design of the DRC channel has margin of adjustment, via the DRC channel gain and DRC repetition, enabling mitigation of imbalance. Consequently, methods for adaptively changing the margin in the DRC channel in response to link imbalance changes may delay, and possibly avoid, level of imbalance affecting the rate of data throughput.","A value of at least one variable affecting the DRC channel margin is determined in accordance with conditions in the communication system. The at least one variable is then set to the determined value, thus adjusting the DRC channel margin. The conditions may comprise changes in an active set, and changes in a rise over thermal differential among sectors.","In one embodiment, a value of a variable DRC channel gain is set to a constant. The constant is determined by simulations, field-testing, and other known engineering methods. A value of a variable DRC message length is initially set to a default, which may be 2 for an access terminal not in handoff, and 4 otherwise. Subsequently, the value of the variable DRC message length is changed to a value determined in accordance with conditions in the communication system.","In another embodiment, a value of the variable DRC message length is set to a constant. The constant is determined by simulations, field-testing, and other known engineering methods. The value of the variable DRC channel gain is initially set to a default value, which may be \u22121.5 dB for an access terminal not in handoff, and \u22123 dB otherwise. Subsequently, the value of the variable DRC channel gain is changed to a value determined in accordance with conditions in the communication system.","In yet another embodiment, the values of the variable DRC channel gain and the variable DRC message length are initially set to a default value. Subsequently, the values of the variables DRC channel gain and the DRC message length are changed to values determined in accordance with conditions in the communication system.","As described, the active set size changes in accordance with changing conditions in the communication system, e.g., changes in reverse and forward links, movement of access terminals, and the like. Changes in the active set size may result in a change of a differential transmit power between sectors in the active set. The term \u201cdifferential transmit power\u201d is a difference in transmit power between two sectors. Since imbalance may arise when the active set size is greater than one, the only transmit power differentials that need to be considered are the transmit power differentials between cells in the active set.","A control entity determines the differential transmit power between sectors in the active set in accordance with the sectors' transmit power. The sectors may report the sectors' transmit power to the control entity. The control entity may comprise e.g., a controller  from  (BSC). The differential transmit power may be determined continuously or only upon change in active set size.","Additionally, even without an active set size change, the changing conditions in the communication system may result in change of a rise over thermal. The term \u201crise over thermal\u201d is a difference between a noise floor and a total received power as measured by a sector. The measurement of noise by the sectors is well known. Such a measurement is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,192,249 entitled \u201cMethod and apparatus for reverse link loading estimation\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention.","The control entity determines the differential rise over thermal between sectors in the active set in accordance with the sectors' noise. The sectors measure noise at periodic interval, e.g., a second, and report the measured noise upon measurement, to the control entity. Alternatively, the sectors measure noise at periodic interval, but report the measured noise only upon a change of the measured noise, in order to minimize traffic on the backhaul. The measured noise may be filtered before being reported to the control entity or by the control entity. The filter may be a first order filter with a time-constant of 300 slots.","When the control entity determines that either a differential rise over thermal between sectors in the active set exceeded a differential rise over thermal threshold or following a change in an active set size a differential transmit power between sectors in the active set exceeded a differential transmit power threshold, the control entity changes at least one variable affecting the DRC channel margin.","When the at least one variable affecting the DRC channel margin to be changed is a DRC message length, the value of the DRC message length is increased. The value of the DRC message length may be increased by 4.","When the at least one variable affecting the DRC channel margin to be changed is a DRC gain, the value of the DRC gain is increased. The value the DRC gain may be increased by 1.5 dB.","When the at least one variable affecting the DRC channel margin to be changed comprises both the DRC message length and the DRC gain, the control entity first tests whether one of the variables, e.g., the DRC gain, is at a maximum value. If the variable is not at the maximum value, the value of the variable is increased. If the variable is at the maximum value, the other variable, i.e., the DRC message length, is tested for a maximum value. If the other variable is not at the maximum value, the value of the other variable is increased; otherwise, no change to the other variable is made.","When the control entity fails to determine that either a differential rise over thermal between sectors in the active set exceeded the differential rise over thermal threshold or following a change in an active set size a differential transmit power between sectors in the active set exceeded the differential transmit power threshold, the control entity decreases the value at least one variable affecting DRC channel margin. The control entity may set the value at least one variable to a default.","A flowchart illustrating the above-described concepts is presented in . The method starts in block , and continues in step .","In step , the active set size (ASS) is compared to 1. If the active set size is equal to 1, the method continues in step , otherwise, the method continues in step .","In step , the at least one variable is set to a default value, and the method continues in step .","In step , the active set size is tested for change.

A differential transmit power between a newly added sector and each of the sectors in the active set is calculated. If any of the calculated differential transmit powers exceeds a first differential transmit power threshold, the value of the at least one variable is set as described above. The method continues in step .","In step , the desired value of the at least one variable is determined. If the decrease in the active set size resulted in active set size of one, the current value of the at least one variable is set to a default value. Otherwise, for each pair of the sectors in the active set, the differential transmit power is calculated. If any of the calculated differential transmit powers exceeds a second differential transmit power threshold, the value of the at least one variable is set as described above. The method continues in step .","In step , the test whether a rise over thermal has changed is performed. If the rise over thermal is unchanged, the method continues in step , otherwise the method continues in step .","In step , the desired value of the at least one variable is determined.

However, it is possible that sectors of the same base station, transmitting to a subscriber station will transmit at the same power. In such a case, changing an active set size by adding a sector of a base station, whose another sector is already a member of the active set does not change differential transmit power. Similarly, changing an active set size by removing one of a plurality of sectors of a base station does not change differential transmit power. Therefore, the determination of a value of the at least one variable in accordance with an active set size change occurs only when the change in number of sectors is accompanied in change in number of base stations whose sectors are added or removed from the active set. It is further appreciated, that there is no need to determine a transmit power differential between sectors of the same cell.","Alternatively, a value of at least one variable affecting the DRC channel margin is determined in accordance with conditions in the communication system. The at least one variable is then set to the determined value, thus adjusting the DRC channel margin. The conditions may comprise, e.g., forward link utilization (U), a DRC erasure rate (Re), and other conditions.","In one embodiment, a value of a variable DRC channel gain is set to a constant. The constant is determined by simulations, field-testing, and other known engineering methods. A value of a variable DRC message length is initially set to a default, which may be 2 for an access terminal not in handoff, and 4 otherwise. Subsequently, the value of the variable DRC message length is changed to a value determined in accordance with conditions in the communication system.","In another embodiment, a value of the variable DRC message length is set to a constant. The constant is determined by simulations, field-testing, and other known engineering methods. The value of the variable DRC channel gain is initially set to a default value, which may be \u22121.5 dB for an access terminal not in handoff, and \u22123 dB otherwise. Subsequently, the value of the variable DRC channel gain is changed to a value determined in accordance with conditions in the communication system.","In yet another embodiment, values of the variable DRC channel gain and the variable DRC message length are initially set to default values. The DRC channel gain is initially set to a default value, which may be \u22121.5 dB when an access terminal is not in handoff, and \u22123 dB otherwise. The DRC message length is initially set to a default value, which may be 2 when an access terminal is not in handoff, and 4 otherwise. Subsequently, both the variables DRC channel gain and DRC message length are adjusted by a serving sector. The other sectors in the access terminal's active set adjust the DRC channel gain only.","Each sector determines forward link utilization and a DRC erasure rate of all access terminals whose active set contain the sector. The term \u201cforward link utilization\u201d is a value evaluated as one minus a percentage of slots on the forward link that are idle because all the DRC symbols from access terminals served by a sector are erased. The forward link utilization value may be filtered with a filter with a time constant. The time constant may comprise 2 minutes.","When a serving sector determines that the determined DRC erasure rate is above a second erasure rate threshold value (Te) or that the forward link utilization (U) is below a first utilization threshold value (Tu), the serving sector proceeds as follows.","When only one variable affecting the DRC channel margin is to be changed, the serving sector tests whether the variable, e.g., the DRC channel gain or the DRC message length, is at the maximum value. If the variable is at maximum value, the value of the variable is maintained. The determination to maintain the value of the variable is indicated by sending no adjustment message to the access terminal. Alternatively, an adjustment message indicating that a current value of the variable is to be kept (\u201chold\u201d) is sent. If the variable is not at the maximum value, the value of the variable is increased. The determination to increase the value of the variable is indicated by sending transmit an adjustment message indicating that the access terminal is to increase the at least one variable (\u201cup\u201d).","When at least one variable affecting the DRC channel margin to be changed, the serving sector tests whether one of the at least one variable, e.g., the DRC channel gain, is at the maximum value. If the one variable is not at the maximum value, the value of the variable is increased. The determination to increase the value of the variable is indicated by sending transmit an adjustment message indicating that the access terminal is to increase the at least one variable (\u201cup\u201d). If the one variable is at the maximum value, the serving sector tests whether the other of the at least one variable, e.g., the DRC message length, is at the maximum value.

The determination to maintain the values of the variables is indicated by sending no adjustment message to the access terminal. Alternatively, an adjustment message indicating that current values of the variables are to be kept (\u201chold\u201d) is sent.

The symbol comprises number of bits allowing mapping of all traffic channel data rates. The block encoder  encodes the symbol yielding a code word, and provides the code word to a code word repetition block , which repeats the DRC code words.
