{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","REFERENCE NUMBERS IN DRAWINGS","TERM DEFINITIONS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Method of Use","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to a system for language translation. More particularly, the present invention is an on-line based collaborative translation system, termed (CTS) that is a web based product that offers real-time and batch translation services to clients over the internet. The CTS is protocol agnostic, meaning it can provide its services via all the major internet protocol and data types, with the CTS helping to solve the issues raised by inaccuracies of current automated translation software products by providing a real time system by which skilled human agents may translate all or part of the client communications.","The need for language translation has existed ever since there was the desire for communication as between different ethnic groups. Typically a local in person translator was used to translate either a live conversation on-the-fly or would translate text to text from one language to another language. The accuracy of this method depended greatly upon the skill and knowledge of the particular translator, as with many language translations, there is not a word for word correlation, thus the translator must translate thoughts, concepts, and ideas in conveying from the original language into the new language, therein lies the problem with automated software language systems\u2014wherein the automated translation system puts forth some form of automated logic on a word for word basis, thus increasing the opportunity for error in the language translation. This of course leaves the opportunity for misinterpretation or lack of understanding in the translation, this can be especially troublesome when the translation work involves highly technical, scientific, or some specialized lexicon data in the language to be translated that either the automated language software has no automated logic for, resulting in an even higher number of errors, or the particular human manual translator may not be familiar with, in other words a translator may know several languages well, however, the translator may not be familiar with a specialized vocabulary applicable to a specific technical field which increases the opportunity for translation errors even when the language translation is done manually. As examples, for specialized lexicons in the legal, medical, scientific, technical, and similar fields are especially troublesome to get an accurate language translation easily, as the automated language translation software would be prone to a large number of errors and for the human manual language translator\u2014they may not have the right skills to complete the desired language translation in a specialized lexicon with any degree of accuracy.","There are been numerous attempts to automate translation through software, which is very attractive for completing a high number of translations quickly and at low cost, however, due to the problems mentioned above of specialized terminology, i.e. the lexicon not being easily translated in an accurate manner, with automated translation this specialized terminology\/accuracy problem is made even worse as the translation data bases currently have a hard time of interpreting context of the translated idea or thought, as by necessity the translation databases must use set logic which can work acceptably well in simple basic conversation type words to be translated, however, any translation being beyond this and moving toward a technical or specialized nature, the error rate in automated translation would be too high to be acceptable.","In looking at the prior art in the language translation area starting with U.S. Pat. No. 6,292,769 to Flanagan et al. disclosed is a system for the automated translation of speech having speech recognition software as input for spoken words in online chat or conferencing systems. Thus in Flanagan et al., users may speak rather than type their messages and hear comments from other users. The speech data in Flanagan et al., is translated into textual data and submitted to the online information service or computer network for processing, see. column 2, lines 20-22 and lines 27-31.","Continuing in the prior art translation area in U.S. Pat. No. 5,351,189 to Doi et al. disclosed is a machine translation system including separated side-by-side display of original and corresponding translated sentences, wherein scrolling can be done to roll through the side-by-side display of original and translated segments. The machine translation system in Doi et al., comprises a translation processor for translating an original sentence by accessing a dictionary to produce a translated sentence corresponding to the original sentence, see column 2, lines 34-39.","Next, in the language translation prior art area in U.S. Pat. No. 6,996,520 to Levin disclosed is a language translation system of electronic communications that automatically selects and deploys specialized dictionaries based upon context recognition and other factors. The system in Levin includes a machine translation component which can access a database of specialized dictionaries and deploy search agents to search the internet for complementary specialized translation dictionaries, see column 3, lines 21-28. Also, in the translation arts in U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,701 to Stentiford et al., disclosed is a language translation system for translating phrases from a first language into a second language comprising a store holding collections of phrases in the second language. Phrases input in Stentiford et al., are characterized on the basis of keywords, and the corresponding phrases in the second language are output in an effort to increase speed and accuracy of automated translation. Thus in Stentiford et al., being similar to the typical tourist language translation \u201cphrase book\u201d of commonly used phrases such as \u201cwhere is the bathroom\u201d or \u201chow much does this cost\u201d as being more useful for typical conversation than a word for word translation when trying to communicate with someone in a different language\u2014thus reinforcing the idea that in language translation it requires an \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the meaning of a group of words to a similar meaning in the translated language, lending emphasis to the problem of either the automated language software translator or the manual human translator capacity to do this word group \u201cinterpretation\u201d into the new language.","Further to this in the language translation arts, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,953,088 to Suzuki et al. disclosed is a sentence translator with processing stage indicator. The translation apparatus in Suzuki et al., has a computer which analyzes the original language sentence and generates a target language sentence based on the analyzed original language sentence. Suzuki et al., attempts to refine the word-to-word automated translation scheme by ascertaining the translated word criterion of its verb, noun, adverb, adjective, plural, singular, tense, person, and the like, associated with the looked up words to translate, by further using a comparison to perform a syntactic (criterion relationship), semantic (coordination of criterion), and context (expression theme of the criterion) analysis for determining a best fit scenario relationship as between the translated words criterion, while indicating the continual status of the translation. Thus in Suzuki et al., there is an attempt to further refine the logic of the language translation software to improve the translation accuracy, and as this may be done for commonly used conversational words in major languages, there would not be much motivation to refine the language translation logic to this degree in uncommon specialized technical lexicons due to the smaller need for these language translations, thus the automated language software translation inaccuracy would still exist for specialized technical lexicon language translations.","There exists a need to provide an internet based language translation system that attempts to combine the best of both worlds being the automated software language translation systems and the skilled human manual language translation in a central system that can allocate as between automated and manual language translation to best fulfill the particular translation needs of the translation client. The ideal internet based language translation system would avail itself of a multitude of both automated software language systems and a multitude of skilled manual human language translators, thus resulting in optimizing the accuracy of the language translation by pulling together as many ways of accomplishing language translation as possible\u2014to best serve the languages involved and the potential specialized nature of the lexicon involved. This could be accomplished via a password protected basic web-site to show some information about the Collaborative Translation System (CTS) system, its usage and links and other resources for identifying the product's core functionality, such as maintaining a list of translator logins. A further aspect in the CTS system is the translation console that is a major component of the system. The CTS system console demonstrates the translator and translator administrator experience to monitor and translate messages, by having two modes: A first translator mode: having translator login, translator skill set-termed settings, shows the experience for the translator of receiving messages from the queue, translating them and sending them back, and cumulative data on the particular translator performance. A second administrator mode would include: administrator login, CTS system overall operational statistics, and particular translation case statistics.","A collaborative language translation system is disclosed that allocates as between automated and manual language translation services, with the collaborative language translation system including a credential protected language translation data portal for a manual language translator to gain access to a manual language translator section. Further included in the system is a unique database associated with the manual language translator in the manual language translator section, the unique database includes information selected from the group consisting essentially of manual language translator specific languages capability for translation, accuracy skill level for each language translated, scope of language translation project desired, and language translation turnaround time availability. In addition included in the system is a credential protected language translation portal for a language translation client to gain access to a language translation client section, wherein the language translation client initiates a selected language translation to be completed.","Further the system includes a unique information set associated with the language translation client in the language translation client section, the unique information set includes information selected from the group consisting essentially of client original language, client desired language, scope of translated material, client desired translation formats, client desired translation timing, and client desired translation accuracy that are associated with the selected language translation to be completed. Also included in the system is an automated language translation database, one or more processors, a memory, and one or more programs, wherein the one or more programs are stored in the memory and configured to be executed by the one or more processors. The one or more programs including instructions for allocating a flow of the unique information set as between the unique database and the automated language translation database based upon the client initiated unique information set associated with the selected language translation to be completed and instructions to perform the selected language translation to be completed for the language translation client.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0030"},"b":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0002","num":"0031"},"b":"55"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0003","num":"0032"},"b":"60"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0004","num":"0033"},"b":["65","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0005","num":"0034"},"b":"70"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0006","num":"0035"},"b":"75"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0007","num":"0036"},"b":"80"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0008","num":"0037"},"b":["85","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0009","num":"0038"},"b":["90","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0010","num":"0039"},"b":["95","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0011","num":"0040"},"b":["100","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0012","num":"0041"},"b":["105","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0013","num":"0042"},"b":["110","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0014","num":"0043"},"b":["115","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0015","num":"0044"},"b":["120","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0016","num":"0045"},"b":["121","80","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0017","num":"0046"},"b":["122","80","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0018","num":"0047"},"b":"125"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0019","num":"0048"},"b":["130","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0020","num":"0049"},"b":["135","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0021","num":"0050"},"b":["140","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0022","num":"0051"},"b":["145","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0023","num":"0052"},"b":["150","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0024","num":"0053"},"b":["155","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0025","num":"0054"},"b":["160","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0026","num":"0055"},"b":["165","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0027","num":"0056"},"b":["170","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0028","num":"0057"},"b":["171","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0029","num":"0058"},"b":["175","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0030","num":"0059"},"b":["180","125","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0031","num":"0060"},"b":["185","125","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0032","num":"0061"},"b":["186","125","80","175"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0033","num":"0062"},"b":"190"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0034","num":"0063"},"b":"195"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0035","num":"0064"},"b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0036","num":"0065"},"b":["205","90","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0037","num":"0066"},"b":["210","60"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0038","num":"0067"},"b":["215","80","121"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0039","num":"0068"},"b":["220","122","80"]}]}},"The collaborative translation system  (CTS) includes various software components that work together in the translation process.

Further included in the system  is a unique database  associated with the manual language translator  in the manual language translator section , the unique database  includes information selected from the group consisting essentially of manual language translator  specific languages capability  for translation, accuracy skill level  for each language translated, scope of language translation project  desired, and language translation turnaround time  availability. In addition included in the system is a credential protected language translation portal  for a language translation client  to gain access to a language translation client section , wherein the language translation client  initiates a selected language translation to be completed.","Further the system  includes a unique information set  associated with the language translation client  in the language translation client section , the unique information set  includes information selected from the group consisting essentially of client original language text , client desired language , scope of translated material  which can be a total of the text  or special instructions from the client , the client desired translation formats , again which can be special instructions from the client , the client desired translation timing , being turnaround time for the language translation, and the client desired translation accuracy  that are associated with the selected language translation to be completed. Also included in the system  is an automated language translation system  database , one or more processors , a memory , and one or more programs , wherein the one or more programs  are stored in the memory  and configured to be executed by the one or more processors . The one or more programs  including instructions for allocating  a flow of the unique information set  as between the unique database  and the automated language translation database  based upon the client  initiated unique information set  associated with the selected language translation to be completed and instructions to perform the selected language translation to be completed for the language translation client .","Further, on the collaborative language translation system , the unique database  can further include a member translator  technical language lexicon expertise skill set  and the unique information set  can also further include a client  desired technical language lexicon expertise skill set . Both of the technical language lexicon expertise skill sets  and  relate to the translator having language translation skills beyond good skill and conversational language translation, in other words the language translator has knowledge in a particular science, for instance-medical terminology lexicon\u2014that could be identified by the member translator  as skill  that would be matched to the client  required medical report translation, wherein the accuracy of the medical report translation would be far superior with a translator who knew the specialized lexicon for a particular scientific area.","Continuing, on the collaborative language translation system  the instructions to allocate  a flow of the unique information set  as between the unique database  and the automated language translation database , the unique information set will be allocated on a priority basis of firstly  to the automated language translation database  if qualified, and then secondly  to a manual language translator  specific queue  if qualified, and thirdly  to a general queue  for the manual language translator  to selectively translate. Thus to clarify, to better economize the required translation for the client  a search is made for the fastest and least expensive form if language translation-albeit with the most potential for poor accuracy\u2014is the automated language translation systems , which can be web searched in multitudes as more and more web based translation services are coming online, such as SYSTRAN, GOOGLETRANSLATE, MYMOJOFITI, and the like, that have the lowest cost and fastest turnaround time depending upon if they qualify as per the clients  requirements that can include accuracy , speed  and cost , or the added qualification of technical language lexicon  specialty as parameters  for the automated translation database . If none of the automated language translation databases  qualify to the clients  requirements of accuracy , speed , and cost  and possibly the qualification of technical language lexicon  specialty, than a search is made for a member language translator  who meets the aforementioned qualifications and who would be the first available member language translator , wherein the clients  language translation job would go into the member  specific queue , if the member  meets the clients previously mentioned qualifications, and failing that, the clients  requested language translation job is placed into a general queue  for any member language translator  to pick up on a voluntary basis.","A further option for the collaborative language translation system  is wherein the client  can generate rankings of particular member language translators  based upon translation jobs that a particular member language translator  had completed for the client  in the categories of accuracy , speed , cost , and technical language lexicon expertise skill set , that would then be all incorporated into the unique database  is the particular member language translator  rankings. Thus these rankings by the client  would be analyzed to develop a ranking of the member language translators  performance which would be proportionally correlated to the fee that the member language translator  could charge for their translation services. Member language translator  rankings would be defined by each language pair  the member  supports.
