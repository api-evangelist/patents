{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","General Overview","Implementation Examples"],"p":["The present invention relates to a system and method for managing expense data for expense reports.","The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued, but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, it should not be assumed that any of the approaches described in this section qualify as prior art merely by virtue of their inclusion in this section.","Currently, accounting for business expenditures is a painstaking and time-consuming activity. The receipts relating to an expenditure must be collected, itemized, and entered manually into a form. The receipt must then be reconciled with any credit card information available from a credit card service that processed a credit card used in the making the expenditure. If a person made the expenditure with a personal credit card, then a credit card statement for the expenditure must be collected from the person using the credit card. If the person made the expenditure with cash, then there is no credit card data with which to reconcile the receipt. Not only do the above activities take time, but they also delay reimbursement to the person making the expenditure.","One embodiment of the present invention is a method for generating expense data for an expense report. The method includes receiving receipt data that includes one or more data items pertaining to a transaction, where the one or more data items are obtained from characters optically recognized in receipt image data for the transaction, and the receipt data includes data indicating that the transaction is a credit card transaction, and creating expense data for the expense report, where the expense data includes the receipt data and the receipt image data associated with the receipt data for the transaction, and the receipt data includes credit card data.","Another embodiment is a system for generating expense data for an expense report. The system includes an interface to a receipt image processing system and an expense data generator. The interface to a receipt image processing system receives receipt image data, optically recognizes characters in the receipt image data, and provides receipt data obtained from the recognized characters, where the receipt data includes one or more data items pertaining to a transaction and indicates whether the transaction is a credit card transaction or a cash transaction. The expense data generator receives receipt data, and creates expense data for the expense report, where the expense data includes the receipt data and the receipt image data associated with the receipt data for the transaction.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding. It will be apparent, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are depicted in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","An embodiment obtains data from a receipt and matches the data with credit card information, if the transaction recorded on the receipt is a credit card transaction. An expense report is generated based the receipt data and the credit card transaction data. In the description that follows, it is understood that while the term \u201ccredit card\u201d is used for purposes of explanation, the term includes, without limitation any form of payment that involves the use of crediting or debiting of an account and is not limited to credit, debit, or ATM cards. For example, the approach is applicable to transactions involving the use of credit cards, debit cards and ATM cards, as well as transactions that are performed using wireless communications, for example, via mobile devices, PDAs, cell phones, tablet computers, laptop computers, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","106","112","114","116","118","106","102","104","120","108","124","110","126","120","124","126","120","124","126"]},"The expense report system receives the receipt image data  via link  from the receipt image capture devices , , credit card data  from the credit card services  via link , and receipt data  from the receipt image processing services  via link .

The special-purpose computing devices may be hard-wired to perform the techniques, or may include digital electronic devices such as one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that are persistently programmed to perform the techniques, or may include one or more general purpose hardware processors programmed to perform the techniques pursuant to program instructions in firmware, memory, other storage, or a combination. Such special-purpose computing devices may also combine custom hard-wired logic, ASICs, or FPGAs with custom programming to accomplish the techniques. The special-purpose computing devices may be desktop computer systems, portable computer systems, handheld devices, networking devices or any other device that incorporates hard-wired and\/or program logic to implement the techniques.","For example,  is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system  upon which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Computer system  includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a hardware processor  coupled with bus  for processing information. Hardware processor  may be, for example, a general-purpose microprocessor.","Computer system  also includes a main memory , such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus  for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor . Main memory  also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor . Such instructions, when stored in non-transitory storage media accessible to processor , convert computer system  into a special-purpose machine that is customized to perform the operations specified in the instructions.","Computer system  further includes a read only memory (ROM)  or other static storage device coupled to bus  for storing static information and instructions for processor . A storage device , such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus  for storing information and instructions.","Computer system  may be coupled via bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus  for communicating information and command selections to processor . Another type of user input device is cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor  and for controlling cursor movement on display . This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.","Computer system  may implement the techniques described herein using customized hard-wired logic, one or more ASICs or FPGAs, firmware and\/or program logic which in combination with the computer system causes or programs computer system  to be a special-purpose machine. According to one embodiment, the techniques herein are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions may be read into main memory  from another storage medium, such as storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory  causes processor  to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions.","The term \u201cstorage media\u201d as used herein refers to any non-transitory media that store data and\/or instructions that cause a machine to operation in a specific fashion. Such storage media may comprise non-volatile media and\/or volatile media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory . Common forms of storage media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, solid state drive, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic data storage medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical data storage medium, any physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, NVRAM, any other memory chip or cartridge.","Storage media is distinct from but may be used in conjunction with transmission media. Transmission media participates in transferring information between storage media. For example, transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.","Various forms of media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor  for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk or solid-state drive of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system  can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus . Bus  carries the data to main memory , from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory  may optionally be stored on storage device  either before or after execution by processor .","Computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  that is connected to a local network . For example, communication interface  may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, cable modem, satellite modem, or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.","Network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) . ISP  in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d . Local network  and Internet  both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link  and through communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from computer system , are example forms of transmission media.","Computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link  and communication interface . In the Internet example, a server  might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet , ISP , local network  and communication interface .","The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, and\/or stored in storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution.","In the foregoing specification, embodiments of the invention have been described with reference to numerous specific details that may vary from implementation to implementation.
