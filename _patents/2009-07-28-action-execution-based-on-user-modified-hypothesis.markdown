Stephen G. Kunin, Benefit of Prior-Filed Application, USPTO Official Gazette Mar. 18, 2003, available at http:\/\/www.uspto.gov\/web\/offices\/com\/sol\/og\/2003\/week11\/patbene.htm. The present Applicant Entity (hereinafter \u201cApplicant\u201d) has provided above a specific reference to the application(s) from which priority is being claimed as recited by statute. Applicant understands that the statute is unambiguous in its specific reference language and does not require either a serial number or any characterization, such as \u201ccontinuation\u201d or \u201ccontinuation-in-part,\u201d for claiming priority to U.S. patent applications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Applicant understands that the USPTO's computer programs have certain data entry requirements, and hence Applicant is designating the present application as a continuation-in-part of its parent applications as set forth above, but expressly points out that such designations are not to be construed in any way as any type of commentary and\/or admission as to whether or not the present application contains any new matter in addition to the matter of its parent application(s).","All subject matter of the Related Applications and of any and all parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, etc. applications of the Related Applications is incorporated herein by reference to the extent such subject matter is not inconsistent herewith.","A computationally implemented method includes, but is not limited to presenting to a user a hypothesis identifying at least a relationship between a first event type and a second event type; receiving from the user one or more modifications to modify the hypothesis; and executing one or more actions based, at least in part, on a modified hypothesis resulting, at least in part, from the reception of the one or more modifications.

In addition to the foregoing, other computer program product aspects are described in the claims, drawings, and text forming a part of the present disclosure.","The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.","A recent trend that is becoming increasingly popular in the computing\/communication field is to electronically record one's feelings, thoughts, and other aspects of the person's everyday life onto an open diary. One place where such open diaries are maintained are at social networking sites commonly known as \u201cblogs\u201d where users may report or post their latest status, personal activities, and various other aspects of the users' everyday life. The process of reporting or posting blog entries is commonly referred to as blogging. Other social networking sites may allow users to update their personal information via, for example, social networking status reports in which a user may report or post for others to view their current status, activities, and\/or other aspects of the user.","A more recent development in social networking is the introduction and explosive growth of microblogs in which individuals or users (referred to as \u201cmicrobloggers\u201d) maintain open diaries at microblog websites (e.g., otherwise known as \u201ctwitters\u201d) by continuously or semi-continuously posting microblog entries. A microblog entry (e.g., \u201ctweet\u201d) is typically a short text message that is usually not more than 140 characters long. The microblog entries posted by a microblogger may report on any aspect of the microblogger's daily life. Typically, such microblog entries will describe the various \u201cevents\u201d associated with or are of interest to the microblogger that occurs during a course of a typical day. The microblog entries are often continuously posted during the course of a typical day, and thus, by the end of a normal day, a substantial number of events may have been reported and posted.","Each of the reported events that may be posted through microblog entries may be categorized into one of at least three possible categories. The first category of events that may be reported through microblog entries are \u201cobjective occurrences\u201d that may or may not be associated with the microblogger. Objective occurrences that are associated with a microblogger may be any characteristic, incident, happening, or any other event that occurs with respect to the microblogger or are of interest to the microblogger that can be objectively reported by the microblogger, a third party, or by a device. Such events would include, for example, intake of food, medicine, or nutraceutical, certain physical characteristics of the microblogger such as blood sugar level or blood pressure, activities of the microblogger, external events such as performance of the stock market (which the microblogger may have an interest in), performance of a favorite sports team, and so forth.","Other examples of objective occurrences include, for example, external events such as the local weather, activities of others (e.g., spouse or boss), the behavior or activities of a pet or livestock, the characteristics or performances of mechanical or electronic devices such as automobiles, appliances, and computing devices, and other events that may directly or indirectly affect the microblogger.","A second category of events that may be reported or posted through microblog entries include \u201csubjective user states\u201d of the microblogger. Subjective user states of a microblogger may include any subjective state or status associated with the microblogger that can only be typically reported by the microblogger (e.g., generally cannot be directly reported by a third party or by a device). Such states including, for example, the subjective mental state of the microblogger (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, tension, state of alertness, state of mental fatigue, jealousy, envy, and so forth), the subjective physical state of the microblogger (e.g., upset stomach, state of vision, state of hearing, pain, and so forth), and the subjective overall state of the microblogger (e.g., \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cbad,\u201d state of overall wellness, overall fatigue, and so forth). Note that the term \u201csubjective overall state\u201d as will be used herein refers to those subjective states that may not fit neatly into the other two categories of subjective user states described above (e.g., subjective mental states and subjective physical states).","A third category of events that may be reported or posted through microblog entries include \u201csubjective observations\u201d made by the microblogger. A subjective observation is similar to subjective user states and may be any subjective opinion, thought, or evaluation relating to any external incidence (e.g., outward looking instead of inward looking as in the case of subjective user states). Thus, the difference between subjective user states and subjective observations is that subjective user states relates to self-described subjective descriptions of the user states of one's self while subjective observations relates to subjective descriptions or opinions regarding external events. Examples of subjective observations include, for example, a microblogger's perception about the subjective user state of another person (e.g., \u201che seems tired\u201d), a microblogger's perception about another person's activities (e.g., \u201che drank too much yesterday\u201d), a microblogger's perception about an external event (e.g., \u201cit was a nice day today\u201d), and so forth. Although microblogs are being used to provide a wealth of personal information, thus far they have been primarily limited to their use as a means for providing commentaries and for maintaining open diaries.","Another potential source for valuable but yet to be fully exploited is data that may be provided by sensing devices that are used to sense and\/or monitor various aspects of everyday life. Currently there are a number of sensing devices that can detect and\/or monitor various user-related and nonuser-related events. For example, there are presently a number of sensing devices that can sense various physical or physiological characteristics of a person or an animal (e.g., a pet or a livestock). Examples of such devices include commonly known and used monitoring devices such as blood pressure devices, heart rate monitors, blood glucose sensors (e.g., glucometers), respiration sensor devices, temperature sensors, and so forth. Other examples of devices that can monitor physical or physiological characteristics include more exotic and sophisticated devices such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) device, functional Near Infrared (fNIR) devices, blood cell-sorting sensing device, and so forth. Many of these devices are becoming more compact and less expensive such that they are becoming increasingly accessible for purchase and\/or self-use by the general public.","Other sensing devices may be used in order to sense and for monitor activities of a person or an animal. These would include, for example, global positioning systems (GPS), pedometers, accelerometers, and so forth. Such devices are compact and can even be incorporated into, for example, a mobile communication device such a cellular telephone or on the collar of a pet. Other sensing devices for monitoring activities of individuals (e.g., users) may be incorporated into larger machines and may be used in order to monitor the usage of the machines by the individuals. These would include, for example, sensors that are incorporated into exercise machines, automobiles, bicycles, and so forth. Today there are even toilet monitoring devices that are available to monitor the toilet usage of individuals.","Other sensing devices are also available that can monitor general environmental conditions such as environmental temperature sensor devices, humidity sensor devices, barometers, wind speed monitors, water monitoring sensors, air pollution sensor devices (e.g., devices that can measure the amount of particulates in the air such as pollen, those that measure COlevels, those that measure ozone levels, and so forth). Other sensing devices may be employed in order to monitor the performance or characteristics of mechanical and\/or electronic devices. All the above described sensing devices may provide useful data that may indicate objectively observable events (e.g., objective occurrences).","In accordance with various embodiments, the data provided through social networking sites (e.g., via microblog entries, status entries, diary entries, and so forth) as well as, in some cases, those from sensing devices may be processed in order to develop a hypotheses that identifies the relationship between multiple event types (e.g., types of events). For example, based on past events reported by a person (e.g., a microblogger) and\/or reported by sensing devices, a hypothesis such as a hypothesis may be developed relating to the person, a third party, a device, external activities, environmental conditions, or anything else that may be of interest to the person. One way to develop or create such a hypothesis is by identifying a pattern of events that repeatedly reoccurs.","Once such a hypothesis is developed, one or more actions may be executed based on the hypothesis and in response to, for example, occurrence of one or more reported events that may match or substantially match one or more of the event types identified in the hypothesis. Examples of actions that could be executed include, for example, the presentation of advisories or the prompting of one or more devices (e.g., sensing devices or home appliances) to execute one or more operations. However, the development of a hypothesis based on identifying repeatedly reoccurring patterns of events may lead to the development of a faulty or incorrect hypothesis.","As an illustration, suppose a hypothesis is developed by identifying a repetitively reoccurring pattern of events that indicate, for example, that whenever the person wakes-up late, eats ice cream, and drinks coffee, a stomach ache follows. However, merely looking at repetitively reoccurring patterns of events may result in a hypothesis that includes types of events that may not be relevant to the hypothesis or may not accurately reflect the types of events that should be included in the hypothesis. For example, in the above example, waking-up late may not be relevant to having a stomach ache. That is, the hypothesis may have been based on data that indicated that prior to past occurrences of stomachaches, the subject (e.g., user) had reported waking-up late, eating ice cream, and drinking coffee. However, the reports of waking-up late occurring prior to previous reports of stomachaches may merely have been a coincidence. As can be seen, using the technique determining repeatedly reoccurring patterns of events may result in the development of inaccurate or even false hypothesis.","Accordingly, robust methods, systems, and computer program products are provided to, among other things, present to a user a hypothesis identifying at least a relationship between a first event type and a second event type and receive from the user one or more modifications to modify the hypothesis. The methods, systems, and computer program products may then facilitate in the execution of one or more actions based, at least in part, on a modified hypothesis resulting, at least in part, from the reception of the one or more modifications. Examples of the types of actions that may be executed include, for example, the presentation of the modified hypothesis or advisories relating to the modified hypothesis. Other actions that may be executed include the prompting of mechanical and\/or electronic devices to execute one or more operations based, at least in part, on the modified hypothesis. In some cases, the execution of the one or more actions, in addition to being based on the modified hypothesis, may be in response to a reported event.","The robust methods, systems, and computer program products may be employed in a variety of environments including, for example, social networking environments, blogging or microblogging environments, instant messaging (IM) environments, or any other type of environment that allows a user to, for example, maintain a diary. Further, the methods, systems, and computing program products in various embodiments may be implemented in a standalone computing device or implemented in a client\/server environment.","In various implementations, a \u201chypothesis,\u201d as referred to herein, may define one or more relationships or links between different types of events (i.e., event types) including defining a relationship between at least a first event type (e.g., a type of event such as a particular type of subjective user state including, for example, a subjective mental state such as \u201chappy\u201d) and a second event type (e.g., another type of event such as a particular type of objective occurrence, for example, favorite sports team winning a game). In some cases, a hypothesis may be represented by an events pattern that may indicate spatial or sequential (e.g., time\/temporal) relationships between different event types (e.g., subjective user states, subjective observations, and\/or objective occurrences). In some embodiments, a hypothesis may be further defined by an indication of the soundness (e.g., strength) of the hypothesis.","Note that for ease of explanation and illustration, the following description will describe a hypothesis as defining, for example, the sequential or spatial relationships between two, three, or four event types. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that such a hypothesis may also identify the relationships between five or more event types (e.g., a first event type, a second event type, a third event type, a fourth event type, a fifth event type, and so forth).","In some embodiments, a hypothesis may, at least in part, be defined or represented by an events pattern that indicates or suggests a spatial or a sequential (e.g., time\/temporal) relationship between different event types. Such a hypothesis, in some cases, may also indicate the strength or weakness of the link between the different event types. That is, the strength or weakness (e.g., soundness) of the correlation between different event types may depend upon, for example, whether the events pattern repeatedly occurs and\/or whether a contrasting events pattern has occurred that may contradict the hypothesis and therefore, weaken the hypothesis (e.g., an events pattern that indicates a person becoming tired after jogging for thirty minutes when a hypothesis suggests that a person will be energized after jogging for thirty minutes).","As briefly described above, a hypothesis may be represented by an events pattern that may indicate spatial or sequential (e.g., time or temporal) relationship or relationships between multiple event types. In some implementations, a hypothesis may indicate a temporal relationship or relationships between multiple event types. In alternative implementations a hypothesis may indicate a more specific time relationship or relationships between multiple event types. For example, a sequential pattern may represent the specific pattern of events that occurs along a timeline that may specify the specific amount of time, if there are any, between occurrences of the event types. In still other implementations, a hypothesis may indicate the specific spatial (e.g., geographical) relationship or relationships between multiple event types.","In various embodiments, a hypothesis may initially be provided to a user (e.g., a microblogger or a social networking user) that the hypothesis may or may not be directly associated with.

Such a hypothesis may relate to, for example, one or more subjective user states associated with the user, one or more activities associated with the user, or one or more characteristics associated with the user. In other embodiments, however, a hypothesis may be initially provided that may not be directly associated with a user. For example, a hypothesis may be initially provided that may be particularly associated with a third party (e.g., a spouse of the user, a friend, a pet, and so forth), while in other embodiments, a hypothesis may be initially provided that is directed to a device that may be, for example, operated or used by the user.

Alternatively, such a hypothesis may be supplied by a third party source such as a network service provider or a content provider.","After being presented with the hypothesis, the user may be provided with an opportunity to modify the presented hypothesis. Various types of modifications may be made by the user including, for example, revising or deleting one or more event types identified by the hypothesis, revising one or more relationships between the multiple event types identified by the hypothesis, or adding new event types to the hypothesis. Based on the modifications provided by the user, a modified hypothesis may be generated. In some embodiments, the user may be provided with the option to delete or deactivate the hypothesis or an option to select or revise the type of actions that may be executed based on the modified hypothesis.","Based, at least in part, on the modified hypothesis, one or more actions may be executed. Examples of the types of actions that may be executed include, for example, presenting to the user or a third party one or more advisories related to the modified hypothesis or prompting one or more devices to execute one or more operations based on the modified hypothesis. The one or more advisories that may be presented may include, for example, presentation of the modified hypothesis, presentation of a recommendation for a future action, presentation of a prediction of a future event, and\/or presentation of a past event or events.

For example, in various implementations, the action execution operation  may include an operation  for executing the one or more actions based on the modified hypothesis and in response to a reported event as depicted in . For instance, the action execution module * of the mobile device  or the computing device  executing the one or more actions based on the modified hypothesis  and in response to a reported event (e.g., in response to the reported event reception module * of the mobile device  or the computing device  receiving data indicating a reported event).","In some implementations, operation  may further include an operation  for executing the one or more actions based on the modified hypothesis and in response to a reported event that at least substantially matches with one of at least two event types identified by the modified hypothesis as depicted in . For instance, the action execution module * of the mobile device  or the computing device  executing the one or more actions based on the modified hypothesis  and in response to a reported event that substantially matches with one of at least two event types identified by the modified hypothesis . To illustrate, suppose the modified hypothesis  indicates a relationship between eating a particular Mexican dish at a particular restaurant (e.g., an event type) with a stomach ache (e.g., another event type). Under this scenario, the action execution module * may execute an action (e.g., indicate a warning about a pending stomach ache) if it is reported that a similar Mexican dish was consumed at the same restaurant (e.g., reported event).","Operation , in turn, may further include an operation  for executing the one or more actions based on the modified hypothesis and in response to a reported event that matches with one of the at least two event types identified by the modified hypothesis as depicted in . For instance, the action execution module * of the mobile device  or the computing device  executing the one or more actions based on the modified hypothesis  and in response to a reported event (e.g., in response to the reported event reception module * of the mobile device  or the computing device  receiving data indicating a reported event) that matches with one of the at least two event types identified by the modified hypothesis . To illustrate, suppose the modified hypothesis  indicates a relationship between exercising on a treadmill (e.g., an event type) and feeling hot (e.g., another event type). Under this scenario, the action execution module * may execute an action (e.g., configuring an air conditioner to operate at full power) if it is reported that the treadmill was used for exercising (e.g., reported event).","Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware or software is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and\/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies are deployed. For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and\/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and\/or devices and\/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software, and or firmware.","The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and\/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples contain one or more functions and\/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and\/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof. In one embodiment, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits, as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and\/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and\/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communications link, a wireless communication link, etc.).","In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof can be viewed as being composed of various types of \u201celectrical circuitry.\u201d Consequently, as used herein \u201celectrical circuitry\u201d includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein), electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of random access memory), and\/or electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, or optical-electrical equipment). Those having skill in the art will recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.","Those having skill in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and\/or processes in the fashion set forth herein, and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and\/or processes into data processing systems. That is, at least a portion of the devices and\/or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation. Those having skill in the art will recognize that a typical data processing system generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, a memory such as volatile and non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors, computational entities such as operating systems, drivers, graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices, such as a touch pad or screen, and\/or control systems including feedback loops and control motors (e.g., feedback for sensing position and\/or velocity; control motors for moving and\/or adjusting components and\/or quantities). A typical data processing system may be implemented utilizing any suitable commercially available components, such as those typically found in data computing\/communication and\/or network computing\/communication systems.","The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components and\/or logically interacting and\/or logically interactable components.","While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.","In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.).","In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 1","i":["a ","b "],"b":["1","10","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","b.
