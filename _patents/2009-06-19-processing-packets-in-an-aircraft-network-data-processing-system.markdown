{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The present disclosure relates generally to interfacing between network components having different protocols and in particular to processing packets of data between devices connected to network data buses. Still, more particularly, the present disclosure relates a method and apparatus for monitoring a network data processing system and processing packets of data for errors and network configuration between components connected to data networks.","2. Background","Aeronautical Radio Inc. 664 (ARINC 664) is a standard for an avionics data network used in aircraft including commercial and transport aircraft. The ARINC 664 defines physical and electrical interfaces of a data network and data protocol for an aircraft's local area network. The ARINC 664 standard is based on the IEEE 802.3 standard and uses commercial off-the-shelf hardware. The Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) network is built on the ARINC 664 standard. AFDX uses a switch tied to a number of end systems or line replaceable units. Each end system may be bridged using other switches on the network. AFDX also provides dual redundancy to increase availability on connectionless datagram communication. AFDX uses less wiring than previous networks. Since AFDX is full duplex, data can travel across a single wire in both directions, as opposed to the previous systems where two lines were used, one for each direction, in a simplex configuration.","AFDX uses a special protocol to provide deterministic timing and redundancy management. The deterministic timing allows for data to be transmitted between different systems within a specified time. To accomplish the timing, the amount of data per transmission is limited. AFDX comprises a data or logical link layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layer. AFDX also utilizes virtual links. Virtual links provide a unidirectional logic path from end system to end system instead of a normal Ethernet switch which routes packets of data based on machine access code address. AFDX routes packets of data using a virtual link identifier. A virtual link identifier is a 16-bit unsigned integer value that follows a constant 32-bit data field.","Virtual links are used by a network switch for three functions. Routing data packets, traffic policing, and size policing. Traffic policing may be, for example, monitoring network traffic in conformance with particular settings. For example, each virtual link has a \u201cbandwidth allocation gap\u201d. If a data packet with a particular virtual link is received in a period less than the specified bandwidth allocation gap, the switch does not forward the data packet to any configured port. Size policing may be, for example, measuring the minimum and maximum frame size of a particular data packet and only forwarding the packet if it is within the specified tolerance for a particular virtual link.","Currently, accessing and testing the AFDX network requires the use of proprietary hardware and software. The current software is used in combination with an application programming interface designed for the proprietary hardware and software. In addition to having to use the proprietary hardware and software, which are costly, these systems do not provide all desired capabilities. Since the systems are proprietary, it is difficult to alter them to provide additional capabilities.","Thus, it would be advantageous to have a method and apparatus that takes into account at least some of the issues discussed above, as well as possibly other issues.","In one advantageous embodiment, a method is present for processing packets in an aircraft network data processing system. A number of first packets of data are received from each redundant network in a plurality of redundant networks in the aircraft network data processing system. A number of second packets of data generated by a redundancy manager are received in communication with the plurality of redundant networks. Then, a configuration of the plurality of redundant networks is identified using the number of first packets and the number of second packets.","In another advantageous embodiment, an apparatus comprises a bus; a memory connected to the bus; and a processor unit connected to the bus, wherein the processor unit configured to receive a number of first packets of data from each redundant network in a plurality of redundant networks in the aircraft network data processing system; receive a number of second packets of data generated by a redundancy manager in communication with the plurality of redundant networks; and identify a configuration of the plurality of redundant networks using the number of first packets and the number of second packets.","In another advantageous embodiment, a computer program product comprises a computer recordable storage medium; program code, stored on the computer recordable storage medium, for receiving a number of first packets of data from each redundant network in a plurality of redundant networks in the aircraft network data processing system; program code, stored on the computer recordable storage medium, for receiving a number of second packets of data generated by a redundancy manager in communication with the plurality of redundant networks; and program code, stored on the computer recordable storage medium, for identifying a configuration of the plurality of redundant networks using the number of first packets and the number of second packets.","The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present disclosure or may be combined in yet other embodiments in which further details can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.","Referring more particularly to the drawings, embodiments of the disclosure may be described in the context of aircraft manufacturing and service method  as shown in  and aircraft  as shown in .

As another example, airline network  in ground network  may connect to computers, such as proxy server computer , at airports, such as airport , through other types of networks other than Internet . For example, a wide area network (WAN) may be used in place of, or in conjunction with, Internet .","With reference now to , a flowchart of a process for processing packets in an aircraft network data processing system. This process may be implemented using network system  in .","The process begins by receiving a number of first packets of data from each redundant network in a plurality of redundant networks in the aircraft network data processing system (step ). The number of first packets received from the plurality of redundant networks is received through one or more interface accumulators. Also, a number of second packets of data generated by a redundancy manager are received in communication with the plurality of redundant networks (step ). Then, a configuration of the plurality of redundant networks is identified using the number of first packets and the number of second packets (step ). Identifying is performed by identifying machine access control addresses of the number of first packets and the number of second packets. In different advantageous embodiments, identifying the configuration of the plurality of redundant networks may also be done by identifying virtual link identifiers, internet protocol addresses, packet header elements, and\/or substantive data of the number of first and the number of second packets.","With reference now to , a flowchart of a process for determining a network configuration in an aircraft network data processing system. This process may be implemented using network system  in .","The process begins by receiving a data packet (step ). The data packet may consist of a frame of data. A determination is made to whether the data packet contains errors (step ). If there are errors, the data packet is discarded (step ). If there are no errors, the virtual link identifier is identified in the data packet (step ). The virtual link identifier is located in the machine access code address. Identifying the virtual link identifier in the data packet may be performed by filtering the protocol. For example, a Berkley Packet Filter may be used.","Once a virtual link identifier and machine access code address have been identified, a hash table is tested for a first occurrence of the virtual link identifier (step ). A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to associated values. A hash function converts a large amount of data into a datum, a single integer that serves to index an array. For example, virtual link identifier \u201c1234567891012131\u201d may be associated with map key \u201cright rudder.\u201d If the map key does not exist, a new virtual link configuration object is created (step ). The virtual link configuration object comprises information such as the virtual link identifier, maximum and minimum frame size measured, and bandwidth allocation gap value. Also, the new identified virtual link is added to the hash table (step ). An end system table may also be populated. A determination may then be made as to whether multiple end systems are using the same virtual link identifier.","Additionally, at the network layer, an internet protocol hash table may be created. The internet protocol address is comprised of a format aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd. The first section \u201caaa\u201d may be a constant, such as \u201c10\u201d. The second section \u201cbbb\u201d may be the end system equipment class. The third section \u201cccc\u201d may be the end system position. The fourth section \u201cddd\u201d may be the partition identifier, such as an integer from 0 to 255. Additionally, at the transport layer, a user datagram protocol hash table may be created. A destination user datagram protocol datagram object may be created and stored in the hash table. Each object at each layer, logical link, network, and transport may have statistical data objects. The statistics may be used by an application to extract information about a network to determine the configuration and usage of the network.","Additionally, when discovering the network, the end system, virtual link, internet protocol source address, user datagram protocol source port, user datagram protocol destination port, and internet protocol destination may be used to discover the network configuration.","The end system may be determined by a user defined identifier. In some advantageous embodiments, the user defined identifier may be referred to as two separate identifiers, the equipment class identifier and the equipment position identifier. The user defined identifier is 16 bits and indicates the equipment class and position. In other advantageous embodiments, the user defined identifier may comprise a different number of bits. If equipment class identifier and equipment position identifier are used, each would comprise 8 bits.","The internet protocol source address may be determined by a second user defined identifier and a partition identifier. A partition identifier indicates the number of virtual end systems at a physical end system.","The user defined identifier and the second user defined identifier may be compared and a determination made as to whether the identifiers are equal. If they are not, there may be an error in the data packet.","Additionally, the signature of the protocol may be checked for errors. One advantageous embodiment of the protocol checking comprises loose signature checks, strict signature checks, and consistency checks.","Loose signature checks are a user defined mode of the packet engine to filter data packets. The loose signature checks are the destination machine access code address at ether[0:4]==0x03000000; source machine access address at 1)ether[6:3]==0x020000, 2)ether[11:1]==0x20 or ether[11:1]==0x40; and type at ether[12:2]==0x0800. For example, the designation \u201cether[0:4}\u201d refers to the data packet. The initial \u201c0\u201d refers to the offset starting at the source machine access code address, comprising 4 octets.","Strict signature checks are a user defined mode of the packet engine to filter data packets. Strict signature checks include loose signature checks. The strict signature checks are the internet protocol version and header length at ether[14:1]==0x45; internet protocol type of service at ether[15:1]==0x00; internet protocol time to live at ether[22:1]==0x01; internet protocol at ether[23:1]==0x01 or ether[23:1]==0x11; internet protocol source address at ether[26:1]==0x0a; and internet protocol destination address: ether[30:1]==0x0a or ether[30:2]==0xe0e0.","Strict signature checks also comprise consistency checks. The consistency checks are the virtual link if ether[30:2]==0xe0e0, then ether[4:2]==ether[32:2]; and the user defined identifier, ether[9:2]==ether[27:2].","Additionally, in some advantageous embodiments, a program associated with the network system through a socket layer determines whether one or more errors exist in the network. The one or more errors are at least one of a timeout, queue overrun, and reception of the plurality of packets from less than all of the number of networks. In other advantageous embodiments, the packets are only received from a subset of the plurality of packets and the managed plurality of packets based on a number of filter options.","The flowcharts and block diagrams in the different depicted embodiments illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of some possible implementations of apparatus and methods in different advantageous embodiments. In this regard, each block in the flowcharts or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, function, and\/or a portion of an operation or step. In some alternative implementations, the function or functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, in some cases, two blocks shown in succession may be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.","For example, socket layer may be located in network system , but not packet engine  as in . As another example, redundancy manager  may be located in network layer  and\/or transport layer  as in .","In one or more advantageous embodiments, the ability to access packets of data above or below the redundancy manager is provided.
