As used herein, the term \u201casymmetric\u201d means that the arms of the block copolymer are not all identical. Generally, a polymodal block copolymer is an asymmetric block copolymer (i.e., a polymodal asymmetric block copolymer) as not all arms of a polymodal block copolymer are identical since the molecular weights of the end blocks are not all the same. In some embodiments, the block copolymers of the present disclosure are polymodal, asymmetric block copolymers. Methods of making asymmetric, polymodal block copolymers are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,296,547.","Generally, the multifunctional coupling agent may be any polyalkenyl coupling agent or other material known to have functional groups that can react with carbanions of the living polymer to form linked polymers.

Generally, the miscibility of a tackifier with a block can be determined by measuring the effect of the tackifier on the Tg of that block. If a tackifier is miscible with a block it will alter (e.g., increase) the Tg of that block.","A tackifier is \u201cprimarily compatible\u201d with a block if it is at least miscible with that block, although it may also be miscible with other blocks. For example, a tackifier that is primarily compatible with a rubbery block will be miscible with the rubbery block, but may also be miscible with a glassy block.","Generally, resins having relatively low solubility parameters tend to associate with the rubbery blocks; however, their solubility in the glassy blocks tends to increase as the molecular weights or softening points of these resins are lowered.

Exemplary low Tg tackifiers include polybutenes.","Generally, a plasticizer is compatible with one or more blocks of the linear block copolymer, and\/or one or more blocks of the multi-arm block copolymer. Generally, a plasticizer that is compatible with a block will be miscible with that block and will lower the Tg of that block. Exemplary plasticizers include naphthenic oils, liquid polybutene resins, polyisobutylene resins, and liquid isoprene polymers.","In some embodiments, the ratio of the total weight of all multi-arm block copolymers to the total weight of all linear block copolymers ranges from 5.7:1 to 1.5:1.

In some embodiments, this ratio is no less than 1:1.15, or even no less than 1:1.1.","In some embodiments, the ratio of the total weight of high Tg tackifier(s) that are primarily compatible with the rubbery blocks to the total weight of the high Tg tackifier(s) that are primarily compatible with the glassy blocks ranges from 9:1 to 0.67:1 In some embodiments, this ratio is no greater than 4:1, and, in some embodiments, no greater than 3:1. In some embodiments, this ratio is no less than 1:1, or even no less than 1.85:1.","In some embodiments, the total amount of the components selected from the group consisting of low Tg tackifiers, plasticizers, and combinations thereof, expressed as a percent by weight (wt %) based on the total weight of the main adhesive components (i.e., the block copolymers, the high Tg tackifiers, the low Tg tackifiers and the plasticizers), is in the range of 2 to 10 wt %. In some embodiments, the total amount of these components is at least 4 wt %, and, in some embodiments, at least 5 wt % based on the total weight of the main adhesive components. In some embodiments, the total amount of these components is no greater than 8 wt %, or even no greater than 7 wt % based on the total weight of the main adhesive components.","In some embodiments, the pressure sensitive adhesive of the present disclosure is a hot melt adhesive.

For example, they can be made by dissolving the block copolymers, suitable tackifiers, any plasticizer(s), and any other additives in a suitable solvent, creating a solvent-based adhesive. The adhesive may then be coated onto a substrate (e.g., release liner, tape backing, core, or panel) using conventional means (e.g., knife coating, roll coating, gravure coating, rod coating, curtain coating, spray coating, air knife coating). In some embodiments, the adhesive is then dried to remove at least some of the solvent.

In some embodiments, the pressure sensitive adhesive may contain residual solvents, e.g., adhesives may be prepared in solvent, and the solvent is removed prior to subsequent processing, e.g., coating. Generally, the residual solvent is present as no greater than about 5%, in some embodiments, no greater than about 1%, or even no greater than trace amounts of solvent (i.e., essentially no solvent). Such substantially solvent-free processes are known and include, e.g., compounding by calendering or roll milling, and extruding (e.g., single. screw, twin screw, disk screw, reciprocating single screw, pin barrel single screw, etc.). Commercially available equipment such as BRABENDER or BANBURY internal mixers are also available to batch mix the adhesive compositions. After compounding, the adhesive may be coated through a die into a desired form, such as a layer of adhesive, or it may be collected for forming at a later time.","In some embodiments, solvent-based adhesives may be used.
