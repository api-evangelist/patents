{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to a launch tube assembly with an adjustable plenum volume.","More particularly, the invention relates to an adjustable length launch tube assembly with an adjustable plenum volume which assures that countermeasures launched from a launch tube have a predetermined acceleration.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Current externally housed submarine countermeasures are launched by way of gas generators. The generated gas pressure builds up behind the ram plate and countermeasure until there is enough pressure to shear pins holding a muzzle cap in place. This then allows the countermeasure to move through the launch tube and exit. The current gas generator imparts acceleration to the device on the order of 90 g's. A redesign of the gas generator is expected to impart accelerations on the order of 50 g's.","The following patents, for example, disclose gas generation in launch systems, but do not disclose an adjustable length launch tube which in turn creates a predetermined initial plenum volume.\n\n","Specifically, Jackson et al. discloses a lower power arcjet propellant feed system for delivering propellant to the low power arcjet. The low power arcjet propellant feed system includes a liquid propellant storage chamber for storing a liquid propellant. A gas generator in communication with the liquid propellant storage chamber generates a gaseous propellant upon receipt of the liquid propellant from the liquid propellant storage chamber. A gas plenum in communication with the gas generator accumulates the gaseous propellant for the gas generator up to a desired pressure. Actively controllable valves actively control the flow of the liquid propellant into the gas generator and actively control the flow of the resultant gaseous propellant out of the gas generator and into the gas plenum up to the desired pressure. A substantially continuous and stable low flow rate of gaseous propellant is then delivered to the low power arcjet.","The patent to Yagla et al. '919 discloses a launcher having means for directing and concentrically spreading, as well as dispersing, exhaust gases created by an internal combustion of an object, such as a missile, that is operatively launchable therefrom. The concentric duct provides the directing, spreading and dispersing means and cooperates with a cup having a means to arrange a port in operative relationship with an exhaust outlet of the object being launched. The cup which mates with the concentric duct has one of its ends open to the ambient so that the exhaust gases are lead into and out of the concentric duct so as to be concentrically dispersed into the atmosphere.","Mello discloses a submarine signal launcher for preventing pinched control wires therein. The submarine signal launcher includes a gas generator, an acoustic device countermeasure, a launch tube for housing the gas generator and the countermeasure, and a ram plate positioned between the gas generator and the countermeasure. A status cable is connected to the countermeasure and intermediately threaded through the ram plate and joined to the gas generator. A collapsible tube is connected to the ram plate and the gas generator. The status cable is confined within the collapsible tube. Securing members are formed on opposing ends of the collapsible tube for securing the collapsible tube to the ram plate and the gas generator, wherein upon assembly of the gas generator with the ram plate and the countermeasure within the launch tube, the collapsible tube will protect the cable from being pinched between joined ends of the ram plate and the gas generator.","Keller discloses a helicopter aircraft with an upper hollow center circular plenum in gaseous communication with a plurality of hollow hinged attached rotor blades. Below the plenum and in gaseous communication with it are two fan jet engines whose gaseous output can be inputted to the plenum and their attached hollow rotor blades through an operator controlled valve system. This same valve system can be adjusted to completely or partially by-pass the plenum and discharge the jet engines' gas to a common rear rudder located on the aircraft to provide directional control to the aircraft when in flight. The plenum is shaped lenticular in cross section similar to an airplane wing to provide a lifting body when the helicopter is in forward flight.","The patent to Gendre et al. discloses a projectile propulsion assembly of the type comprising a chamber housing a pressure source. The chamber which houses the pressure source communicates with at least one pipe placed inside the launch tube and having bores distributed along its length so as to be released in succession during ejection of the projectile.","Yagla et al. '310 discloses a launcher having means for directing and concentrically spreading, as well as dispersing, exhaust gases created by an internal combustion of an object, such as a missile, that is operatively launchable therefrom. The concentric duct provides the directing, spreading and dispersing means and cooperates with a cup having means to arrange a port in operative relationship with an exhaust outlet of the object being launched. The cup which mates with the concentric duct has one of its ends open to the ambient so that the exhaust gases are lead into and out of the concentric duct so as to be concentrically dispersed into the atmosphere.","The patent to Doctor et al. discloses an IR radiating decoy for an IR seeking anti-ship missile (ASM) and includes a propulsion section, safe and arming section, gas generator section, fuel tank section, and flight stabilization section to ignite and continuously maintain an IR plume for decoying the ASM away from the targeted ship. The IR radiating decoy ignites the IR plume immediately when the decoy reaches a safe separation distance from the targeted ship. The IR plume continues to be emitted as the decoy flies away, as it lands on the water, and while it floats upon the water until all the fuel is used from the fuel tank. The fuel can be changed to change the signature of the IR plume so that different ASM missiles can be drawn away from the ship.","Bredy discloses a four stroke combustion engine and method of operation of use and control. The engine includes a combustion chamber with an intake manifold coupled to the combustion chamber. A one-way valve is located within the intake manifold. The engine includes an intake valve for modulating the flow of a fuel-air mixture into and out of the combustion chamber. The engine preferably employs a fixed, late closing intake valve. A plenum chamber is located in the intake manifold. The plenum chamber is located downstream of the one-way valve and upstream of the intake valve. During the compression stroke of the engine, a pressurized charge of the fuel-air mixture is stored within the manifold and plenum. The amount of the fuel-air mixture stored within the plenum is controlled by adjusting the volume of the plenum, or, alternatively, a plenum valve is used to regulate the amount of fuel-air mixture entering\/exiting a fixed volume plenum.","It should be understood that the present invention would in fact enhance the functionality of the above patents by providing an adjustable volume plenum that reduces peak acceleration on the countermeasure device being launched from the launch tube assembly.","Therefore it is an object of this invention to provide a launch tube assembly having a controllable peak acceleration.","A still further object of the invention is to provide a launch tube assembly in which a forward launch tube portion is longitudinally adjustable relative to a sleeve member connected to the aft launch tube portion, by a threaded connection therebetween.","Yet another object of this invention is to provide a launch tube assembly which incorporates existing launch tube structure to adjust a plenum volume suitable for launching a countermeasure device at a predetermined acceleration.","In accordance with one aspect of this invention, there is provided a launch tube assembly including an aft launch tube portion, a forward launch tube portion, and a transfer sleeve having a first end fixed to and adjacent the forward end of said aft launch tube portion and a second end adjustably receiving the forward launch tube portion. A forward end of the aft launch tube portion faces a rearward end of the forward launch tube portion within the transfer sleeve. An adjustable plenum is present having a volume within the transfer sleeve defined by an adjusted distance between the facing ends of aft and forward launch tube portions. An end cap is pinned to a forward end of the forward launch tube portion, a gas generator housed in the aft launch tube portion, and a countermeasure device is housed in the forward launch tube portion. An adjustably selected volume of the plenum is such that a gas generated by the gas generator will enable propulsion of the countermeasure device at a predetermined acceleration from the forward launch tube portion.","In general, the present invention is directed to an adjustable launch tube assembly as generally shown at  in the FIG.","The defining structure of the adjustable launch tube  includes an aft launch tube portion , a forward launch tube portion , and a transfer sleeve .","The aft launch tube portion  is typically cylindrical in section, and has a closed end  and an open end . An interior  of the aft launch tube portion  houses a gas generator .","The forward launch tube  includes an open end  aligned with and facing the open end  of the aft launch tube portion  and a forward end  into which a muzzle cap  is secured by a plurality of shear pins . An outer surface  of the forward launch tube  includes recessed grooves  adjacent the open end  thereof and a threaded portion  intermediate the open  and forward  ends thereof. An interior  of the forward launch tube  houses a ram plate  and a countermeasure device , with the countermeasure device  abutting the muzzle cap .","The transfer sleeve  has an inner surface  corresponding in dimension to an outer surface  of the aft launch tube . As previously indicated, it is preferable that the aft launch tube portion , forward launch tube portion , and transfer sleeve  are circular in shape. The transfer sleeve  includes a first end  fixed to said aft launch tube  and a second end .","The first end  of the transfer sleeve  is fixed by welding or the like to the outer surface  of the aft launch tube portion . The second end  of the transfer sleeve  includes an outwardly radial flange  having plural spaced apertures  formed therein and therethrough.","A locking collar  includes a threaded inner annular surface  and an outwardly radial flange  with plural spaced apertures  formed therein. The inner surface  of the locking collar  is threadably engageable with the outer threaded surface  of the forward launch tube  and faces of the radial flanges  and  are aligned such that the respective plural apertures  and  thereof can be aligned. Plural bolts  inserted through corresponding ones of the plural aligned apertures  and  secure the locking collar  to the radial flange  and to the radial flange  of the transfer sleeve .","Sealing members , such as O-rings, are seated within the recessed grooves  on the outer surface  of the forward launch tube  in order to seal out any hydrostatic pressure between the forward launch tube  and the transfer sleeve .","As an alternative, it should be noted that the interior surface adjacent the first end  of the transfer sleeve  may be threaded, and the exterior surface at the forward end  of the aft launch tube portion  may be threaded as well. The current version is for ease of assembly, and therefore, may be varied.","A plenum  is defined in the interior of the transfer sleeve  in the location between the open end  of the aft launch tube portion  and the open end  of the forward launch tube portion . The plenum  volume is selectively adjusted according to the distance into the transfer sleeve  that the forward launch tube portion  is threaded. The position of the forward launch tube  provides a nearly maximum volume to the plenum . In other words, if the forward launch tube portion  is such that the locking collar  is at an inner most end of the threaded portion  thereon, then the plenum  is at a maximum volume. Likewise, positioning the forward launch tube portion  within the transfer sleeve  to the point where an outermost end of the threaded portion  thereof is engaged with the threaded surface  of the locking collar  will provide a minimum volume for the plenum .","In keeping with the structure described in connection with the FIG., the basic operation of a countermeasure launcher is that an electrical signal (not shown) is sent to the gas generator  located within the aft launch tube portion  for its activation. As gas is being generated, the volume between the gas generator  and the ram plate  becomes pressurized to a level where the compressive load being applied to the shear pins  which hold the muzzle cap  in place, shear, and allow movement of the countermeasure device . The continuation of gas generation assures that the pressure behind the ram plate  is sufficient to move the countermeasure  completely out of the forward launch tube portion .","The physical reason for the increased initial plenum volume resulting in lower peak accelerations on the countermeasure  can be explained by the following relationships: \n\n\n\n","The relationship shown in equation (4) is a key to the explanation. Since the mass flow rate (dm\/dt) entering the plenum at shear pin failure is only slightly lower for a larger initial plenum volume, V, dominates. Equation (4) shows that the pressurization rate (dP\/dt) of the plenum will be lower for a larger initial plenum volume. Equation (5) shows that the overshoot of the plenum pressure (beyond shear pressure) is proportional to the pressurization rate. Equations (1) and (2) link plenum pressure to countermeasure acceleration. In summary, the larger initial plenum volume reduces the initial pressurization rate, which reduces the plenum pressure overshoot (hence, reduces peak plenum pressure), which reduces peak countermeasure acceleration.","The launch tube  with the adjustable plenum  is assembled by first welding the aft launch tube portion  to the transfer sleeve . The forward launch tube portion  is then inserted into the transfer piece  to the desired length. O-rings  inserted in grooves  the forward launch tube portion  seal the launch tube against hydrostatic pressure. The locking collar  is then screwed along the forward launch tube portion  until it is both flush against the radial flange  at the end of the transfer sleeve  and the bolt holes ,  are aligned between the transfer sleeve  and the locking collar , respectively. Bolts  are then secured around the circumference of the mated radial flanges ,  to assure the entire assembly will withstand the loads during the launch event.","A mathematical model of a countermeasure launch is then exercised in order to determine the appropriate plenum volume necessary to achieve the desired peak acceleration on the countermeasure being launched. The volume is then converted into an overall launch tube length, and the forward launch tube portion  is moved in or out to achieve the desired length. Note that is was decided to control overall length thread by threading the forward launch tube portion  and the transfer sleeve  due to the greater linear dimension control. Also, the volume was made adjustable due to the uncertainties of the computer models.","It should also be understood that materials are chosen that can withstand the stresses from a launch impulse.","The present invention will allow current gas generators, that typically impart acceleration peaks on countermeasures of 90-g's to mimic future gas generators that are designed to impart peak accelerations of 50-g's on similar weighted devices.","In view of the above detailed description, it is anticipated that the invention herein will have far reaching applications other than those of a countermeasure launch tube.","This invention has been disclosed in terms of certain embodiments. It will be apparent that many modifications can be made to the disclosed apparatus without departing from the invention.
