title: Helicopter messenger cable illumination
abstract: An apparatus for illuminating the messenger cable of a helicopter includes a helicopter having a floor and including a RAST system; the RAST system comprising a messenger cable with a connector attached to one end for lowering to a landing deck of a ship, the RAST system further comprising a winch for raising and lowering the messenger cable, a housing attached to the floor of the helicopter through which the messenger cable is raised and lowered, a top of the housing including an opening through which the messenger cable passes, a sheave attached to the top of the housing and over which the messenger cable passes and a pulley attached to the housing and over which the messenger cable passes; a luminescent cover attached to a portion of the messenger cable adjacent the connector; a light mounted on the top of the housing for charging the luminescent cover; and a limit switch mounted on top of the housing for stopping upward motion of the messenger cable.

It provides the means to assist landing and securing an airborne helicopter to the flight deck of a seagoing ship. The RAST system has components on both the ship and the helicopter. The helicopter RAST system controls an electrically-operated actuator and hoist, which unlatches and extends the RAST main probe and lowers a messenger cable from the main probe to the ship's flight deck. On the flight deck of the ship, the messenger cable is secured to a hauldown cable. The messenger cable, with the hauldown cable attached, is retrieved and reeled into the helicopter through the main probe. When the end of the hauldown cable reaches the main probe, the hauldown cable is secured to the main probe. The shipboard RAST winch then hauls the helicopter down to the flight deck of the ship under the control of the shipboard landing officer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","14","16","15","16","18","18","14","18","16","16"]},"The present invention provides improved visibility to the messenger cable  and connector  to facilitate helicopter landing operations during times of low visibility.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["16","18","16","18","14","20","16","20","32","21"]},"A generally cylindrical housing  is attached to the floor  of the helicopter .
