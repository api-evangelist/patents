title: Enhanced search system and method based on entity ranking
abstract: Enhanced search system and method based on entity ranking that accepts votes for online and offline users and calculates rankings for user attributes that are used to provide highly valued search results. An input is received from a user indicating an opinion of another user or plurality of other users. In one embodiment, reputation scores are weighted by the reputation scores of voters. In another embodiment, weights are derived from voter reputation scores in the domain in which the voting took place. In another embodiment, reputation scores are adjusted according to a plurality of factors, including, but not limited to, user demographics or user behavior.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","One or more embodiments of the invention are related to the field of computer systems. More particularly, but not by way of limitation, embodiments of the invention enable an enhanced search system and method based on entity scoring and ranking configured to provide improved searches through calculation of scalar online and offline user rankings quantified by peer-to-peer voting that are extended through network analysis. In one or more embodiments of the invention, searches for people and information, for example, may employ and enhance offline or physical-world reputation-enabled entity scoring and rankings in online environments and vice versa, which is unknown in the art.","2. Description of the Related Art","Currently known search providers generally do not automatically take into account the preferences of an information searcher beyond that searcher's search request, or the reputation of the sources, which offer the information that is being searched. As a result, not only are searchers offered only limited means for leveraging personal preferences throughout the search process, but they are also unable to conduct searches based on the reputation of information sources or rank information sources based on reputation. A searcher may have some familiarity with certain sources and thus a subjective impression of the sources' reputations or their alignment with the searcher's preferences. However, search providers generally do not offer searchers any means for assessing a large variety of sources whose reputations are objectively quantified and standardized in a way that would enable searchers to compare and rank sources based on specific preferences beyond the search request and\/or based on source reputation. More specifically, common types of search providers such as certain Internet search engines sample online user behavior, for example, as represented by the number of searchers, recurring or non-recurring web site visits, page or advertising views, clicks, or \u201cclick-throughs\u201d. Other Internet search engines utilize evaluations of the types and degrees of connectedness among sites (e.g. as represented through inbound and outbound links) to establish source relevance and quality. Therefore, the operative variables employed by known search engines are ultimately based on the behavior of many online users that is aggregated, evaluated, sorted, ranked, and presented back to users as search-facilitating criteria. Here, source reputation is implicitly relegated to the notion that quantity (e.g. the number of page visits or inbound or outbound links) reasonably approximates source relevance and quality. Moreover, search results are often also manipulated by so-called \u201csearch engine optimization\u201d providers. Search engine optimization pursues strategic deployment of online information to improve search engine rankings for paying customers. Thus, inadequate information is commonly provided, thereby diminishing the usefulness of search results.","There are other search systems that establish some kind of source quality through various rating mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are limited in that they permit users to rate only instances of what other users say or do or look like or endorse or buy. The only online environments where users can currently acquire some sort of reputation are systems that track the volume of user activity (e.g. the quantity of information shared) across various social networking sites, or online marketplaces where users are rated primarily by strangers and only with respect to business trustworthiness, that is, the assessment of transaction fulfillment risk. In both settings reputation is confined to the very context in which it was acquired. There is no online place that mirrors the physical world in that people acquire a reputation first and foremost within their social circles and this reputation is then carried forward into the extended networks of their peers, driven by the impact of their peers' reputations. In other words, no online context exists that consistently enables a \u201creal\u201d reputation, or rather a perception of quality that attaches to a person's characteristics or abilities, and that transcends the division between physical and online world because it is tantamount to a personal brand.","As stated, known search systems take into account only narrowly defined types of reputation and largely ignore physical-world reputation. In the physical world, reputation can be defined as an entity's quality or characteristic or ability as perceived by another entity, whereas an entity can be defined as a person, or organization, or group, or object, or system, or concept affiliated or associated with a person, or organization, or groups, or systems, or conceptual representations thereof. Reputation is thus instrumental in shaping an entity's social and personal identity. It would therefore be desirable to provide a search system that defines reputation holistically, enabling the utilization of offline, or rather physical-world reputation in the online world, and providing ways to enhance physical-world reputation using online means. None of the many known Internet-enabled search systems achieve this objective because they employ a definition of reputation that is behavior-specific and tied to a certain context, rather than a definition of reputation that is entity-specific because it is tied to a certain entity's attributes or characteristics.","Collaborative filtering systems employ techniques that draw predictive conclusions based on behavioral patterns that are shared among users. For example, users may be presented with product suggestions that are informed by statistical algorithms extrapolating from past site-specific behavior by other, similar users. As such, search results generated from the perspective of collaborative filtering systems are associated with behavioral similarity among users who are otherwise unfamiliar with one another, and with respect to specific consumption contexts.","There are other online rating or review systems that also draw upon informational relevance of similarity in past or intended consumption behavior among users who are otherwise unfamiliar with one another. As such, reputation refers primarily to degrees of agreement among users with respect to certain qualities of usually unfamiliar third entities. Moreover, online ratings or reviews are frequently based on small samples of user votes because they tend to eschew user data aggregation beyond individual sites. In addition, people with extreme opinions are much more likely than average users to rate or review anything online and the underlying sample sizes are too small to overcome this inherent voting bias and the resulting statistical error, and generate a meaningful level of significance. These problems are exacerbated by anonymity, that is, users cannot easily determine the relevance of other users' ratings with regards to motivation or competence.","As mentioned, electronic marketplaces frequently implement systems that allow users to rate one another with respect to a preceding transaction. As such, search results are presented based on the interaction over time among many users who are otherwise unfamiliar with one another and across many transactions in one particular context.","Other, more sophisticated systems exist that are also predominantly focused on user behavior in electronic transactions. Some of these systems extend beyond a first and\/or unilateral layer of evaluation sources by enabling weighted and\/or reciprocal exchanges of user ratings. This means the impact of an entity's ratings is influenced by the entity's own rating. However, these systems are also site-specific and merely employ reputation as a transaction risk reduction tool that is based on the degree to which a multitude of users who are otherwise unfamiliar with one another agree on the ratings of other entities over time, and only with respect to certain electronic transactions such as the purchases of goods and services.","In other words, systems conceived to provide user value in electronic transactions or online marketplaces address only transactional fulfillment risk. As such, any related ranking of users would provide user value only for a narrow range of user interactions and for one particular place.","Social networking sites represent a departure from these anonymous single-purpose environments, as they cluster individuals connected through varying degrees of familiarity, often derived from or supplemented by interaction in the physical world. However, such sites entirely relegate the notion of reputation to the physical world, presumably because they assume that offline familiarity among users sufficiently establishes reputation. In addition, such sites also usually provide rudimentary mechanisms that allow users to vote on one another, that is, express agreement about one another's opinions or actions (e.g. through the use of \u201clike buttons\u201d) or social media influence, but not usually about user attributes. Also, these mechanisms do not generally allow anonymous voting or weighting and do not mandate reciprocity.","There also exist a multitude of social sites that connect individuals who do not usually know one another for the sole purpose of rating one another's phenotype.","As a result, currently known Internet-enabled systems do not offer holistic implementations of the features that make reputation valuable in the physical world:","Attribute specificity and diversity: addressing one or more specific qualities or characteristics or abilities.","Portability: applying across different environments and contexts (e.g. online and offline, as well as across different settings within each context) that are unified by the attributes under consideration.","Entity dependence: attaching to an entity's public or private persona or image or identity as supposed to an entity's actions in one context.","Weighting by source reputation: it matters whether an opinion about an entity is issued by a source with high or low reputation.","Reciprocity: entities evaluate one another along the same criteria.","Opinion heterogeneity: reputation formation derives from samples that are large enough and diverse enough to address possible statistical errors meaningfully.","For at least the limitations described above there is a need for an enhanced search system and method based on entity ranking.","One or more embodiments described in the specification are related to an enhanced search system and method based on entity ranking. Embodiments of the invention establish rankings of entities derived from opinions of entities about other offline and online entities to form reputations and offer results for a specific search based on the rankings for online or offline entities, comprising features that:","Establish rankings as relating to personal attributes, i.e. qualities or characteristics or abilities, along one or multiple domains, by way of entities voting for one another across these attributes to form domain-specific reputations for online and offline entities.","Utilize various voting methods including, but not limited to, range\/scale voting or Condorcet voting or modifications thereof and enable users to function simultaneously as voters and votees.","Calculate rankings recursively based on received votes using un-weighted scoring or weighted scoring associated with user or voter rankings or reputations.","Adjust reputation scores statistically using a multitude of methods including, but not limited to, probability analyses, inferential statistics, or test theory, and a multitude of variables including, but not limited to, demographics such as age or sex or experience, the number of votes placed or received, the frequency and\/or duration and\/or recentness of user activity, the veracity and\/or completeness and\/or amount of user information provided, degrees of similarity between voter and votee as determined by other variables and\/or the degree of familiarity between voter and votee, and\/or voting outcomes across the entire user base and\/or user feedback in response to search results.","Establish user reputation as portable between or within the physical world and the Internet to enhance the ability to search in both offline and online contexts.","Establish reputation dissociated from transactional context as a way to enable identity formation.","Enable the derivation of organizational reputation from the reputations of an organization's members.","Enable reputation in and across certain domains such as \u201ccomputer programming\u201d or \u201cproviding investment advice\u201d or \u201cfinding great restaurants\u201d based on certain attributes that may be as general as \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d or \u201ccompetence\u201d, or as specific as \u201cwriting ability\u201d or \u201captitude for . . . \u201d (e.g. aptitude for finding great restaurants).","Enable the definition of key attribute categories and reputation domains that are then presented to voters and enable users to suggest and vote on non-key attribute categories and reputation domains.","Enable \u201cagreement paths\u201d throughout the entire user base, derived from a definition of reputation as a measure for expressing co-orientation among users with regards to certain attribute-domain combinations and regardless of the distance among users along such paths.","Enable the clustering users into groups based on the degree of familiarity or agreement among them, or based on reputation domains or attributes.","Enable the generation of domain-specific reputation badges representing reputation rankings or scores, and enabling enhanced searches based on the reputation rankings or scores of users.","Enable the clustering of users into statistical distributions depending on variables such as familiarity among users, or reputation domains or attributes, or voting outcomes, or agreement among users, or user feedback to assess and enhance the validity and reliability of reputation scoring and ranking, or make inferences about certain voting outcomes, or adjust reputation scoring or ranking mechanisms ex post.","Enable a \u201ckudos\u201d feature, allowing users to boost their own reputations' impact on the reputations of others, and limiting use of that feature in time (e.g. once per year) and\/or in frequency (e.g. one kudos per user or one kudos per user per month).","Examples of possible voting mechanisms include range voting, i.e., assigning numbers from a quantifiable or numerical scale such as a Likert-type scale, or Condorcet voting by which a voter decides who, among a group of two or more candidates, beats out the others, a voting method frequently used on phenotype rating sites. For example, a Condorcet election that one or more embodiments of the invention may utilize could be the presentation to a voter of a question such as \u201cWhose product recommendations would you rather follow?\u201d, along with two photos or descriptions\/writings\/mentioning of two or more of the voter's contacts from his\/her social network. The voter may then vote by clicking on the candidate whose product recommendations she favors.","Embodiments of the invention may calculate votees' rankings via scores that are based on received votes and weight these scores by the reputation scores of the voters. The weights used may be voters' reputation scores for the same domain and attribute or for a more general yet relevant domain or attribute, or a global reputation score that aggregates reputation scores from multiple domains or attributes. Weighting may be simple, using the vote tallies of voters as weights, or weighted using the weighted scores of voters as weights. Scores or ranks may be statistically standardized or normalized, for example by using averages, or adjusted, or transformed, or smoothened in one or more embodiments. Online users may also vote on offline users, enabling offline users to be found via online or offline searches for example. An example of an offline search may be a Smartphone application that shows users, directly, or indirectly via search results that are based on said users' opinions, ranked with respect to a certain domain-attribute combination, and in a certain area without requiring an Internet connection at the time, or without requiring a typical Internet search.","Generally, every voter may also be a votee. As users are connected through a social network structure, whether offline in the physical world or online, they are familiar with the users who vote on them and the users they vote on. However, it may not usually be disclosed to votees who voted for them and how. Instead, only the aggregated results, e.g. votees' reputation scores for a specific attribute in a specific domain, or rankings, or distributions, or summary statistics thereof may be shown to users.","The weighted reputation scores may also be adjusted to address various statistical biases. Such adjustments may involve complex probability analyses including, but not limited to probability theory, test theory, or inferential statistics, utilizing variables including, but not limited to, user-specific data such as demographics, usage behavior (e.g. recentness or frequency of voting), voting outcomes anywhere in the user base, or user feedback in response to certain scoring or ranking outcomes that users learn about via search results that may be provided by third-parties. Voting may also use a time constraint, that is, voters are given only a predetermined amount of time such as three seconds to vote. This prevents rumination or rationalization, both of which distort how a person would likely judge in an everyday context.","Embodiments of the invention provide improved searching based on ranking of entities. Search providers, search engines, online commerce sites, social networking sites (e.g. online dating sites or job sites) that offer search services may utilize embodiments of the invention to incorporate the reputation of an entity into their algorithms, thereby making it much easier to find, for example, meaningful, relevant, or reliable information or content or people, or employees, or entities, or service providers. An entity may be an offline individual or online user such as a blogger, journalist, artist, job seeker, online dater, representative of an organization or corporation, etc., or an organization or service\/product provider, or members thereof who may be represented by the aggregate reputation of the individuals who make up that entity.","Embodiments of the invention enable improved search results for critiqued entities. For example, the Internet, and all media for that matter, is filled with rankings, rating, or comments. However, the reputation of the sources behind such opinions is either rarely known or tied to the respective publication platform (e.g. a journalist's reputation often hinges on that of a newspaper). The list of possible applications is long, ranging from consumer product\/service\/media reviews, over critics such as those for films, restaurants, theater, art, etc., to general advising activities such as those by people offering help to others, etc., and commenting activities. Possible applications exist throughout the offline world as well. For example, local services businesses such as barbershops or spas could market themselves using the reputation of their employees. Moreover, websites that provide rating\/reviewing\/commenting implementations may employ embodiments of the invention to improve the relevance of such implementations by taking into account the reputation scores or rankings of entities that rate\/review\/comment. For example, a consumer products company could weigh the aggregate review results for a product by the each reviewer's reputation for being a good product reviewer, or offer ratings that are tailored to the degree of co-orientation (with regards to consumption taste) among different users.","Embodiments of the invention may also be utilized for hiring employees by facilitating the typical matching process for both employees and employers. Every year, firms spend billions to find new employees through job ads, interviews, executive search firms, etc. Empirical evidence suggests that the results leave much to be desired, because despite employers' best efforts, much uncertainty about an individual's abilities remains throughout the hiring process. As a result, many hiring decisions end up being gut decisions and as such they are ultimately very bad at predicting future employee performance. Companies may, for example, utilize embodiments of the invention to search for employees based on the reputation scores of applicants for attributes and in domains that are most relevant to open positions. This makes it much easier to locate relevant candidate expertise that can also be quantified and benchmarked internally (i.e. compared with current employees) and externally (i.e. compared with other applicants) quickly and easily, while reducing the need for subjective and inefficient candidate evaluation processes such as resume scanning. In fact, companies may utilize embodiments of the invention to keep abreast of the career progress of potential employees who represent the right combination of expertise and fit, without the need for launching or funding an actual hiring campaign. Similarly, as the same occupation may provide very different experiences depending on the firm, job applicants may use embodiments of the invention to gauge vague and hard-to-communicate concepts such as company culture to get a sense of what it would really be like to work at a particular company. Companies on the other hand may utilize embodiments of the invention to determine their employees' collective reputation in relevant categories such as \u201cwork ethic\u201d or \u201ccollegiality\u201d and benchmark such categories against competitors. Of course, this same rationale can be applied to internal evaluation. For example, instead of hoping its mission statement holds, a company may determine what its culture really looks like behind the scenes, how it evolves, and which areas need improvement. Companies may also employ embodiments of the invention as performance evaluation tool to rank employees against one another and to identify strong performers or people who may be in the wrong position, team, etc. Again, this is particularly valuable because of the need for large, diverse, and independent opinion samples\u2014employees' performance assessments are no longer just based on the ratings of three or four immediate colleagues but based on true instances of reputation that are influenced by the perceptions of many more colleagues, even prior colleagues at other firms, or other individuals whose opinions are relevant to such an evaluation. Likewise, large sample sizes also enable much more holistic evaluations of job applicants, as hiring decisions need no longer be based solely on a combination of interview, resume, and references or recommendations. Put differently, an employee's or job applicant's reputation score or ranking for attributes such as \u201ccompetence\u201d would reflect that individual's competence throughout her entire career, thereby functioning like an objective letter of reference encompassing all of the applicant's past jobs or work related efforts. Naturally, this logic can be extended to academic selection or any other human capital assessment or selection process as well.","Embodiments of the invention may quantitatively and measurably connect and rank all users regardless of how far apart they are, thus representing a potential empowerment tool, a way to \u201cmeritocratize\u201d society using the power, reach and connectivity of the Internet. Embodiments may therefore give a voice to people whose voices have previously gone unheard, yet unjustifiably so, for example because they lack the credentials for a particular domain. For example, one might find out that an unknown blue-collar worker's restaurant recommendations are relevant to a wider audience than, for example, those of a famous food journalist. More specifically, embodiments of the invention enable users to compete against one another in particular domains, thereby offering them opportunities to make a living using verified and benchmarked expertise, even though their real-world credentials would have never suggested it or given them the chance to prove themselves.","For example, assume said blue-collar worker, named Bob, had a good friend, Mark, who knew that Bob's expertise in identifying hidden gem restaurants was second-to-none. Now, Mark may talk to other people and tell them about Bob or relay Bob's \u201cfoodie recommendations\u201d, but that may never benefit Bob. But if both used an embodiment of the invention, the story may unfold completely differently. Let's assume Bob may only know other blue-collar workers, but Mark has a more diverse social circle. Now, assume Mark rates Bob's foodie skills (Condorcet example: \u201cWhose restaurant recommendations would you rather follow?\u201d) superior to those of all the members in his social network. Among these people is one lady, Erica, a rather renowned foodie herself, who happens to be connected to Samantha, a well-known food journalist. By virtue of her profession and her social circle, Samantha fetches a very high foodie reputation score. However, Samantha also thinks very highly of Erica's foodie skills and actually rates her above some of her other high-powered food journalist friends. Thus, via weighting, Erica's reputation in the foodie domain will be infused with Samantha's foodie reputation. Now, as long as Mark receives at least one vote from Erica, his foodie reputation will benefit as well. But because Mark knows of Bob's outstanding talent, he will surely vote for Bob in that domain, maybe even rating Bob's foodie skills atop all of his personal contacts. That way, Bob will be able to benefit from the connection to Samantha via Erica and Mark, and be able to garner some of the reputation of Samantha, thereby \u201cclimbing the ladder\u201d and earning a higher reputation score without having to know Samantha personally or be connected to her social network. In fact, the more highly all her reputed food journalist-friends rate Samantha, the better Bob will do. Of course, his ascent is mitigated by the influence of Mark's and Erica's reputations as well. But the general logic holds\u2014embodiments of the invention connect people across multiple degrees of separation in a standardized and quantitative way, allowing them to \u201cbenchmark\u201d directly and indirectly against one another. Embodiments may also employ statistical analysis that may show that, across his own social network, Bob appears on top of more foodie recommender lists than his reputation suggests, thereby triggering an additional reputation bump in this domain. In addition, Mark may decide to bestow his only yearly \u201cKudos\u201d in the foodie onto Bob, thereby boosting the impact of his own reputation on Bob's reputation and further lifting Bob's score. As Bob's network grows he can continually improve his score and use his reputation to advertise, for example, on his own foodie blog, eventually becoming a part-time food journalist himself. In addition, Bob's recommendations may also show up as weights or multipliers with respect to Bob's restaurant reviews on third-party sites. For example, Bob may rate a certain restaurant as having five stars using a restaurant site that employs embodiments of the invention in its rating algorithm. This means that Bob's five-star rating may be weighted utilizing Bob's foodie score or ranking, thereby impacting the restaurant's overall rating more than the ratings of people with lower foodie reputation (but less than the people with higher foodie reputation). Now, as users actually frequent the restaurant, for example because of its ratings on said site or because it had shown up in a relevant search through a search provider employing embodiments of the invention in its rating algorithm, they may use embodiments of the invention to provide feedback about whether their pre-dining perception of the restaurant aligns with their actual eating experience. This feedback may then be used to further calibrate the rating and scoring methodology that embodiments use and enhance or confirm or mitigate Bob's rating influence and thus, his scores and ranking.","An enhanced search system and method based on entity ranking will now be described. In the following exemplary description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to an artisan of ordinary skill that the present invention may be practiced without incorporating all aspects of the specific details described herein. In other instances, specific features, quantities, or measurements well known to those of ordinary skill in the art have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention. Readers should note that although examples of the invention are set forth herein, the claims and the full scope of any equivalents are what define the metes and bounds of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","102","110","111","102","103","101","102","103","102","103","101","101","102","103","101","110","111","110","111","101","104","105","101","104","105","104","105","104","105","101","101","103","100","120","121","121","122","104","105","121","104","105","101","103","121","121"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","101","105"]},"Users are articulated within the system through unexpressed reputations, that is, attribute-domain combinations (e.g. competence in computer programming) that can be expressed through voting by other users. Reputation (rA) therefore represents an unexpressed attribute a (e.g. speed) for user A in a particular domain (e.g. typing). Now, users B and C choose a domain (e.g. computer programming) and vote on A's attribute a (e.g. competence) relative to this domain, thereby expressing A's reputation (rA) in said domain. This reputation is then weighted by the expressed reputations rB and rC belonging to voters B and C, respectively, and representing B's and C's reputations for attribute a in the same domain (i.e. B's and C's competence in computer programming). System S then calculates weighted scores and relative ranks associated with the reputations rA, rB and rC. In addition, an adjustment mechanism (ADJ) may adjust the weighted reputations rA, rB, and rC using statistical methods such as standardization, transformation, test theory, probability analysis, or inferential statistics, using user variables (VA, VB, VC) or expressed reputations (rA, rB, rC) or user distributions and ranks or ex-post user feedback. System S then returns the adjusted reputation scores or ranks as search results in response to a user's or electronic system's relevant search request. Moreover, embodiments may return results regardless of whether the involved users are online users or offline users, and results may differ based on the type of information sought. For example, if a person is the object of a search, as would be the case when searching for a competent computer programmer (in the user network), embodiments may return a relevant person's available scoring or ranking information. When searching for general data or information, for example with respect to assessing the quality of a place or service or product, embodiments may directly return results that are already informed by user scoring or ranking, without the need for displaying all the underlying user scores or ranks that generated the desired information. Additional feedback, for example on user A's computer programming skills may also be provided later, for example, by user A's manager who also uses the system and who may or may not have voted for A initially. This feedback may then be used to further adjust rA.","For example, if user  is performing a search for a restaurant in a given area on mobile computer , embodiments of the invention analyze all users who are scored with regards to their competence for recommending restaurants, then rank these users, and return the findings as search results. Results may comprise users ranked with regards to their competence for recommending restaurants, and\/or their degree of co-orientation with user , or restaurants with user reviews which already incorporate the impact of the reputations of the underlying reviewers via implementations of embodiments of the invention in the algorithms of the respective review platform, or users ranked with regards to their competence for recommending restaurants that fit the taste of user  as identified through \u201cagreement path\u201d, or rather, co-orientation analysis, that is, the analysis of the propagation of user ranks and reputations across social networks via shared network users (compare ), or restaurants with user reviews which already incorporate the impact of the reputations and agreement paths of the underlying reviewers via implementations of embodiments in the algorithms of the respective review platforms. Results may be presented to users in various output forms that may be directly provided by embodiments of the invention or by third-parties such as those operating restaurant review websites that utilize implementations of the invention. For example, user  may be identified by embodiments of the invention as the most competent restaurant recommender available and\/or the most competent restaurant recommender relative to the searcher's preferences.

As this already represents an improvement over the site's previous rating method it may enhance S's search.","However, from the perspective of embodiments of the invention, restaurant recommendations represent a domain-attribute combination that lends itself to agreement path analysis, as they represent a voting area relating to consumer preferences, or rather individual taste. This means that S has several options to assess the relevance of a restaurant recommendation.","Even if S remains anonymous vis-\u00e1-vis the restaurant recommendation site because she does not have an account there, she can still determine whether a recommendation is relevant to her (i.e. whether the recommendation\/rating or group of recommendations\/ratings belongs to an agreement path on which she resides) if the restaurant employs embodiments of the invention in a way that disaggregates ratings into different agreement paths and marks those paths, for example, visually. As explained above, agreement path analysis addresses statistical bias in ratings and thus, such disaggregation would still yield useful results. For example, assume a restaurant had a total of five star ratings: 2\u00d7 one star, 1\u00d7 two stars, 2\u00d7 five stars. If these ratings are not weighted, either because the site does not employ reviewer ratings combined with weighting or because ratings are placed by anonymous users such as S, the restaurant's mean rating would be 2.8 stars (2\u00d71 star+1\u00d72 stars+2\u00d75 stars=14, divided by 5 users). In other words, 2.8 stars is the rating based on which S would have to make a consumption decision about said restaurant without the involvement of embodiments of the invention. However, S may really belong to an outlier group such as the one that would like the restaurant very much and thus rate it five stars. If the site employed embodiments of the invention, agreement path analysis would enable S to identify to which group she belongs and thus greatly facilitate her decision. S may, for instance, know that she belongs to agreement path \u201c174\u201d (or \u201cblue\u201d or \u201cG\u201d) with regards to restaurant recommendations. By looking at the disaggregated ratings, she will learn that people on this agreement path actually recommend the restaurant very highly, thereby enabling her to make a consumption decision at a higher level of confidence than would be the case without employing embodiments of the invention.","Alternatively, S may have an account with the restaurant rating site, enabling the site to provide to S and every other user the most relevant rating directly, using agreement path analysis.","Another option for S would be to use embodiments of the invention directly and determine restaurant relevance by looking at the recommendations of her personal contacts and their recommendations, or by sorting her agreement paths for restaurant recommendations. Similarly, by using agreement path analysis S can gather the relevance to her of any recommendation by anyone on any site, regardless of whether the site is a dedicated rating site, as long as the respective recommenders\/raters use embodiments of the invention. For example, a blogger may recommend a certain product or service on a blog. As long as the blogger uses embodiments of the invention, visitors to his blog can determine their agreement path relationships with said blogger, for example, if the blogging platform employed embodiments of the invention, or if the blogger utilized on his blog a badge or any other means to publicize his reputations (i.e. his scoring and rankings information) as determined by embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"While the invention herein disclosed has been described by means of specific embodiments and applications thereof, numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art, without departing from the scope of the invention set forth in the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from the following more particular description thereof, presented in conjunction with the following drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
