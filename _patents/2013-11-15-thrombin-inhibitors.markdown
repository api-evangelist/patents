Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of Formula I can all independently of one another have (R) configuration or (S) configuration. When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the structural Formulas of the invention, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the Formula. Similarly, when a compound name is recited without a chiral designation for a chiral carbon, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence individual enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced by the name. The production of specific stereoisomers or mixtures thereof may be identified in the Examples where such stereoisomers or mixtures were obtained, but this in no way limits the inclusion of all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof from being within the scope of this invention.","The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for example mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, in all ratios. Thus, enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis\/trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture by customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of Formula I or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Where compounds of this invention are capable of tautomerization, all individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are included in the scope of this invention. The present invention includes all such isomers, as well as salts, solvates (including hydrates) and solvated salts of such racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers and tautomers and mixtures thereof.","Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may exist in amorphous form and\/or one or more crystalline forms, and as such all amorphous and crystalline forms and mixtures thereof of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water (i.e., a hydrate) or common organic solvents. Such solvates and hydrates, particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates, of the instant compounds are likewise encompassed within the scope of this invention, along with un-solvated and anhydrous forms.","Reference to the compounds of this invention as those of a specific formula or embodiment, e.g., Formula I or any other generic structural formula or specific compound described or claimed herein, is intended to encompass the specific compound or compounds falling within the scope of the formula or embodiment, including salts thereof, particularly pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates of such compounds and solvated salt forms thereof, where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.","In the compounds of Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (H) and deuterium (H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and\/or intermediates.","It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of structural Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and also salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as precursors to the free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in other synthetic manipulations.","The compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

Those experienced in this field are readily aware of the circumstances requiring anticoagulant therapy. The term \u201cpatient\u201d used herein is taken to mean mammals such as primates, including humans, sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, rats, and mice.","Thrombin inhibition is useful not only in the anticoagulant therapy of individuals having thrombotic conditions, but is useful whenever inhibition of blood coagulation is required such as to prevent coagulation of stored whole blood and to prevent coagulation in other biological samples for testing or storage. Thus, the thrombin inhibitors can be added to or contacted with any medium containing or suspected of containing thrombin and in which it is desired that blood coagulation be inhibited, e.g., when contacting the mammal's blood with material selected from the group consisting of vascular grafts, stents, orthopedic prosthesis, cardiac prosthesis, and extracorporeal circulation systems.","Compounds of the invention may be useful for treating or preventing venous thromboembolism (e.g., obstruction or occlusion of a vein by a detached thrombus; obstruction or occlusion of a lung artery by a detached thrombus), cardiogenic thromboembolism (e.g., obstruction or occlusion of the heart by a detached thrombus), arterial thrombosis (e.g., formation of a thrombus within an artery that may cause infarction of tissue supplied by the artery), atherosclerosis (e.g., arteriosclerosis characterized by irregularly distributed lipid deposits) in mammals, and for lowering the propensity of devices that come into contact with blood to clot blood.","Examples of venous thromboembolism which may be treated or prevented with compounds of the invention include obstruction of a vein, obstruction of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism), deep vein thrombosis, thrombosis associated with cancer and cancer chemotherapy, thrombosis inherited with thrombophilic diseases such as Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, and Factor V Leiden, and thrombosis resulting from acquired thrombophilic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (inflammatory connective tissue disease). Also with regard to venous thromboembolism, compounds of the invention may be useful for maintaining patency of indwelling catheters.","Examples of cardiogenic thromboembolism which may be treated or prevented with compounds of the invention include thromboembolic stroke (detached thrombus causing neurological affliction related to impaired cerebral blood supply), cardiogenic thromboembolism associated with atrial fibrillation (rapid, irregular twitching of upper heart chamber muscular fibrils), cardiogenic thromboembolism associated with prosthetic heart valves such as mechanical heart valves, and cardiogenic thromboembolism associated with heart disease.","Examples of arterial thrombosis include unstable angina (severe constrictive pain in chest of coronary origin), myocardial infarction (heart muscle cell death resulting from insufficient blood supply), ischemic heart disease (local anemia due to obstruction (such as by arterial narrowing) of blood supply), reocclusion during or after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, occlusion of coronary artery bypass grafts, and occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Also with regard to arterial thrombosis, compounds of the invention may be useful for maintaining patency in arteriovenous cannulas.","Examples of atherosclerosis include arteriosclerosis.","Examples of devices that come into contact with blood include vascular grafts, stents, orthopedic prosthesis, cardiac prosthesis, and extracorporeal circulation systems","The thrombin inhibitors of the invention can be administered in such oral forms as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. Likewise, they may be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. An effective but non-toxic amount of the compound desired may be employed as an anti-aggregation agent. For treating ocular build up of fibrin, the compounds may be administered intraocularly or topically as well as orally or parenterally.","The thrombin inhibitors can be administered in the form of a depot injection or implant preparation which may be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained release of the active ingredient. The active ingredient can be compressed into pellets or small cylinders and implanted subcutaneously or intramuscularly as depot injections or implants. Implants may employ inert materials such as biodegradable polymers or synthetic silicones, for example, Silastic, silicone rubber or other polymers manufactured by the Dow-Corning Corporation.","The thrombin inhibitors can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.","The thrombin inhibitors may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The thrombin inhibitors may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinlypyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxy-propyl-methacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethyl-aspartamide-phenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the thrombin inhibitors may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.","The dosage regimen utilizing the thrombin inhibitors is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound or salt thereof employed. An ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition.","Oral dosages of the thrombin inhibitors, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.01 mg per kg of body weight per day (mg\/kg\/day) to about 30 mg\/kg\/day, preferably 0.025-7.5 mg\/kg\/day, more preferably 0.1-2.5 mg\/kg\/day, and most preferably 0.1-0.5 mg\/kg\/day (unless specified otherwise, amounts of active ingredients are on free base basis). For example, an 80 kg patient would receive between about 0.8 mg\/day and 2.4 g\/day, preferably 2-600 mg\/day, more preferably 8-200 mg\/day, and most preferably 8-40 mg\/kg\/day. A suitably prepared medicament for once a day administration would thus contain between 0.8 mg and 2.4 g, preferably between 2 mg and 600 mg, more preferably between 8 mg and 200 mg, and most preferably 8 mg and 40 mg, e.g., 8 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg. Advantageously, the thrombin inhibitors may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. For administration twice a day, a suitably prepared medicament would contain between 0.4 mg and 4 g, preferably between 1 mg and 300 mg, more preferably between 4 mg and 100 mg, and most preferably 4 mg and 20 mg, e.g., 4 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg.","Intravenously, the patient would receive the active ingredient in quantities sufficient to deliver between 0.025-7.5 mg\/kg\/day, preferably 0.1-2.5 mg\/kg\/day, and more preferably 0.1-0.5 mg\/kg\/day. Such quantities may be administered in a number of suitable ways, e.g. large volumes of low concentrations of active ingredient during one extended period of time or several times a day, low volumes of high concentrations of active ingredient during a short period of time, e.g. once a day. Typically, a conventional intravenous formulation may be prepared which contains a concentration of active ingredient of between about 0.01-1.0 mg\/ml, e.g. 0.1 mg\/ml, 0.3 mg\/ml, and 0.6 mg\/ml, and administered in amounts per day of between 0.01 ml\/kg patient weight and 10.0 ml\/kg patient weight, e.g. 0.1 ml\/kg, 0.2 ml\/kg, 0.5 ml\/kg. In one example, an 80 kg patient, receiving 8 ml twice a day of an intravenous formulation having a concentration of active ingredient of 0.5 mg\/ml, receives 8 mg of active ingredient per day. Glucuronic acid, L-lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid or any pharmaceutically acceptable acid\/conjugate base with reasonable buffering capacity in the pH range acceptable for intravenous administration may be used as buffers. The choice of appropriate buffer and pH of a formulation, depending on solubility of the drug to be administered, is readily made by a person having ordinary skill in the art.","The compounds can also be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, or course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regime.","The thrombin inhibitors are typically administered as active ingredients in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients or carriers (collectively referred to herein as \u201ccarrier\u201d materials) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, that is, oral tablets, capsules, elixers, syrups and the like, and consistent with convention pharmaceutical practices.","For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like; for oral administration in liquid form, the oral drug components can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, distintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn-sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as , tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.","The thrombin inhibitors can also be co-administered with suitable anticoagulants, including, but not limited to, other thrombin inhibitors, thrombin receptor antagonists, factor VIIa inhibitors, factor IXa inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors, factor XIa inhibitors, adenosine diphosphate antiplatelet agents (e.g., P2Y12 antagonists), fibrinogen receptor antagonists (e.g. to treat or prevent unstable angina or to prevent reocclusion after angioplasty and restenosis), other anticoagulants such as aspirin, and thrombolytic agents such as plasminogen activators or streptokinase to achieve synergistic effects in the treatment of various vascular pathologies. Such anticoagulants include, for example, apixaban, dabigatran, cangrelor, ticagrelor, vorapaxar, clopidogrel, edoxaban, mipomersen, prasugrel, rivaroxaban, and semuloparin. For example, patients suffering from coronary artery disease, and patients subjected to angioplasty procedures, would benefit from coadministration of fibrinogen receptor antagonists and thrombin inhibitors. Also, thrombin inhibitors enhance the efficiency of tissue plasminogen activator-mediated thrombolytic reperfusion. Thrombin inhibitors may be administered first following thrombus formation, and tissue plasminogen activator or other plasminogen activator is administered thereafter.","Alternatively or additionally, one or more additional pharmacologically active agents may be administered in combination with a compound of the invention.

Haemostasis 1995, 74, 1107-1112. The assays were carried out at 25\u00b0 C. in 0.05 M TRIS buffer pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% PEG. Trypsin assays also contained 1 mM CaC12. In assays wherein rates of hydrolysis of a p-nitroanilide (pna) substrate were determined, a Thermomax 96-well plate reader was used was used to measure (at 405 nm) the time dependent appearance of p-nitroaniline. sar-PR-pna was used to assay human \u03b1-thrombin (K=125 \u03bcM) and bovine trypsin (K=125 \u03bcM). p-Nitroanilide substrate concentration was determined from measurements of absorbance at 342 nm using an extinction coefficient of 8270 cmM.","In certain studies with potent inhibitors (K<10 nM) where the degree of inhibition of thrombin was high, a more sensitive activity assay was employed. In this assay the rate of thrombin catalyzed hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Z-GPR-afc, Lewis S. D. et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, pp. 4843-4854) (K=27 \u03bcM) was determined from the increase in fluorescence at 500 nm (excitation at 400 nm) associated with production of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin. Concentrations of stock solutions of Z-GPR-afc were determined from measurements of absorbance at 380 nm of the 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin produced upon complete hydrolysis of an aliquot of the stock solution by thrombin.","Activity assays were performed by diluting a stock solution of substrate at least tenfold to a final concentration \u22660.1 Kinto a solution containing enzyme or enzyme equilibrated with inhibitor. Times required to achieve equilibration between enzyme and inhibitor were determined in control experiments. Initial velocities of product formation in the absence (V) or presence of inhibitor (V) were measured.
