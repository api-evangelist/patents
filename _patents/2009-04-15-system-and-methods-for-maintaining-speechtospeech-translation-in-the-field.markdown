Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed generally to speech-to-speech translation systems for cross-lingual communication, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for field maintenance that enables users to add new vocabulary items and to improve and modify the content and usage of their system in the field, without requiring linguistic or technical knowledge or expertise.","2. Description of the Invention Background","Automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) technologies have matured to the point where it has become feasible to develop practical speech translation systems on laptops or mobile devices for limited and unlimited domains. Domain limited speech-to-speech systems, in particular, have been developed in the research field and in research laboratories for a variety of application domains, including tourism, medical deployment and for military applications. Such systems have been seen before in the works of A. Waibel, C. Fugen, \u201cSpoken language translation\u201d in Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE May 2008; 25(3):70-79, In Proc. HLT, 2003; and Nguyen Bach, Matthias Eck, Paisarn Charoenpornsawat, Thilo K\u00f6hler, Sebastian St\u00fcker, ThuyLinh Nguyen, Roger Hsiao, Alex Waibel, Stephan Vogel, Tanja Schultz and Alan W. Black, for examples. \u201cThe CMU TransTac 2007 eyes-free and hands-free two-way speech-to-speech translation system,\u201d In Proc. of the IWSLT, Trento, Italy, October 2007. They are limited, however, in that they operate with a limited vocabulary which is defined by the developers of the system in advance, and is determined by the application domain, and the location where it is envisioned the system will be used. Thus vocabularies and language usage are determined largely based on example scenarios and by data that is collected or presumed in such scenarios.","In field situations, however, actual words and language usage deviate from the anticipated scenario of the laboratory. Even in simple domains such as tourism language usage will vary dramatically in the field as a user travels to different locations, interacts with different people and pursues different goals and needs. Thus, new words and new expressions will always arise. Such new words\u2014in speech recognition parlance \u201cout-of-vocabulary\u201d (OOV) words will be misrecognized as an in-vocabulary word and then translated incorrectly. The user may attempt a paraphrase, but if a critical word or concept (such as a person or a city name) cannot be entered or communicated, the absence of the word or expression may lead to communication break-down.","Despite the need for user modifiable speech-to-speech translation systems, an actual solution has so far not been proposed. While adding a word to the system may seem to be easy, making such modifications proves to be extraordinarily difficult. Appropriate modifications must be made to many component modules throughout the entire system, and most modules would have to be retrained to restore the balance and integrated functioning of the components. Indeed, about 20 different modules would have to be modified or re-optimized to learn a new word. Such modifications require expertise and experience with the components of a speech translation system, and as a result, to the inventor's understanding, such modifications have so far been done only in the laboratory by experts, requiring human expertise, time and cost.","For example, if a system designed for users in Europe does not contain the name \u201cHong Kong\u201d in the vocabulary. Once a speaker speaks the sentence \u201cLet's go to Hong Kong\u201d, the system will recognize the closest sounding similar word in the dictionary and produce: \u201cLet's go to home call\u201d. At this point it is not obvious if the error was the result of a recognition error or result of the absence of this word in the entire speech-to-speech translation system. The user therefore proceeds to correct the system. This can be done by one of several correction techniques. The simplest might be re-spealcing or typing, but it can alternatively be done more effectively by cross-modal error correction techniques as described by other disclosures and prior art (Waibel, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,855,000). Once the correct spelling of the desired word sequence has been established (\u201cLet's go to Hong Kong\u201d), the system performs a translation. If \u201cHong Kong\u201d is in the dictionary, the system would proceed from there normally, performing translation and synthesis. If, however, it is absent from the recognition and translation dictionary, the system would need to establish if this word is a named entity or not. Finally, and most importantly, even if a name or word can be translated properly to the output languages by user intervention, without learning it, the system would fail again when the user speaks the same word the next time around.","Unfortunately, learning a new word cannot be addressed just by simply typing in a new word in a word list, but it requires changes at about 20 different points and at all levels of a speech translation system. Presently it also involves manual tagging and editing of entries, collection of extensive databases involving the required word, retraining of language model and translation model probabilities and re-optimization of the entire system, so as to re-establish the consistency between all the components and components' dictionaries and to restore the statistical balance between the words, phrases and concepts in the system (probabilities have to add up to 1, and thus all words would be affected by a single word addition).","As a result, even small modifications of existing speech translation systems have generally required use of advanced computing tools and linguistic resources found in research labs. For actual field use, however, it is unacceptable to require every modification to be done at the lab, since it takes too much time, effort and cost. Instead, a learning and customization module is needed that hides all the complexity from the user, and performs all the critical operations and language processing steps semi-autonomously or autonomously behind the scenes, and interacts with the human user in the least disruptive manner possible by way of a simple intuitive interface, thereby eliminating the need for linguistic or technical expertise in the field altogether. In the present invention, we provide a detailed description for a learning and customization module that satisfies these needs.","Unfortunately, translation systems are often prohibitively complex such that access for users is not practicable or used. Thus, there is a need for systems and methods that use machine translation techniques and enable user modification capabilities to provide cross-lingual communication without requiring linguistic or technical knowledge or expertise, making it possible to overcome language barriers and bring people closer together.","In various embodiments, the present invention solves the foregoing problems by providing a method and apparatus for updating the vocabulary of a speech translation system. In various embodiments a method is provided for updating the vocabulary of a speech translation system for translating a first language into a second language including written and spoken words. The method includes adding a new word in the first language to a first recognition lexicon of the first language and associating a description with the new word, wherein the description contains pronunciation and word class information. The new word and description are then updated in a first machine translation module associated with the first language. The first machine translation module contains a first tagging module, a first translation model and a first language module, and is configured to translate the new word to a corresponding translated word in the second language.","Optionally, for bidirectional translation, the method additionally includes the steps of translating the translated word from the second language back into the new word of the first language, correlating the new word with a corresponding translated word of the second language and adding the translated word and its description to a second recognition lexicon of the second language. A second machine translation module associated with the second language is then updated with the translated word and the description. The second machine translation module contains a second tagging module, a second translation model and a second language module","In embodiments the method further comprises the further step of inputting the first word into a text-to-speech pronunciation lexicon associated with the first language, and inputting the second word into a text-to-speech pronunciation lexicon associated with the second language. The input signals may be of different modalities (e.g. speech and nonverbal spelling, speech and verbal spelling, writing and speech, etc.) (referred to herein as \u201ccross-modal\u201d) or may be of the same modality (speech and respeaking, writing and rewriting, etc.).","An embodiment of the invention is directed to a field maintainable class-based speech-to-speech translation system for communicating between a first language and a second language. The system includes two speech recognition units, each configured for accepting sound comprising the spoken word of the first or second language and for producing text that corresponds to the spoken language, and two corresponding machine translation units, each configured to receive text from one of the speech recognition units and output a translation of the text into text of the other language. It also includes a user field customization module that enables the system to learn new words in cooperation with the user. The user field customization module is configured for accepting user selected input that comprises sounds or text corresponding to one or both of the languages and updates the machine translation units appropriately with the user selected input.","In an embodiment, four primary features equip the system to provide a field maintainable class-based speech-to-speech translation system. The first includes a speech translation framework that enables the addition of new words to the active system vocabulary, or the switching between location or task specific vocabularies. This provides for dynamic addition of words to a speech recognition module without requiring the module to be re-started. The system uses multilingual system-dictionary and language independent word-classes across all system components in the speech-to-speech translation device, class-based machine-translation (phrase-based statistical MT, syntactic, example-based, etc), multilingual word-class tagging during model training, based on combination of monolingual taggers, and word-class tagging in new language by way of alignment via parallel corpus from known tagged language. Second, a multimodal interactive interface enables non-experts to add new words to the system. Third, the system is designed to accommodate ASR and SMT model adaptation using multimodal feedback provided by the user. And fourth, the system has networking capability to enable sharing of corrections or words.","In another embodiment, a multimodal interactive interface enabling a user to add new words to a speech-to-speech translation device in the field and without technical expertise is disclosed. Examples include: (1) Methods to automatically classify class of word or word-phrase to be added to the system, and automatically generate of pronunciations, and translation of the word; (2) Method for entering new words cross-modally by one or more of speaking, typing, spelling, handwriting, browsing, paraphrasing; (3) Multimodal feedback to help a linguistically untrained user determine if phonetic transliteration and translation is adequate: multiple textual forms (i.e. Romanized form as well as written form in other language's script) and acoustic form via text-to-speech (TTS; i.e. does it sound right); (4) Method for setting language model and translation probabilities for new word; and (5) Boosting or discounting language model and translation probabilities for new learned word based on relevance to user activities, interests and history of use.","In another embodiment, an online system that corrects via multimodal user feedback in the field is disclosed. Examples include: (1) Interface and methods to enable users to correct automatic speech recognition results, and use of this feedback information to adapt speech recognition components; (2) Interface and methods to enable users to correct machine translation hypotheses, and use of this feedback information to improve machine translation components; and (3) Method for automatically adjusting (enhancing or decreasing) language model, dictionary and translation model probability for correct or corrected word based on user correction.","In another embodiment, an internet application that allows users to share corrections or new word additions done in the field across devices is disclosed. Examples include: (1) Methods to upload, download and edit models for use in speech-to-speech translation devices via the world-wide-web; (2) Methods to collate in-the-field new words additions and corrections across the entire community of users; and (3) Methods to upload, download and edit, location or task specific vocabularies for use in speech-to-speech translation devices.","Various embodiments of the present invention describe methods and systems for speech-to-speech translation. Embodiments may be used to adapt to the user's voice and speaking style via model adaptation. In further embodiments, the user can correct recognition errors and the system can explicitly learn from errors that the user corrected, thereby making it less likely that these errors occur again in the future. The present invention enables the user to customize the vocabulary to his or her individual needs and environment by either adding new words to the system, or selecting predefined dictionaries that are optimized for a specific location or task. When adding new words a multimodal interface allows the user to correct and verify automatically generated translations and pronunciations. This allows the user to add new words to the system when the user has no knowledge of the other language. In an embodiment, the system is further configured to transmit any new vocabulary inputted by a user to a community of users. This data is collated and dictionaries are automatically generated which can then be downloaded by any user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"sub":["a ","b","a ","b ","b ","a","a ","b","1 ","n ","a ","b","a ","b"],"b":["2","9","18","19","20"]},"The system also includes two machine translation modules  and , which translate text from Lto Land from Lto L, respectively (module ). The MT module used in this example was the \u201cPanDoRA\u201d system developed at Mobile Technologies, LLC. Other MT modules could be used such as those developed by IBM Corporation, SRI, BBN or at Aachen university.","Two text-to-speech engines,  and  each corresponding to one of the machine translation modules  and , are configured to receive text produced from a corresponding ASR unit. The output text is transferred to the respective MT module,  or , that translate text from Lto Land from Lto L, respectively. The TTS module generates audio output to convert at least one text word in Lto speech via an output device , such as a loud speaker, and at least one text word in Lto speech via device  or another output device, such as a loud speaker , respectively. For this example a Cepstral TTS module was used. Any TTS modules which support Windows SAPI (speech application programming interface) conventions could also be employed.","A correction and repair module  allows the user to correct the system output via multiple modalities; including speech, gesture, writing, tactile, touch-sensitive and keyboard interfaces, and enables the system to learn from the user's corrections. The correction and repair module may be of the type such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,855,000. A user field customization module , provides an interface for users to add new vocabulary to the system, and can also select an appropriate system vocabulary for their current situation. For example, triggered by a change in location, as determined by the GPS coordinates indicating the current location of the device, or an explicit selection of task or location by the user.","The user can access the user field customization module  and interact with the system via a graphical user interface displayed on the screen (or active touch screen) of the device , and a pointing device , including a mouse or pen. An example of a graphical user interface is shown in . In this example, the device  displays the text of audio input of a Land corresponding text in window . Machine translation of text Lin the second language Lis displayed in window .","In an embodiment, the same microphone and loud-speaker can be used for both languages. Thus, microphones  and  can be a single physical device, and speakers  and  can be a single physical device.","A flow chart illustrating the operation of an example of the method of the present invention is shown in . First, the speech recognition system is activated by the user at step . For instance, a button can be selected on the graphical user interface (, item ) or on an external physical button (not shown). The user's speech (item ) is then recognized by one of the ASR modules in step ; module , if the user is speaking L, and module  if the user is speaking L. The ASR modules  and  apply three models: acoustic model , ASR class-based language model  and a recognition lexicon model . These models are language specific and each ASR module contains its own set of models. The resulting text of the user's speech is displayed via the GUI on the device screen  at step .","Translation is then applied via MT module  or  based on the input language (step ). MT modules  and , apply three main models: a tagging or parsing [Collins02] model to identify word classes (model ), a class-based translation model (model ), and a class-based language model (model ). The tagging model  may be any suitable type of tagging or parsing model such as the types described in J. Lafferty, A. McCallum, and F. Pereira, \u201cConditional random fields: Probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data,\u201d In Proceedings of 18th International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 282-289, 2001 (\u201cLafferty01\u201d) or Michael Collins, \u201cParameter estimation for statistical parsing models: Theory and practice of distribution-free methods\u201d (2004) In Harry Bunt, John Carroll, and Giorgio Satta, editors, New Developments in Parsing Technology, Kluwer. Other models that are applied during the machine translation include distortion models, which constrain how words are re-ordered during translation, and sentence length models. A detailed description of class-based machine translation is given below. The resulting translation is displayed via the GUI on device  as shown in step .","To help the user determine if the translation output is adequate, the automatically generated translation (, item ) is translated back into the input language via MT module  or  and displayed with parentheses under the original input as illustrated for example in , item . If the confidence of both speech recognition and translation are high (step ) as determined by the ASR model,  or , and the MT module,  or , spoken output (item ) is generated via loud speakers  or , via TTS modules  or  (step ). Otherwise, the system indicates that the translation may be wrong via the GUI, audio and\/or tactical feedback. The specific TTS module used in step  is selected based on the output language.","Thereafter, if the user is dissatisfied with the generated translation, the user may intervene during the speech-to-speech translation process in any of steps from 27 to 33 or after process has completed. This invokes the Correction and Repair Module module  at (step ). The correction and repair module  records and logs any corrections the user may make, which can be later used to update ASR modules  and  and MT modules  and  as described in detail further below in this document. If the correction contains a new vocabulary item (step ), or if the user enters the field customization mode to explicitly add a new word to the system in step , or if a new word is automatically detected in the input audio using confidence measures or new word models, such as the method described in Thomas Schaaf, \u201cDetection of OOV words using generalized word models and a semantic class language model,\u201d in Proc. of Eurospeech, 2001 in step ; the User Field Customization Module  is invoked. This module  provides a multimodal interface to enable users to add new words to the active system vocabulary. When a new word or phrase is added by a user the ASR, MT and TTS models (items ,  and ) are updated as required. The functioning of this module is described further below for both languages.","A common set of classes (for example person names, place names, and organization names) is used in both ASR and MT for both languages. This provides a system-wide set of semantic slots that allows new words to be added to the system. The names, special terms and expressions that occur within these classes are the words that are most variable depending on different users' deployments, locations, cultures, customs and tasks, and thus they are in greatest need of user-customization.","In a preferred example, the specific classes used are dependent on the application domain of the system. The classes may include semantic classes for named-entities; person, place and organization names; or task-specific noun phrases; for example: names of foods, illnesses or medicines; and another open class for words or phrases that don't fit into any of the predefined classes. Syntactic classes or word equivalence classes such as synonyms could also be used. Examples of application domains include, but are not limited to, tourist, medical, peace keeping, and the like. In an example, classes required in the tourist application domain include names of persons, cities, foods and the like. In another example, for a medical professional application classes required include names of diseases, medications, anatomical names, and the like. In another example, classes required for a peace-keeping application include names of weapons, vehicles, and the like. To enable field customizable speech translation, the system permits error correction and later learning from these errors through the operation of the correction and repair module  in combination with a user field customization module .","Correction and Repair Module","Correction and repair module  enables a user to intervene in the speech-to-speech translation process at any time. The user may either identify and log an error, or, if he\/she wishes, correct an error in the speech recognition or translation output. Such user intervention is of considerable value, as it provides immediate correction in the human-human communication process, and opportunities for the system to adjust to user needs and interests and to learn from mistakes. A flow diagram illustrating this error feedback functionality is shown in . If the user is dissatisfied with a translation of an utterance (i.e. an error occurs) the user can log the current input (step ). The system will save audio of the current utterance as well as other information to a log file. This can be accessed and corrected by the user at a later time, or can be uploaded to a community database to allow expert users to identify and correct errors.","The user can also correct the speech recognition or machine translation output via a number of modalities. The user can correct the entire utterance, by re-speaking it or entering the sentence via a keyboard or handwriting interface. Alternatively a user can highlight an erroneous segment in the output hypothesis via the touch-screen, mouse or cursor keys and correct only that phrase or word, using the keyboard, handwriting, speech, or explicitly spelling out the word letter-for-letter. The user can also select an erroneous segment in the output hypothesis via the touch screen and correct it by selecting a competing hypothesis in an automatically generated drop-down list, or by reentering it by speech, or by any other complementary modality (e.g., handwriting, spelling, paraphrasing, etc.). These methods and how to suitably combine complementary repair actions build on methods proposed by Waibel, et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,855,000 for multimodal speech recognition correction and repair. Here they are applied to the speech recognition and translation modules of interactive speech translation systems.","If the user corrects the speech recognition output (step ) the system first determines if the correction contains a new word (step ). This determination is made by checking for the word in the recognition lexicon model  associated with each language, Land L. If the word is not found the system prompts the user to add the new word to the active system vocabulary if desired (, step ). Otherwise, the probabilities in the ASR models (, item ) are updated to reduce the likelihood of the same error occurring again. This can be performed in a discriminative manner where probabilities of the corrected word sequence are increased, and those of close-competing hypotheses are reduced.","A user can also correct the machine translation output if they have sufficient language expertise. The same modalities as used in the ASR case can be used. If the machine translation output is corrected by the user (step ) and the correction contains a new word, then the user is prompted with a dialog enabling them to add the new word to the active system vocabulary (, step ). If the correction only contains words which are already in the active system vocabulary, then the machine translation models (, item ) are updated. Specifically, an implementation can be used, where phrases are extracted from the corrected sentence pair and these are folded into translation models. The target language model used can be updated in a similar way to the ASR case.","User Field Customization Module","User field customization module  enables the system to learn new words in cooperation with the user. Prior systems do not allow users to modify vocabularies in speech-to-speech translation systems. Unlike prior systems, user field customization model  enables the user to make incremental modifications in a running system that are relatively easy to perform for a non-expert, with minimal or no knowledge of computer speech and language processing technology or of linguistics. Model 12 offers such field customization by providing and accepting certain easy-to-understand feedback from the user, and based on this feedback deriving all the necessary parameters and system configurations autonomously. Field customization module  accomplishes this through: 1) an intuitive interface for user-customization, and 2) internal tools that automatically estimate all the internal parameters and settings needed for user customization, thereby relieving the user from this burden.","For unidirectional translation, the system processes a minimum of four pieces of information about the word or phrase to add a new word or phrase to the active system vocabulary. These include:\n\n","A flow chart illustrating the steps of operation of the user field customization model  is shown, for example, in . When a new word is encountered by the system, based on a corrective intervention via the correction and repair model  in the previous section, it will prompt the user (, step ) to determine if this word should be \u201clearned\u201d, i.e., added to the active system vocabulary. If so, a word learning mode is activated and the field customization module  begins to act. Note that field customization or new-word learning need not only result from error correction dialogs. The user may also specifically choose to enter a word learning mode from a pull-down menu, to add a new word or a list of new words a priori. New word learning, could also be triggered by external events that cause a sudden need for different words, such as specialty terms, names, locations, etc. In all such instances, however, the system must collect the above information.","After the user indicates that he\/she wishes to add a new word to the system vocabulary (step ), the system first looks up a large external dictionary, which is either contained locally on the device, or is a dictionary service that can be accessed via the Internet, or is a combination of both. The external dictionary consists of entries of word translation pairs. Each entry contains pronunciation and word-class information which enables the new word to be easily added to the active system vocabulary. Each entry also contains a description of each word-pair in both languages. This will allow the user to select the appropriate translation of the word, even if they have no knowledge of the target language. If the new word is contained within the external dictionary (step ), the system displays a list of alternative translations of the word with a description of each (step ). If the user selects one of the predefined translations from the dictionary (step ), then user can verify the pronunciation and other information provided by the dictionary (step ), and the edit it if necessary. The new word is then added to the active system vocabulary.","To add a new word to the active system vocabulary, three steps are required (steps , , ). First the word and its translation are added to the ASR recognition lexicons of modules  and  (step ). The word is added to this recognition lexicon  along with the pronunciation(s) given by the dictionary. As the user has just entered this word its probability of occurrence is set to be greater than competing members of the same class within the ASR class-based language model . This is to make words that were specifically added by the user more likely. Next, the word and its translation are added to the MT models (, item ), enabling the system to translate the new-word in both translation directions. Finally, the word is registered with the TTS pronunciation model (, model ), which enables the system to pronounce the word correctly in both languages.","When the new word entered by the user is not found in the external dictionary, the system will automatically generate the information required to register the word into the active system vocabulary, and will verify this information with the user. First, the class of the new word is estimated via a tagging model (, model ) using the surrounding word context if it is available (step ). Next, the pronunciation and translation of the new word are automatically generated via either rule-based or statistical models (step ). The resulting information is then shown to the user via a multimodal interface (step ). The system prompts the user to verify (step ) or correct (step ) the automatically generated translation or pronunciation. Finally, after the user has verified this information, the new word is added to the active system vocabulary (steps , , ). To dynamically add a new word (specifically, \u201cword+pronunciation+word class\u201d) to the ASR vocabularies (), the recognition lexicon  (which is typically stored as a tree-structure, within ASR Modules  or ) is searched and then updated to include the new word. This enables the new word to be added to the recognition vocabulary dynamically, and it can thus be recognized, immediately, if spoken in the following utterance. The ASR system does not need to be re-initialized or re-started as in prior systems.","Similarly, a new word (specifically, \u201cword+translation+word class\u201d) can be appended to the MT translation model (), the translation model  (which is can be stored as a hash-map within MT modules  and\/or ) is searched and an new translation-pair containing the new word its translation, and word class is appended. This enables the new word to be added to the MT modules  and\/or , dynamically, and the new word will be translated correctly in proceeding utterances. The MT systems do not need to be re-initialized or re-started as in prior works.","Estimating all this information automatically is essential, so that a non-expert user in the field can perform the task of customization. In the following, we describe in detail, how this critical information about a word is estimated automatically, and then, how it can be obtained or verified intuitively from the user.","Generation of Pronunciations and Translations of New Words","As users of speech-to-speech translation systems usually have limited or no knowledge of phonetics, linguistics, language technology, and often even have no knowledge of the word and its use in the other language, they cannot be expected to provide a translation and all the pertinent information (pronunciation, orthography, word use, etc.) of each new-word they wish to add to the system. Thus, when the user enters a new-word, the system estimates the word-class and generates the translation and pronunciation information of the word in both languages, automatically.","To register a new word into the active system vocabulary, the translation of the word and pronunciations for both the word and its translation are required. Generating this information can be implemented as a three-step process as shown, for example, in . First, the pronunciation of the word is generated (step ). Based on the character sequence of the word and its pronunciation, a translation is generated (step ). Next, the pronunciation of the new word in the target language is generated (step ) using information generated in previous steps. Two examples for generating this information using different techniques within a Japanese-English Field Maintainable S2S Translation System are shown on the left hand side of . To add a new English word \u201cWheeling\u201d (item ) to the system, first the English pronunciation is generated via machine learning (step ). Machine learning may be conducted by any suitable technique such as those described by Damper, R. I. (Ed.), Data-Driven Techniques in Speech Synthesis. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers (2001). Next, the transliteration of this word in Japanese is automatically generated via statistical machine transliteration (step ), and the Japanese pronunciation is then generated via manually defined rules (step ). Transliteration may be accomplished by using any suitable statistical machine transliteration engine. Examples include those discussed by K. Knight and J. Graehl, Machine transliteration. Computational Linguistics 24 4 (1998), pp. 599-612; and Bing Zhao, Nguyen Bach, Ian Lane, and Stephan Vogel, \u201cA Log-linear Block Transliteration Model based on Bi-Stream HMMs\u201d, to appear in HLT\/NAACL-2007. The resulting information (item ) is then verified by the user by way of acoustic playback and by the phonetic string, before registering the word into the active system vocabulary.","Similarly, to add a new Japanese word \u201cWakayama\u201d (item ) to the system, first the Japanese pronunciation is generated via manually defined rules (step ). Next, the transliteration of this word in Japanese is automatically generated via rule-based transliteration (step ), the English pronunciation is then generated via manually defined rules (step ). The rule based transliteration may be performed using methods of Mansur Arbabi, Scott M. Fischthal, Vincent C.

The resulting information (item ) is then verified by the user before registering the word into the active system vocabulary.","The user can verify the generated translation and pronunciation via audible output. Alternatively written form may be used if considered more suitable for the user, given their native language (i.e. in \u201cHanyu Pinyin\u201d for Chinese, or \u201cRomaji\u201d for Japanese if the user is an English speaker). The user may edit the translation and\/or pronunciation if required. Once approved by the user, the word and word characteristics are added to the multilingual system dictionary.","The system also eliminates the need for a translation of each new word that is added to the dictionary by automatically generating the required information with the assistance of interactive user input. An example of a user interface is shown in .","Interactive User Interface","Thereafter, the system consults the user to confirm and verify the estimated linguistic information. This is done in an intuitive manner, so as not to presume any special linguistic or technical knowledge. Thus, a suitable interface is used. In the following we describe the user interaction during new word learning.","In the interface, the user may select a \u201cnew-word\u201d mode from the menu, or the new word learning mode could be invoked after a user correction has yielded a new\/unknown word. In the window pane that appears he\/she can now type the desired new word, name, special term, concept, expression. Based on the orthographic input in the user's language (this can be character sets different from English, e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Russian, etc.). The system then generates a transliteration in Roman alphabet and the words predicted pronunciation. This is done by conversion rules that are either hand written or extracted from preexisting phonetic dictionaries or learned from transliterated speech data. The user then views the automatic conversion and can play the sound of the generated pronunciation via TTS. The user may iterate and modify either of these representations (script, Romanized transliteration, phonetic transcription, and its sound in either language) and the other corresponding entries will be regenerated similarly (thus a modified transcription in one language may modify the transcription in the other).","The system further automatically selects the most likely word class that the new word belongs to based on co-occurrence statistics of other words (with known class) in similar sentence contexts. The new word window pane also allows for a manual selection (and\/or correction) of this class identity, however, so that the user can override any such estimated class assessment.","In summary, given a new word\/phrase from user, the system will\n\n","If the user enters a word that does not match any of the pre-defined classes within the system, the user can assign it to the \u2018unknown\u2019 class. For ASR, the \u2018unknown\u2019 class is defined by words that occurred in the training data but not in the recognition lexicon. For SMT bilingual entries that do not occur in the translation lexicon are set to the unknown tag in the target language model.","Intra-Class Probability and Relevance Boosting","Neither of these input methods requires linguistic training and provides an intuitive way for the user to judge if a new word was suitably represented. The user may then accept this new word entry by adding the word to a \u201cmultilingual system-dictionary\u201d, that is a user's individual lexicon. The overall system merges standardized lexica with customized lexica into the user's runtime dictionary.","In addition to the above five entries, an intra-class probability P(w|C) is also defined. In this fashion it is possible for the system to differentiate between words belonging to the same class. Thus words that are closer to the user's tasks, preferences and habits will be preferred and a higher intra-class probability assigned. This boosting of higher intra-class probability is determined based on relevance to the user, where relevance is assessed by observing:\n\n","Such observations and relevance statistics are collected based on the user's observed location, history or activity, and\/or alternatively by observing the occurrence of the system's new word in a large background language resource such as the internet. Such statistics may be collected mono-lingually, in a data-rich language and applied to the translation dictionary and translation language model.","The relevance of boosted words may also decay over time, as the user's new activities and tasks render such words less likely over time and\/or if new information (as the arrival at a different city) make a subclass of words less relevant.","Cross-Modal Entry","Optionally, a new word is entered by one of the following:\n\n","The methods described in the previous sections are all aimed at allowing an individual user to customize a speech translation system to his\/her individual needs and tasks in the field. Many of such user customizations could, however, be useful to other users as well. In an embodiment, user customizations are uploaded to a community wide database, where names, special terms, or expressions are shared between interested parties. The vocabulary entries, translations and class tags are collected and related to similarly interested communities. Subsequent users can download these shared community resources and add as resource to their own system.","Alternatively, users may choose to only upload poorly translated sentences, to request manual translation from the community. For such incorrect or incomplete source words or sentences and their missing or incorrect translations other human users can provide online correction and translation on a volunteer (or paid fee) basis. The resulting corrections and translations are once again resubmitted into the updated shared community translation database.","Unsupervised Adaptation","After correction, repair and new word learning, finally, we obtain a corrected hypothesis, and thus a true transcript or translation of a spoken sentence. The speech-to-speech translation device or system automatically can use the fact that such ground truth has been provided to further adapt the ASR modules (, module  or ) to the primary user of the device. Such adaptation is designed to improve the accuracy and usability of the device. Two specific methods of adaptation are performed. First, adaptation of the system to better recognize the user's voice; acoustic model and pronunciation model adaptation, and second, adapting to the user's style of speech by way of language model adaptation. Profiles are used to store adaptation data for specific users and can be switched in the field.","Class-Based Machine Translation","In the previous sections, we have described error repair and new word learning. In these modules, reference was made to class-based machine translation. In the following, we describe the detailed functioning of such class-based machine translation.","The Approach","State of the art machine translation systems perform translation on the word-level. This is evident from prior translation systems including those described in the following three documents; (1) P. Ioehn, H. Hoang, A. Birch, C. Callison-Burch, M. Federico, N. Bertoldi, B. Cowan, W. Shen, C. Moran, R. Zens, C. Dyer, O. Bojar, A. Constantin, and E. Herbst, \u2018Moses: Open source toolkit for statistical machine translation\u2019, In Proc. ACL, 2007 (\u201c[Koehn07\u201d); (2) D. Chiang, A. Lopez, N. Madnani, C. Monz, P. Resnik and M. Subotin, \u201cThe Hiero machine translation system: extensions, evaluation, and analysis,\u201d, In Proc. Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 779-786, 2005 (\u201cChiang05\u201d); and (3) K. Yamada and K. Knight \u201cA decoder for syntax-based statistical MT\u201d. In Proc. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2002 (\u201cYamada02\u201d). Alignment is performed word-to-word; translation examples, or phrase-pairs are matched at the word level; and word-based language models are applied. Hierarchical translation modules such as those in Chiang05, and syntax-based translation models such as in Yamada02, extend on this by introducing intermediate structure. However, these approaches still require exact word matches. As each word is treated as a separate entity, these models do not generalize to unseen words.","One embodiment of class-based machine translation is class-based statistical machine translation, in which a foreign language sentence f=f, f, . . . , fis translated into another language e=e, e, . . . , eby searching for the hypothesis ^ewith maximum likelihood, given:\n\n^=argmax ()=argmax ()\u00b7()\n\nClasses can be semantic classes, such as named-entities, syntactic classes or classes consisting of equivalent words or word phrases. As an example we describe the case when named-entity classes are incorporated into the system.\n","The two most informative models applied during translation are the target language model P(e) and the translation model P(f|e). In a class-based statistical machine translation framework P(f|e) is a class-based translation model (, model ), and P(e) is a class-based language model (, model ).","Class-based models for a statistical machine translation framework can be trained using the procedure shown in . First, the training corpora of sentence pairs are normalized (step ) and tagging models (, model ) are used to tag the corpora (step ). One approach to do this is described in Lafferty01. In this step, sentences that combine to form a training-pair can be tagged independently, tagged jointly, or tags from one language can be projected to the other. After the entire training corpus is tagged, words within sentence-pairs are aligned (step ). Alignment can be accomplished using current approaches such as those described by Franz Josef Och, Christoph Tillmann, Hermann Ney: \u201cImproved Alignment Models for Statistical Machine Translation\u201d; pp. 20-28; Proc. of the Joint Conf. of Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Very Large Corpora; University of Maryland, College Park, Md., June 1999; and Brown, Peter F., Stephen A. Della Pietra, Vincent J. Della Pietra, and R. L. Mercer. 1993. \u201cThe mathematics of statistical machine translation: Parameter estimation,\u201d Computational Linguistics, vol 19(2):263-311. In this step, multi-word phrases within a tagged entity (i.e. \u201cNew York\u201d) are treated as a single token. Next, phrases are extracted (step ) using methods such as Koehn07 to generate class-based translation models (, model ). The tagged corpus is also used to train class-based target language models (, model ). Training may be accomplished using a procedure such as that described in B. Suhm and W. Waibel, \u201cTowards better language models for spontaneous speech\u2019 in Proc. ICSLP-1994, 1994 (\u201cSuhm94\u201d). (step ).","To translate an input sentence the method illustrated in  is applied. First, the input sentence is normalized (step ) and tagged (step ) using a similar procedure as that applied to the training corpora. The input sentence is tagged using a monolingual tagger (, model ). Next, the input sentence is decoded using class-based MT models (, models  and ). For class-based statistical machine translation decoding is performed using the same procedure used in standard statistical machine translation, However, phrase-pairs are matched at the class-level, rather than the word, as shown in the example below.","Given the tagged input

In this approach, for each sentence-pair (Sa,Sb) the label-sequence-pair (Ta,Tb) is selected which has maximum conditional probabilities P(Ta,Sa) and P(Tb,Sb). If the occurrence count of any class-tag differs between P(Ta,Sa) and P(Tb,Sb), that class-tag is removed from the label-sequence-pair (Ta,Tb). One method to estimate P(Ta,Sa) and P(Tb,Sb) is by applying conditional random field-based tagging models Lafferty01. An example of a feature set used during monolingual tagging is shown in .","In an embodiment, labeling consistency across sentence-pairs can be further improved by using the target word extracted from word-alignment (wb,j in ), in addition to monolingual features.","In another embodiment, both sentences in the translation-pair are jointly labeled while applying the constraint that the class-tag sets must be equivalent. Specifically, for the sentence-pair (Sa,Sb) we search for the label-sequence-pair (Ta,Tb) that maximizes the joint maximum conditional probability\n\n\u03bbaP(Ta,Sa)\u00b7\u03bbbP(Tb,Sb) where, ()=() for 1\u2266i\u2266M\n\n","In an embodiment, in the case where no manually annotated corpora is available for a specific language, labels can be generated by projecting labels from a first language where labels are known, across the sentence-pairs in the training corpora to the non-annotated language.

The right hand column indicates the percentage of sentence-pairs in which both sides were tagged correctly. Although the F-score is above 0.90 for the independent languages, the bilingual tagging accuracy is significantly lower at 0.84, and only 80% of the sentence-pairs were correctly tagged. Incorporating alignment features into the monolingual taggers improved precision for both languages and significantly improvement recall for the Japanese side, however, the percentage of correctly tagged sentence-pairs increased only slightly. Removing inconsistent tags across sentence-pairs improved precision, but the number of correctly tagged sentence-pairs did not improve.","Next, the effectiveness of bilingual tagging was evaluated using the approach described above. The tagging accuracy of this approach, and when word alignment features were incorporated are shown in the lower 2 rows of Table 3. Compared to the monolingual case, bilingual tagging significantly improved tagging accuracy. Not only did tagging consistency improve (the F-score for bilingual tagging increased from 0.84 to 0.95), but the tagging accuracy on both the English and Japanese-sides also improved. Incorporating word-alignment features gained a further small improvement in tagging accuracy for all measures.","The effectiveness of the system was further evaluated by comparing the performance of three class-based systems and a baseline system that did not use class models.","For the baseline system phrase-based translation models were trained using the Moses toolkit such as described in Koehn05 and GIZA++ (such as that used by Franz Josef Och, XHermann Ney. \u201cA Systematic Comparison of Various Statistical Alignment Models\u201d, Computational Linguistics, volume 29, number 1, pp. 19-51 Mar. 2003). 3-gram language models were trained using the SRILM toolkit of A. Stolcke \u201cSRILM\u2014an extensible language modeling toolkit\u201d, In Proc. of ICSLP, pp. 901-904, 2002. Decoding was performed using our PanDoRA decoder.

Systems were created for both translation directions J\u2192E (Japanese to English) and E\u2192J (English to Japanese) using the training set described in Table 1. The data used to train the target language models were limited to this corpora. The translation quality of the baseline system was evaluated on a test-set of 600 sentences. One reference was used during evaluation. The BLEU-score for the J\u2192E and E\u2192J systems were 0.4381 and 0.3947, respectively. BLEU-score is described in Kishore Papineni, Salim Roukos, Todd Ward and Wei-Jing Zhu \u201cBLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation,\u201d In Proc. Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 311-318, 2002. Translation quality using three different tagging schemes was evaluated:","+num: 8 classes related to numbers, times","+NE-class: above, +8 classes for named-entities","+Bi-Tagging: above 16 classes, training corpora tagged bilingually","Monolingual tagging was applied for the +num and +NE-class cases, and tags that were inconsistent across a sentence-pair were removed. In the +Bi-Tagging case, bilingual tagging incorporating word alignment features were used. For each tagging scheme, the entire training corpora was tagged with the appropriate set of class-labels. Class-based translation and language models were then trained using an equivalent procedure to that used in the baseline system. During testing the input sentence was tagged using a monolingual tagger. All named-entities in the test set were entered into the user dictionary to be used during translation.","The performance on the 600 sentence test-set for the baseline and class-based systems are shown in terms of BLEU-score for the J\u2192E and E\u2192J systems in Table 4.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0136"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Translation Quality of Class-based SMT"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Translation Quality",{}]},{"entry":[{},"(BLEU [Papineni02])"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"System","J \u2192 E","E \u2192 J"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"baseline","0.4381","0.3947"]},{"entry":[{},"+num","0.4441","0.4104"]},{"entry":[{},"+NE-class","0.5014","0.4464"]},{"entry":[{},"+Bi-Tagging","0.5083","0.4542"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The class-based SMT system using number and time tags (+num), obtained improved translation quality compared to the baseline system for both translation directions.
