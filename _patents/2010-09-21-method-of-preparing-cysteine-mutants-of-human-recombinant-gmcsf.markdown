title: Method of preparing cysteine mutants of human recombinant GM-CSF
abstract: The growth hormone supergene family comprises greater than 20 structurally related cytokines and growth factors. A general method is provided for creating site-specific, biologically active conjugates of these proteins. The method involves adding cysteine residues to non-essential regions of the proteins or substituting cysteine residues for non-essential amino acids in the proteins using site-directed mutagenesis and then covalently coupling a cysteine-reactive polymer or other type of cysteine-reactive moiety to the proteins via the added cysteine residue. Disclosed herein are preferred sites for adding cysteine residues or introducing cysteine substitutions into the proteins, and the proteins and protein derivatives produced thereby. Also disclosed are therapeutic methods for using the cysteine variants of the invention.

The entire disclosure of each of the above-identified applications is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made in part with Government support under Grant Numbers 1R43 CA084850 and 2R44 CA084850 awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to genetically engineered therapeutic proteins and methods of using such proteins. More specifically, the engineered proteins include cysteine variants of growth hormone and related members of the growth hormone supergene family.","The following proteins are encoded by genes of the growth hormone (GH) supergene family (Bazan (1990); Mott and Campbell (1995); Silvennoinen and Ihle (1996); Blumberg et al. (2001)): growth hormone, prolactin, placental lactogen, erythropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12 (p35 subunit), IL-13, IL-15, IL-19, IL-20, IL-21, MDA-7, IL-TIF, AK-155, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, alpha interferon, beta interferon, gamma interferon, omega interferon, tau interferon, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (\u201cthe GH supergene family\u201d). It is anticipated that additional members of this gene family will be identified in the future through gene cloning and sequencing. Members of the GH supergene family have similar secondary and tertiary structures, despite the fact that they generally have limited amino acid or DNA sequence identity. The shared structural features allow new members of the gene family to be readily identified.","There is considerable interest on the part of patients and healthcare providers in the development of long acting, \u201cuser-friendly\u201d protein therapeutics. Proteins are expensive to manufacture and, unlike conventional small molecule drugs, are not readily absorbed by the body. Moreover, they are digested if taken orally. Therefore, natural proteins must be administered by injection. After injection, most proteins are cleared rapidly from the body, necessitating frequent, often daily, injections. Patients dislike injections, which leads to reduced compliance and reduced drug efficacy. Some proteins, such as erythropoietin (EPO), are effective when administered less often (three times per week for EPO) because they are glycosylated. However, glycosylated proteins are produced using expensive mammalian cell expression systems.","The length of time an injected protein remains in the body is finite and is determined by, e.g., the protein's size and whether or not the protein contains covalent modifications such as glycosylation. Circulating concentrations of injected proteins change constantly, often by several orders of magnitude, over a 24-hour period. Rapidly changing concentrations of protein agonists can have dramatic downstream consequences, at times under-stimulating and at other times over-stimulating target cells. Similar problems plague protein antagonists. These fluctuations can lead to decreased efficacy and increased frequency of adverse side effects for protein therapeutics. The rapid clearance of recombinant proteins from the body significantly increases the amount of protein required per patient and dramatically increases the cost of treatment. The cost of human protein pharmaceuticals is expected to increase dramatically in the years ahead as new and existing drugs are approved for more disease indications.","Thus, there is a need to develop protein delivery technologies that lower the costs of protein therapeutics to patients and healthcare providers. The present invention provides a solution to this problem by providing methods to prolong the circulating half-lives of protein therapeutics in the body so that the proteins do not have to be injected frequently. This solution also satisfies the needs and desires of patients for protein therapeutics that are \u201cuser-friendly\u201d, i.e., protein therapeutics that do not require frequent injections. The present invention solves these and other problems by providing biologically active, cysteine-added variants of members of the growth hormone supergene family. The invention also provides for the chemical modification of these variants with cysteine-reactive polymers or other types of cysteine-reactive moieties to produce derivatives thereof and the molecules so produced. The invention also provides for therapeutic methods using the protein variants described herein.","The present invention provides cysteine variants of members of the GH supergene family and uses of such cysteine variants. The variants comprise a cysteine residue substituted for a nonessential amino acid of the proteins. Preferably, the variants comprise a cysteine residue substituted for an amino acid selected from amino acids in the loop regions, the ends of the alpha helices, proximal to the first amphipathic helix, and distal to the final amphipathic helix or wherein the cysteine residue is added at the N-terminus or C-terminus of the proteins. Preferred sites for substitution are the N- and O-linked glycosylation sites. According to the present invention, \u201cproximal to the first amphipathic helix\u201d refers to a position preceding, or N-terminal to, the first amphipathic helix (i.e., closer to the amino-terminus of the protein than the first amphipathic helix). Similarly, \u201cdistal to the final amphipathic helix\u201d refers to a position following, or C-terminal to, the final amphipathic helix (i.e., further away from the amino-terminus of the protein than the final amphipathic helix).","Also provided are cysteine variants wherein the amino acid substituted for is in the A-B loop, B-C loop, the C-D loop or D-E loop of interferon\/interferon-10-like members of the GH supergene family.","Also provided are cysteine variants of members of the GH supergene family wherein the cysteine residue is introduced between two amino acids in the natural protein. In particular, the cysteine residue is introduced into the loop regions, the ends of the alpha helices, proximal to the first amphipathic helix, or distal to the final amphipathic helix. Even more particularly, the cysteine variant is introduced between two amino acids in an N-O-linked glycosylation site or adjacent to an amino acid in an N-linked or O-linked glycosylation site.","More particularly are provided cysteine variants wherein the loop region where the cysteine is introduced is the A-B loop, the B-C loop, the C-D loop or D-E loop of interferon\/interferon-10-like members of the GH supergene family.","Such cysteine substitutions or insertion mutations also can include the insertion of one or more additional amino acids amino acids at the amino-terminal or carboxy-terminal to the cysteine substitution or insertion.","Also provided are cysteine variants that are further derivatised by PEGylating the cysteine variants and including the derivatised proteins produced thereby.","As set forth in the examples, specific cysteine variants of the members of the GH supergene family also are provided, including for example, variants of GH. The GH cysteine variants can have the substituted-for amino acid or inserted cysteine located at the N-terminal end of the A-B loop, the B-C loop, the C-D loop, the first three or last three amino acids in the A, B, C and D helices and the amino acids proximal to helix A and distal to helix D.","More particularly, the cysteine can be substituted for the following amino acids: F1, T3, P5, E33, A34, K38, E39, Q40, S43, Q46, N47, P48, Q49, T50, S51, S55, T60, A98, N99, S100, G104, A105, S106, E129, D130, G131, 5132, P133, T135, G136, Q137, K140, Q141, T142, S144, K145, D147, T148, N149, S150, H151, N152, D153, 5184, E186, G187, S188, and G190.","Other examples of cysteine variants according to the invention include erythropoietin variants. Erythropoietin variants include those wherein the substituted for amino acid is located in the A-B loop, the B-C loop, the C-D loop, the amino acids proximal to helix A and distal to helix D and the N- or C-terminus. Even more specifically, the EPO cysteine variants include molecules wherein the amino acids indicated below have a cysteine substituted therefor: serine-126, N24, I25, T26, N38, I39, T40, N83, S84, A1, P2, P3, R4, D8, S9, T27, G28, A30, E31, H32, S34, N36, D43, T44, K45, N47, A50, K52, E55, G57, Q58, G77, Q78, A79, Q86, W88, E89, T107, R110, A111, G113, A114, Q115, K116, E117, A118, S120, P121, P122, D123, A124, A125, A127, A128, T132, K154, T157, G158, E159, A160, T163, G164, D165, R166 and S85.","The members of the GH supergene family include growth hormone, prolactin, placental lactogen, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, interleukin-2, interleukin-3, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-9, interleukin-10, interleukin-11, interleukin-12 (p35 subunit), interleukin-13, interleukin-15, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, alpha interferon, beta interferon, gamma interferon, omega interferon, tau interferon, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, macrophage colony stimulating factor, cardiotrophin-1 and other proteins identified and classified as members of the family. The proteins can be derived from any animal species including human, companion animals and farm animals.","Also provided are therapeutic methods for protecting an animal from a disease or condition that is amenable to treatment by any of the wild-type growth hormone superfamily proteins described herein. The methods include administration of one or more cysteine variants (cysteine muteins) of the invention (including those with agonist or antagonist functions) to an animal for treatment of a disease or condition.","In one aspect, provided is a method to protect an animal from a disease or condition, comprising administering to the animal a composition comprising a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cysteine mutein as described herein.","Also provided is a method to prevent or treat the occurrence of neutropenia in an animal comprising administering to the animal a composition comprising a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cysteine mutein as described herein. The neutropenia to be prevented or treated using this method can include, but is not limited to: (a) neutropenia resulting from myelosuppressive chemotherapy; (b) neutropenia associated with bone marrow transplantation (c) neutropenia associated with infection with the human immunodeficiency virus; (d) neutropenia associated with burns, surgery, dilatation, anemia and neonatal septicemia; (e) severe chronic neutropenia; or neutropenia associated with aplastic anemia and acute leukemia.","Also provided is a method to protect an animal from a disease or condition by stimulating proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells in the animal, comprising administering to the animal a composition comprising a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cysteine mutein as described herein.","Also provided is a method for stimulating the expansion and proliferation of peripheral blood progenitor cells in an animal comprising administering to the animal a composition comprising a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cysteine mutein as described herein.","Other variations and modifications to the invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art based on the specification and the \u201crules\u201d set forth herein. All of these are considered as part of the invention.","The present invention relates to cysteine variants and, among other things, the site-specific conjugation of such proteins with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other such moieties. PEG is a non-antigenic, inert polymer that significantly prolongs the length of time a protein circulates in the body. This allows the protein to be effective for a longer period of time. Covalent modification of proteins with PEG has proven to be a useful method to extend the circulating half-lives of proteins in the body (Abuchowski et al., 1984; Hershfield, 1987; Meyers et al., 1991). Covalent attachment of PEG to a protein increases the protein's effective size and reduces its rate of clearance rate from the body. PEGs are commercially available in several sizes, allowing the circulating half-lives of PEG-modified proteins to be tailored for individual indications through use of different size PEGs. Other benefits of PEG modification include an increase in protein solubility, an increase in vivo protein stability and a decrease in protein immunogenicity (Katre et al., 1987; Katre, 1990).","The preferred method for PEGylating proteins is to covalently attach PEG to cysteine residues using cysteine-reactive PEGs. A number of highly specific, cysteine-reactive PEGs with different reactive groups (e.g., maleimide, vinylsulfone) and different size PEGs (2-20 kDa) are commercially available (e.g., from Shearwater, Polymers, Inc., Huntsville, Ala.). At neutral pH, these PEG reagents selectively attach to \u201cfree\u201d cysteine residues, i.e., cysteine residues not involved in disulfide bonds. The conjugates are hydrolytically stable. Use of cysteine-reactive PEGs allows the development of homogeneous PEG-protein conjugates of defined structure.","Considerable progress has been made in recent years in determining the structures of commercially important protein therapeutics and understanding how they interact with their protein targets, e.g., cell-surface receptors, proteases, etc. This structural information can be used to design PEG-protein conjugates using cysteine-reactive PEGs. Cysteine residues in most proteins participate in disulfide bonds and are not available for PEGylation using cysteine-reactive PEGs. Through in vitro mutagenesis using recombinant DNA techniques, additional cysteine residues can be introduced anywhere into the protein. The added cysteines can be introduced at the beginning of the protein, at the end of the protein, between two amino acids in the protein sequence or, preferably, substituted for an existing amino acid in the protein sequence. The newly added \u201cfree\u201d cysteines can serve as sites for the specific attachment of a PEG molecule using cysteine-reactive PEGs. The added cysteine must be exposed on the protein's surface and accessible for PEGylation for this method to be successful. If the site used to introduce an added cysteine site is non-essential for biological activity, then the PEGylated protein will display essentially wild type (normal) in vitro bioactivity. The major technical challenge in PEGylating proteins with cysteine-reactive PEGs is the identification of surface exposed, non-essential regions in the target protein where cysteine residues can be added or substituted for existing amino acids without loss of bioactivity.","Cysteine-added variants of a few human proteins and PEG-polymer conjugates of these proteins have been described. U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,344 describes cysteine-added variants of IL-2. These cysteine-added variants are located within the first 20 amino acids from the amino terminus of the mature IL-2 polypeptide chain. The preferred cysteine variant is at position 3 of the mature polypeptide chain, which corresponds to a threonine residue that is O-glycosylated in the naturally occurring protein. Substitution of cysteine for threonine at position 3 yields an IL-2 variant that can be PEGylated with a cysteine-reactive PEG and retain full in vitro bioactivity (Goodson and Katre, 1990). In contrast, natural IL-2 PEGylated with lysine-reactive PEGs displays reduced in vitro bioactivity (Goodson and Katre, 1990). The effects of cysteine substitutions at other positions in IL-2 were not reported.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,322 teaches cysteine-added variants of IL-3. These variants are located within the first 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the mature protein sequence. The patent teaches expression of the proteins in bacteria and covalent modification of the proteins with cysteine-reactive PEGs. No information is provided as to whether the cysteine-added variants and PEG-conjugates of IL-3 are biologically active. Cysteine-added variants at other positions in the polypeptide chain were not reported.","PCT Publication No. WO 9412219 and PCT Application No. PCT\/US95\/06540 teach cysteine-added variants of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). IGF-I has a very different structure from GH and is not a member of the GH supergene family (Mott and Campbell, 1995). Cysteine substitutions at many positions in the IGF-I protein are described. Only certain of the cysteine-added variants are biologically active. The preferred site for the cysteine added variant is at amino acid position 69 in the mature protein chain. Cysteine substitutions at positions near the N-terminus of the protein (residues 1-3) yielded IGF-I variants with reduced biological activities and improper disulfide bonds.","PCT Publication No. WO 9422466 teaches two cysteine-added variants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein-1, which has a very different structure than GH and is not a member of the GH supergene family. The two cysteine-added IGF binding protein-1 variants disclosed are located at positions 98 and 101 in the mature protein chain and correspond to serine residues that are phosphorylated in the naturally-occurring protein.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07\/822,296 teaches cysteine added variants of tumor necrosis factor binding protein, which is a soluble, truncated form of the tumor necrosis factor cellular receptor. Tumor necrosis factor binding protein has a very different structure than GH and is not a member of the GH supergene family.","IGF-I, IGF binding protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor binding protein have secondary and tertiary structures that are very different from GH and the proteins are not members of the GH supergene family. Because of this, it is difficult to use the information gained from studies of IGF-I, IGF binding protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor binding protein to create cysteine-added variants of members of the GH supergene family. The studies with IL-2 and IL-3 were carried out before the structures of IL-2 and IL-3 were known (McKay 1992; Bazan, 1992) and before it was known that these proteins are members of the GH supergene family. Previous experiments aimed at identifying preferred sites for adding cysteine residues to IL-2 and IL-3 were largely empirical and were performed prior to experiments indicating that members of the GH supergene family possessed similar secondary and tertiary structures.","Based on the structural information now available for members of the GH supergene family, the present invention provides \u201crules\u201d for determining a priori which regions and amino acid residues in members of the GH supergene family can be used to introduce or substitute cysteine residues without significant loss of biological activity. In contrast to the naturally occurring proteins, these cysteine-added variants of members of the GH supergene family will possess novel properties such as the ability to be covalently modified at defined sites within the polypeptide chain with cysteine-reactive polymers or other types of cysteine-reactive moieties. The covalently modified proteins will be biologically active.","GH is the best-studied member of the GH supergene family. GH is a 22 kDa protein secreted by the pituitary gland. GH stimulates metabolism of bone, cartilage and muscle and is the body's primary hormone for stimulating somatic growth during childhood. Recombinant human GH (rhGH) is used to treat short stature resulting from GH inadequacy and renal failure in children. GH is not glycosylated and can be produced in a fully active form in bacteria. The protein has a short in vivo half-life and must be administered by daily subcutaneous injection for maximum effectiveness (MacGillivray et al., 1996). Recombinant human GH (rhGH) was approved recently for treating cachexia in AIDS patients and is under study for treating cachexia associated with other diseases.","The sequence of human GH is well known (see, e.g., Martial et al. 1979; Goeddel et al. 1979 which are incorporated herein by reference; SEQ ID NO:1). GH is closely related in sequence to prolactin and placental lactogen and these three proteins were considered originally to comprise a small gene family. The primary sequence of GH is highly conserved among animal species (Abdel-Meguid et al., 1987), consistent with the protein's broad species cross-reactivity. The three dimensional folding pattern of porcine GH has been solved by X-ray crystallography (Abdel-Meguid et al., 1987). The protein has a compact globular structure, comprising four amphipathic alpha helical bundles joined by loops. Human GH has a similar structure (de Vos et al., 1992). The four alpha helical regions are termed A-D beginning from the N-terminus of the protein. The loop regions are referred to by the helical regions they join, e.g., the A-B loop joins helical bundles A and B. The A-B and C-D loops are long, whereas the B-C loop is short. GH contains four cysteine residues, all of which participate in disulfide bonds. The disulfide assignments are cysteine53 joined to cysteine165 and cysteine182 joined to cysteine189.","The crystal structure of GH bound to its receptor revealed that GH has two receptor binding sites and binds two receptor molecules (Cunningham et al., 1991; de Vos et al., 1992). The two receptor binding sites are referred to as site I and site II. Site I encompasses the Carboxy (C)-terminal end of helix D and parts of helix A and the A-B loop, whereas site II encompasses the Amino (N)-terminal region of helix A and a portion of helix C. Binding of GH to its receptor occurs sequentially, with site I always binding first. Site II then engages a second GH receptor, resulting in receptor dimerization and activation of the intracellular signaling pathways that lead to cellular responses to GH. A GH mutein in which site II has been mutated (a glycine to arginine mutation at amino acid 120) is able to bind a single GH receptor, but is unable to dimerize GH receptors; this mutein acts as a GH antagonist in vitro, presumably by occupying GH receptor sites without activating intracellular signaling pathways (Fuh et al., 1992).","The roles of particular regions and amino acids in GH receptor binding and intracellular signaling also have been studied using techniques such as mutagenesis, monoclonal antibodies and proteolytic digestion. The first mutagenesis experiments entailed replacing entire domains of GH with similar regions of the closely related protein, prolactin (Cunningham et al., 1989). One finding was that replacement of the B-C loop of GH with that of prolactin did not affect binding of the hybrid GH protein to a soluble form of the human GH receptor, implying that the B-C loop was non-essential for receptor binding. Alanine scanning mutagenesis (replacement of individual amino acids with alanine) identified 14 amino acids that are critical for GH bioactivity (Cunningham and Wells, 1989). These amino acids are located in the helices A, B, C, and D and the A-B loop and correspond to sites I and II identified from the structural studies. Two lysine residues at amino acid positions 41 and 172, K41 and K172, were determined to be critical components of the site I receptor binding site, which explains the decrease in bioactivity observed when K172 is acetylated (Teh and Chapman, 1988). Modification of K168 also significantly reduced GH receptor binding and bioactivity (de la Llosa et al., 1985; Martal et al., 1985; Teh and Chapman, 1988). Regions of GH responsible for binding the GH receptor have also been studied using monoclonal antibodies (Cunningham et al., 1989). A series of eight monoclonal antibodies was generated to human GH and analyzed for the ability to neutralize GH activity and prevent binding of GH to its recombinant soluble receptor. The latter studies allowed the putative binding site for each monoclonal antibody to be localized within the GH three-dimensional structure. Of interest was that monoclonal antibodies 1 and 8 were unable to displace GH from binding its receptor. The binding sites for these monoclonal antibodies were localized to the B-C loop (monoclonal number 1) and the N-terminal end of the A-B loop (monoclonal number 8). No monoclonals were studied that bound the C-D loop specifically. The monoclonal antibody studies suggest that the B-C loop and N-terminal end of the A-B loop are non-essential for receptor binding. Finally, limited cleavage of GH with trypsin was found to produce a two chain derivative that retained full activity (Mills et al., 1980; Li, 1982). Mapping studies indicated that trypsin cleaved and\/or deleted amino acids between positions 134 and 149, which corresponds to the C-D loop. These studies suggest the C-D loop is not involved in receptor binding or GH bioactivity.","Structures of a number of cytokines, including G-CSF (Hill et al., 1993), GM-CSF (Diederichs et al., 1991; Walter et al., 1992), IL-2 (Bazan, 1992; McKay, 1992), IL-4 (Redfield et al., 1991; Powers et al., 1992), and IL-5 (Milburn et al., 1993) have been determined by X-ray diffraction and NMR studies and show striking conservation with the GH structure, despite a lack of significant primary sequence homology. EPO is considered to be a member of this family based upon modeling and mutagenesis studies (Boissel et al., 1993; Wen et al., 1994). A large number of additional cytokines and growth factors including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), thrombopoietin (TPO), oncostatin M, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, and alpha, beta, omega, tau and gamma interferon belong to this family (reviewed in Mott and Campbell, 1995; Silvennoinen and Ihle 1996). All of the above cytokines and growth factors are now considered to comprise one large gene family, of which GH is the prototype.","In addition to sharing similar secondary and tertiary structures, members of this family share the property that they must oligomerize cell surface receptors to activate intracellular signaling pathways. Some GH family members, e.g., GH and EPO, bind a single type of receptor and cause it to form homodimers. Other family members, e.g., IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6, bind more than one type of receptor and cause the receptors to form heterodimers or higher order aggregates (Davis et al., 1993; Paonessa et al., 1995; Mott and Campbell, 1995). Mutagenesis studies have shown that, like GH, these other cytokines and growth factors contain multiple receptor binding sites, typically two, and bind their cognate receptors sequentially (Mott and Campbell, 1995; Matthews et al., 1996). Like GH, the primary receptor binding sites for these other family members occur primarily in the four alpha helices and the A-B loop (reviewed in Mott and Campbell, 1995). The specific amino acids in the helical bundles that participate in receptor binding differ amongst the family members (Mott and Campbell, 1995). Most of the cell surface receptors that interact with members of the GH supergene family are structurally related and comprise a second large multi-gene family (Bazan, 1990; Mott and Campbell, 1995; Silvennoinen and Ihle 1996).","A general conclusion reached from mutational studies of various members of the GH supergene family is that the loops joining the alpha helices generally tend to not be involved in receptor binding. In particular the short B-C loop appears to be non-essential for receptor binding in most, if not all, family members. For this reason, the B-C loop is a preferred region for introducing cysteine substitutions in members of the GH supergene family. The A-B loop, the B-C loop, the C-D loop (and D-E loop of interferon\/IL-10-like members of the GH superfamily) also are preferred sites for introducing cysteine mutations. Amino acids proximal to helix A and distal to the final helix also tend not to be involved in receptor binding and also are preferred sites for introducing cysteine substitutions. Certain members of the GH family, e.g., EPO, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, G-CSF, GM-CSF, TPO, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-13, IL-15 and beta-interferon contain N-linked and O-linked sugars. The glycosylation sites in the proteins occur almost exclusively in the loop regions and not in the alpha helical bundles. Because the loop regions generally are not involved in receptor binding and because they are sites for the covalent attachment of sugar groups, they are preferred sites for introducing cysteine substitutions into the proteins. Amino acids that comprise the N- and O-linked glycosylation sites in the proteins are preferred sites for cysteine substitutions because these amino acids are surface-exposed, the natural protein can tolerate bulky sugar groups attached to the proteins at these sites and the glycosylation sites tend to be located away from the receptor binding sites.","Many additional members of the GH gene family are likely to be discovered in the future. New members of the GH supergene family can be identified through computer-aided secondary and tertiary structure analyses of the predicted protein sequences. Members of the GH supergene family will possess four or five amphipathic helices joined by non-helical amino acids (the loop regions). The proteins may contain a hydrophobic signal sequence at their N-terminus to promote secretion from the cell. Such later discovered members of the GH supergene family also are included within this invention.","The present invention provides \u201crules\u201d for creating biologically active cysteine-added variants of members of the GH supergene family. These \u201crules\u201d can be applied to any existing or future member of the GH supergene family. The cysteine-added variants will posses novel properties not shared by the naturally occurring proteins. Most importantly, the cysteine added variants will possess the property that they can be covalently modified with cysteine-reactive polymers or other types of cysteine-reactive moieties to generate biologically active proteins with improved properties such as increased in vivo half-life, increased solubility and improved in vivo efficacy.","Specifically, the present invention provides biologically active cysteine variants of members of the GH supergene family by substituting cysteine residues for non-essential amino acids in the proteins. Preferably, the cysteine residues are substituted for amino acids that comprise the loop regions, for amino acids near the ends of the alpha helices and for amino acids proximal to the first amphipathic helix or distal to the final amphipathic helix of these proteins. Other preferred sites for adding cysteine residues are at the N-terminus or C-terminus of the proteins. Cysteine residues also can be introduced between two amino acids in the disclosed regions of the polypeptide chain. The present invention teaches that N- and O-linked glycosylation sites in the proteins are preferred sites for introducing cysteine substitutions either by substitution for amino acids that make up the sites or, in the case of N-linked sites, introduction of cysteines therein. The glycosylation sites can be serine or threonine residues that are O-glycosylated or asparagine residues that are N-glycosylated. N-linked glycosylation sites have the general structure asparagine-X-serine or threonine (N-X-S\/T), where X can be any amino acid. The asparagine residue, the amino acid in the X position and the serine\/threonine residue of the N-linked glycosylation site are preferred sites for creating biologically active cysteine-added variants of these proteins Amino acids immediately surrounding or adjacent to the O-linked and N-linked glycosylation sites (within about 10 residues on either side of the glycosylation site) are preferred sites for introducing cysteine-substitutions.","More generally, certain of the \u201crules\u201d for identifying preferred sites for creating biologically active cysteine-added protein variants can be applied to any protein, not just proteins that are members of the GH supergene family. Specifically, preferred sites for creating biologically active cysteine variants of proteins (other than IL-2) are O-linked glycosylation sites. Amino acids immediately surrounding the O-linked glycosylation site (within about 10 residues on either side of the glycosylation site) also are preferred sites. N-linked glycosylation sites, and the amino acid residues immediately adjacent on either side of the glycosylation site (within about 10 residues of the N-X-S\/T site) also are preferred sites for creating cysteine added protein variants. Amino acids that can be replaced with cysteine without significant loss of biological activity also are preferred sites for creating cysteine-added protein variants. Such non-essential amino acids can be identified by performing cysteine-scanning mutagenesis on the target protein and measuring effects on biological activity. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis entails adding or substituting cysteine residues for individual amino acids in the polypeptide chain and determining the effect of the cysteine substitution on biological activity. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis is similar to alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham et al., 1992), except that target amino acids are individually replaced with cysteine rather than alanine residues.","Application of the \u201crules\u201d to create cysteine-added variants and conjugates of protein antagonists also is contemplated. Excess production of cytokines and growth factors has been implicated in the pathology of many inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, allergies and wound scarring. Excess production of GH has been implicated as a cause of acromegaly. Certain growth factors and cytokines, e.g., GH and IL-6, have been implicated in proliferation of particular cancers. Many of the growth factors and cytokines implicated in inflammation and cancer are members of the GH supergene family. There is considerable interest in developing protein antagonists of these molecules to treat these diseases. One strategy involves engineering the cytokines and growth factors so that they can bind to, but not oligomerize receptors. This is accomplished by mutagenizing the second receptor binding site (site II) on the molecules. The resulting muteins are able to bind and occupy receptor sites but are incapable of activating intracellular signaling pathways. This strategy has been successfully applied to GH to make a GH antagonist (Cunningham et al., 1992). Similar strategies are being pursued to develop antagonists of other members of the GH supergene family such as IL-2 (Zurawski et al., 1990; Zurawski and Zurawski, 1992), IL-4 (Kruse et al., 1992), IL-5 (Tavernier et al., 1995), GM-CSF (Hercus et al., 1994) and EPO (Matthews et al., 1996). Since the preferred sites for adding cysteine residues to members of the GH supergene family described here lie outside of the receptor binding sites in these proteins, and thus removed from any sites used to create protein antagonists, the cysteine-added variants described herein could be used to generate long-acting versions of protein antagonists. As an example, Cunningham et al. (1992) developed an in vitro GH antagonist by mutating a glycine residue (amino acid 120) to an arginine. This glycine residue is a critical component of the second receptor binding site in GH; when it is replaced with arginine, GH cannot dimerize receptors. The glycine to arginine mutation at position 120 can be introduced into DNA sequences encoding the cysteine-added variants of GH contemplated herein to create a cysteine-added GH antagonist that can be conjugated with cysteine-reactive PEGs or other types of cysteine-reactive moieties. Similarly, amino acid changes in other proteins that turn the proteins from agonists to antagonists could be incorporated into DNA sequences encoding cysteine-added protein variants described herein. Considerable effort is being spent to identify amino acid changes that convert protein agonists to antagonists. Hercus et al. (1994) reported that substituting arginine or lysine for glutamic acid at position 21 in the mature GM-CSF protein converts GM-CSF from an agonist to an antagonist. Tavernier et al. (1995) reported that substituting glutamine for glutamic acid at position 13 of mature IL-5 creates an IL-5 antagonist. Prolactin antagonists can be created by substituting other amino acids, in particular alanine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, for serine-179 of prolactin (Chen et al., 1998). Receptor antagonists of erythropoietin can be created by substituting alanine for arginine-103 of erythopoietin (Matthews et al., 1996).","Experimental strategies similar to those described above can be used to create cysteine-added variants (both agonists and antagonists) of members of the GH supergene family derived from various animals. This is possible because the primary amino acid sequences and structures of cytokines and growth factors are largely conserved between human and animal species. For this reason, the \u201crules\u201d disclosed herein for creating biologically active cysteine-added variants of members of the GH supergene family will be useful for creating biologically active cysteine-added variants of members of the GH supergene family of companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats, horses) and commercial animal (e.g., cow, sheep, pig) species. Conjugation of these cysteine-added variants with cysteine-reactive PEGs will create long-acting versions of these proteins that will benefit the companion animal and commercial farm animal markets.","Proteins that are members of the GH supergene family (hematopoietic cytokines) are provided in Silvennoimem and Ihle (1996). Silvennoimem and Ihle (1996) also provide information about the structure and expression of these proteins. DNA sequences, encoded amino acids and in vitro and in vivo bioassays for the proteins described herein are described in Aggarwal and Gutterman (1992; 1996), Aggarwal (1998), and Silvennoimem and Ihle (1996). Bioassays for the proteins also are provided in catalogues of various commercial suppliers of these proteins such as R&D Systems, Inc. and Endogen, Inc.","The cysteine variants of the present invention can be used for any of the known therapeutic uses of the native proteins in essentially the same forms and doses all well known in the art. By way of example, therapeutic methods for increasing hematopoeisis in a patient and for accelerating recovery from neutropenia are described herein which use a cysteine variant of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) according to the present invention. It is to be understood, however, that general discussion regarding modes of administration, dosage and delivery of cysteine variants such as the GM-CSF cysteine mutein, is generally intended to apply to therapeutic methods using any of the cysteine variants described herein.","One embodiment of the invention relates to a method to protect an animal from a disease or condition, comprising administering to the animal a composition comprising a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cysteine mutein as described herein. In one embodiment, the cysteine mutein is prepared using methods described in PCT Application No. PCT\/US01\/16088 (PCT Publication No. WO 01\/87925 A2), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Another embodiment of the invention relates to a method to prevent or treat the occurrence of neutropenia in an animal comprising administering to the animal a composition comprising a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cysteine mutein as described herein and in one embodiment, as prepared using methods described in PCT Application No. PCT\/US01\/16088, supra. The neutropenia to be prevented or treated using this method can include, but is not limited to: (a) neutropenia resulting from myelosuppressive chemotherapy; (b) neutropenia associated with bone marrow transplantation (c) neutropenia associated with infection with the human immunodeficiency virus; (d) neutropenia associated with burns, surgery, dilatation, anemia and neonatal septicemia; (e) severe chronic neutropenia; or neutropenia associated with aplastic anemia and acute leukemia.","Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a method to protect an animal from a disease or condition by stimulating proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells in the animal, comprising administering to said animal a composition comprising a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cysteine mutein as described herein and in one embodiment, as prepared using methods described in PCT Application No. PCT\/US01\/16088, supra. Hematopoeitic cells include, but are not limited to, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, erythroid, and megakaryocyte cell lineages. According to the present invention, a cell of hematopoietic lineage is able to develop into cell types including, but not limited to, erythrocyte cells (i.e. a red blood cell), leukocyte cells (i.e. a white blood cell), or thrombocyte cells (i.e. platelet cell). Leukocyte cells include, but are not limited to, granular leukocytes, including eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, and mast cells; as well as non-granular leukocytes, including megakaryocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes and monocytes (i.e. macrophages). According to the present invention, the term \u201clineage\u201d refers to all of the stages of the development of a cell type, from the earliest precursor cell to a completely mature cell (i.e. a specialized cell). As used herein, the terms \u201cdevelop\u201d, \u201cdifferentiate\u201d and \u201cmature\u201d all refer to the progression of a cell from the stage of having the potential to differentiate into at least two different cellular lineages to becoming a specialized cell. Such terms can be used interchangeably for the purposes of the present application.","Yet another embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for stimulating the expansion and proliferation of peripheral blood progenitor cells in an animal comprising administering to the animal a composition comprising a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cysteine mutein as described herein and in one embodiment, as prepared using methods described in PCT Application No. PCT\/US01\/16088, supra. Reference to a progenitor cell or a precursor cell is reference to a group of cells capable of developing into a more mature cell. A precursor cell population can comprise cells that are totipotent, cells that are pluripotent and cells that are stem cell lineage restricted (i.e. cells capable of developing into less than all hematopoietic lineages, or into, for example, only cells of erythroid lineage). Peripheral blood progenitor cells are cells that differentiate into various cells that circulate in the blood, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).","Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is a glycoprotein having a molecular mass of 14.5-35 kDa that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into mature cells such as mature neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils. GM-CSF also stimulates the functional properties of mature monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. Recombinant GM-CSF is used to ameliorate neutropenia following myelosuppressive chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. GM-CSF also has been used to treat severe chronic neutropenia, aplastic anemia, and acute leukemia, and to mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells for transplantation and blood banking. GM-CSF also may be useful for reversing neutropenia associated with the human immunodeficiency virus, burns, surgery, dilatation, anemia and neonatal septicemia. The ability of GM-CSF to enhance the functional properties of monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils suggests that GM-CSF may have utility as an anti-neoplastic agent either alone or in combination with other anti-neoplastic agents such as cytotoxic drugs, chemotherapeutic agents, polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor cells. The immunomodulatory properties of GM-CSF also suggest that GM-CSF may have utility as an adjuvant for vaccines against tumors and infectious agents.","GM-CSF has a short circulating half life, which necessitates daily subcutaneous injections for maximum effectiveness in humans. The present inventors have created novel GM-CSF analogs (i.e., the GM-CSF cysteine muteins described herein) with improved in vivo characteristics such as increased circulating half-life and improved therapeutic efficacy through site-specific chemical modification of the protein with cysteine-reactive Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) reagents. These analogs were created by introducing a \u201cfree\u201d cysteine residue (i.e., a cysteine residue not involved in a disulfide bond) into the protein using site-directed mutagenesis. The free cysteine residue serves as the site for covalent modification of the protein with cysteine-reactive PEG reagents. The present application teaches a variety of human GM-CSF cysteine muteins that can be modified with cysteine-reactive PEG reagents and retain biological activity, and PCT Application No. PCT\/US01\/16088, supra, describes additional methods of preparing such muteins.","Human and rodent GM-CSF proteins perform similar functions in their respective species and studies with rodent GM-CSF proteins can be used to predict the function of human GM-CSF in humans. Human and rodent GM-CSF proteins share 50-60% amino acid identity, but there is no cross species cross-reactivity in terms of biological activity or receptor binding. It is possible to use the significant amino acid identity between human and rodent GM-CSF proteins to construct murine GM-CSF cysteine muteins that are analogues of human GM-CSF cysteine muteins. The murine GM-CSF cysteine analogs can be expressed, purified and PEGylated using procedures similar to those described for human GM-CSF cysteine variants herein and in PCT Application No. PCT\/US01\/16088, supra. Biological activities of the PEGylated murine GM-CSF cysteine muteins can be tested in rodent animal disease models and used to predict the effectiveness of PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs in humans. Toward that end, the present inventors constructed the murine GM-CSF T3C mutein, which is an analog of the human GM-CSF A3C mutein described herein. As shown in Example 26, the PEGylated murine T3C analog is effective at stimulating hematopoiesis in a mammal (a rodent), which indicates that PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine muteins will be effective at stimulating hematopoiesis in humans. Stimulating hematopoiesis will be useful for ameliorating disease indications in which hematopoiesis is impaired, such as neutropenia (see Example 27). PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs can used to ameliorate neutropenia following myelosuppressive chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation based on the observed efficacy of GM-CSF in these indications (Cebon and Lieschke 1994). Similarly PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs will be useful in treating diseases and conditions for which the therapeutic use of GM-CSF is well established (Armitage, 1998) such as peripheral blood cell progenitor cell transplantation, engraftment failure or delay after bone marrow transplantation, and induction therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia.","Similarly, based on the observed effects of GM-CSF, PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs also may be useful in treatment of a wide variety of cancers such as breast cancer, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and ovarian cancer, by allowing chemotherapy dose intensification (Cebon and Lieschke 1994). Human GM-CSF also can be used to treat severe chronic neutropenia, for example in Felty syndrome (Joseph et al, 1991) or myelokathexis (Hess et al.), as well as aplastic anemia, and acute leukemia. Human GM-CSF (and therefore GM-CSF cysteine variants of the invention) also may be useful for reversing neutropenia associated with the human immunodeficiency virus infection, myelodysplastic syndrome and ideopathic neutropenia (Kaczmarski et al, 1993). Neutropenia resulting from other causes such as burns, surgery, dilatation, anemia and neonatal septicemia may also be treated by administration of PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs.","The ability of GM-CSF to enhance the functional properties of monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils suggests that PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs may have utility as an anti-neoplastic agent either alone or in combination with other anti-neoplastic agents such as cytotoxic drugs, chemotherapeutic agents, polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor cells (Armitage, 1998). GM-CSF administration may be useful in the treatment of prostate cancer (Small et al, 1999). GM-CSF monotherapy also has been reported to reduce melanoma metastases (Hoeller et al, 2001). GM-CSF also may be useful in the treatment of melanoma when co-administered with anti-neoplastic agents (Vaughan et al, 2000). The immunomodulatory properties of GM-CSF also suggest that PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs may have utility as an adjuvant for vaccines against tumors and infectious agents (Gaudernack and Gjertsen, 1999, Warren and Weiner, 2000). For example adjuvant therapy using GM-CSF may be useful in treatment of malignant melanoma (Spitler et al, 2000) following surgical resection. GM-CSF co-administration with a monoclonal antibody-based immunogen may be useful in the treatment of metastatic coleorectal cancer (Rucker et al. 1999). The immunomodulatory properties of GM-CSF indicate that PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs may also provide useful therapy for enhancing immune function in immunocompromised patients such as those infected with the HIV virus (Armitage, 1998). The immunomodulatory properties of GM-CSF indicate that PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs may also provide useful therapy against bacterial and fungal infections (Armitage, 1998; Jones, 1999).","GM-CSF also may be used to accelerate wound healing of surgical incisions (Jyung et al., 1994) and also to accelerate healing of refractory wounds or ulcers such as those of patients with diabetes Canturk et al, 1999) and PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs may also be used in these indications.","In some diseases, antagonists of GM-CSF activity could provide therapeutic benefit. For example there is evidence that rheumatoid arthritis is promoted by GM-CSF activity (Campbell et al, 1997; Bischof et al, 2000; Campbell et al., 1998; Yang and Hamilton, 2001) and an anti-GM-CSF antibody has been shown to reduce the severity of arthritis observed in a murine model (Cook et al, 2001). Therefore PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs that contain one or more additional mutations that result in GM-CSF antagonist activity could be used to treat arthritis. GM-CSF activity is similarly implicated in the development and progression of multiple sclerosis (McQualter et al., 2001) and PEGylated human GM-CSF cysteine analogs that contain one or more additional mutations that result in GM-CSF antagonist activity could be used to treat multiple sclerosis.","As discussed above, various embodiments of the invention relate to methods of use of GM-CSF cysteine muteins. In particular, the present invention relates to the use of these muteins to protect an animal from a disease or condition that is amenable to treatment by the use of wild-type GM-CSF or an antagonist thereof, or which might be particularly amenable to treatment using the GM-CSF cysteine muteins of the present invention.","As used herein, the phrase \u201cprotected from a disease\u201d refers to reducing the symptoms of the disease, reducing the occurrence of the disease, and\/or reducing the severity of the disease. Protecting an animal can refer to the ability of a therapeutic composition of the present invention, when administered to an animal, to prevent a disease from occurring and\/or to cure or to alleviate disease symptoms, signs or causes. As such, to protect an animal from a disease includes both preventing disease occurrence (prophylactic treatment) and treating an animal that has a disease or that is experiencing initial symptoms of a disease (therapeutic treatment). In particular, protecting an animal from a disease is accomplished by inducing a beneficial or protective therapeutic response in the animal by administration of a GM-CSF cysteine mutein of the present invention. The term, \u201cdisease\u201d refers to any deviation from the normal health of a mammal and includes a state when disease symptoms are present, as well as conditions in which a deviation (e.g., infection, gene mutation, genetic defect, etc.) has occurred, but symptoms are not yet manifested.","Accordingly, a GM-CSF cysteine mutein of the present invention can be administered to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into mature cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils. A GM-CSF cysteine mutein can also be administered to stimulate the functional properties of mature monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. A GM-CSF cysteine mutein, or antagonist thereof, can be administered to an animal to prevent or ameliorate any disease or condition for which the use of the wild-type protein, or antagonist thereof, respectively, can be used. Such diseases and conditions are described in detail above. In one embodiment, a GM-CSF cysteine mutein of the present invention is used as an anti-neoplastic agent either alone or in combination with other anti-neoplastic agents such as cytotoxic drugs, chemotherapeutic agents, polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor cells. In yet another embodiment, the GM-CSF cysteine mutein of the present invention is used as an adjuvant for vaccines against tumors and infectious agents.","Cysteine muteins of the present invention are preferably administered in a composition. Compositions can include a cysteine mutein of the invention and any other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, as well as, in some aspects, additional components that may be useful in the treatment of a give disease or condition. According to the present invention, a \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d includes pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable delivery vehicles, which are suitable for use in administration of the composition to a suitable in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo site. A suitable in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo site is preferably any site where the cysteine mutein will provide a detectable effect as compared to in the absence of the mutein, and includes a disease site or a site of cell types to be contacted with the mutein. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are capable of maintaining the mutein of the present invention in a form that, upon arrival of the mutein at the cell target in a culture or in patient, the mutein is capable of interacting with its target (e.g., hematopoeitic cell for GM-CSF).","Suitable excipients of the present invention include excipients or formularies that transport or help transport, but do not specifically target a composition to a cell or area (also referred to herein as non-targeting carriers). Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to water, phosphate buffered saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, serum-containing solutions, Hank's solution, other aqueous physiologically balanced solutions, oils, esters and glycols. Aqueous carriers can contain suitable auxiliary substances required to approximate the physiological conditions of the recipient, for example, by enhancing chemical stability and isotonicity. Compositions of the present invention can be sterilized by conventional methods and\/or lyophilized.","One type of pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes a controlled release formulation that is capable of slowly releasing a composition of the present invention into a patient or culture. As used herein, a controlled release formulation comprises a cysteine mutein of the present invention in a controlled release vehicle. Suitable controlled release vehicles include, but are not limited to, biocompatible polymers, other polymeric matrices, capsules, microcapsules, microparticles, bolus preparations, osmotic pumps, diffusion devices, liposomes, lipospheres, and transdermal delivery systems. Other carriers of the present invention include liquids that, upon administration to a patient, form a solid or a gel in situ. Preferred carriers are also biodegradable (i.e., bioerodible). In the event that a cysteine mutein of the invention is administered as a recombinant nucleic acid molecule encoding the cysteine mutein (e.g., gene therapy or genetic immunization), suitable carriers include, but are not limited to liposomes, viral vectors or other carriers, including ribozymes, gold particles, poly-L-lysine\/DNA-molecular conjugates, and artificial chromosomes. Natural lipid-containing carriers include cells and cellular membranes. Artificial lipid-containing carriers include liposomes and micelles.","A carrier of the present invention can be modified to target to a particular site in a patient, thereby targeting and making use of a compound of the present invention at that site. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is capable of targeting can also be referred to herein as a \u201cdelivery vehicle\u201d or \u201ctargeting carrier\u201d. Suitable modifications include manipulating the chemical formula of the lipid portion of the delivery vehicle and\/or introducing into the vehicle a targeting agent capable of specifically targeting a delivery vehicle to a preferred site or target site, for example, a preferred cell type. A \u201ctarget site\u201d refers to a site in a patient to which one desires to deliver a composition. Suitable targeting compounds include ligands capable of selectively (i.e., specifically) binding another molecule at a particular site. Examples of such ligands include antibodies, antigens, receptors and receptor ligands. Manipulating the chemical formula of the lipid portion of the delivery vehicle can modulate the extracellular or intracellular targeting of the delivery vehicle. For example, a chemical can be added to the lipid formula of a liposome that alters the charge of the lipid bilayer of the liposome so that the liposome fuses with particular cells having particular charge characteristics.","One delivery vehicle of the present invention is a liposome. A liposome is capable of remaining stable in an animal for a sufficient amount of time to deliver a nucleic acid molecule or protein described in the present invention to a preferred site in the animal. A liposome, according to the present invention, comprises a lipid composition that is capable of delivering a nucleic acid molecule or protein to a particular, or selected, site in a patient. A liposome according to the present invention comprises a lipid composition that is capable of fusing with the plasma membrane of the targeted cell to deliver a nucleic acid molecule or protein into a cell. Suitable liposomes for use with the present invention include any liposome. Preferred liposomes of the present invention include those liposomes commonly used in, for example, gene delivery methods known to those of skill in the art. More preferred liposomes comprise liposomes having a polycationic lipid composition and\/or liposomes having a cholesterol backbone conjugated to polyethylene glycol. Complexing a liposome with a nucleic acid molecule or protein of the present invention can be achieved using methods standard in the art.","Another type of delivery vehicle, when the cysteine mutein is administered as a nucleic acid encoding the mutein, comprises a viral vector. A viral vector includes an isolated nucleic acid molecule, in which the nucleic acid molecules are packaged in a viral coat that allows entrance of DNA into a cell. A number of viral vectors can be used, including, but not limited to, those based on alphaviruses, poxviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses, lentiviruses, adeno-associated viruses and retroviruses.","According to the present invention, an effective administration protocol (i.e., administering a therapeutic composition in an effective manner) comprises suitable dose parameters and modes of administration that result in the desired effect in the patient (e.g., stimulation of proliferation and\/or differentiation of neutrophils), preferably so that the patient is protected from the disease (e.g., by disease prevention or by alleviating one or more symptoms of ongoing disease). Effective dose parameters can be determined using methods standard in the art for a particular disease. Such methods include, for example, determination of survival rates, side effects (i.e., toxicity) and progression or regression of disease.","In accordance with the present invention, a suitable single dose size is a dose that results in the desired therapeutic effect in the patient, depending o the cysteine mutein that is administered, or in the amelioration of at least one symptom of a condition in the patient, when administered one or more times over a suitable time period. Doses can vary depending upon the disease being treated. One of skill in the art can readily determine appropriate single dose sizes for a given patient based on the size of a patient and the route of administration.","In one aspect of the invention, a suitable single dose of a therapeutic composition of the present invention is an amount that, when administered by any route of administration, provides a therapeutic effect in the patient as described above, as compared to a patient which has not been administered with the therapeutic composition of the present invention (i.e., a control patient), as compared to the patient prior to administration of the composition, or as compared to a standard established for the particular disease, patient type and composition.","In one aspect of the invention an appropriate single dose of a cysteine mutein of the present invention is at least about 0.01 \u03bcg per kg of the animal to which the mutein is administered, and in other aspects, at least about 0.1 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 0.2 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 0.5 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 1 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 5 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 10 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 25 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 50 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 75 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 100 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 200 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 300 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 400 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 500 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 750 \u03bcg\/kg, at least about 1 mg\/kg, or at least about 5 mg\/kg. In one embodiment, a preferred single dose of a GM-CSF cysteine mutein of the present invention is at least about 0.1 \u03bcg\/kg, and more preferably, from about 25 to about 300 \u03bcg\/kg.","As discussed above, a therapeutic composition of the present invention is administered to a patient in a manner effective to deliver the composition to a cell, a tissue, and\/or systemically to the patient, whereby the desired result is achieved as a result of the administration of the composition. Suitable administration protocols include any in vivo or ex vivo administration protocol. The preferred routes of administration will be apparent to those of skill in the art, depending on the type of condition to be prevented or treated; whether the composition is nucleic acid based or protein based; and\/or the target cell\/tissue. For proteins or nucleic acid molecules, preferred methods of in vivo administration include, but are not limited to, intravenous administration, intraperitoneal administration, intramuscular administration, intranodal administration, intracoronary administration, intraarterial administration (e.g., into a carotid artery), subcutaneous administration, transdermal delivery, intratracheal administration, subcutaneous administration, intraarticular administration, intraventricular administration, inhalation (e.g., aerosol), intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, intranasal, oral, bronchial, rectal, topical, vaginal, urethral, pulmonary administration, impregnation of a catheter, and direct injection into a tissue. Routes useful for deliver to mucosal tissues include, bronchial, intradermal, intramuscular, intranasal, other inhalatory, rectal, subcutaneous, topical, transdermal, vaginal and urethral routes. Combinations of routes of delivery can be used and in some instances, may enhance the therapeutic effects of the composition. Particularly preferred routes of delivery include subcutaneous and intravenous delivery.","Ex vivo administration refers to performing part of the regulatory step outside of the patient, such as administering a composition of the present invention to a population of cells removed from a patient under conditions such that the composition contacts and\/or enters the cell, and returning the cells to the patient. Ex vivo methods are particularly suitable when the target cell type can easily be removed from and returned to the patient.","Many of the above-described routes of administration, including intravenous, intraperitoneal, intradermal, and intramuscular administrations can be performed using methods standard in the art. Aerosol (inhalation) delivery can also be performed using methods standard in the art (see, for example, Stribling et al., 189:11277-11281, 1992, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Oral delivery can be performed by complexing a therapeutic composition of the present invention to a carrier capable of withstanding degradation by digestive enzymes in the gut of an animal Examples of such carriers, include plastic capsules or tablets, such as those known in the art.","One method of local administration is by direct injection. Direct injection techniques are particularly useful for administering a composition to a cell or tissue that is accessible by surgery, and particularly, on or near the surface of the body. Administration of a composition locally within the area of a target cell refers to injecting the composition centimeters and preferably, millimeters from the target cell or tissue.","Various methods of administration and delivery vehicles disclosed herein have been shown to be effective for delivery of a nucleic acid molecule to a target cell, whereby the nucleic acid molecule transfected the cell and was expressed. In many studies, successful delivery and expression of a heterologous gene was achieved in preferred cell types and\/or using preferred delivery vehicles and routes of administration of the present invention. All of the publications discussed below and elsewhere herein with regard to gene delivery and delivery vehicles are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","For example, using liposome delivery, U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,151, issued Jan. 6, 1998, to Dow et al. demonstrated the successful in vivo intravenous delivery of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a superantigen and a nucleic acid molecule encoding a cytokine in a cationic liposome delivery vehicle, whereby the encoded proteins were expressed in tissues of the animal, and particularly in pulmonary tissues. In addition, Liu et al., 15:167, 1997, demonstrated that intravenous delivery of cholesterol-containing cationic liposomes containing genes preferentially targets pulmonary tissues and effectively mediates transfer and expression of the genes in vivo. Several publications by Dzau and collaborators demonstrate the successful in vivo delivery and expression of a gene into cells of the heart, including cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells using both naked DNA and Hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome delivery, administered by both incubation within the pericardium and infusion into a coronary artery (intracoronary delivery) (See, for example, Aoki et al., 199729:949-959; Kaneda et al., 1997811:299-308; and von der Leyen et al., 199592:1137-1141).","Delivery of numerous nucleic acid sequences has been accomplished by administration of viral vectors encoding the nucleic acid sequences. Using such vectors, successful delivery and expression has been achieved using ex vivo delivery (See, of many examples, retroviral vector; Blaese et al., 1995270:475-480; Bordignon et al., 1995270:470-475), nasal administration (CFTR-adenovirus-associated vector), intracoronary administration (adenoviral vector and Hemagglutinating virus of Japan, see above), intravenous administration (adeno-associated viral vector; Koeberl et al., 199794:1426-1431). A publication by Maurice et al. (1999104:21-29) demonstrated that an adenoviral vector encoding a \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, administered by intracoronary delivery, resulted in diffuse multichamber myocardial expression of the gene in vivo, and subsequent significant increases in hemodynamic function and other improved physiological parameters. Levine et al. describe in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo delivery and expression of a gene to human adipocytes and rabbit adipocytes using an adenoviral vector and direct injection of the constructs into adipose tissue (Levine et al., 199844:569-572).","In the area of neuronal gene delivery, multiple successful in vivo gene transfers have been reported. Millecamps et al. reported the targeting of adenoviral vectors to neurons using neuron restrictive enhancer elements placed upstream of the promoter for the transgene (phosphoglycerate promoter). Such vectors were administered to mice and rats intramuscularly and intracerebrally, respectively, resulting in successful neuronal-specific transfection and expression of the transgene in vivo (Millecamps et al., 199917:865-869). As discussed above, Bennett et al. reported the use of adeno-associated viral vector to deliver and express a gene by subretinal injection in the neural retina in vivo for greater than 1 year (Bennett, 1999, ibid.).","Gene delivery to synovial lining cells and articular joints has had similar successes. Oligino and colleagues report the use of a herpes simplex viral vector which is deficient for the immediate early genes, ICP4, 22 and 27, to deliver and express two different receptors in synovial lining cells in vivo (Oligino et al., 19996:1713-1720). The herpes vectors were administered by intraarticular injection. Kuboki et al. used adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer and intraarticular injection to successfully and specifically express a gene in the temporomandibular joints of guinea pigs in vivo (Kuboki et al., 199944:701-709). Apparailly and colleagues systemically administered adenoviral vectors encoding IL-10 to mice and demonstrated successful expression of the gene product and profound therapeutic effects in the treatment of experimentally induced arthritis (Apparailly et al., 1998160:5213-5220). In another study, murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector was used to deliver (by intraarticular injection) and express a human growth hormone gene both ex vivo and in vivo (Ghivizzani et al., 19974:977-982). This study showed that expression by in vivo gene transfer was at least equivalent to that of the ex vivo gene transfer. As discussed above, Sawchuk et al. has reported successful in vivo adenoviral vector delivery of a gene by intraarticular injection, and prolonged expression of the gene in the synovium by pretreatment of the joint with anti-T cell receptor monoclonal antibody (Sawchuk et al., 1996, ibid. Finally, it is noted that ex vivo gene transfer of human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist using a retrovirus has produced high level intraarticular expression and therapeutic efficacy in treatment of arthritis, and is now entering FDA approved human gene therapy trials (Evans and Robbins, 19968:230-234). Therefore, the state of the art in gene therapy has led the FDA to consider human gene therapy an appropriate strategy for the treatment of at least arthritis. Taken together, all of the above studies in gene therapy indicate that delivery and expression of a recombinant nucleic acid molecule according to the present invention is feasible.","Another method of delivery of recombinant molecules is in a non-targeting carrier (e.g., as \u201cnaked\u201d DNA molecules, such as is taught, for example in Wolff et al., 1990247, 1465-1468). Such recombinant nucleic acid molecules are typically injected by direct or intramuscular administration. Recombinant nucleic acid molecules to be administered by naked DNA administration include an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, and preferably includes a recombinant molecule of the present invention that preferably is replication, or otherwise amplification, competent. A naked nucleic acid reagent of the present invention can comprise one or more nucleic acid molecules of the present invention including a dicistronic recombinant molecule. Naked nucleic acid delivery can include intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, transdermal, intranasal and oral routes of administration, with direct injection into the target tissue being most preferred. A preferred single dose of a naked nucleic acid vaccine ranges from about 1 nanogram (ng) to about 100 \u03bcg, depending on the route of administration and\/or method of delivery, as can be determined by those skilled in the art. Suitable delivery methods include, for example, by injection, as drops, aerosolized and\/or topically. In one embodiment, pure DNA constructs cover the surface of gold particles (1 to 3 \u03bcm in diameter) and are propelled into skin cells or muscle with a \u201cgene gun.\u201d","In the method of the present invention, compositions can be administered to any animal and preferably, to any member of the Vertebrate class, Mammalia, including, without limitation, primates, rodents, livestock and domestic pets. Livestock include mammals to be consumed or that produce useful products (e.g., sheep for wool production). Preferred mammals to protect include humans, dogs, cats, mice, rats, sheep, cattle, horses and pigs, with humans being particularly preferred.","The following examples are provided to demonstrate how the \u201crules\u201d described herein can be used to create cysteine-added variants of GH, erythropoietin, alpha interferon, beta interferon, G-CSF, GM-CSF and other members of the GH supergene family. The examples also demonstrate the therapeutic uses of cysteine variants of the present invention. The examples are not intended to be limiting, but only exemplary of specific embodiments of the invention.","This example discloses certain amino acids in GH that are non-essential for biological activity and which, when mutated to cysteine residues, will not alter the normal disulfide binding pattern and overall conformation of the molecule. These amino acids are located at the N-terminal end of the A-B loop (amino acids 34-52 of the mature protein sequence; SEQ ID NO: 1; Martial et al 1979; Goeddel et al 1979), the B-C loop (amino acids 97-105 in the mature protein sequence), and the C-D loop (amino acids 130-153 in the mature protein sequence). Also identified as preferred sites for introducing cysteine residues are the first three or last three amino acids in the A, B, C and D helices and the amino acids proximal to helix A (amino acids 1-5) and distal to helix D (amino acids 184-191). Helix A encompasses amino acids 6-33, helix B encompasses amino acids 75-96, helix C encompasses amino acids 106-129 and helix D encompasses amino acids 154-183. The entire A-B loop encompasses amino acids 34-74.","DNA sequences encoding wild type GH can be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction technique from commercially available single-stranded cDNA prepared from human pituitaries (ClonTech, San Diego, Calif.) or assembled using overlapping oligonucleotides. Specific mutations can be introduced into the GH sequence using a variety of procedures such as phage techniques (Kunkel et al 1987), PCR mutagenesis techniques (Innis et al 1990; White 1993) mutagenesis kits such as those sold by Stratagene (\u201cQuick-Change Mutagenesis\u201d kit, San Diego, Calif.) or Promega (Gene Editor Kit, Madison Wis.).","Cysteine substitutions can be introduced into any of the amino acids comprising the B-C loop, C-D loop and N-terminal end of the A-B loop or into the first three amino acids of the alpha helical regions that adjoin these regions. or in the region proximal to helix A or distal to helix D. Preferred sites for introduction of cysteine residues are: F1, T3, P5, E33, A34, K38, E39, Q40, S43, Q46, N47, P48, Q49, T50, S51, S55, T60, A98, N99, S100, G104, A105, S106, E129, D130, G131, S132, P133, T135, G136, Q137, K140, Q141, T142, S144, K145, D147, T148, N149, S150, H151, N152, D153, S184, E186, G187, S188, and G190. Cysteine residues also can be introduced at the beginning of the mature protein, i.e., proximal to the F1 amino acid, or following the last amino acid in the mature protein, i.e., following F191. If desirable, two or more such mutations can be readily combined in the same protein either by in vitro DNA recombination of cloned mutant genes and\/or sequential construction of individual desired mutations.","1. Cloning the Gene for Human Growth Hormone (GH)","The human GH gene was amplified from human pituitary single-stranded cDNA (commercially available from CLONTECH, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and primers BB1 and BB2. The sequence of BB1 is 5\u2032-GGGGGTCGACCATATGTTCCCAACCATTCCCTTATCCAG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 24). The sequence of BB2 is 5\u2032-GGGGGATCCTCACTAGAAGCCACAGCTGCCCTC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 25). Primer BB1 was designed to encode an initiator methionine preceding the first amino acid of mature GH, phenylalanine, and SalI and NdeI sites for cloning purposes. The reverse primer, BB2, contains a BamHI site for cloning purposes. The PCR 100 microliter reactions contained 20 pmoles of each oligonucleotide primer, 1\u00d7PCR buffer (Perkin-Elmer buffer containing MgCl), 200 micromolar concentration of each of the four nucleotides dA, dC, dG and dT, 2 ng of single-stranded cDNA, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, Inc). The PCR reaction conditions were 96\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, 35 cycles of (95\u00b0 C., 1 minute; 63\u00b0 C. for 30 seconds; 72\u00b0 C. for 1 minute), followed by 10 minutes at 72\u00b0 C. The thermocycler employed was the Amplitron II Thermal Cycler (Thermolyne). The approximate 600 bp PCR product was digested with SalI and BamHI, gel purified and cloned into similarly digested plasmid pUC19 (commercially available from New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass.). The ligation mixture was transformed into strain DH5alpha and transformants selected on LB plates containing ampicillin. Several colonies were grown overnight in LB media and plasmid DNA isolated using miniplasmid DNA isolation kits purchased from Qiagen, Inc (Valencia, Calif.). Clone LB6 was determined to have the correct DNA sequence.","For expression in , clone LB6 was digested with NdeI and EcoRI, the approximate 600 bp fragment gel-purified, and cloned into plasmid pCYB1 (commercially available from New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass.) that had been digested with the same enzymes and phosphatased. The ligation mixture was transformed into DH5alpha and transformants selected on LB ampicillin plates.

Construction of Pst-pUC19","To facilitate mutagenesis of the cloned GH gene for construction of selected cysteine substitution and insertion mutations a derivative of the plasmid pUC19 (New England BioLabs) lacking a Pst I site was constructed as follows. pUC19 plasmid DNA was digested with Pst I and subsequently treated at 75 deg. C. with PFU DNA Polymerase (Stratagene) using the vendor-supplied reaction buffer supplemented with 200 uM dNTPs. Under these conditions the polymerase will digest the 3\u2032 single-stranded overhang created by Pst I digestion but will not digest into the double-stranded region. The net result will be the deletion of the 4 single-stranded bases which comprise the middle four bases of the Pst I recognition site. The resulting molecule has double-stranded, i.e., \u201cblunt\u201d, ends. Following these enzymatic reactions, the linear monomer was gel-purified using the Qiaex II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Inc). This purified DNA was treated with T4 DNA Ligase (New England BioLabs) according to the vendor protocols, digested with Pst I, and used to transform DH5alpha. Transformants were picked and analyzed by restriction digestion with Pst I and Bam H1. One of the transformants which was not cleaved by Pst I but was cleaved at the nearby Bam H1 site was picked and designated pBBT108.","5.

Typically PCR primer oligonucleotides are designed to incorporate nucleotide changes to the coding sequence of GH that result in substitution of a cysteine residue for an amino acid at a specific position within the protein. Such mutagenic oligonucleotide primers can also be designed to incorporate an additional cysteine residue at the carboxy terminus or amino terminus of the coding sequence of GH. In this latter case one or more additional amino acid residues could also be incorporated at the amino terminal and\/or carboxy terminal to the added cysteine residue if that were desirable. Moreover, oligonucleotides can be designed to incorporate cysteine residues as insertion mutations at specific positions within the GH coding sequence if that were desirable. Again, one or more additional amino acids could be inserted along with the cysteine residue and these amino acids could be positioned at the amino terminal and\/or carboxy terminal to the cysteine residue.","The cysteine substitution mutation T135C was constructed as follows.

The choice of sequences for mutagenic oligonucleotides will be dictated by the position where the desired cysteine residue is to be placed and the propinquity of useful restriction endonuclease sites. Generally, it is desirable to place the mutation, i.e., the mismatched segment near the middle of the oligonucleotide to enhance the annealing of the oligonucleotide to the template. Appropriate annealing temperatures for any oligonucleotide can be determined empirically. It is also desirable for the mutagenic oligonucleotide to span a unique restriction site so that the PCR product can be cleaved to generate a fragment that can be readily cloned into a suitable vector, e.g., one that can be used to express the mutein or provides convenient restriction sites for excising the mutated gene and readily cloning it into such an expression vector. Sometimes mutation sites and restriction sites are separated by distances that are greater than that which is desirable for synthesis of synthetic oligonucleotides: it is generally desirable to keep such oligonucleotides under 80 bases in length and lengths of 30-40 bases are more preferable.","In instances where this is not possible, genes targeted for mutagenesis could be re-engineered or re-synthesized to incorporate restriction sites at appropriate positions. Alternatively, variations of PCR mutagenesis protocols employed above, such as the so-called \u201cMegaprimer Method\u201d (Barik, S., pp. 277-286 in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 15: PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications edited by B. A. White, 1993, Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, N.J.) or \u201cGene Splicing by Overlap Extension\u201d (Horton, R. M., pp. 251-261, in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 15: PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications, edited by B. A. White, 1993, Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, N.J.) can also be employed to construct such mutations.","6. Expression of GH in pCYB1","To express GH in , pBBT120 (GH gene with no leader sequence cloned into the tac expression vector pCYB1) and pBBT114 (GH gene with stII leader sequence cloned into the tac expression vector pCYB1) were transformed into strains JM109 and W3110. The parental vector pCYB1 was also transformed into JM109 and W3110.","These strains were given the following designations:","BOB119: JM109 (pCYB1)","BOB130: W3110 (pCYB1)","BOB129: JM109 (pBBT120)","BOB133: W3110 (pBBT120)","BOB121: JM109 (pBBT114)","BOB132: W3110 (pBBT114)","For expression, strains were grown overnight at 37\u00b0 C. in Luria Broth (LB) (Sambrook, et al 1989) containing 100 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin. These saturated overnight cultures were diluted to \u02dc0.03 OD at Ain LB containing 100 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in shake flasks in rotary shaker, typically at 250-300 rpm. ODs were monitored and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM when culture ODs reached \u02dc0.25-0.5, typically between 0.3 and 0.4. Cultures were sampled typically at 1, 3, 5 and \u02dc16 h post-induction. The \u201c\u02dc16 h\u201d time points represented overnight incubation of the cultures and exact times varied from \u02dc15-20 h. Samples of induced and uninduced cultures were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1\u00d7 sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% sodium lauryl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) with the addition of 1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol when desirable. Samples were boiled for \u02dc10 minutes or heated to 95\u00b0 C. for \u02dc10 minutes. Samples were cooled to room temperature before being loaded onto SDS polyacrylamide gels or were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. if not run immediately. Samples were run on precast 15% polyacrylamide \u201cReady Gels\u201d (Bio-Rad, Hercules Calif.) using a Ready Gel Cell electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the vendor protocols. Typically gels were run at 200 volts for \u02dc35-45 minutes. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or were analyzed by Western Blot following electro-blotting. Coomassie staining of whole cell lysates from strains BOB 129, BOB 133, BOB 121 and BOB 132 showed a band of \u02dc22 kD that co-migrated with purified recombinant human GH standard purchased from Research Diagnostics Inc (Flanders, N.J.). That band was most prominent in induced cultures following overnight induction. However, a band was also observed at that molecular weight in uninduced cultures of these same strains and could also be observed with and without induction in the BOB 119 and BOB 130 control strains that carried the expression vector pCYB1 lacking the GH gene. To clarify this observation, Western Blot analyses were performed on whole cell lysates of induced cultures of strains BOB119, BOB130, BOB129, BOB133, BOB121, and BOB132. Western blots were performed with polyclonal rabbit anti-human GH antiserum purchased from United States Biological; catalogue #G 9000-11 (Swampscott, Mass.) This primary antibody was used at a 1:5000 dilution and its binding was detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, (product #31341) purchased from Pierce (Rockford, Ill.). This secondary antibody was used at a 1:10,0000 dilution Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using the ImmunoPure\u00ae Fast Red TR\/AS-MX Substrate Kit (Pierce, Rockford Ill.) according to the vendor protocols. The Western Blots clearly demonstrated presence of GH in lysates of induced cultures of BOB129, BOB133, BOB121, and BOB132 at both 3 and 16 h post-induction. In the induced culture of control strains, BOB119 and BOB130, no GH was detected by Western blot at 3 or 16 h post-induction time points.","In these preliminary experiments, the highest yields of GH were obtained from BOB132 W3110(pBBT114) in which the GH gene is fused downstream of the stII secretion signal sequence. This strain was tested further to determine if the GH protein was secreted to the periplasm as would be expected. An induced culture of BOB132 was prepared as described above and subjected to osmotic shock according to the procedure of Koshland and Botstein (Cell 20 (1980) pp. 749-760). This procedure ruptures the outer membrane and releases the contents of the periplasm into the surrounding medium. Subsequent centrifugation separates the periplasmic contents, present in the supernatant from the remainder of the cell-associated components. In this experiment, the bulk of the GH synthesized by BOB132 was found to be localized to the periplasm. This result is consistent with the finding that the bulk of the total GH is also indistinguishable in size from the purified GH standard, which indicated that the stII signal sequence had been removed. This is indicative of secretion. A larger scale (500 ml) culture of BOB132 was also induced, cultured overnight and subjected to osmotic shock according to the procedure described by Hsiung et al, 1986 (Bio\/Technology 4, pp. 991-995). Gel analysis again demonstrated that the bulk of the GH produced was soluble, periplasmic, and indistinguishable in size from the GH standard. This material could also be quantitatively bound to, and eluted from, a Q-Sepharose column using conditions very similar to those described for recombinant human GH by Becker and Hsiung, 1986 (FEBS Lett 204 pp 145-150).","7.

The approximate 1.9 kb PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into the BamHI and XhoI cloning sites of pcDNA3.1 (+). Only infrequent transformants from this ligation contained the cloned GH receptor cDNA and all of those were found to contain deletions of segments of the receptor coding sequence. One of these clones was sequenced and found to contain a deletion of 135 bp within the GH receptor coding sequence: the sequence of the rest of the gene was in agreement with that reported by Leung et at (1987).","8. Cloning the Rabbit GH Receptor","The rabbit GH receptor was cloned by PCR using forward primer BB3 (described above) and reverse primer BB36. BB36 has the sequence 5\u2032 CCCCGTCGACTCTAGAGCCATTAGATACAAAGCTCTTGGG3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 41) and contains XbaI and Sal I restriction sites for cloning purposes. Rabbit liver poly(A) mRNA was purchased from CLONTECH, Inc. and used as the substrate in first strand synthesis of single-stranded cDNA to produce template for PCR amplification. First strand synthesis of single-stranded cDNA was accomplished using a 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-PCR (AMV) kit from Boehringer Mannheim Corp (Indianapolis, Ind.) according to the vendor protocols. Parallel first strand cDNA syntheses were performed using random hexamers or BB36 as the primer. Subsequent PCR reactions with the products of the first strand syntheses as templates, were carried out with primers BB3 and BB36 according to the 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-PCR (AMV) kit protocol and using 2.5 units of Amplitac DNA Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and 0.625 units of Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR reaction conditions were 96\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, 35 cycles of (95\u00b0 C., 1 minute; 58\u00b0 C. for 30 seconds; 72\u00b0 C. for 2 minutes), followed by 10 minutes at 72\u00b0 C. The thermocycler employed was the Amplitron II Thermal Cycler (Thermolyne). The expected \u02dc1.9 kb PCR product was observed in PCR reactions using random hexamer-primed or BB36 primed cDNA as template. The random hexamer-primed cDNA was used in subsequent cloning experiments. It was digested with Bam H1 and XbaI and run out over a 1.2% agarose gel. This digest generates two fragments (\u02dc365 bp and \u02dc1600 bp) because the rabbit GH receptor gene contains an internal Bam H1 site. Both fragments were gel-purified. Initially the \u02dc1600 bp Bam H1-XbaI fragment was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) which had been digested with these same two enzymes. These clones were readily obtained at reasonable frequencies and showed no evidence of deletions as determined by restriction digests and subsequent sequencing. To generate a full length clone, one of the plasmids containing the 1600 bp Bam H1-Xba I fragment (pcDNA3.1(+):: rab-ghr-2A) was digested with Bam H1, treated with Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (Promega) according to the vendor protocols, gel-purified and ligated with the gel purified \u02dc365 bp Bam H1 fragment that contains the 5\u2032 portion of the rabbit GH receptor gene. Transformants from this ligation were picked and analyzed by restriction digestion and PCR to confirm the presence of the \u02dc365 bp fragment and to determine its orientation relative to the distal segment of the rabbit GH receptor gene. Three out of four clones analyzed were found to contain the \u02dc365 bp fragment cloned in the correct orientation for reconstitution of the rabbit GH receptor gene. The lack of complications in the cloning in of the rabbit gene, in contrast to the human gene, is consistent with the results of Leung et al (1987) who also readily obtained full length cDNA clones for the rabbit GH receptor gene but were unable to clone a full length cDNA of the human gene in . The rabbit GH receptor can be employed in assays with human GH as a ligand as it has been shown that the human GH binds the rabbit receptor with high affinity (Leung et al 1987). Plasmids containing the cloned rabbit GH receptor should be sequenced to identify a rabbit GH receptor cDNA with the correct sequence before use.","9. Construction of a Human\/Rabbit Chimeric GH Receptor Gene","As an alternative to the rabbit receptor, a chimeric receptor could be constructed which combines the extracellular domain of the human receptor with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the rabbit receptor. Such a chimeric receptor could be constructed by recombining the human and rabbit genes at the unique Nco I site that is present in each (Leung et al 1987). Such a recombinant, containing the human gene segment located 5\u2032 to, or \u201cupstream\u201d of the Nco I site and the rabbit gene segment 3\u2032 to, or \u201cdownstream\u201d of the Nco I site would encode a chimeric receptor of precisely the desired type, having the extracellular domain of the human receptor with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the rabbit receptor. This would allow analysis of the interaction of GH, GH muteins, and PEGylated GH muteins with the natural receptor binding site but could avoid the necessity of cloning the full length human GH receptor in ","The GH muteins can be expressed in a variety of expression systems such as bacteria, yeast or insect cells. Vectors for expressing GH muteins in these systems are available commercially from a number of suppliers such as Novagen, Inc. (pET15b for expression in ), New England Biolabs (pC4B1 for expression in ) Invitrogen (pVL1392, pVL1393, and pMELBAC for expression in insect cells using Baculovirus vectors, vectors for expression in yeast cells, and pcDNA3 for expression in mammalian cells). GH has been successfully produced in as a cytoplasmic protein and as a secreted, periplasmic, protein using the OmpA or STII signal sequences to promote secretion of the protein into the periplasmic space (Chang et al., 1987; Hsiung et al., 1986). It is preferable that the GH muteins are expressed as secreted proteins so that they do not contain an N-terminal methionine residue, which is not present in the natural human protein. For expression in , DNA sequences encoding GH or GH muteins can be cloned into expression vectors such as pET15b that uses the strong T7 promoter or pCYB1 that uses the TAC promoter. Adding IPTG (isopropylthiogalactopyranoside, available form Sigma Chemical Company) to the growth media, can induce expression of the protein. Recombinant GH will be secreted into the periplasmic space from which it can be released by, and subsequently purified, following osmotic shock (Becker and Hsiung, 1986). The protein can be purified further using other chromatographic methods such as ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, size-exclusion and reversed phase chromatography, all of which are well known to those of skill in the art (e.g., see Becker and Hsiung, 1986). Protein concentrations can be determined using commercially available protein assay kits such as those sold by BioRad Laboratories (Richmond, Calif.). If the GH proteins are insoluble when expressed in they can be refolded using procedures well known to those skilled in the art (see Cox et al., 1994 and World patent applications WO9422466 and WO9412219).","Alternatively, the proteins can be expressed in insect cells as secreted proteins. The expression plasmid can be modified to contain the GH signal sequence to promote secretion of the protein into the medium. The cDNAs can be cloned into commercially available vectors, e.g., pVL1392 from Invitrogen, Inc., and used to infect insect cells. The GH and GH muteins can be purified from conditioned media using conventional chromatography procedures. Antibodies to rhGH can be used in conjunction with Western blots to localize fractions containing the GH proteins during chromatography. Alternatively, fractions containing GH can be identified using ELISA assays.","The cysteine-added GH variants also can be expressed as intracellular or secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells such as yeast, insect cells or mammalian cells. Vectors for expressing the proteins and methods for performing such experiments are described in catalogues from various commercial supply companies such as Invitrogen, Inc., Stratagene, Inc. and ClonTech, Inc. The GH and GH muteins can be purified using conventional chromatography procedures.","Biological activity of the GH muteins can be measured using a cell line that proliferates in response to GH. Fuh et al. (1992) created a GH-responsive cell line by stably transforming a myeloid leukemia cell line, FDC-P1, with a chimeric receptor comprising the extracellular domain of the rabbit GH receptor fused to the mouse G-CSF receptor. This cell line proliferates in response to GH with a half maximal effective concentration (EC) of 20 picomolar. A similar cell line can be constructed using the published sequences of these receptors and standard molecular biology techniques (Fuh et al., 1992). Alternatively, the extracellular domain of the human GH receptor can be fused to the mouse G-CSF receptor using the published sequences of these receptors and standard molecular biology techniques. Transformed cells expressing the chimeric receptor can be identified by flow cytometry using labeled GH, by the ability of transformed cells to bind radiolabeled GH, or by the ability of transformed cells to proliferate in response to added GH. Purified GH and GH muteins can be tested in cell proliferation assays using cells expressing the chimeric receptor to measure specific activities of the proteins. Cells can be plated in 96-well dishes with various concentrations of GH or GH muteins. After 18 h, cells are treated for 4 hours with H-thymidine and harvested for determination of incorporated radioactivity. The ECcan be determined for each mutein. Assays should be performed at least three times for each mutein using triplicate wells for each data point. GH muteins displaying similar optimal levels of stimulation and ECvalues comparable to or greater than wild type GH are preferable.","GH muteins that retain in vitro activity can be PEGylated using a cysteine-reactive 8 kDa PEG-maleimide (or PEG-vinylsulfone) commercially available from Shearwater, Inc. Generally, methods for PEGylating the proteins with these reagents will be similar to those described in world patent applications WO 9412219 and WO 9422466 and PCT application US95\/06540, with minor modifications. The recombinant proteins must be partially reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT) in order to achieve optimal PEGylation of the free cysteine. Although the free cysteine is not involved in a disulfide bond, it is relatively unreactive to cysteine-reactive PEGs unless this partial reduction step is performed. The amount of DTT required to partially reduce each mutein can be determined empirically, using a range of DTT concentrations. Typically, a 5-10 fold molar excess of DTT for 30 min at room temperature is sufficient. Partial reduction can be detected by a slight shift in the elution profile of the protein from a reversed-phase column Care must be taken not to over-reduce the protein and expose additional cysteine residues. Over-reduction can be detected by reversed phase-HPLC (the protein will have a retention time similar to the fully reduced and denatured protein) and by the appearance of GH molecules containing two PEGs (detectable by a molecular weight change on SDS-PAGE). Wild type GH can serve as a control since it should not PEGylate under similar conditions. Excess DTT can be removed by size exclusion chromatography using spin columns. The partially reduced protein can be reacted with various concentrations of PEG-maleimide (PEG: protein molar ratios of 1:1, 5:1, 10:1 and 50:1) to determine the optimum ratio of the two reagents. PEGylation of the protein can be monitored by a molecular weight shift using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The lowest amount of PEG that gives significant quantities of mono-pegylated product without giving di-pegylated product will be considered optimum (80% conversion to mono-pegylated product is considered good). Generally, mono-PEGylated protein can be purified from non-PEGylated protein and unreacted PEG by size-exclusion or ion exchange chromatography. The purified PEGylated protein can be tested in the cell proliferation assay described above to determine its specific activity.","The above experiments will allow identification of amino acids in the B-C loop, C-D loop or N-terminal end of the A-B loop in GH that can be changed to cysteine residues, PEGylated and retain in vitro biological activity. These muteins can be tested in animal disease models well known in the art.","Experiments can be performed to confirm that the PEG molecule is attached to the protein at the proper site. This can be accomplished by proteolytic digestion of the protein, purification of the PEG peptide (which will have a large molecular weight) by size exclusion, ion exchange or reversed phase chromatography, followed by amino acid sequencing or mass spectroscopy. The PEG-coupled amino acid will appear as a blank in the amino acid sequencing run.","The pharmacokinetic properties of the PEG-GH proteins can be determined as follows, or as described in world patent application WO9422466. Pairs of rats or mice can receive an intravenous bolus injection of the test proteins. Circulating levels of the proteins are measured over the course of 24 h by removing a small sample of blood from the animals at desired time points. Circulating levels of the test proteins can be quantitated using ELISA assays. Additional experiments can be performed using the subcutaneous route to administer the proteins. Similar experiments should be performed with the non-PEGylated protein to serve as a control. These experiments will reveal whether attachment of a PEG reagent to the protein alters its pharmacokinetic properties. Covalent modification of the protein with PEG should increase the protein's circulating half-life relative to the unPEGylated protein. Larger PEG molecules and\/or attachment of multiple PEG molecules should lengthen the circulating half-life longer than smaller PEG molecules.","PEG-GH proteins can be tested in rodent models of growth hormone deficiency (Cox et al., 1994) and cachexia (Tomas et al., 1992; Read et al., 1992) to determine optimum dosing schedules and demonstrate efficacy. These studies can explore different size PEG molecules, e.g., 8 and 20 kDa, and dosing schedules to determine the optimum PEG size and dosing schedule. It is expected that the larger PEG molecule will increase the circulating half-life greater than the smaller PEG molecule and will require less frequent dosing. However, large proteins potentially may have reduced volumes of distribution in vivo; thus, it is possible a 20 kDa PEG attached to GH will limit bioavailability, reducing its efficacy. Rodent models will allow determination of whether this is the case. Once the optimum dosing schedules and PEG sizes are determined, the efficacy of PEG-GH to GH can be compared in the animal models. While all PEG-GH proteins having GH activity are included in the invention, the preferred PEG-GH proteins are those that enhance growth equal or superior to GH, but which can be given less frequently. PEG-GH should be more efficacious than GH when both are administered using the less frequent dosing schedules.","One GH deficiency model that can be used is a hypophysectomized rat. GH stimulates body weight gain and bone and cartilage growth in this model (Cox et al., 1994). Hypophysectomized rats can be purchased from Charles River. Rats can be injected with GH, PEG-GH or placebo and weight gain measured daily over a 10-14 day period. At time of sacrifice, tibial epiphysis width can be determined as a measure of bone growth. Experimental methods for performing these studies are described in Cox et al. (1994).","The efficacy of PEG-GH in rodent cachexia models can be tested in a similar manner. Daily administration of dexamethasone, via osmotic pumps or subcutaneous injection, can be used to induce weight loss (Tomas et al., 1992; Read et al., 1992; PCT patent application US95\/06540).","This example relates to cysteine-added variants of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is the hormone primarily responsible for stimulating erythropoiesis or red blood cell formation. EPO acts on immature red blood cell precursors to stimulate their further proliferation and differentiation into mature red blood cells. A commercial pharmaceutical version is available from Amgen, Inc. Human EPO is a 35-39 kDa glycoprotein secreted by the adult kidney. The mature human protein contains 166 amino acids and is heavily glycosylated. The sequence of human EPO (SEQ ID NO: 2) is shown in Lin et al 1985 and Jacobs et al. 1985, which are incorporated herein by reference. The primary sequence of EPO is highly conserved among species (greater than 80% identity; Wen et al., 1994). Sugar groups account for greater than 40% of the protein's mass. Human EPO contains three N-linked glycosylation sites and one O-linked glycosylation site. The N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved in different species whereas the O-linked glycosylation site is not. The extensive glycosylation of EPO has prevented the protein's crystallization, so the X-ray structure of the protein is not known. Human EPO contains four cysteine residues. The disulfide assignments are Cys7 to Cys161 and Cys29 to Cys33. Cys33 is not conserved in mouse EPO, suggesting that the Cys29-Cys33 disulfide bond is not critical to mouse EPO's structure or function. This conclusion also seems to hold for human EPO (Boissel et al., 1993).","The amino acid sequence of EPO is consistent with the protein being a member of the GH supergene family and mutational studies support this view of EPO's structure (Boissel et al., 1993; Wen et al., 1994). A model of the three dimensional structure of EPO, modeled after the GH structure has been proposed (Boissel et al., 1993; Wen et al., 1994). Helix A encompasses amino acids 9-22, Helix B encompasses amino acids 59-76, Helix C encompasses amino acids 90-107 and Helix D encompasses amino acids 132-152. Amino acids in EPO important for receptor binding have been identified through mutagenesis experiments and reside primarily in the N-terminal half of presumptive helix A and the C-terminal half of presumptive helix D (Boissel et al., 1993; Wen et al., 1994; Matthews et al., 1996). Only a single cell surface receptor for EPO has been identified (D'Andrea et al., 1989). It is believed that EPO dimerizes its receptor in much the same way that GH dimerizes its receptor (Matthew's et al., 1996).","Human EPO contains three sites for N-linked glycosylation (asparagine-24, -38 and -83) and one site for O-linked glycosylation (serine-126). The N-linked glycosylation sites are located in the A-B and B-C loops and the O-glycosylation site is located in the C-D loop. The N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved among species whereas the O-linked glycosylation site is absent in rodent EPO (Wen et al., 1993). A non-O-linked glycosylated human variant containing methionine at position 126 has been described (U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,008). The N-linked sugar groups are heavily branched and contain terminal sialic acid residues (Sasaki et al., 1987; Takeuchi et al., 1988). N-38 and N-83 contain the most highly branched oligosaccharides (Sasaki et al., 1988).","The terminal sialic residues on EPO are critical for the protein's in vivo function because removal of these residues by digestion eliminates in vivo activity (Fukada et al., 1989; Spivak and Hogans, 1989). Loss of activity correlates with faster clearance of the asialated protein from the body. The circulating half-life of the asialated protein in rats is less than ten minutes, in contrast to that of the sialated protein, which is approximately 2 hr (Fukada et al., 1989; Spivak and Hogans, 1989). Thus, in vivo activity of EPO directly correlates with its circulating half-life.","The role of N-linked sugars in EPO's biological activities has been better defined by mutating, individually and in combination, the three asparagine residues comprising the N-linked glycosylation sites. EPO muteins in which only a single N-linked glycosylation site was mutated, i.e., N24Q, N38Q and N83Q, were secreted from mammalian cells as efficiently as wild type EPO, indicating that N-linked glycosylation at all three sites is not required for protein secretion (N24Q indicates that the asparagine at position 24 is mutated to glutamine). In contrast, EPO muteins in which two or more N-linked glycosylation sites were mutated were secreted less efficiently than wild type EPO from mammalian cells (Yamaguchi et al., 1991; Delorme et al., 1992). Mutagenesis studies found that each of the single N-linked glycosylation site muteins had in vitro biological activities equal to or greater than wild type EPO. Thus, it was concluded that none of the N-linked glycosylation sites is essential for secretion or in vitro biological activity of EPO. In fact, removal of one of the glycosylation sites seemed to improve biological activity (Yamaguchi et al., 1991).","The in vivo biological activity of N-linked glycosylation muteins was studied by two groups. Yamaguchi et al. (1991) concluded that the N24Q and N83Q muteins had in vivo activities greater than wild type EPO, which correlated with their increased in vitro activities. These authors found that the N38Q mutein had decreased in vivo activity, about 60% of wild type EPO. N38 is the most heavily branched of the three N-linked glycosylation sites (Sasaki et al., 1988). Delorme et al. (1992) reported that mutating any of the N-linked glycosylation sites reduced in vivo biological activity by about 50%. Muteins in which two or more glycosylation sites were mutated had decreased in vivo activities in both studies.","The above studies indicate that some N-linked glycosylation is required for in vitro and in vivo activity of EPO. Individually, however, none of the three glycosylation sites is absolutely essential for activity. The N-linked sugars increase the apparent molecular weight of EPO and prolong its circulating half-life, which correlates with bioactivity. Natural EPO and EPO manufactured in mammalian cells have complex N-linked sugars containing galactose and terminal sialic acid residues. The galactose residues are recognized by specific receptors on hepatocytes and promote rapid clearance of EPO from the body unless the galactose residues are masked by the terminal sialic acid residues.","Mutagenesis studies concluded that O-linked glycosylation is not required for in vitro or in vivo function of EPO (Delorme et al., 1992). This is in keeping with the observation that rodent EPO is not O-glycosylated and with the existence of a naturally occurring human EPO variant in which serine-126 is replaced by methionine, with a corresponding lack of O-linked glycosylation. Mutagenesis of serine-126 revealed that certain amino acid changes at this site (to valine, histidine or glutamic acid) yielded EPO muteins with biological activities similar to wild type EPO, whereas other amino acid changes (to alanine or glycine) resulted in EPO molecules with severely reduced activities (Delorme et al., 1992). The effect of changing serine-126 to cysteine was not studied. The in vivo bioactivity of S126V EPO was found to be similar to wild type EPO (Delorme et al., 1992).","The requirement for complex, N-linked carbohydrates containing terminal sialic acid residues for in vivo activity of EPO has limited commercial manufacture of the protein to mammalian cells. The important functions of the sialated N-linked sugars are to prevent protein aggregation, increase protein stability and prolong the circulating half-life of the protein. The terminal sialic acid residues prolong EPO's circulating half-life by masking the underlying galactose residues, which are recognized by specific receptors on hepatocytes and promote clearance of the asialated protein. EPO can be produced in insect cells and is N-glycosylated and fully active in vitro; its activity in vivo has not been reported (Wojchowski et al., 1987).","This example provides for the design of cysteine-added EPO variants and their use in preparing conjugates using cysteine-reactive PEGs and other cysteine-reactive moieties. Certain amino acids in EPO are non-essential for biological activity and can be mutated to cysteine residues without altering the normal disulfide binding pattern and overall conformation of the molecule. These amino acids are located in the A-B loop (amino acids 23-58 of the mature protein sequence), the B-C loop (amino acids 77-89 of the mature protein sequence), the C-D loop (amino acids 108-131 of the mature protein sequence), proximal to helix A (amino acids 1-8) and distal to helix D (amino acids 153-166 of the mature protein sequence). Also contemplated as preferred sites for adding cysteine residues are at the N-terminus or C-terminus of the protein sequence. Preferred sites for cysteine substitutions are the O-linked glycosylation site (serine-126) and the amino acids comprising the three N-linked glycosylation sites (N24, I25, T26, N38, I39, T40, N83, S84, S85). Glycosylation sites are attractive sites for introducing cysteine substitutions and attaching PEG molecules to EPO because (1) these sites are surface exposed; (2) the natural protein can tolerate bulky sugar groups at these positions; (3) the glycosylation sites are located in the putative loop regions and away from the receptor binding site (Wen et al., 1994); and (4) mutagenesis studies indicate these sites (at least individually) are not essential for in vitro or in vivo activity (Yamaguchi et al., 1991; Delorme et al., 1992). As discussed above, the local conformation of the region encompassing the O-glycosylation site region seems to be important for biological activity. Whether a cysteine substitution at position 126 affects biological activity has not been studied. The cysteine-29 to cysteine-33 disulfide bond is not necessary for biological activity of EPO because changing both residues to tyrosine simultaneously yielded a biologically active EPO protein (Boissel et al., 1993; Wen et al., 1994). A \u201cfree\u201d cysteine can be created by changing either cysteine-29 or cysteine-33 to another amino acid. Preferred amino acid changes would be to serine or alanine. The remaining \u201cfree\u201d cysteine (cysteine-29 or cysteine-33) would be a preferred site for covalently modifying the protein with cysteine-reactive moieties.","Bill et al. (1995) individually substituted cysteine for N24, N38 and N83 and reported that the muteins had greatly reduced in vitro biological activities (less than 20% of wild type activity). Bill et al. (1995) expressed the EPO variants as fusion proteins (fused to glutathionine-S-transferase) in bacteria. One aspect of the present invention is to provide expression systems in which the N24C, N38C and N83C EPO variants will have in vitro biological activities more similar to wild type EPO.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,008 contemplates naturally occurring variants of EPO as well as amino acid substitutions that are present in EPO proteins of mammals. Ovine EPO contains a cysteine residue at position 88 of the polypeptide chain. The inventor is unaware of any other naturally occurring human or animal cysteine variants of EPO in which the cysteine residue occurs in the polypeptide regions disclosed herein as being useful for generating cysteine-added EPO variants. U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,008 specifically teaches away from cysteine-added EPO variants by suggesting that expression of EPO might be improved by deleting cysteine residues or substituting naturally occurring cysteine residues with serine or histidine residues.","The mature protein form of EPO can contain 165 or 166 amino acids because of post-translational removal of the C-terminal arginine Asp-165 is the C-terminus of the 165 amino acid form and Agr-166 is the C-terminal amino acid of the 166 amino acid form. The cysteine substitution and insertion mutations described herein can comprise either the 165 or 166 amino acid forms of mature EPO.","A cDNA encoding EPO can be cloned using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique from the human HepG2 or Hep3B cell lines, which are known to express EPO when treated with hypoxia or cobalt chloride (Wen et al., 1993) and are available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cysteine mutations can be introduced into the cDNA by standard phage, plasmid or PCR mutagenesis procedures as described for GH. As described above, the preferred sites for introduction of cysteine substitution mutations are in the A-B loop, the B-C loop, the C-D loop and the region proximal to helix A and distal to helix D. The most preferred sites in these regions are the N- and O-linked glycosylation sites: S126C; N24C; I25C, T26C; N38C; I39C, T40C; N83C, S 84C and S85C. Other preferred sites for cysteine substitution mutagenesis are in the A-B loop, the B-C loop and the C-D loop, amino acids surrounding the glycosylation sites and the region of the protein proximal to helix A and distal to helix D (Boissel et al., 1993; Wen et al., 1994). Other preferred sites for cysteine substitutions in these regions are: A1, P2, P3, R4, D8, S9, T27, G28, A30, E31, H32, S34, N36, D43, T44, K45, N47, A50, K52, E55, G57, Q58, G77, Q78, A79, Q86, W88, E89, T107, R110, A111, G113, A114, Q115, K116, E117, A118, S120, P121, P122, D123, A124, A125, A127, A128, T132, K154, T157, G158, E159, A160, T163, G164, D165 and R166. Cysteine residues also can be introduced proximal to the first amino acid of the mature protein, i.e., proximal to A1, or distal to the final amino acid in the mature protein, i.e., distal to D165 or R166. Other variants in which cys-29 or cys-33 have been replaced with other amino acids, preferably serine or alanine, also are provided.","Wild type EPO and EPO muteins can be expressed using insect cells to determine whether the cysteine-added muteins are biologically active. DNAs encoding EPO\/EPO muteins can be cloned into the Baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (available from Invitrogen, Inc. and Sigma Corporation (St. Louis, Mo.) and used to infect insect cells. Recombinant Baculoviruses producing EPO can be identified by Western blots of infected insect cell conditioned media using polyclonal anti-human EPO antiserum (available from R&D Systems). The secreted EPO mutein proteins can be purified by conventional chromatographic procedures well known to those of skill in the art. Protein concentrations can be determined using commercially available protein assay kits or ELISA assay kits (available from R&D Systems and Bio-Rad Laboratories).","Purified EPO and EPO muteins can be tested in cell proliferation assays using EPO-responsive cell lines such as UT7-epo (Wen et al., 1994) or TF1 (available from the ATCC) to measure specific activities of the proteins. Cells can be plated in 96-well microtiter plates with various concentrations of EPO. Assays should be performed in triplicate. After 1-3 days in culture, cell proliferation can be measured by H-thymidine incorporation, as described above for GH. The concentration of protein giving half-maximal stimulation (EC) can be determined for each mutein. Assays should be performed at least three times for each mutein, with triplicate wells for each data point. ECvalues can be used to compare the relative potencies of the muteins. Alternatively, cell proliferation in response to added EPO muteins can be analyzed using an MTT dye-exclusion assay (Komatsu et al. 1991). Proteins displaying similar optimal levels of stimulation and ECvalues comparable to or greater than wild type EPO are preferable.","The above studies confirm identification of amino acid residues in EPO that can be changed to cysteine residues and retain biological activity. Muteins that retain activity can be PEGylated using a cysteine-reactive 8 kDa PEG-maleimide as described above for GH muteins. Wild type EPO should be used as a control since it should not react with the cysteine-reactive PEG under identical partial reduction conditions. The lowest amount of PEG that gives significant quantities of mono-PEGylated product without giving di-PEGylated product should be considered optimum. Mono-PEGylated protein can be purified from non-PEGylated protein and unreacted PEG by size-exclusion or ion exchange chromatography. The purified PEGylated proteins should be tested in the cell proliferation assay described above to determine their bioactivities.","One or more of the PEGylated EPO muteins that retain in vitro bioactivity, are candidates for testing in animal disease models. PEGylation of the protein at the proper amino acid can be determined as described for GH.","In vivo testing of PEGylated EPO muteins expressed using insect cells may require that they be re-engineered for expression in mammalian cells to ensure proper glycosylation. PEG-EPO candidates produced using insect cells can be tested in the animal models described below to determine if they are active in vivo and whether they are as active as PEG-EPO produced using mammalian cell expression systems. For expression in mammalian cells, the EPO muteins can be subcloned into commercially available eukaryotic expression vectors and used to stably transform Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells (available from the ATCC). Sublines can be screened for EPO expression using ELISA assays. Sufficient quantities of the insect cell- and mammalian cell-produced EPO muteins can be prepared to compare their biological activities in animal anemia models.","In vivo bioactivities of the EPO muteins can be tested using the artificial polycythemia or starved rodent models (Cotes and Bangham., 1961; Goldwasser and Gross., 1975). In the starved rodent model, rats are deprived of food on day one and treated with test samples on days two and three. On day four, rats receive an injection of radioactive iron-59. Approximately 18 h later, rats are anesthetized and blood samples drawn. The percent conversion of labeled iron into red blood cells is then determined. In the artificial polycythemia model, mice are maintained in a closed tank and exposed for several days to hypobaric air. The animals are then brought to normal air pressure. Red blood cell formation is suppressed for several days. On day four or six after return to normal air pressure, mice are injected with erythropoietin or saline. Mice receive one injection per day for one to two days. One day later the animals receive an intravenous injection of labeled iron-59. The mice are euthanized 20 h later and the amount of labeled iron incorporated into red blood cells determined EPO stimulates red blood cell formation in both models as measured by a dose-dependent increase in labeled iron incorporated into red blood cells. In both models different dosing regimens and different times of injections can be studied to determine if PEG-EPO is biologically active and\/or more potent and produces longer acting effects than natural EPO.","Alpha interferon is produced by leukocytes and has antiviral, anti-tumor and immunomodulatory effects. There are at least 20 distinct alpha interferon genes that encode proteins that share 70% or greater amino acid identity. Amino acid sequences of the known alpha interferon species are given in Blatt et al. (1996). A \u201cconsensus\u201d interferon that incorporates the most common amino acids into a single polypeptide chain has been described (Blatt et al., 1996). A hybrid alpha interferon protein may be produced by splicing different parts of alpha interferon proteins into a single protein (Horisberger and Di Marco, 1995). Some alpha interferons contain N-linked glycosylation sites in the region proximal to helix A and near the B-C loop (Blatt et al. 1966). The alpha 2 interferon protein (SEQ ID NO: 3) contains four cysteine residues that form two disulfide bonds. The cys1-cys98 disulfide bond (cys1-cys99 in some alpha interferon species such as alpha 1; SEQ ID NO: 4) is not essential for activity. The alpha 2-interferon protein does not contain any N-linked glycosylation sites. There are two subtypes of the alpha-2 interferon protein; one subtype has arginine at position 23 whereas the other subtype has lysine at position 23. The crystal structure of alpha interferon has been determined (Radhakrishnan et al., 1996). Alpha interferon has five major alpha helices referred to as helices A-E. Helix A encompasses amino acids 9-21, helix B encompasses amino acids 52-68, helix C encompasses amino acids 78-100, helix D encompasses amino acids 112-132 and helix E encompasses amino acids 137-160.","This example provides cysteine added variants in the region proximal to the A helix (amino acids 1-8), distal to the E helix (amino acids 161-165), in the A-B loop (amino acids 22-51), in the B-C loop (amino acids 69-77), in the C-D loop (amino acids 101-111) and in the D-E loop (amino acids 133-136). This Example also provides cysteine-added variants at the first three or last three amino acids in helices A, B, C, D and E. Preferred sites for the introduction of cysteine residues in these regions of the alpha interferon-2 species are: D2, L3, P4, Q5, T6, S8, Q20, R22, K\/R23, S25, F27, S28, K31, D32, R33, D35, G37, F38, Q40, E41, E42, F43, G44, N45, Q46, F47, Q48, K49, A50, N65, S68, T69, K70, D71, S72, S73, A74, A75, D77, E78, T79, Y89, Q90, Q91, N93, D94, E96, A97, Q101, G102, G104, T106, E107, T108, P109, K112, E113, D114, S115, K131, E132, K133, K134, Y135, S136, A139, S152, S154, T155, N156, L157, Q158, E159, S160, L161, R162, S163, K164, E165. Variants in which cysteine residues are introduced proximal to the first amino acid of the mature protein, i.e., proximal to C1, or distal to the final amino acid in the mature protein, i.e., distal to E165 are provided. Other variants in which cys-1 or cys-98 (cys-99 in some alpha interferon species) have been replaced with other amino acids, preferably serine or alanine, also are provided. Other variants in which Cys-1 has been deleted (des Cys-1) also are provided. The cysteine variants may be in the context of any naturally occurring or non-natural alpha interferon sequence, e.g., consensus interferon or interferon protein hybrids. Some naturally occurring alpha interferon species (e.g., alpha interferon-1) contain a naturally occurring \u201cfree\u201d cysteine. In such interferon species the naturally occurring free cysteine can be changed to another amino acid, preferably serine or alanine.","This example also provides cysteine variants of other alpha interferon species, including consensus interferon, at equivalent sites in these proteins. The alignment of the alpha interferon-2 species with other known alpha interferon species and consensus interferon is given in Blatt et al. (1996). The crystal structure of alpha interferon-2 has been determined by Rhadhakrishnan et al. (1996). Lydon et al (1985) found that deletion of the first four amino acids from the N-terminus of alpha interferon did not affect biological activity. Valenzuela et al (1985) found that substitution of Phe-47 in alpha interferon-2 with Cys, Tyr or Ser did not alter biological activity of the protein. Cys-1 and Cys-98 have been changed individually to glycine and serine, respectively, without altering biological activity of the protein (DeChiara et al, 1986).","DNA sequences encoding alpha interferon-2 can be amplified from human genomic DNA, since alpha interferon genes do not contain introns (Pestka et al., 1987). The DNA sequence of alpha interferon-2 is given in Goeddel et al. (1980). Alternatively, a cDNA for alpha interferon-2 can be isolated from human lymphoblastoid cell lines that are known to express alpha interferon spontaneously or after exposure to viruses (Goeddell et al., 1980; Pickering et al., 1980). Many of these cell lines are available from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.). Specific mutations can be introduced into the alpha interferon sequence using plasmid-based site-directed mutagenesis kits (e.g., Quick-Change Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene, Inc.), phage mutagenesis strategies or employing PCR mutagenesis as described for GH.","Alpha interferon has been successfully produced in as an intracellular protein (Tarnowski et al., 1986; Thatcher and Panayotatos, 1986). Similar procedures can be used to express alpha interferon muteins. Plasmids encoding alpha interferon or alpha interferon muteins can be cloned into an expression vector such as pET15b (Novagene, Inc.) that uses the strong T7 promoter or pCYB1 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass.) that uses the TAC promoter. Expression of the protein can be induced by adding IPTG to the growth media.","Recombinant alpha interferon expressed in is sometimes soluble and sometimes insoluble (Tarnowski et al., 1986; Thatcher and Panayotatos, 1986). Insolubility appears to be related to the degree of overexpression of the protein. Insoluble alpha interferon proteins can be recovered as inclusion bodies and renatured to a fully active conformation following standard oxidative refolding protocols (Thatcher and Panayotatos, 1986; Cox et al., 1994). The alpha interferon proteins can be purified further using other chromatographic methods such as ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, size-exclusion and reversed phase resins (Thatcher and Panayotaos, 1986). Protein concentrations can be determined using commercially available protein assay kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories).","If expression of alpha interferon muteins is not successful, one can express the proteins in insect cells as secreted proteins as described for GH. The proteins can be modified to contain the natural alpha interferon signal sequence (Goeddell et al., 1980) or the honeybee mellitin signal sequence (Invitrogen, Inc.) to promote secretion of the proteins. Alpha interferon and alpha interferon muteins can be purified from conditioned media using conventional chromatography procedures. Antibodies to alpha interferon can be used in conjunction with Western blots to localize fractions containing the alpha interferon proteins during chromatography. Alternatively, fractions containing alpha interferon proteins can be identified using ELISAs.","Bioactivities of alpha interferon and alpha interferon muteins can be measured using an in vitro viral plaque reduction assay (Ozes et al., 1992; Lewis, 1995). Human HeLa cells can be plated in 96-well plates and grown to near confluency at 37\u00b0 C. The cells are then washed and treated for 24 hour with different concentrations of each alpha interferon preparation. Controls should include no alpha interferon and wild type alpha interferon (commercially available from Endogen, Inc., Woburn, Mass.). A virus such as Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is added to the plates and the plates incubated for a further 24-48 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Additional controls should include samples without virus. When 90% or more of the cells have been killed in the virus-treated, no alpha interferon control wells (determined by visual inspection of the wells), the cell monolayer are stained with crystal violet and absorbance of the wells read using a microplate reader. Alternatively, the cell monolayers can be stained with the dye MTT (Lewis, 1995). Samples should be analyzed in duplicate or triplicate. ECvalues (the amount of protein required to inhibit the cytopathic effect of the virus by 50%) can be used to compare the relative potencies of the proteins. Wild type alpha interferon-2 protects cells from the cytopathic effects of VSV and EMCV and has a specific activity of approximately 2\u00d710units\/mg in this assay (Ozes et al., 1992). Alpha interferon muteins displaying ECvalues comparable to wild type Alpha Interferon are preferable.","Alpha interferon muteins that retain activity can be PEGylated using procedures similar to those described for GH. Wild type alpha interferon-2 can serve as a control since it should not PEGylate under similar conditions. The lowest amount of PEG that gives significant quantities of mono-pegylated product without giving di-pegylated product should be considered optimum. Mono-PEGylated protein can be purified from non-PEGylated protein and unreacted PEG by size-exclusion or ion exchange chromatography. The purified PEGylated proteins can be tested in the viral plaque reduction bioassay described above to determine their bioactivities. PEGylated alpha interferon proteins with bioactivities comparable to wild type alpha interferon are preferable. Mapping the PEG attachment site and determination of pharmacokinetic data for the PEGylated protein can be performed as described for GH.","In vivo bioactivities of the PEG-alpha interferon muteins can be tested using tumor xenograft models in nude mice and viral infection models (Balkwill, 1986; Fish et al., 1986). Since PEG-alpha interferon bioactivity may be species-specific, one should confirm activity of the PEGylated protein using appropriate animal cell lines in in vitro virus plaque reduction assays, similar to those described above. Next, one should explore the effects of different dosing regimens and different times of injections to determine if PEG-alpha interferon is more potent and produces longer lasting effects than non-PEGylated alpha interferon.","The novel alpha interferon-derived molecules of this example can be formulated and tested for activity essentially as set forth in Examples 1 and 2, substituting, however, the appropriate assays and other considerations known in the art related to the specific proteins of this example.","Beta interferon is produced by fibroblasts and exhibits antiviral, antitumor and immunomodulatory effects. The single-copy beta interferon gene encodes a preprotein that is cleaved to yield a mature protein of 166 amino acids (Taniguchi et al. 1980; SEQ ID NO: 5). The protein contains three cysteines, one of which, cysteine-17, is \u201cfree\u201d, i.e., it does not participate in a disulfide bond. The protein contains one N-linked glycosylation site. The crystal structure of the protein has been determined (Karpusas et al. 1997). Beta interferon has five major alpha helices referred to as helices A-E. Helix A encompasses amino acids 2-22, helix B encompasses amino acids 51-71, helix C encompasses amino acids 80-107, helix D encompasses amino acids 118-136 and helix E encompasses amino acids 139-162.","This example provides cysteine-added variants at any of the three amino acids that comprise the N-linked glycosylation sites, i.e., N80C, E81C or T82C.

This Example also provides cysteine-added variants at the first three or last three amino acids in helices A, B, C, D and E.

No. 4,810,643 all incorporated herein by reference. The human protein is synthesized as a preprotein of 204 or 207 amino acids that is cleaved to yield mature proteins of 174 or 177 amino acids. The larger form has lower specific activity than the smaller form. The protein contains five cysteines, four of which are involved in disulfide bonds. Cysteine-17 is not involved in a disulfide bond. Substitution of cysteine-17 with serine yields a mutant G-CSF protein that is fully active (U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,643). The protein is O-glycosylated at threonine-133 of the mature protein.

The AML-193 cell line is preferable since it is of human origin, which eliminates the possibility of a false conclusion resulting from species differences. The NFS60 cell lines proliferates in response to G-CSF with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC) of 10-20 picomolar. Purified G-CSF and G-CSF muteins can be tested in cell proliferation assays using these cell lines to determine specific activities of the proteins, using published methods (Tsuchiya et al., 1986; Lange et al., 1987; Shirafuji et al., 1989). Cells can be plated in 96-well tissue culture dishes with different concentrations of G-CSF or G-CSF muteins. After 1-3 days at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified tissue culture incubator, proliferation can be measured by H-thymidine incorporation as described for GH. Assays should be performed at least three times for each mutein using triplicate wells for each data point. ECvalues can be used to compare the relative potencies of the muteins. G-CSF muteins displaying similar optimal levels of stimulation and ECvalues comparable to wild type G-CSF are preferable.","G-CSF muteins that retain activity can be PEGylated using procedures similar to those described for GH. Wild type G-CSF and ser-17 G-CSF can serve as controls since they should not PEGylate under similar conditions. The lowest amount of PEG that gives significant quantities of mono-PEGylated product without giving di-PEGylated product should be considered optimum. Mono-PEGylated protein can be purified from non-PEGylated protein and unreacted PEG by size-exclusion or ion exchange chromatography. The purified PEGylated proteins can be tested in the cell proliferation assay described above to determine their bioactivities.","The PEG site in the protein can be mapped using procedures similar to those described for GH. Pharmacokinetic data for the PEGylated proteins can be obtained using procedures similar to those described for GH.","Initial studies to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of PEG-G-CSF can be done in normal Sprague-Dawley rats, which can be purchased from Charles River. Groups of rats should receive single subcutaneous or intravenous injections of various doses of G-CSF, PEG-G-CSF or placebo. Animals should be sacrificed at daily intervals for up to a week for determination of neutrophil and total white blood cell counts in peripheral blood. Other blood cell types (platelets and red blood cells) can be measured to demonstrate cell specificity.","The efficacy of PEG-G-CSF can be tested in a rat neutropenia model. Neutropenia can be induced by treatment with cyclophosphamide, which is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent that is myelosuppressive. G-CSF accelerates recovery of normal neutrophil levels in cyclophosphamide-treated animals (Kubota et al., 1990). Rats receive an injection of cyclophosphamide on day 0 to induce neutropenia. The animals are then be divided into different groups, which will receive subcutaneous injections of G-CSF, PEG-G-CSF or placebo. Neutrophil and total white blood cell counts in peripheral blood should be measured daily until they return to normal levels. Initially one should confirm that G-CSF accelerates recovery from neutropenia when injected daily. Next, one should explore the effects of different dosing regimens and different times of injections to determine if PEG-G-CSF is more potent and produces longer lasting effects than non-PEGylated G-CSF.","The novel GCSF-derived molecules of this example can be formulated and tested for activity essentially as set forth in Examples 1 and 2, substituting, however, the appropriate assays and other considerations known in the art related to the specific proteins of this example.","Thrombopoietin stimulates the development of megakaryocyte precursors of platelets.

Expression and Purification of Wild Type Murine GM-CSF (muGM-CSF)","Cloning of a cDNA encoding wild type murine GM-CSF (WT muGM-CSF) is described in PCT\/US01\/16088, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Wild type muGM-CSF was expressed and purified using the following protocol. A fresh saturated overnight culture of strain W3110 transformed with pBBT257::stII-muGM-CSF, which encodes wild type muGM-CSF and is described in PCT\/US01\/16088, was inoculated at \u02dc0.05 OD @ Ain LB containing 10 \u03bcg\/ml tetracycline. The 400 ml culture was grown in a 2 L baffled shake flask at 28\u00b0 C. in a gyrotory shaker water bath at \u02dc250 rpm. When the culture reached a density of \u02dc0.6 OD, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The induced culture was then incubated overnight for \u02dc16 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. The cell pellet was thawed and treated with 5 mL of B-PER\u2122 bacterial protein extraction reagent according to the manufacturer's (Pierce Chemical Company) protocols. The insoluble portion, and the bulk of the muGM-CSF protein, was recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in B-PER. This mixture was treated with lysozyme (200 \u03bcg\/mL) for 10 min to further disrupt the bacterial cell walls, and MgCl(10 mM final) and protease-free DNAse (2 \u03bcg\/ml) were added. Insoluble mGM-CSF was collected by centrifugation and washed, by resuspension in water and recentrifugation, to remove most of the solubilized cell debris. For refolding, the resulting pellet containing insoluble muGM-CSF was dissolved in 10 ml of 8 M urea, 25 mM cysteine in 20 mM Tris Base. This mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature then diluted into 100 ml of 20 mM Tris, 40 \u03bcM copper sulfate, 15% glycerol, pH 8.0. This refold mixture was held at 4\u00b0 C. for 2 days and then centrifuged and loaded onto a 5 ml Q-Sepharose HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 (Buffer A). The bound proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient from 0-35% Buffer B (1M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8). Column fractions were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. muGM-CSF eluted at approximately 190 mM NaCl. Fractions containing primarily muGM-CSF were pooled.","The Q-Sepharose pool was adjusted to 30% ammonium sulfate by slow addition of solid ammonium sulfate. The mixture was warmed to room temperature before being loaded onto a 1 mL Phenyl HP HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with 30% ammonium sulfate in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The muGM-CSF was recovered from the column by elution with a reverse salt gradient (30% ammonium sulfate to 0% ammonium sulfate in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5). The Phenyl HP column elution profile for GM-CSF showed a single major peak, eluting at a conductivity of approximately 1.28 mS\/cm. Column fractions across the peak were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing muGM-CSF and no visible contaminants were pooled. Protein concentrations were determined using a MicroBCA kit (Pierce Chemical Company).","B. Expression and Purification of T3C Murine GM-CSF","Construction of the muGM-CSF T3C cysteine mutein (substitution of cysteine for threonine at position 3 of muGM-CSF) is described in PCT\/US01\/16088. strain 3110 transformed with pBBT257::stII-muGM-CSF(T3C), which encodes the muGM-CSF T3C mutein and is described in PCT\/US01\/16088, was grown, induced and harvested using the protocols described in Example 24A for wild type muGM-CSF. The mutein was refolded and purified using the protocol described for wild type muGM-CSF. The mutein eluted from the Q-Sepharose column at approximately 220 mM NaCl and from the Phenyl HP column at a conductivity around 2 mS\/CM. The mutein was recovered predominantly as a monomer, with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined using a MicroBCA kit (Pierce Chemical Company).","One milligram of muGM-CSF T3C protein prepared as described in Example 24B was diluted 3-fold with 100 mM Tris, pH 8, to a final concentration of 0.1 mg\/ml protein. A 20-fold molar excess of 20 kDa maleimide-Polyethylene Glycol (20 kDa-mPEG-maleimide, Shearwater Corporation) was added followed by a 15\u00d7 fold excess of TCEP (Pierce Chemical Company). The mixture was allowed to sit at room temperature for 4 hours before being diluted 5-fold with 20 mM Tris pH 8. The PEGylation reaction was next loaded on to a 1 ml Q-Sepharose HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 (Buffer A). The bound proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient from 0-35% Buffer B (1M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8). Column fractions were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The T3C protein modified with the 20 kDa maleimide-PEG eluted at approximately 90 mM NaCl. Fractions containing purified 20 kDa PEG-T3C protein were pooled. The T3C protein modified with a 10 kDa mPEG-maleimide (Shearwater Corporation) and a 40 kDa mPEG2 maleimide (Shearwater Corporation) were prepared using this same protocol.","The purpose of this study was to determine if the PEG-T3C GM-CSF proteins are effective at stimulating hematopoiesis in a mammal. The study was performed in rats because rats are predictive of the situation in other mammals, including humans. Similar types of experiments can be performed with other PEGylated GM-CSF cysteine muteins such as those described in Example 7 and in PCT\/US01\/16088 to demonstrate that these proteins are effective at stimulating hematopoiesis. The PEGylated GM-CSF cysteine muteins will be effective from the low \u03bcg\/kg to the mg\/kg range with the preferred level being between 25-300 \u03bcg\/kg. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 350 grams were given a single intravenous dose of wild type muGM-CSF, or the T3C mutein modified with 10 kDa-, 20 kDa and 40 kDa-maleimide PEGs. All rats were dosed at 100 \u03bcg\/kg. The protein solutions were prepared at 100 \u03bcg\/ml in phosphate buffered saline. Blood samples (0.4 ml) were collected at pre-dose, 0.25 h, 1.5 h, 4 h, 10 hr, 24 h, 48 h, 72 hr, 96 h, 120 h and 144 h post-injection in an EDTA-coated tube. Blood samples were centrifuged and the plasma stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. At pre-dose, 4, 10, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 h post-injection approximately 0.2 ml of whole EDTA blood was removed prior to centrifugation and placed in an EDTA microtainer tube for submission to a commercial firm for a complete blood cell (CBC) analysis. Results of the CBC analyses are shown in Tables 1-5. The data show that the PEG-T3C GM-CSF proteins are effective at stimulating hematopoiesis in a mammal In particular the proteins are effective at increasing blood levels of white blood cells, granulocytes (neutrophils and eosinophils), monocytes and lymphocytes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0249","num":"0248"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

purpose of this study was to determine whether the PEGylated GM-CSF cysteine muteins could accelerate recovery from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in a mammal. The study was performed in rats because rats are predictive of neutropenia in other mammals, including humans. Similar types of experiments can be performed with other PEGylated GM-CSF cysteine muteins such as those described in Example 7 and in PCT\/US01\/16088 to demonstrate that these proteins are effective at accelerating recovery from neutropenia. The PEGylated GM-CSF muteins will be effective from the low \u03bcg\/kg (e.g., at least about 0.1 \u03bcg\/kg) to the mg\/kg range (e.g., at least about 0.1 mg\/kg) with the preferred level being between 25-300 \u03bcg\/kg.","Male Sprague Dawley rats (5 animals per group) weighing approximately 180 g were given an intraperitoneal dose of cyclophosphamide (CPA; 100 mg\/kg) on Day 0. Wild type muGM-CSF, 20 kDa-PEG-T3C muGM-CSF or 40 kDa-PEG-T3C muGM-CSF prepared as described in Example 25 were then injected subcutaneously into rats at a dose of 100 \u03bcg\/kg on Days 1-5. Protein samples were prepared in phosphate buffered saline. As controls, different groups of rats were injected with wild type muGM-CSF (Example 24) or vehicle (phosphate buffered saline). There was one group of rats that received no chemotherapy. A blood sample was collected at pre-dose (Day 0) and on Days 1-11 and 13 from all groups to perform a complete blood cell count (CBC) analysis. 400 \u03bcl of whole EDTA blood was removed and placed in an eppendorf tube for submission to an external lab for CBC analysis.","Results of the CBC analysis for white blood cells and neutrophils are shown in Tables 6 and 7. CPA-treatment caused a drastic drop in neutrophil and white blood cell counts by Day 1. It was found that the 20 kDa-PEG-T3C and 40 kDa-PEG-T3C muGM-CSF accelerated the recovery of neutropenia compared to the CPA-only treated group and the wild type muGM-CSF treated group. Neutrophil counts returned to normal levels (day 0 values) between Days 5 and 6 for the PEG-T3C muGM-CSF proteins versus between Day 9 and 10 for the CPA-only treated animals and the wild type muGM-CSF treated animals White blood cell counts returned to normal levels between Days 6 and 8 for the PEG-T3C muGM-CSF proteins, whereas white blood cell counts in the CPA-treated animals and the wild type muGM-CSF treated animals had not returned to normal levels (day 0 values) even by day 13 when the experiment was terminated. Similar types of experiments could be performed using different dosing schedules, e.g., a single injection on day 1, every other day injections or every third day injections, or weekly injections to determine an optimum dosing schedule for the PEG-GM-CSF cysteine muteins.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0257","num":"0256"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
