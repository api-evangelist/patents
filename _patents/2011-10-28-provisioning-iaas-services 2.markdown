{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Over the years, the number of cloud service providers who provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) has grown. IaaS generally involves a service provider outsourcing hardware to support operations, including virtualized compute, storage, networking and other information technology (IT) infrastructure resources, typically on a per-use basis. The service provider often owns the hardware and is typically responsible for hosting, operating and maintaining the equipment.","There is a shift in paradigm where users\/organizations \u201crent\u201d such virtualized infrastructure to deploy and run their applications and services without needing to worry about scalability and upfront costs. Users can rapidly provision virtualized IT infrastructure resources by using IaaS. However, IaaS presents its own concerns. For example, IaaS providers have occasionally experienced outages that have lasted for several hours, which can be unacceptable for mission critical applications\/services.","For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons that will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need in the art for alternative apparatus and methods for using IaaS services.","To address such problems, various implementations allow users to deploy their core business applications and\/or services to multiple service providers for added redundancy to improve reliability and availability, for example. Various implementations provide a proxy service to support basic management functionality for IaaS from a variety of service providers, to provide a unified service to manage heterogeneous IaaS environments, and\/or to provide the flexibility to switch from one IaaS service provider to another. Various implementations facilitate the use of multiple IaaS service providers, e.g., to use services available from alternative IaaS service providers to permit continued operation of services even when one of the IaaS service providers is not available, or to take advantage of pricing differences among IaaS service providers.","Various implementations use a model-based approach to service oriented computing to provide a solution for describing services and facilitating service integration. The DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force) Common Information Model (CIM) is a widely adopted object-oriented modeling tool for describing managed entities, e.g., compute or network entities. It provides a framework to enable description of resources provided by IaaS service providers. The CIM meta-model can be used to define the unified IaaS proxy service to model IaaS services. The IaaS proxy service can be implemented using Web2Exchange, a model-based service integration environment, to provision the unified IaaS management service for various IaaS service providers. Web2Exchange, as one example of a service integration environment, is available from Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, Calif., USA.","Service providers have used various approaches to expose their services across the Internet. Since multiple protocols exist to describe specifications for services, it can become difficult to understand service capabilities and orchestrate the invocations to multiple services. Model-based approaches to service-oriented computing may characterize services by their interfaces and their locations. The interfaces define what the services can do by defining a set of operations exposed by the service, and the location defines how the services can be accessed. Services can be described by service models in a structured way to facilitate service discovery and integration.","The services in the service integration environment can be modeled, for example, by an extension of the DMTF CIM meta-model and described by Managed Object Format (MOF) which is a readable and writable syntax to represent the service models. In some cases, service models may be defined directly in MOF with properties and operations as well as meta-data information in the form of qualifiers supported by the service integration environment. To simplify development, Web2Exchange, as one example of a service integration environment, has tools that can generate CIM models by run-time introspection of annotations in the service implementation. For example, an example service model might be specified in MOF as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Class SIE_HelloWorldService : SIE_ManagedService {"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2002\u2002[Write(true)]"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2002\u2002String SampleProperty;"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2002\u2002String helloWorld(sint32 inParameter);"]},{"entry":[{},{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"@ExportClass"]},{"entry":["\u2003","public class HelloWorldService extends ManagedService {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003@Export"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003public String getSampleProperty( ){ ... }"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003@Export"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003public String helloWorld(int value){ ... }"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Service models and modeled elements inherit from one root of the model, which may be referred to as Entity. The entities may be identified by a Unified Resource Identifier (URI) which can be used to locate the services in a service integration environment.","Web2Exchange includes foundation services, such as service catalogs, naming and directory services, to provide basic support services used by all other Web2Exchange services. Web2Exchange can enable services running on it to stay compatible with their models because it can generate the models by introspecting annotations present in the code at runtime, and therefore allows the models to evolve as the service implementation evolves over time.","Although the concepts of IaaS services provided by different IaaS service providers may be similar in terms of functionality, IaaS service providers can have different implementations, and therefore may not share a common interface or protocol for their services. Various implementations provide a translation layer between the user and the service provider in addition to composition services to allow interaction with different service providers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","112","100","102","102","110","112","102","104"]},"The proxy service  links to the service providers \/ and provides a translation layer to communicate with the various communication protocols used by the service providers \/. For example, different service providers \/ may use different sets of application program interface (API) calls to communicate equivalent information.","The service providers \/ can include one or more private cloud service providers  (e.g., infrastructure services available through private or dedicated networks) and\/or one or more public cloud service providers  (e.g., infrastructure services available through public networks, such as the Internet). Although  depicts one private cloud service provider  and three public cloud service providers , various implementations can include more or less service providers \/ of either type. The service providers \/ are in communication with the proxy service  through communication links . Communication links  may include Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communication links using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), for example.","In general, a set of service models  may be created in SIE  for use by the proxy service . In accordance with model-based service integration environments, service models  can describe the actual state of the service at runtime, and permit reasoning about individual and composed services both at design time and at runtime. Service models  can represent live runtime instances, and can enable interoperability, versioning, extensibility and protocol independence. Since services from the service providers \/ may frequently be made available to allow users to rent the servers and storage in a pay-as-you-go manner, some common concepts can be extracted from IaaS services.","The proxy service  further provides an interface  for communication with a user, such as through a communication link  to an application . The interface  may be a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface. REST is a software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the Internet. REST-style architectures include clients (e.g., application ) and servers (e.g., SIE ). Clients initiate requests to servers, which in turn process those requests and return responses. These requests and responses are in the context of the transfer of representations of resources, e.g., service models .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","108","242","240","266","252","252","266","266","252","270","252","258","238"]},"The UML depiction of  further indicates the number of occurrences that may exist between whole and part classifiers. For example, for every Network , there is one Firewall , and vice versa; for every Network , there are zero or more occurrences of IP address ; and for every Virtual Machine , there are one or more occurrences of Storage .","The abstraction models of  contain models for both types and services, consistent with a model-based approach. Both classes of models extend the root, Entity , and models of services further extend Service Provider  which itself extends Entity . The type models provide parameters as well as information about instances of types which are exposed by a set of services during service invocations. Models of services provide basic functionalities to fulfill operational requests. The type models and models of services, along with the root Entity  and Service Provider , may collectively be referred to herein as service models. Service models may be generated in response to the services exposed to the proxy service  by service providers.","For the example shown in , models of services for various basic categories include Clone Service , Security Service , Resource Management Service , Virtual Machine Service  and Cluster Service .","Clone Service  may provide both creation and deletion of compute Images  and storage Snapshots , so that at the time of disaster recovery, appropriate images or snapshots can be restored to Computes  and Storages . Security Service  may provide functionalities of generating Credentials  and Firewall  settings, and may further support revoking Credentials  as well as updating Firewall  configurations. Resource Management Service  may define operations for lifecycle management, such as creating, deleting, starting and stopping a resource. It may also define the operations for querying and searching, and special functional operations, such as creating Compute  from an Image  and restoring Storage  from Snapshots . Virtual Machine Service  may define operations for Virtual Machines  in the context of lifecycle management and querying, and may also specify operations for flexibly attaching or detaching resources as well as for monitoring and billing purpose. Cluster Service  may provide creation and deletion of collections of Virtual Machines .","Models of services of various implementations may further include Lookup Service , which may be used to retrieve global configurations of service providers, and may further be used to identify restrictions of a resource usage, for example.

The user might only be made aware of the common interface provided by the proxy service to communicate with all the supported service providers. For various implementations, invocations to a particular service provider can be designed so that it is possible to support a variety of types of service providers without modifying service models.","The service models can be thought of as building blocks, each describing a particular functionality to be selected and specified by a user (e.g., application ) to meet its infrastructure requirements. The user is presented with a single interface (e.g. interface ) for the selection and specification of the service models to meet its infrastructure requirements. In response to the selection and specification of the various service models, the proxy service  can select services from one or more of the service providers \/ to satisfy the specified parameters for the selected models based on their services exposed to the proxy service  through communication link , and generate the type models for exposure to the application  through Entity . Entity  serves as the returned value of a service call, and may be refreshed upon the completion of each service call.","The proxy service  further provides the communication between the various selected services based on the model description (e.g., as depicted in the example of ), and can dispatch the appropriate API service calls to the service providers \/ corresponding to the selected services in response to requests from the application  for resources. The selection of services by the proxy service  may be prioritized based on preferred service providers, preferred geographical regions, historical reliability indications, redundancy preferences, cost, etc.","Implementing the proxy service  in SIE  can further facilitate a reduction in the complexity of integrating infrastructure services with legacy applications and new software components, especially for a heterogeneous environment where invocations may happen among multiple IaaS service providers.  is a modified block diagram depicting the interaction of a proxy service in generating composed services.","For various implementations, there may be four types of services within an SIE , e.g., legacy services  for legacy applications , new software components  written within the SIE , proxy service , and composed service . Legacy service  and proxy service  may be proxies that bind service models (not shown in ) to the back-end implementations, i.e., to legacy application  and service providers \/, respectively. Service providers \/ may include private cloud service providers and\/or public cloud service providers. New software components  may represent additional functionalities written within the SIE  itself.","Legacy service , proxy service , and new software components  may be associated with different sets of service models, and their associated type models. By selecting and specifying service and type models from one or more of legacy service , proxy service  and new software components , a composed service  can be generated, providing functionality that may be unavailable from any one of the other services \/\/.","With the common interface provided by proxy service , a management console may be provided to subscribe, provision, monitor and\/or manage IaaS resources from multiple service providers. The management console may be an instance of application .  depicts an example representation of a management console  for use with various implementations herein. The management console  might be displayed to a user through a web browser or other graphical user interface (not shown). As depicted in , management console might provide a list of various resource types associated with the proxy service , their statuses, their corresponding service providers, the service providers' resource IDs and platforms, and descriptive comments. The user may further be presented with a set of actions that can be taken, such as to add a resource, register an external resource, delete a resource from the proxy service, terminate a resource, or refresh the management console.","It will be appreciated that implementations of the present disclosure can be instantiated by machine-readable instructions, e.g., software, configured to cause a processor to perform methods disclosed herein. The machine-readable instructions can be stored on tangible storage media in the form of volatile or non-volatile storage that is non-transitory in nature. Examples of storage media include solid-state memory (e.g., Read-Only Memory (ROM), Random-Access Memory (RAM), Flash memory, etc.); optical media (e.g., CD, DVD, Blu-Ray\u2122 disks, etc.), magnetic media (e.g., magnetic disks and disk drives, magnetic tape, etc.).
