title: Multi-tier wireless communications architecture, applications and methods
abstract: Multi-tier system for digital radio communication. The multi-tier system has a first-tier base station with relatively long-range radio and has a second-tier base station with relatively short-range, low power and cheaper radios. The system can be more versatilely configured to meet demands of various applications. The application may include data capture using bar code readers, radio frequency readers and other automatic data capture devices. The system may also be used to control hotel door locks, individual room temperature control, remote video monitoringâ€”all without having to wire and with much flexibility given the two types of radios employed.

No. 09\/483,167, filed on Jan. 14, 2000.","A. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to multi-tier wireless communications architecture, applications and methods of using wireless units having differing communication functionalities and ranges.","B. Description of the Related Art","Each year more electronic devices are being deployed in a wider variety of commercial areas. In particular, data acquisition devices, such as bar code scanners, hand held terminals and radio frequency identification (\u201cRFID\u201d) readers, are being adopted to speed up commercial operations and are a standard fixture in inventory tracking environments, as well as in many consumer businesses. With wide deployment of these electronic devices across manufacturing, inventory, and retail sales areas, there has been an increasingly strong demand for wireless connectivity between the data acquisition units and the corporate local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d). In response, various wireless solution vendors have come up with systems using spread spectrum technologies in the 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz radio bands. Spread spectrum technologies are widely used in these applications because they can co-exist with other radio devices without causing significant interferences and thus do not require FCC licenses. Various examples and details of spread spectrum communication in these radio bands using base stations, access points and portable terminals are disclosed in the following patents assigned to Symbol Technologies, all of which patents are herein incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat. No. 5,815,811; U.S. Pat. No. 5,812,589; U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,803; U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,621; U.S. Pat. No. 5,479,441; U.S. Pat. No. 5,418,812; U.S. Pat. No. 5,280,498; U.S. Pat. No. 5,157,687; U.S. Pat. No. 5,142,550; U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,461; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,183.","Although they have relatively long ranges and are versatile, these spread spectrum radio transceivers, however, have been generally expensive. Furthermore, due to the expensive nature of these radios, the applications have been generally limited to the more expensive data capture devices. However, cheaper and shorter-range radio transceivers, when used in conjunction with longer-range radios (collectively forming a \u201cmulti-tier radio communications architecture\u201d), would have much broader applications heretofore unapplied, such as handheld terminals, price checkers, temperature and other sensors, hotel, school, and other door locks, and remote video cameras.","There also have been proposed multi-tier communication systems, such as the one disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,536, which is herein incorporated by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,536 shows wireless units with relatively long range participating in the \u201cpremises\u201d LAN and other wireless units with shorter range participating in the \u201cperipheral\u201d LAN. In such conventional systems the main communications are done through the \u201cpremises\u201d LAN, whereas in the \u201cperipheral\u201d LAN, wireless units are temporally formed (and dissolved) on an ad hoc basis for short communications such as for printing. Furthermore, the conventional systems generally require a coordination between the upper-tier radio communication protocol and the lower-tier radio communication protocol. These factors (i.e., need to accommodate ad hoc communications and protocol coordination between different tier units) generally contribute to a more expensive solution for the lower-tier radio transceiver. Moreover, U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,536 discloses only a few specific applications and does not disclose detailed applications of the multi-tier architecture discussed hereinbelow.","Therefore, the proposals of the related art fail to comprehensively overcome the problems discussed above and other related problems. Advantages of this invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.","In accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the invention comprises: a first-tier base station comprising a first radio transceiver operating in accordance with a first communication protocol, the first-tier base station connected to a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a second-tier base station comprising a second radio transceiver operating in accordance with a second communication protocol independent of the first communication protocol and the second-tier base station connected to the first-tier base station, a first-tier remote unit wirelessly connected to the first-tier base station through the first radio transceiver, and a second-tier remote unit wirelessly connected to the second-tier base station through the second radio transceiver.","In another embodiment of the invention, the invention comprises: a host connected to a local area network, a first-tier base station connected to the host through the local area network, the first-tier base station comprising a first radio transceiver for spread spectrum radio transmission in accordance with a first communication protocol, a second-tier base station comprising a second radio transceiver operating in accordance with a second communication protocol independent of the first communication protocol and the second-tier base station connected to the first-tier base station, a remote unit wirelessly connected to the second-tier base station through the second radio transceiver.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.","The overall nature of a Radio Packet Assembler\/Disassembler. (RadPad) system is intended to develop cordless devices that are application independent. Targeted for scanner, terminal, printer, cash register and wearable computer products, the RadPad can be easily integrated into system designs and provides industry standard mechanisms for both electrical and protocol interface.","RadPad implementations support RF communication capability across single (point-to-point) or multiple (point-to-multipoint) domains in a in a battery-powered environment facilitated by an integrated power management capability. The serial interface placed no restriction on the host operating system and can operate in any number of environments. Frame retries are managed automatically in the event of transmission errors. Additionally, frequency agility permits a RadPad to operated in a crowded RF environment by selecting an appropriately quiet frequency channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","112","110","120","122","124","140","142","144","152","154","164","166","174","176","178","184","186","188","190","160","162","170","171","172","180","181","182","183"]},"The wired backbone  could be any LAN, such as Ethernet, token ring, or token bus. Many of these LANs are now standardized by the IEEE: IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet), IEEE 802.4 (Token Bus), and IEEE 802.5 (Token Ring).","The first-tier base station could be any base station or access point readily available on the market. For example, WCCN Wireless Handbook\u2014RF Terminals & LANs (1997 Third Edition), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes at pp. 17\u201328, base stations used in vendor protocol dependent approach and access points in vendor protocol independent approach (or alternatively referred to as target protocol dependent approach).

Other base stations, such as  and , may be linked wirelessly to wired LAN  through base station . Wireless first-tier base stations  and  may be located away from the wired first-tier base station  in the range of a few to several hundred feet.","The second-tier station includes an RF transceiver meeting the following criteria: (1) the communication protocol of the second-tier base station must be independent of the protocol for the first-tier base station; (2) a relatively short range (5\u2013100 feet); and (3) low power. An example of an RF transceiver that could be used a second-tier base station is discussed in  and the corresponding text. Another such radio transceiver could be the Bluetooth radio under development. See Bluetooth Specification, version 0.9, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Second-tier base station  is linked to first-tier station  via a wired link  (or  or ). Wired links ,  and  could be any wired link. However, a preferred link would be a serial link, such as RS . A serial link, such as RS , is preferred because it is very cheap and ubiquitously available. Second-tier base station  is then wireless connected with another second-tier base station .

Through this multi-tier architecture, any of the wireless units may communicate with any other device on the network, including host  and other wireless units.","First-tier base station  and the related units attached thereto illustrate another configuration. First-tier base station  is wirelessly connected to wired LAN  via first-tier base station  by relatively long-range radio. First-tier base station  is also connected to a second-tier base station  by a wired link .

Each floor of the hotel would generally have one first-tier base station, and a plurality of second-tier base stations will be linked serially and in parallel to the first-tier base station. For example, second-tier base stations ,  and  are linked serially to first-tier base station , whereas second-tier base stations  and  are linked to first-tier base station  in parallel. Second-tier base stations  and  may be linked to first-tier base station  by wire as discussed in . In the alternative, second-tier base stations may be integrally encased with the first-tier station as in . It will be understood that any one of the configurations discussed in conjunction with  may be used in the embodiment shown in .","Each door lock (generally the main door) for each room would be a wireless unit with a wireless communication module. For example, door lock  includes a wireless communication module  for communication with second-tier base station , ,  or . Door lock  also includes additional circuitry: a sensor for detecting conditions of the door (open or closed); locking mechanism which, in response to the control signals from the front desk (or the administrator) transmitted to the door lock through wireless communication module , is adapted to configure the lock mechanism as needed.","One operation of this system is follows. A hotel guest would arrive at the front desk. The guest is checked in and the guest is given a door key  in the form of a card, programmed by a programming unit . Programming unit  may be a magstripe type or punch hole type or any other programmable key. Front desk computer  would program a unique code to key , depending on the room being assigned and a password. Preferably, at the time of such programming, front desk computer would also communicate with the door lock of the room being assigned via wired LAN , first-tier base station  and one or more second-tier base stations, thereby programming the door lock at the time the guest is being checked in. This ability to program each room door wirelessly allows a lot of flexibility. For example, after guest walks up to the room he or she is assigned, the guest realizes that he or she wants another room (perhaps the room is a smoking room and he or she wants a non-smoking room, or vice versa). In this situation, the guest would could call the front desk from the room initially assigned and request another room. The front desk personnel would be able to assign a new room to the guest and communicate with the door lock of the new room being assigned to accept the guest's existing key. In this way, the guest can use the key he or she already has and does not need to even come down to the front desk.","In another use of the system, the wirelessly controlled door locks may also be useful in emergency situations. For example, the doors of all the rooms (or of certain sections of the hotel) may automatically become unlocked during a fire so that the hotel, fire-fighter or other emergency personnel may easily get to individual guest rooms.","Also, the door locks may be continuously monitored through the network for security purposes. For example, if a door is left open for any extended period of time, a security guard may be sent to the room to check to see if any","While the application of  is particularly useful in a hotel environment, other applications also possible. For example, in light of the increase in school violence, security has become a top concern for schools and local communities. Applying the system of the present invention to the school environment, all the doors into a school building may be easily monitored by relatively few people. A security guard may be quickly dispatched to any door that is not supposed to stay open. Similar applications may be used in hospitals, banks, retail and convenience stores, private homes and businesses.","In another variation of the embodiment disclosed in , in addition to the door locks, wireless units may be thermostat controls in individual guest rooms. In this embodiment, each thermostat control in each guest room would include a wireless communication module for communication with a second-tier base station. The second-tier base station would either directly or indirectly through a series of other second-tier base stations link with a first-tier base station, which in turn is directly or indirectly connected to a wired LAN. In this way, the temperatures in guest rooms may be individually monitored and controlled. This feature would be useful in a variety of ways: (1) Energy savings: The hotel could realize substantial energy saving by having the vacant room immediately go into energy saving mode as soon as the guest checks out until the next check in; (2) Flexible control: The hotel could even provide customized temperature setting (e.g., relatively warm, standard or relatively cold) in advance for guests so that upon arrival in their assigned rooms, the room temperature will be already pleasant for the particular guest. A guest's temperature preference may be obtained: (1) when the guest makes the room reservation; (2) in a survey during a check-out for the next visit; or (3) monitored electronically using the thermostat monitors and wireless modules of the present invention for next visit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["510","520","540","530","520","530"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","690","650","652","640","670","610","620","610","660","640","610","640","610","660","620","680","670","640"]},"The video surveillance system of  may be used in conjunction with the system described in .

Introduction.","2.1 RadPad Functional Overview.","The RADPAD system is a discrete, embedded, & low-cost PCB product designed for support of wireless communication for cordless devices without requiring the traditional full LAN software stacks. RADPAD is intended for portable, battery powered equipment and therefore, includes a power management design feature. RADPAD is a compound device that combines a radio (ISO physical layer) along with software which runs the RADPAD protocol (ISO Data Link layer) on a digital section that is \u201chost\u201d accessed via a standard serial interface. Serial port access to configuration and data link services uses either (1) the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frame format for transferring data on and off the RADPAD unit or (2) asynchronous character serial I\/O with support for \u201ccommand\u201d and \u201cdata\u201d modes.","The RADPAD protocol functionality and serial application programming interface (API) are specified herein. The API is defined by the interface to the serial port as discussed in Section 4. The electrical interface is specified by the serial connector as discussed in Section 5 and RF (antenna) connector as discussed in Section 7.","The RADPAD API defines both configuration commands and data formats. The commands allow a hosting device to configure RADPAD parameters such as RF channel, addresses, error control, and timing parameters. Any data sent to the serial port will be sent across the radio link to another RADPAD selected by the user. Discrimination between data and command streams is achieved by selected PPP frame elements or current device mode as described in Section 3.","The RADPAD RF data rate is 50 Kbps and is capable of a minimum range of 50+ feet (typical open environment) with low power consumption (1 mW & 10 mW). The RADPAD radio provides frequency tuning from 2400 to 2500 MHz in 1 MHz increments. The large number of channels provides a means for avoiding interference and therefore ensures a reliable RF connection over the entire RF range. Single frequency radios have no means of avoiding interference and therefore are subject to dramatic reduction in range without recourse.","The addressability of any one station can be extended by compounding BSS entities that utilize the \u201crepeater\u201d capability of a base. This extends the effective range of any station in communicating with a designated BSSID to beyond the 50+ foot radius. In this configuration, each station is associated with a particular base, but the final destination of the frames may be an ESS base or any other station that is accessible through the local base that is acting as a repeater. (see ).","2.2. RadPad Implementation Perspective","While several alternative implementations are possible, the following could be one implementation.","2.2.1 RadPad Hardware Interface\u2014","The host system must provide 5 volt DC power to the board for serial and radio enabling. The host system must be able to properly interface with the 10 pin serial connector interface. The host system must provide an adequate antenna for the RF interface. Symbol's units have a built-in on-board antenna, but is not intended to support maximum range applications. Configuration with a 2.4 GHz high gain antenna will maximize the effective range.","2.2.2 RadPad Software Interfaces\u2014","The host system must be able to properly configure the RadPad from persistent information known to the host. The host system must provide a mechanism for inputting the (1) client\/base operating frequency; (2) the ES identification to which it will belong; and (3) the target \u201cpartner\u201d user ID. The host system may also, optionally, wish to support remote management of devices in the ESS.","3. Protocol Description","3.1 Basic Service Area","The basic cordless network cell is called a BSA (Basic Service Area). A collection of stations within a BSA that are associated with a common CB or base form a Basic Service Set(BSS). The size of a cell is dependent on the environment and the characteristics of the wireless transceivers. Each BSS has a unique identifier (BSSID) were the BSSID is the NodelD of the cordless base with the addition of a single byte chosen by the base each time it is powered up.","3.2 Cordless Station","This component is the application agent that utilizes the RADPAD as a communication link. Provision is made in the design of the station to specify the designated ESSID of the base (typically, via scanning a special bar code). When powered up and properly configured, the RADPAD will: (a) associate with the target base (matching the ESSID values) and (b) provide best-effort datagram transmission and reception across the radio link to a designated \u201cpartner\u201d. By design, the associations and link state information will be preserved across RadPad power cycles.","3.3 Cordless Bases","A Cordless Base (or base) is always present in a cordless cell and provides the following basic functionality: (a) Association functions which allow a station to join a particular base's BSS; (b) Synchronization functions which ensure that all stations currently associated with the base are synchronized on a common clock. This synchronization is used, for example, in supporting repeater and power management; (c) Frame buffering and other associated power-management functions for power-conserving stations; (d) Application gateway services to any attached \u201chost\u201d device; and (e) Manage ESS associations. A repeater base is also a station to a superior BSSID and will forward messages to this address if the local addressing cannot be resolved. The base is the essential element in the operation of a BSS and must be the first device activated. Should this component lose power or fail for any reason, the entire BSS will fail, requiring a re-association of each station upon reactivation. For this reason, implementation of the base system should consider fault tolerant elements to minimize operational problems.","3.4 Basic RadPad Protocol Architecture","RadPad uses positive acknowledgments for detection and retransmission of lost frames. Since multiple frames are often involved in a single exchange, the concept of a MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) is introduced. An MPDU may, for example, constitute either Data and ACK frames. There is provision for support of broadcast frames (e.g., Beacons) which require no acknowledgment. There is no support for multicast addressing.","There is no notion of a \u201csession\u201d or \u201cvirtual circuit\u201d supported by this architecture. Only datagram transport reliability is assured by the RadPad, and that only if the MAC protocol is not called upon to forward frames.","3.5 MAC Acknowledgments","The MAC-level Acknowledgment allows the detection of a lost frame and recovery by retransmission at the MAC level transparent to the application level. All data transmissions use the Request\/Response (Data+ACK) architecture, except for broadcast frames sent to stations. The singular exception is broadcast frames which are generated by stations and are to be forwarded by a base will be acknowledged by the base.","Since MAC-level acknowledgments and re-transmissions are implemented, there is the possibility that a frame may be received more than once. Such duplicate frames are filtered out by the receiving MAC. Duplicate frame filtering is facilitated through the inclusion of a Sequence field within the Data and ACK frames.","RADPAD station is designed such that the association state and frame sequence number is preserved across RADPAD power cycles. This design optimizes performance of the host device and minimizes power consumption.","If no acknowledgment is received within a predetermined \u201cAcknowledgment Window\u201d (approximately 3 milliseconds) after a frame has been transmitted, the original frame is retransmitted. This process will continue until a configurable number of re-transmissions has been reached.","Confirmation or error indications are returned to the data source as discussed in Section 4 below.","3.6 Time Synchronization","A critical function within RADPAD is the synchronization of time among all stations within a BSS. This is used for important functions such as power management.","The base is the timing master and performs the Timing Synchronization Function (TSF). To synchronize the stations in a BSS, the base sends out periodic frames called Beacons. Receiving stations coordinate all of their activities to the arrival of these frames.","3.7 Power Management","An essential part of the RADPAD is the ability to conserve station power consumption as much as possible. This is achieved by the following architectural features: Synchronize all stations operating in Power Save Mode within a BSS. Allow stations to power down their transceivers for most of the time. Temporarily buffer frames for \u201csleeping\u201d stations at the base. Announce the buffered frames to the stations at regular predetermined intervals, so that a station can sleep until it wishes to hear such an announcement, at which point it can take steps to ensure that any buffered frames are properly received.","The basic approach is for the base to temporarily buffer frames for stations will only transmit them in response to a poll from the station. The stations which have buffered frames within the base are identified in a Traffic Indication Map (TIM), which is periodically generated by the base as an element within a Beacon. A station may determine that a frame is buffered for it by listening to a TIM and can then take action to ensure that the frame is forwarded from the base.","Beacons (with TIMs) are periodically generated by the base, separated by a specified time interval; \u201cBeacon Interval\u201d (which is a BSS parameter known by all stations within the BSS upon association with the base). Stations will transmit a Poll frame to the base, which will respond by transmitting the corresponding buffered frame.","It is anticipated that different networks may set the Beacon Interval to different values depending upon the nature of the applications being supported. Because it is a key architectural element, proper establishment of the Beacon Interval greatly impacts observed performance.","3.8 TIM Transmissions","Beacons containing a TIM are sent at regular intervals and will identify the stations for which traffic is pending and buffered in the base. This information is coded in a virtual bitmap. To allow efficient coding, every station is assigned a Station ID code (SID) by the base as part of the \u201cassociation\u201d process. The TIM will identify those stations for which frames are buffered by setting bits in the virtual bitmap which correspond to the appropriate SIDs.","3.9 Blackout Interval","In the case of systems with a battery-powered base, the base may also need to conserve its own power. This will involve powering itself down for certain specific intervals. The base can inform the stations when it is going to be powered down. This information is conveyed in a Blackout Interval element carried in a Beacon frame, which identifies the start and end points of the Blackout Interval.","Stations will not transmit during the Blackout Interval. If a station does not hear a particular Beacon and consequently does not know the Blackout Interval, it carried in a Beacon frame. For systems which are not concerned with base power management the Blackout Interval can be set so the base is constantly powered and therefore always able to receive a packet. The stations are therefore able to send at anytime except when the base is sending a Beacon. This state is optimal for overall BSS performance.","3.10 Address Assignment","Each station has a unique 24 bit (3 bytes) identifier called it's NodelD. When a station associates with the base, it must first know the ESSID of the base (via a mechanism which is outside the scope of this document; the user can configure the ESSID's of both the station and the base). After receiving an Associate Command, the station RADPAD waits for a Beacon from a base whose ESSID matches the station's assigned ESSID value. When it finds one, the station generates an Associate Request addressed to that base and containing it's own NodelD. The base generates an Associate Response and it serves as the acknowledgment to the station's Associate Request transmission. The Associate Response uses a broadcast destination address field, but is only interpreted by the station with the designated NodelD.","The basic association process is the following sequence. The station determines its ESSID through a process external to this specification and the station ESSID is programmed by the ESSID Command. After receiving an Associate Command, the station waits for a beacon to find out the BSSID of a base that has been assigned the same ESSID as the station. Then it generates an Associate Request, using the ESSID and BSSID it has discovered, and including its NodelD within the frame body. Base returns an Associate Response to the station with the Beacon Interval within the frame body. This frame is not acknowledged. If the station does not receive an Associate Response, it will retry the Associate Request (up to a configurable maximum number of times).","Station configuration and association information is stored in Non Volatile Memory. Associations once made, remain valid until the Initialize Command is executed.","When a station may have an assigned ESSID, but doesn't know the frequency, the RADPAD provides the \u201cFind Base Channel\u201d function. This station operation will scan through the available frequency ranges to detect Beacons of the proper ESSID. Once a proper frequency is detected, a station may freely associate with this base.","By design, a station will \u201cassociate\u201d with a matching base if not already associated at power on. These \u201cassociations\u201d are designed to be persistent from the station's point of view, that is, regardless of Power State, the relation will be preserved. Base's, however, cannot afford to preserve associations across power cycles and will require a re-association at each base power cycle. This operation is only 400\u2013500 milliseconds in duration.","Stations that are associated with one base and relocate to associate with another base within the ESS, will have their original association deleted automatically. This feature of the RADPAD protocol conserves resources and ensures that the repeater\/router functionality is reliable.","3.11 Association Management","Any successful communication within a BSS requires an \u201cassociation\u201d between the station and a base. This association relation provides proper address accessibility, repeater access, timing synchronization, and queued frame announcing. The Station\/Base association is, thus a key architectural element in the RADPAD design paradigm. The following paragraphs will describe how this key function is managed within a BSS.","Association is initiated by a station once it receives a Beacon from the appropriate base, i.e., one that is assigned to the proper ESS Service Set. This negotiation \u201cbinds\u201d the station to  the base and is persistent as long as the station does not explicitly \u201cdisassociate\u201d, re-associate with another base in the ESS, or the base is rebooted. In this manner, once a station has successfully \u201cassociated\u201d, this relation endures even across power cycles of the station itself. In the situation where a station is powered down and queued frames are dropped by the base, the association remains active. In an active state, should the station be unable to receive or detect any Beacons from its base, the station will report a communications error.","When a station leaves a BSS and re-associates with another base within the ESS, the new base will announce to it's peers this state change, and the original base (if in the same ESS) will automatically \u201cdisassociate\u201d the station. In this manner, a station only has to associate with a base once and the management service functions are the responsibility of the base code.","4. RadPad API","The interface firmware for RADPAD is provided in one of two formats: (a) RS-232 Serial emulation mode (Modal); and (b) PPP frame mode (Modeless). These options are provided to the integrator to select the simplest option for integrating into the target system. For both interface options, the maximum data frame size is 253 bytes.","The serial emulation provides for the simplest, non-protocol dependent implementation option. Once configured, the RADPAD will behave exactly like a standard asynchronous serial I\/O device (such as a modem). The simplicity of this approach is offset by the modality architecture imposed to affect configuration.","The PPP interface option supports a modeless interface, whereby commands and data frames may be freely interleaved. Additionally, this mode provides support for remote configuration, a feature not supported in the serial interface mode.","4.1 Serial Interface Support","If the RADPAD is in data mode, the unit powers up in a data ready mode. Any data transmitted or received in this mode will be treated as data to be transmitted\/received between the addressed devices. Data frames will be constructed at transmitted based on either a time basis or on buffer fill conditions. It will be the responsibility of the receiving entity to re-assemble any logical \u201cframe\u201d structures to be processed by the receiving application.","Command mode is activated by transmitting a \u201cbreak\u201d character to the RADPAD. In this mode all data sent to the RADPAD will be interpreted as a command string and must conform to the syntax described in the following sections. Exiting back to data mode is achieved by issuing the \u201cD\/\u201d character sequence.","4.2 PPP Interface Support","The RADPAD system accepts Command and Data frames on its serial port encapsulated in PPP format framing. RADPAD recognizes three RADPAD specified protocols running above PPP:","(a) RadPad Data Protocol (RDP). This protocol is used when application data frames are to be transmitted from the local RadPad to its communications partner. No actions will be invoked by the RadPad other than to reformat the frame and transmit it.","(b) RadPad Command Protocol (RCP). This protocol permits the local host system to issue configuration commands to the RadPad. Content in these frames is strictly for local operations and results in no data being transmitted.","(c) RadPad Remote Command Protocol (RRCP). This protocol affords the RadPad client the ability to configure any other RadPad with which it can communicate. This feature provides a straightforward mechanism for centralized configuration management within a BSS.","4.3 RDP Protocol","The RADPAD system sends any data received on the serial port in RDP frames over the radio to partner configured for the RADPAD. When data frames are received from the radio, the data is encapsulated in RDP frames and sent out through the, serial port.","All RDP and RRCP frames must be no more that 253 bytes in size. There is no fragmentation\/defragmentation services provided with the RADPAD. Such functionality will be the responsibility of the RADPAD \u201chost\u201d application. Frames larger than the maximum size will be rejected.","When a RADPAD sends a frame of data on the radio link and receives an acknowledgment for that frame, it will send a plus sign (\u2018+\u2019) embedded in an RCP frame out the serial port. If a frame of data is not acknowledged, after the requisite number of MAC retries, then the RADPAD will send an pound sign (\u2018#\u2019) embedded in an RCP frame out of the serial port to indicate failure.","4.4 RCP and RRCP Protocols","This section describes the commands and responses used by the RADPAD system. All commands must be embedded in the RCP protocol (to be executed locally) or in the RRCP protocol (to be executed remotely). Responses are embedded in the same protocol format as the command was sent.","Each command is a single ASCII character, followed in some cases by further ASCII characters that act as parameters to the command, terminated by a forward slash. The RADPAD system responds to RADPAD commands with ASCII characters, as described in the subsections below. All commands and parameters are case-insensitive. No command may be more than 16 characters long, although multiple commands may be combined into a single RCP or RRCP frame. If the RADPAD finds 16 characters without a forward slash terminating the command, then it will discard all the characters, and send an ASCII  .","Except as noted in the descriptions of the individual commands, the RADPAD system responds to each command with either an ASCII \u20180\u2019, to indicate that it received a valid command and has acted upon it, or an ASCII \u20181\u2019, to indicate that it did not perform the command, because the command was invalid, because it had invalid parameters, or because the command could not be executed given the current state of the RADPAD. These characters are always enveloped in the RCP or RRCP protocol. The possible error conditions are described with each command in the subsections below.","When a RADPAD sends an RRCP frame on the radio and receives an acknowledgment for that frame, it will send a plus sign (\u2018+\u2019) embedded in an RRCP frame out of the serial port. If an RRCP frame is not acknowledged, even after the requisite number of MAC retries, then the pad will send an pound sign (\u2018#\u2019) embedded in an RCP frame out of the serial port to indicate failure.","If a RADPAD loses its association it will send an asterisk (\u2018*\u2019) embedded in an RCP frame out of the serial port. Associations are determined as \u201clost\u201d upon failure to hear five (5) consecutive Beacons or determine that the BSSID has changed since association.","Three configurations are maintained by each RADPAD. The first configuration is stored in nonvolatile memory and is maintained even if power is lost. When the power is applied, the configuration is read from the non-volatile memory and copied into the scratch configuration and the current configuration. Except for the Partner Command and the Mode Command, which change both the scratch configuration and the current configuration, the scratch configuration is the one that is changed by the various configuration commands described in the following subsections. The current configuration is the one that the node is using for its operations. The scratch configuration is copied to the non volatile memory or to the current configuration by the \u201cUse,\u201d Command.","5. Electrical Interface Specification","5.1 Pin Assignments","Pin 1: BCC\u20145 v supply voltage.","Pin 2: GND\u20140 volts return ground.","Pin 3: TX Data\u2014TTL level input, a 1 is indicated by a high TTL level.

This pin is pulled high on the board.","5.2 Power.","The radio requires a 5 volt +\/\u22125% source. The RadPad in receive mode requires a maximum of 125 mA from BCC. When in transmit mode a maximum of 50 mA is required from BCC. In sleep mode a maximum of 2\u20133 mA is required from BCC. The BCC noise should be below 100 mV RMS.","When running with the RadPad protocol, power consumption is reduced dramatically. Power consumption with the RadPad protocol depends on sleep time and beacon intervals, which are configurable.","6. Mechanical Specification","6.1 Antenna Connector","Options exist for an onboard antenna, a coaxial connector or custom connection to a plated hole. The onboard antenna is located at one end of the radio PCB. The onboard antenna is useful if the antenna can be placed so it effectively radiates away from the device. The coaxial connector is used when a coaxial cable is necessary because of antenna mounting considerations. The end of the PCB has provision for a coaxial connector for antenna attachment. If the coaxial connector is not installed, the antenna can be attached to the PCB hole left vacant by the coaxial connector. This is useful when the antenna can be located close to the radio.","7.
