title: Method and apparatus for determining interactive electromagnetic effects among conductors of a multi-layer circuit
abstract: To estimate a distribution of voltages or currents in the layers of a multi-layer circuit, an exemplary current flow in each layer is discretized into a number of current vector elements and at least one scalar charge element related to the charge associated with each current vector element. A first distribution of voltages induced in each circuit layer is determined from current vector elements in all of the circuit layers. A second distribution of voltages induced in each circuit layer is determined from the scalar charge elements in all of the circuit layers. For each circuit layer, the first and second distributions of voltages induced therein are combined to determine an actual distribution of voltages in the circuit layer.

induced on each layer of a multi-layer circuit due to current flowing in conductors in the various layers of the circuit and in vias connecting conductors in pairs of adjacent layers of the circuit. At the expense of some accuracy, the present invention enables the voltages induced on the various layers of the circuit due to current flowing in conductors on the various layers and in vias extending between adjacent layers to be determined in a more computational efficient manner than prior art techniques. Because of the computationally efficiency accorded by the present invention, the voltages induced on each layer of a multi-layer circuit due to current flowing in said layer and in other layers of the circuit is capable of being determined. This is a vast improvement over the prior art wherein due to computational complexity, the voltages induced in one layer of a multi-layer circuit due to current flowing in the other layers of the multi-layer circuit could not be determined efficiently.","The present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment. Obvious modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description.
