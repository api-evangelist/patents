The government may have certain rights in the invention","The invention provides compostions and methods for inducing the formation of an induced pluripotential stem (iPS) cell from a somatic cell in order to treat a disease or condition in a subject. Specifically, the invention provides inducing the formation of iPS cell from a somatic cell by contacting the somatic cell with a microRNA (miR) 302-367 is cluster or a miR 302-367 cluster mimic.","Embryonic stem (ES) cells are stem cells established from early embryos which may be cultured over a long period of time while maintaining pluripotentiality; i.e. the ability to differentiate into any cell type of the body. Using these properties, human embryonic stem cells may be used for cell transplantation therapies for various diseases such as Parkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes, leukemia, and other debilitating human diseases. However, transplantation of ES cells may result in rejection in the same manner as organ transplantation. Moreover, from an ethical viewpoint, there are many who contest the use of ES cells, which are established by destroying human embryos.","If dedifferentiation of patients' own differentiated somatic cells could be induced to establish cells having pluripotency and growth ability similar to those of ES cells (hereinafter, \u201cinduced pluripotent stem cells\u201d or \u201ciPS cells,\u201d), they would not only offer the prospect of producing patient-specific cells but also circumvent the ethical conundrum that surrounds the isolation of human embryonic stem (ES) cells from early embryos.","Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been generated using Oct3\/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (SOKM; Takahashi et al., Cell 126:663-76, 2006). However, published methods for nuclear reprogramming mediated by the introduction of genes are challenged by low efficiency, in which only a small number of induced pluripotent stem cells can be obtained, and by a slow time course (>7 days). In addition, some of the factors are oncogenic (c-Myc and others). Therefore, a method of generating iPS cells from somatic cells for gene therapy and other uses at high efficiency while avoiding the use of tumorogenic factors is lacking in the art.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNA molecules (\u02dc21-25 nt) that to regulate gene expression by targeting one or more mRNAs for translational repression or cleavage. They are small inhibitory RNAs capable of suppressing the translation of target genes with high complementarity. Several thousand miRNAs have been identified in organisms as diverse as viruses, worms, and primates through cloning or computational prediction.","The miR-302-367 cluster has high intracellular abundance and is cell type specific to embryonic stem cells. This miRNA-302-367 cluster was initially identified from cDNA libraries generated by directional cloning using size-fractionated RNA (17-26 nt) from undifferentiated hESCs. This cluster is codified in the human chromosome 4 and comprises nine different miRNAs co-transcribed in a polycistronic manner: miR-302a, miR-302a*, miR-302b, miR-302b*, miR-302c, miR-302c*, miR-302d, miR-367 and miR-367*. The miR-302 family contains seven miRNAs with a highly conserved 5\u2032 region. The miR-302-367 cluster was first identified to be expressed in mESC, hESC and in their malignant counterparts hECCs.","The miR-302-367 genes can target over 445 human genes, most of which are developmental signals involving the initiation and\/or facilitation of lineage-specific cell differentiation during early human embryogenesis. These target genes are listed in the target prediction sites linked to the miRBase::Sequences program at the Sanger website, including TARGETSCAN and PICTAR-VERT.","It is unknown if the miR-302-367 cluster can reprogram normal somatic cells at high efficiency. There exists a need for improved miRNA-based compositions and methods for inducing pluripotent cells.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of inducing the formation of an induced pluripotential stem (iPS) cell from a somatic cell, the method comprising contacting said somatic cell with a composition comprising a) an isolated nucleic acid comprising a microRNA (miR) 302-367 cluster or a miR 302-367 cluster mimic and optionally b) valproic acid.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of inducing the formation of a differentiated cell of interest from a somatic cell, the method comprising contacting said somatic cell with a composition comprising a) an isolated nucleic acid comprising a microRNA (miR) 302-367 cluster and optionally b) valproic acid, thereby inducing the formation of an induced pluripotential stem (iPS) cell and then contacting said iPS cell with a composition for inducing differentiation of said iPS cell into said differentiated cell of interest","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of increasing the is efficiency of nuclear reprogramming of a somatic cell, comprising contacting said somatic cell with a composition comprising a) an isolated nucleic acid comprising a microRNA (miR) 302-367 cluster and optionally b) valproic acid.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a disease or condition in a subject comprising 1) contacting a somatic cell with a composition comprising a) an isolated nucleic acid comprising a microRNA (miR) 302-367 cluster and optionally b) valproic acid, to yield an induced pluripotential stem (iPS) cell; 2) growing additional iPS cells; 3) inducing differentiation of said iPS cells, 4) contacting said subject with said differentiated cells, thereby treating said disease or condition in said subject.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a disease or condition in a subject comprising 1) contacting said subject with a composition comprising a) an isolated nucleic acid comprising a microRNA (miR) 302-367 cluster and optionally b) valproic acid, to induce the local formation of induced pluripotential stem (iPS) cells, and 2) inducing differentiation of said iPS cells into a healthy cell lineage, thereby treating said disease in said subject.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides an iPS cell produced by a method comprising contacting a somatic cell with a composition comprising a) an isolated nucleic acid comprising a microRNA (miR) 302-367 cluster or a miR 302-367 cluster mimic and optionally b) valproic acid, under conditions sufficient to produce an iPS cell from the somatic cell.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides a composition comprising a) an isolated nucleic acid comprising a microRNA (miR) 302-367 cluster or a miR 302-367 cluster mimic and optionally b) valproic acid.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description examples and figures.

They should in no way be construed, however, as limiting the is broad scope of the invention. Methods for performing the experiments are well known to those skilled in the art.","miR302-376 iPS Induction Experiments","The 690 bp fragment of the mouse or 644 bp of the human miR302-367 region, which is embedded in intron X of the Larp7 gene, was expressed using lentiviral vectors using constitutive or doxycycline inducible vectors. 2 mM valproic acid was added to enhance the stability and efficiency of the reprogramming.","Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were infected with the lentivirus encoding the miR302-367 for 48 hours. A defined number of infected MEFs were plated on mitomycin inactivated feeder cells (either MEFs or STO cells) and the cells cultured in standard tissue culturing conditions (5% CO, 37\u00b0 C.). Infected cells were visualized under phase contract or fluorescent microscopy.","The efficiency of colony formation in miR302-367 lentivirus-transduced fibroblast cells was more than 20% (50,000 MEFs transduced for all groups) by day 4 post viral transduction () compared to an average of 0.1% for iPS cells generated using Oct3\/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (Takahashi et al., Cell 126:663-76, 2006; \u201c4 factor\u201d). Moreover, colonies were observed at day 4 in lentivirus-transduced fibroblast cells compared to after 7-14 days in 4 factor-generated iPS cells.","Alkaline Phosphatase Staining","Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4\u00b0 C. over night. PFA was removed and cells washed twice with PBS+0.1% Tween-20 (PBT) for 5 min at room temperature (RT); in 50% methanol\/50% PBT for 15 min at RT; and in 100% methanol twice for 15 min at RT. Cells were rinsed twice with PBT for 5 min at RT, equilibrated with NTMT (100 mM Tris pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% is Tween-20) with 3 rinses (5 min twice and 30 min) at RT. Cells were incubated in staining solution (168 mg 4-Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and 84.5 mg 5-Bromo-4-chloro-8-indolilphosphate (BCIP) per 1 ml of NTMT for 40-120 min and then washed with PBT 3 times.","Immunohistochemistry","Tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The samples were washed sequentially with 1\u00d7PBS, methanol, isopropanol and tetrahydronaphthalene before embedded in paraffin wax. The embedded samples were then cut on a microtome at 7-10 \u03bcm thickness and mounted on clean TESPA-coated slides. Then, the slides were dewaxed with xylene and mounted under coverslips using mounting media (Richard Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, Mich.) and stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E, Sigma) for morphological observation. Immunohistochemical staining kits were purchased from Imgenex (San Diego, Calif.). Processes for antibody dilution and immunostaining were performed according to the manufacturers' suggestions. Primary antibodies used included Nanog (1:500, Santa Cruz), Oct3\/4 (1:500, Santa Cruz), and Sox2 (1:500, Santa Cruz). Fluorescent dye-labeled goat anti-rabbit or horse anti-mouse antibody was used as the secondary antibody (1:2,000, Invitrogen\u2014Molecular Probes). Positive results were observed under a 100\u00d7 microscope with whole field scanning and measured at 200\u00d7 or 400\u00d7 magnification for quantitative analysis by a Metamorph Imaging program (Nikon 80i and TE2000 microscopic quantitation systems). DAPI (Invitrogen) was used as a nuclear counterstain.","Mir302-367 iPS cells were able to form compact colonies reminiscent of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells after 10 days in suspension (). Alkaline phosphatase is a stem cell membrane marker and elevated expression of this enzyme is associated with undifferentiated pluripotent stem cell. iPS cells express alkaline phosphatase 21 days after lentiviral infection (). iPS cells also express the pluripotent markers Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and SSEA-1 in the nucleus after 21 days of reprogramming at the same level as do mouse embryonic stem cells (). In a series of quantitative expression analyses for pluripotential marker genes using real time PCR, Sox2, nanog, Fgf4, and Dnmt3b levels using the miR302\/367 method of reprogramming fibroblasts are at least two orders of magnitude higher than the standard 4 factor (4F) method of reprogramming fibroblasts ().","Similarly, MEFs isolated from the Oct4-GFP mouse line were transduced with the miR302-367 lentivirus GFP detected 6 days after viral infection. Approximately 80% of colonies with an embryonic stem cell like morphology expressed Oct4-GFP ().","In Vitro Molecular Guidance of the miR-Infected iPS Cell Differentiation","Xenograft implantation of the miR-infected iPS cells into the uterus or peritoneal cavity, but not other tissues, of a 6-wk-old female pseudopregnant, immunocompromised SCID-beige mouse could form a cyst full of teratoma-like primordial tissues. Immunocompromised nude mice provided an in vivo environment mimicking transplantation therapy. The pseudopregnant mice are made by intraperitoneally injection of 1 IU human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) for 2 d and then human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) for one more day. For in vitro molecular guidance into spermatogonia lineage, miR-infected iPS cells are maintained on polyornithine\/laminin-coated dishes in DMEM\/F12 (1:1; high glucose) medium supplemented with charcoal-stripped 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 ng\/mL activin, and 50 ng\/mL dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 12 h at 37\u00b0 C. under 5% CO. Then the cells are trypsinized, washed with 1\u00d7PBS, and collected in four aliquots of chilled Matrigel (100 \u03bcL each) and one aliquots of 100 \u03bcL, 1\u00d7PBS. Immediately after that, cells are transplanted into the hind limb muscle, peritoneum, uterus, subcutaneous neck skin (with Matrigel), and tail vein (with PBS) of 6-wk-old athymic immunocompromised SCID-beige nude mice. The mice are anesthetized with diethyl ether during experimental processing.","One week later, spermatogonia-like cells are found only in the uterus area. For fibroblast differentiation, we follow the same procedure as shown above, except using regular phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 ng\/mL noggin, and 100 ng\/mL transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) for 6 h before xenotransplantation. Fibroblast-like cells are found in the uterus 1 wk later. For chondrocyte differentiation, we perform the same procedure as before but using regular to RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 ng\/mL bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) for 6 h. Chondrocyte-like cells are found only in the liver area.","These data confirm that miR302-367 iPS cells can make mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm cell lineages.","miR302\/367 iPS cells were generated from MEFs from Rosa26 mice constitutively expressing lacZ. These cells were injected into E3.5 mouse blastocytes, and the embryos were harvested at E10.5 and stained for lacZ expression. The embryo that was generated from the Rosa26 miR302\/367 iPS cells, is almost entirely blue (, left), indicating that miR302-367 iPS cells can generate all of the organs and tissues in vertebrates. The sample shown on the left represents 11 positive (blue) chimeras from a total of 24 embryos tested.","Somatic cells from embryos or adult mouse tissue are then harvested and the expression of reprogramming factors is re-induced, forming a secondary iPS cell population. A variety of tissue types are assessed for their reprogramming potential","Electroporation, lipofection, gene guns, and microinjection are used to transfect cells as is known in the art with miR302-367.","Next, MEFs will be exposed to miR302-367 mimics ordered from Dharmacon allowing a viral and transfection free method for iPS cell generation. MEFs take up miR302-367 mimics quickly and at high efficiency and express embryonic stem cell markers, as described in Example 2 hereinabove.","The expression of cardiac marker genes in miR302-367 iPS cells is examined by semiquantitative and kinetic real time-PCR. miR302-367 iPS cells are cultured with BMP-2 (Puceat et al., 2008) and ascorbic acid (Takahashi et al., 2003). Semiquantitative RT-PCR demonstrates that all cardiac markers tested, such as GATA4, Nkx2.5, \u03b1-MHC, \u03b2-MHC, and ANF, are increased in BMP-2-treated miR302-367 iPS cells compared to vehicle-exposed to miR302-367 iPS cells, whereas the expression of Tie-2, which is expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells, was not altered by BMP-2. These results suggest that miR302-367 iPS cells can differentiate into cardiac myocytes. In addition, immunoblot analysis is performed with antibodies against sarcomeric myosin and \u03b1-actinin. Treatment with BMP-2 increased the expression of these proteins in a dose-dependent manner compared is to untransfected miR302-367 iPS cells.","To create hematopoietic cells, miR302-367 iPS cells are exposed to mammalian hematopoietic stromal cells. At least some of the resulting cells are CD34+ (a standard marker for hematopoietic cells), or can form hematopoietic cell colony-forming units in methylcellulose culture.","One of the limitations of induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming is the relative inefficiency of the process. We show that expression of the miR302\/367 cluster rapidly and efficiently reprograms human and mouse somatic cells to an iPS state in the absence of Oct4\/Sox2\/Klf4\/Myc. Reprogramming is two orders of magnitude more efficient than standard Oct4\/Sox2\/Klf4\/Myc reprogramming miR302\/367 iPS cells display similar characteristics as Oct4\/Sox2\/Klf4\/Myc-iPS cells including the expression of pluripotent marker genes, teratoma formation, efficient generation of high percentage chimeric mice, and contribution to the germline. Within the miR302\/367 cluster, miR367 expression is required for iPS cell reprogramming by activating Oct4 gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that suppression of Hdac2, which is specifically degraded by valproic acid, is required for miR302\/367 mediated reprogramming.","In particular, we show that valproic acid (VPA) is required for reprogramming mouse fibroblasts by specifically degrading Hdac2 protein, a finding that is supported by the efficient reprogramming of Hdac2\u2212\/\u2212 fibroblasts in the absence of VPA. Thus, the expression of miR302\/367 along with Hdac2 suppression allows for highly efficient iPS reprogramming without the expression of the known reprogramming factors.","These data demonstrate the potent and cooperative role of miRNAs and Hdac mediated pathways in pluripotent stem cell reprogramming.","Materials and Methods","Lentiviral Vector Construction","A mouse genomic DNA fragment comprising of miR302\/367 or miR302a\/b\/c\/d family of miRNA was amplified by PCR using primers listed in Table 1. The amplified fragment was cloned into Acc65I and XhoI restriction enzyme sites of pENTR1-A entry vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. The fragment was excised from the entry vector and ligated into BsrGI site of pLOVE destination vector (Blelloch et al., 2007) is resulting in pLOVE-mi R302\/367 vector. The pLOVE-miR302a\/b\/c\/d vector was generated in the same fashion but using a different 3\u2032 primer that excluded the miR367 sequence.","Cell Culture, Viral Production and Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells","Mouse fibroblasts were isolated from Oct4-GFP, Rosa26-LacZ and Hdac2embryos at E13.5 and cultured in fibroblast medium as described (Takahashi et al., 2007). Hdac2 was excised by infection of Hdac2MEFs with adeno-cre virus. Human dermal fibroblast were cultured in DMEM\/F12, 15% FBS, penicillin\/streptomycin and L-glutamine. Viral particles were generated by transfection of plated 293T cells with pLOVE vectors encoding miR302\/367, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, or N-myc along with pMD.G and psPAX2 vectors as described (Blelloch et al., 2007). Supernatant from the transfected cells were collected every 24 hr for 48 hrs and titered. The titered viral suspension was mixed with 0.5 \u03bcl (0.1 of 10 \u03bcg\/mL polybrene (American Bioanalytical, MA) per milliliter of viral suspension and used to infect fibroblasts. After viral infection, mouse fibroblast were cultured in mouse ES medium supplemented with or without valproic acid at a final concentration of 2 mM for the indicated length of time. Infected human fibroblast were culture in human ES medium as described (Huangfu et al., 2008a; Takahashi et al., 2007).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0162"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Summary of clones tested for pluripotency.

Secondary antibodies are Alexa Fluor 488 and 568 (Invitrogen). The mounting medium used was Vectorshield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Alkaline phosphatase histochemical staining was performed using SIGMAFAST Fast Red TR\/Naphtol AS-MX tablets following manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich).","RNA Isolation, Quantitative RT-PCR, and Microarray Experiments","Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using Superscript First Stand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) by 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Real time primer sequences are listed in Table 1. For microarray experiments, the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays were used. Microarray data were analyzed using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Partek Genomics Suite v6.5.","Teratoma Formation and DNA Fingerprinting Analysis","mR302\/367 iPS cells were passaged twice on 0.1% gelatin coated plates for an hour to remove feeders. 5\u00d710cells were mixed with Matrigel and injected into each flank of NOD-SCID mice. Tumors were harvested at 4 weeks post-injection, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sectioned tumors were stained for hematoxylin and eosin. For immunofluoresence staining, the primary antibodies were 13-111 tubulin (Abeam), MF-20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and E-cadherin (Cell Signaling). Genomic DNA from human miR302\/367 iPS cell clones was used for DNA fingerprinting analysis (Cell Line Genetics, LLC, Madison, Wis.).","Generation of Mouse Chimeras with miR302\/367 iPS Cell Clones","miR302\/367 iPS cells were generated using Rosa26-LacZ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Friedrich and Soriano, 1991). The cells were passaged twice on 0.1% gelatin coated plates for an hour to remove feeders and injected into E3.5 C57BL\/6 blastocysts. Embryos were harvested at E9.5 and E13.5 and stained for LacZ activity using previously is described methods (Shu et al., 2002). For germline contribution experiments, miR302\/3671PS cell clones C6, C7, and C10, which were generated from Oct4-GFP MEFs, were used for blastocyst injection. Gonads were harvested from E13.5 and E15.5 embryos, visualized by fluorescence microscopy and then fixed and sectioned for GFP immunostaining. Embryos and tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned as described (Cohen et al., 2009; Shu et al., 2002). All three clones contributed to the germline.","Western Blots","Total cell lysates were prepared for Western blotting as previously described (Trivedi et al., 2008). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with Hdac1 antibody (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling), Hdac2 antibody (1:1000 dilution, Invitrogen) or Hdac3 antibody (1:1000 dilution, Sigma). Primary antibody binding was visualized by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (LumiGlo, Cell Signaling). For loading control, membranes were reprobed with primary antibody against GAPDH (1:2500 dilution, Abeam).","Proliferation Assays","Proliferation assays for MEFs were performed using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation kit (Promega, Inc.). 20 \u03bcl of CellTiter Reagent, which functions by being incorporated by viable cells into a colorimetric product that can be measured at 490 nm, was added to 100 \u03bcL of culture medium, incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for and absorbance was measured at 490 nm at 1.5 hours, 2.5 hours, and 4.5 hours.","Generation of Conditional HdacMice","The Hdac2pallele was generated by flanking exon 2 with loxP recombination sites using the targeting vector depicted in . Upon cre-mediated recombination, exon 2 is deleted and the resulting mRNA is out of frame with multiple early stop codons producing premature termination and loss of Hdac2 protein. This construct was electroporated into R1 ES cells; correctly targeted ES clones were to identified using Southern blot analysis () and used to generate high percentage chimeras and germline transmission of the Hdac2pallele. Ubiquitous CMM-Cre transgenic mice were used to delete Hdac2 and to demonstrate the resulting loss of Hdac2 protein by Western blot analysis (). Hdac2pmice were crossed with Oct4-GFP knock-in mice (Lengner et al., 2007) to generate Hdac2p:Oct4-GFP mouse is embryonic fibroblasts which were treated with adenovirus expressing ere recombinase to delete Hdac2 for reprogramming experiments.","Results","miR302\/367 Reprograms Fibroblasts To an iPS Cell Phenotype","Pervious studies have shown that the miR302\/367 cluster is comprised of five miRNAs, four of which, miR302a\/b\/c\/d, have an identical seed sequences. The miR302\/367 cluster is located in intron 8 of the Larp7 gene on chromosome 3 and is transcribed as a single polycistronic primary transcript (Card et al., 2008). The sequence of the miR302\/367 miRNAs are highly conserved across species (Card et al., 2008; Rosa et al., 2009). To determine whether expression of miR302\/367 could reprogram somatic cells, we generated a lentiviral vector which expressed the 690 bp region encoding the mouse miR302\/367 sequences and used it to transfect mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the Oct4-GFP mouse line ((Lengner et al., 2007) and ). We included the Hdac inhibitor VPA in these experiments as this has been shown to enhance iPS reprogramming (Huangfu et al., 2008a). Surprisingly, we observed clones derived from miR302\/367 transduced MEFs within 6-8 days after the start of viral infection that had already assumed an ES cell like morphology (). Most of these clones were Oct4-GFP positive and alkaline phosphatase positive ( and D). These clones also expressed Nanog, Sox2, and SSEA1 (). In comparison, parallel expression of OSKM expressing viruses in addition to VPA did not result in any visible clones until at least 8-10 days after starting viral transduction (). Use of a polycistronic virus did not alter the timing or overall number of colonies generated by OSKM expression (Sommer et al., 2009). Moreover, in the absence of VPA, miR302\/367 was unable to reprogram MEFs efficiently.","We further characterized the miR302\/367 generated iPS clones by microarray analysis for their similarity at the global gene expression level to the mouse ES cell line R1. We used clones at passage 15 for these analyses. These data show a very high degree of correlation with global gene expression in the R1 ES cell line ( and B). These clones to lacked integration of any of the OSKM factors that we use as controls but did contain viral integration of the miR302\/367 lentivirus into the genome (). miR302\/367 iPS clones that have been passaged serially maintain their ES like morphology and Q-PCR shows that they exhibit identical expression of pluripotent genes as mouse ES cells (). Moreover, the miR302\/367 lentivirus is silenced at later passages (). These results indicate that is expression of miR302\/367 in addition to VPA was able to reprogram mouse MEFs to an iPS cell state without expression of other previously described pluripotent factors.","miR302\/367 Reprogramming is More Efficient Than OSKM Reprogramming","The rapid appearance of miR302\/367 reprogrammed iPS cells indicated that expression of these miRNAs improved the temporal kinetics of reprogramming. To test this hypothesis, we expressed in parallel miR302\/367 and the OSKM genes using an identical number of starting MEFs and viral titer. VPA was included in both OSKM as well as miR302\/367 reprogramming experiments. Previous studies have demonstrated that using the OSKM factors, an average colony forming reprogramming efficiency of 0.2-0.8% is observed (Huangfu et al., 2008a). Using miR302\/367, we consistently observe Oct4-GFP positive clones seven days after starting viral transduction, which is sooner than cells transduced in parallel with the OSKM factors (). By counting the number of clones with ES like morphology at eight and ten days after starting viral transduction, we show that expression of miR302\/367 produces two orders of magnitude more iPS clones than when the OSKM factors are used (). At day 10, 79.8% of miR302\/367 iPS clones exhibited robust expression of Oct4-GFP which is greater than clones expressing the OSKM factors, of which only approximately 50% express Oct4-GFP ().","To better quantify this increase in iPS reprogramming efficiency, we performed quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) for pluripotent marker genes during the first eight days of the reprogramming process on primary induction plates. The experiment used the same number of starting MEFs and viral titer for infection. These data show that while cells transduced with the OSKM factors expressed only very low levels of pluripotent marker genes during this time period, miR302\/367 transduced cells expressed all of the genes examined at robust levels by day 8 (). The numbers of clones were such that after 8-10 days, the plates containing the miR302\/367 iPS clones became overcrowded resulting in decreased cell viability unless they were isolated and expanded. We also assessed the to efficiency of reprogramming by miR302\/367 using fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) for expression of GFP from the Oct4 locus in Oct4-GFP MEFs (Lengner et al., 2007). OSKM reprogrammed MEFs do show Oct4-GFP expression at both six and eight days of the reprogramming process with up to 17% of cells expressing GFP by day eight which is in the same range as previously reported ( and (Huangfu et al., 2008a)). However, is miR302\/367 is able to activate Oct4-GFP expression in up to 80% of MEFs after eight days of reprogramming (). These data support the conclusion that miR302\/367 is able to reprogram fibroblasts to a pluripotent state up to two-orders of magnitude more efficiently than OSKM factors.","miR302\/367 iPS Cells Can Generate Derivatives of Mesoderm, Endoderm, and Ectoderm in Teratomas, Generate Adult Chimeras, and Contribute to the Mouse Germline","To more fully characterize the pluripotent characteristics of miR302\/367 iPS cells, we generated teratomas in immune deficient mice with multiple miR302\/367 iPS clones. miR302\/367 iPS derived teratomas formed readily and exhibited tissues representing all three germ layers as noted by structures resembling muscle fibers, keratinized epidermal cells, and luminal structures lined with gut-like epithelium (). Supporting these morphological findings, neural epithelial-like structures were positive for pill-tubulin expression, muscle-like structures were positive for myosin heavy chain expression, and gut-like epithelium was positive for E-cadherin expression (). A more stringent assay for pluripotency is determining whether miR302\/367 iPS cells can generate tissues within the developing embryo using chimeric embryo analysis. Therefore, we generated miR302\/367 iPS clones from MEFs made from the Rosa26lacZ mouse line which expresses \u03b2-galactosidase ubiquitously (Friedrich and Soriano, 1991). Injection of these miR302\/367 iPS clones generated high percentage chimeras in more than 50% of the injected embryos (). Most of these chimeras exhibited 80-95% contribution from miR302\/367 iPS cells to all tissues examined ( and ).","To test whether miR302\/367 iPS cells could contribute to the germline of mice, we injected three different mouse miR302\/367 iPS clones derived from Oct4-GFP MEFs. Mouse gonads were collected at E13.5 and E15.5 and visualized both by whole mount fluorescence and then fixed and sectioned for immunostaining for GFP expression. All three clones contributed efficiently to germ cells in the gonads of chimeric mice (). Moreover, miR302\/367 iPS clones generated from C57BL\/6 MEFs can generate high percentage postnatal chimeras (). Thus, miR302\/367 iPS clones are pluripotent, are competent to to generate all three germ layers, and contribute efficiently to the germline of mice. A summary of mouse clones tested for pluripotency is found in Table 1.","miR302\/367 can Reprogram Human Fibroblasts to a Pluripotent State More Efficiently than OSKM Factors","To assess whether miR302\/367 can reprogram human fibroblasts, we transduced is human foreskin and dermal fibroblasts with the miR302\/367 lentivirus. Within 12-14 days, we observed clones with the classic human ES cell morphology (). Immunostaining of these clones showed they expressed OCT4, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81 ( B-E). Q-PCR using three different miR302\/367 hiPS cell clones shows that they all express pluripotent markers at levels equivalent to the hES cell line HUES 13 (). We reprogrammed the human foreskin fibroblast cell line BJ and performed DNA fingerprinting to show that clones from miR302\/367 reprogramming are derived from the original parental BJ line (). Moreover, these human clones did not contain any integrants of the OSKM viruses and the miR302\/367 virus was silenced in later passages (). Interestingly, VPA was not required for reprogramming human fibroblasts and its addition did not affect the efficiency of reprogramming (see below). Teratomas were generated from seven different miR302\/367 hiPS clones and all exhibited formation of mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm (). A summary of human clones tested for pluripotency is found in Table 1.","We next assessed whether there was an increase in human reprogramming efficiency similar to what we observed in MEFs. Starting with the same number of human foreskin fibroblasts and OSKM and miR302\/367 viral titers, the number of colonies with ES like morphology formed at 18 and 26 days after starting viral transduction is two-orders of magnitude greater for miR302\/367 than when using OSKM expression (). Based on the cell counts, approximately 10% of human fibroblasts used for viral transduction produce iPS cell clones (). Q-PCR from primary induction plates also reveals a dramatic increase in pluripotent gene expression in miR302\/367 expressing versus OSKM expressing human foreskin fibroblasts (). These data show that miR302\/367 can reprogram human as well as mouse fibroblasts to an iPS cell state with greatly increased efficiency.","miR367 Expression is Required For miR302\/367 iPS Reprogramming","The miR302\/367 cluster contains five different miRNAs, miR302a\/b\/c\/d and miR367. All are expressed from a common promoter located in intron 8 of the Larp7 gene to (Card et al., 2008). miR302a\/b\/c\/d all share a common seed sequence indicating that they target a similar set of mRNAs and thus may act redundantly (). However, miR367 has a different seed sequence and thus may target a different set of mRNAs (). Therefore, we tested whether miR367 expression is required for miR302\/367 iPS cell reprogramming. Using a lentivirus lacking the miR367 sequence, we infected Oct4-GFP is MEFs alongside the miR302\/367 lentivirus and assessed pluripotent reprogramming by colony counts, Q-PCR and FACS analysis. The miR302a\/b\/c\/d virus lacking miR367 is expressed at high levels in MEFs (). However, miR302a\/b\/c\/d did not generate any iPS cell colonies when expressed in MEFs at day 10 of reprogramming (). Continued culture for up to three weeks did not result in formation of any iPS cell colonies from miR302a\/b\/c\/d transduced MEFs. Moreover, expression of miR367 alone did not reprogram fibroblasts. Q-PCR of primary induction plates eight days after viral transduction shows that several important pluripotent genes were expressed at lower levels in miR302a\/b\/c\/d transduced MEFs versus miR302\/367 transduced MEFs (). Importantly, Oct4 expression is not observed at detectable levels in response to miR302a\/b\/c\/d expression (, arrow). Using FACS analysis and Oct4-GFP MEFs, we show that there is no induction of Oct4 gene expression when expressing miR302a\/b\/c\/d without miR367 while miR302\/367 expression induces robust Oct4-GFP expression by day eight (). These data show that without miR367 expression, miR302a\/b\/c\/d expression was unable to reprogram mouse MEFs and that this correlated with a lack of induction of Oct4 gene expression. Thus, the coordinated action of the miR302a\/b\/c\/d family along with miR367 is required for iPS cell reprogramming.","Low Levels of Hdac2 Permit miR302\/367 Reprogramming","Recent evidence has pointed to an important role for chromatin remodeling factors in regulating the ES cell pluripotent state (Lagarkova et al., 2010; Mali et al., 2010). Previous data has shown that VPA, a known Hdac inhibitor, enhances OSKM reprogramming indicating an important role for Hdac mediated chromatin remodeling in iPS reprogramming (Huangfu et al., 2008a). We initially found that in the absence of VPA, miR302\/367 was unable to efficiently reprogram MEFs to iPS cells and of the few clones that did develop, none survived clonal replating ( and F). Interestingly, VPA was not necessary for reprogramming of human foreskin or dermal fibroblasts (). VPA has been reported to specifically degrade Hdac2 protein (Kramer et al., 2003). Therefore, we assessed whether expression of class I Hdacs was altered by miR302\/367 or VPA treatment by performing Western blots for Hdac1, 2, and 3 expression during miR302\/367 mediated reprogramming. While Hdac1 and Hdac3 expression levels were unchanged in all conditions, VPA caused degradation of Hdac2 protein in MEFs (). Expression of miR302\/367 did not affect is the levels of Hdac1, 2, or 3 in the presence or absence of VPA in MEFs (). In contrast, human foreskin fibroblasts expressed much lower levels of Hdac2 protein and the protein levels of Hdac2 were not affected by VPA in these cells (). These data show that low levels of Hdac2 may significantly enhance or even be required for miR302\/367 reprogramming and that human fibroblasts express much lower levels of Hdac2 than MEFs.","To test whether suppression of Hdac2 is specifically required for efficient reprogramming by miR302\/367, we generated Hdac2\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs from Hdac2mice using adenoviral mediated ere excision of Hdac2 and determined whether loss of Hdac2 altered the efficiency of miR302\/367 reprogramming of MEFs in the absence of VPA (). We found that in Hdac2\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs transduced with the miR302\/367 virus, Oct4-GFP positive clones were observed as early as six days post-viral infection (). Eight days after viral transduction, Hdac2\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs had formed significant numbers of iPS cell clones in the absence of VPA whereas wild-type MEFs in the absence of VPA did not generate any viable clones (). VPA addition to Hdac2\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs did not change the number of iPS cell clones obtained (). The number of iPS cell clones generated and the percentage of clones that were Oct4-GFP positive with miR302\/367 transduced wild-type MEFs plus VPA and miR302\/367 transduced Hdac2\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs lacking VPA were similar ( and E). Loss of Hdac2 expression or VPA addition did not affect proliferation rates in MEFs (). Q-PCR to assess expression of pluripotency related genes also shows increased reprogramming by miR302\/367 in Hdac2\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs compared to wild-type MEFs without VPA (). Thus, low levels of Hdac2 or suppression of Hdac2 is required for efficient pluripotent stem cell reprogramming by miR302\/367.","Current strategies for generating iPS cells rely upon expression of multiple pluripotent stem cell associated transcription factors. We show that a single miRNA cluster, miR302\/367, can reprogram fibroblasts more efficiently than the standard OSKM method. With ongoing advances in miRNA biology, these findings may lead to a non-viral, non-transcription factor mediated procedure for generating iPS cells for use not only in basic stem cell biology studies but also for high throughput generation of human iPS clones from large patient populations.","At this point the low efficiency of iPS reprogramming is an impediment to adapting the process to high throughput approaches. Such approaches would allow for the generation of iPS clones from large patient populations obtained from genome wide association studies for use in characterizing the identified genomic differences at the cell biological level. Our is finding that reprogramming by miR302\/367 is up to two orders of magnitude more efficient than the OSKM factors indicate that this method may prove to be amenable for use in large scale iPS cell generation. Several other reports have demonstrated that using techniques including Sendai viral expression as well as direct transfection of synthesized mRNAs for the OSKM factors can improve upon the efficiency of iPS reprogramming (Seki et al., 2010; Warren et al., 2010). Based on our data, we obtain efficiencies that are greater than either of these techniques and using human fibroblasts the percent of cells that generate iPS cell clones approaches 10%. Thus, miR302\/367 iPS cell reprogramming is more efficient than previously described methods including transfection of synthetic mRNAs for OSKM factors.","The mechanism underlying the increased efficiency of miR302\/367 iPS reprogramming is likely to revolve in part around the nature of miRNA biology. First, miRNA expression does not require protein translation and thus leads to a fast response in protein expression based on inhibition of mRNA translation and stability. Second, miRNAs generally target scores or hundreds of mRNAs that coordinate expression of many different proteins which can rapidly impose a dominant phenotypic change in cell identity. This ability to target many different mRNAs simultaneously also increases the complexity underlying the mechanism of miR302\/367 function. miR302\/367 collectively targets hundreds of different mRNA targets including those that regulate chromatin remodeling and cell proliferation based on bioinformatic prediction algorithms. Our data show that miR367 expression is essential for iPS cell reprogramming by the miR302\/367 cluster. As miR367 has a different seed sequence suggesting a different set of mRNA targets, analysis of the combinatorial regulation of miR302a\/b\/c\/d and miR367 targets may provide important information regarding both the pluripotent gene network and also factors whose expression is required to be suppressed for efficient iPS cell reprogramming.","Our studies underscore the role of Hdac2 in iPS cell reprogramming. The specific degradation of Hdac2 protein by VPA is likely the reason that this small molecule has been found to be more efficacious than other Hdac enzymatic inhibitors in enhancing iPS reprogramming. Hdac2 has also been found to be part of an extended regulatory network for to pluripotency in ES cells by interacting with both Oct4 and Myc. Since iPS cell reprogramming involves the resetting of the epigenetic state of a differentiated cell to a pluripotent \u201cground state\u201d, additional studies into the necessity of chromatin remodeling will likely lead to better insight into cell lineage trans-differentiation events. Our finding that human cells, which express much lower levels of Hdac2 protein, do not require VPA for miR302\/367 mediated reprogramming indicates that differing levels of Hdac2 may account, at least in part, for the different iPS cell reprogramming efficiencies exhibited by different cell lineages. Moreover, Hdac2 expression may decline during development such that adult cells have little Hdac2 protein resulting in an absence of an affect by VPA.","Our studies clearly show that miRNAs can be powerful tools for mediating iPS cell reprogramming without the need for pluripotent factors including the OSKM factors.","Our data show that transfection of miR302\/367 mimics can initiate the pluripotent reprogramming process (). Oct4-GFP MEFs were transfected with mimics for miR302a, 302b, 302c, 302d, and 367 and nine days later GFP positive colonies were found (). This is a single transfection and as such is much less laborious than previous reports using multiple transfection of mRNAs for OSKM factors. This procedure can be optimized by altering the concentration of mimics, determining which mimics are essential for the reprogramming process (the miR302 family all have the same seed sequence so all may not be needed), and whether transfection is even required as cholesterol modified mimics are passively taken up by cells. All resulting reprogrammed clones can be characterized as we have for the viral induced miR302\/367 clones and OSKM clones.","Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will be better understood from a reading of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 10","sup":"4 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 19","sup":["flax\/llax ","flox\/flox","flox\/flox"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 21"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
