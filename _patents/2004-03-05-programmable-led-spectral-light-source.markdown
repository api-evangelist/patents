title: Programmable LED spectral light source
abstract: An apparatus for emulating various known night sky illumination conditions. The apparatus comprises a plurality of electrically-powerable LEDs which are disposed in an array and have respective spectral curves centered at different wavelengths in the visible to the short wave infrared wavebands, and means for fixing the temperatures of the LEDs to avoid temperature-induced changes in their spectral curves. Additionally, the apparatus includes means for varying the light intensities of the individual LEDs so that the combination of their spectral curves matches the spectrum of the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated, and means for regulating the total amount of light collected from the array so that the cumulative spectrum has the same intensity as the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold, imported, and\/or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.","This invention relates in general to light sources, and more particularly, to programmable light sources.","The performance of passive low-light-level imaging systems that operate in the visible, near infrared, and short wavelength infrared spectral bands has been investigated for the past several years. Although such devices operate under low power, exhibit low dark current, and retain high system resolution under moonlight conditions, they are limited under low light level conditions.","Typically, their performance is evaluated in a laboratory setting using a 2856\u00b0 K blackbody\u2014a tungsten filament\u2014as the radiation source, which can correlate reasonably well with night sky measurements below 1 micron. However, it does not correlate reasonably well with night sky measurements above 1 micron. Night sky spectral irradiance data indicate that a moonless sky produces over an order of magnitude more photons in the short-wave infrared (1 to 2 micron) waveband than in the visible and near infrared (0.4 to 1.0 micron) waveband. Therefore, the use of a single broadband 2856\u00b0 K source in a laboratory to evaluate imaging systems that operate beyond 1 micron is insufficient.","It is therefore an object of this invention to accurately evaluate in a laboratory setting passive low-light-level imaging systems that operate in the visible, near infrared, and short wavelength infrared spectral bands.","This and other objects of the invention are achieved in one aspect by an apparatus for emulating various known spectral signatures, particularly night sky illumination conditions. The apparatus comprises a plurality of electrically-powerable LEDs which are disposed in an array and have respective spectral curves centered at different wavelengths in the visible to the short wave infrared wavebands, and means for fixing the temperatures of the LEDs to avoid temperature-induced changes in their spectral curves. Additionally, the apparatus includes means for varying the light intensities of the individual LEDs so that the combination of their spectral curves matches the spectrum of the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated, and means for regulating the total amount of light collected from the array so that the cumulative spectrum has the same intensity as the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated.","Another aspect of the invention involves a method of emulating various spectral signatures comprising the steps of: (a) electrically-powering a plurality of electrically-powered LEDs in an array, the LEDs having respective spectral curves centered at different wavelengths in the visible to the short wave infrared wavebands; (b) fixing the temperatures of the LEDs to avoid temperature-induced changes in their spectral curves; (c) varying the light intensities of the individual LEDs so that the combination of their spectral curves matches the spectrum of the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated; and (d) regulating the total amount of light collected from the array so that the cumulative spectrum has the same intensity as the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated.","The invention can accurately emulate various night sky illumination conditions by emitting spectra in a laboratory setting to match that of full moon, partial moon, starlight and overcast starlight conditions.","Additional advantages and features will become apparent as the subject invention becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:","The FIGURE shows the apparatus  for emulating various known spectral signatures such as night sky illumination conditions. The apparatus  comprises an electrically-powered array  of LEDs which have respective spectral curves centered at different wavelengths in the visible to the short wavelength infrared wavebands, specifically in the 0.4 to 2.5 micron range, and means for fixing the temperatures of the LEDs to avoid temperature-induced changes in their spectral curves. Additionally, the apparatus  includes means for varying the light intensities of the individual LEDs so that the combination of their spectral curves matches the spectrum of the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated, and means for regulating the total amount of light collected from the array so that the cumulative spectrum has the same intensity as the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated.","While the temperature-fixing means may take a variety of forms, conveniently it may take the form shown of a programmable computer , a copper plate  thermally connected to the LED array , a temperature sensor  that is in thermal communication with copper plate  and electrically connected to temperature controller . A plurality of thermo-electric coolers  connected to the copper plate for providing an input to the programmable computer, a temperature controller  connected to the computer, to the temperature sensor  and to the coolers, a heat sink  connected to the coolers, and a cooling fan  disposed next to the coolers.","While the light-intensities-varying means may take a variety of means, conveniently it may take the form shown of the programmable computer , and a light-intensities controller  connected between the LED array  and the computer.","While the light-regulating means may take a variety of forms, conveniently it may take the form shown of the programmable computer , an integrating sphere  attached to the LED array , the sphere having an input opening  and an output opening , and an iris  mounted on the output opening of the sphere and connected to the programmable computer.","For the materials of the present invention, the preferred temperature sensor is a Model W2142 platinum resistance thermometer device manufactured by Omega. The preferred thermo-electric coolers are model CP1.0-71-05L-1 coolers made by Melcor, while LEDs manufactured by Roithner LasertechniK, of Vienna can be used. The preferred integrating sphere is a custom six-inch sphere mad by Spectra-Physics. The light intensity controller and temperature controller can be manufactured using readily available commercial electronic components in a manner known by the skilled artisan.","In operation, the array  of LEDs is electrically-powered and the temperatures of the LEDS are fixed to avoid temperature-induced changes in their spectral curves. This is done by monitoring heat-generated temperature changes in the temperature of the copper plate  and thus in the temperature of the LED array  with the temperature sensor . Temperature sensor  provides an input to the temperature controller according to the temperature of the copper plate. The temperature sensor, in response to a command from programmable computer  to maintain a predetermined temperature, uses the temperature sensor input to drive the thermo-electric coolers  and cool the LED array, by removing heat generated by the thermo-electric coolers with the heat sink  and the cooling fan . With this configuration, the LED array temperature is continuously driven to be equal to a fixed predetermined temperature.","Next, the integrating sphere  collects at its input opening  light from the LED array  and outputs at its output opening  a uniform distribution of the light collected from the array. The light intensities controller  controls the electric power provided to the individual LEDs from their power supply (not shown), and thus their light intensities, in response to commands from the programmable computer  so that the combination of their spectral curves matches the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated, and the iris  adjusts the size of the output opening  of the integrating sphere  in response to commands from the programmable computer  so that the cumulative spectrum has the same intensity as the known night sky illumination condition to be emulated.","It is obvious that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as described."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":"The sole FIGURE is a schematic illustration of an illumination conditions-emulating apparatus embodying the invention."},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
