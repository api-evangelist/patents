{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Aspects of the present invention relate to enhancements of media streaming processes, and in particular, to the insertion of personalized social-awareness based content into media streams.","The insertion of content such as advertisements, announcements, messages, etc., into media streams (audio and\/or video) is an approach utilized to expose an audience of the media stream to the inserted content. For example, advertisements are frequently utilized in mediums such as television, broadcast radio, movies, etc., to expose an audience to products or services for sale. Advertisements are also frequently utilized in online media processes, such as podcasts, Internet radio, streaming video applications, alternate reality applications, etc. Still further, advertisements are frequently utilized in interactive applications, such as video game\/entertainment systems, which may or may not have on-line network connectivity.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for inserting content into media streams. The method comprises monitoring a media stream by a media server computer, the monitored media stream having at least one marker designating an associated insertion position within the media stream. The method further comprises selecting a marker to insert personalized social-awareness based content into the media stream, and transforming the monitored media stream. Transforming the monitored media stream comprises identifying by the media server, social awareness information associated with a target of the monitored media stream, utilizing the identified social awareness information to derive personalized social-awareness based content, and inserting the personalized social-awareness based content into the monitored media stream at the corresponding marker insertion position associated with the selected marker.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, a system is provided for inserting content into media streams. The system comprises a media server computer having a processor, a memory device, and program code resident in the memory device. The program code is executable by the processor of the media server to insert personalized social aware advertising in media streams by monitoring a media stream having at least one marker designating an associated insertion position within the media stream, selecting a marker to insert personalized social-awareness based content into the media stream, and transforming the monitored media stream. Transforming the monitored media stream comprises identifying social awareness information associated with a target of the monitored media stream, utilizing the identified social awareness information to derive personalized social-awareness based content, and inserting the personalized social-awareness based content into the monitored media stream at the corresponding marker insertion position associated with the selected marker.","According to a third aspect of the present invention, a computer program product is provided to insert content into media streams. The computer program product comprises a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied therewith. The computer readable program code comprises computer readable program code configured to monitor a media stream having at least one marker designating an associated insertion position within the media stream. The computer readable program code further comprises computer readable program code configured to select a marker to insert personalized social-awareness based content into the media stream. The computer readable program still further code comprises computer readable program code configured to transform the monitored media stream. The computer readable program code configured to transform the monitored media stream comprises computer readable program code configured to identify social awareness information associated with a target of the monitored media stream, computer readable program code configured to utilize the identified social awareness information to derive personalized social-awareness based content, and computer readable program code configured to insert the personalized social-awareness based content into the monitored media stream at the corresponding marker insertion position associated with the selected marker.","According to various aspects of the present invention, methods, computer program products and systems are provided for the enhancement of media streaming processes by the insertion of personalized social-awareness based content into media streams. The personalized social-awareness based content may be derived, for example, based on social awareness information associated with a target, e.g., an audience, of the media stream. As will be seen in greater detail below, a media server may query one or more social networking servers to discover, derive, learn or otherwise gain social-awareness knowledge about a corresponding target. The queried social awareness applications may be known by the media server to be affiliated with the target, or the social awareness applications may be known to the media server, and may be queried to determine whether the target is affiliated with any of the known social awareness applications.","By way of illustration, social-awareness knowledge may include information with regard to friends of the target and\/or information about the target, e.g., interests, hobbies, etc. Thus, content inserted into a media stream may include personalized social-awareness based content derived from acquired social-awareness knowledge associated with the target. The personalized social-awareness based content inserted into a media stream may also and\/or alternatively be derived or otherwise selected from properties of the media stream itself.","As a few preliminary, illustrative examples, acquired social-awareness knowledge may be filtered, selected or otherwise identified based upon properties of the media stream to derive personalized social-awareness based content for insertion into a media stream.","As another example, a target may be associated with several social networking on-line applications that may be hosted by various websites, which may include social networks affiliated with professional or career oriented activities, and social networks affiliated with recreational activities. As such, the media server may obtain social-awareness knowledge about both professional and personal interests of a target. In this regard, the media server may utilize social awareness knowledge about the target to select or otherwise modify an advertisement that is inserted into a corresponding marker position of a media stream where the advertisement is for a particular product that a professional colleague of the target uses, if the target is interacting with a media stream as part of a professional\/work related activity. In this regard, knowledge that the media stream itself is related to a professional activity assists the media server in selecting appropriate social-aware content, and hence to select and\/or modify appropriate marker content for insertion into the media stream.","As another illustrative example, the media server may utilize social awareness knowledge about the target to select or otherwise modify an advertisement that is inserted into a corresponding marker position of a media stream where the advertisement is for a particular game that a friend of the target plays, if the target is interacting with a media stream as part of a recreational activity. In this regard, knowledge that the media stream itself is related to a recreational activity, e.g., playing on on-line video game, assists the media server in selecting appropriate social-aware content, and hence to select and\/or modify appropriate marker content for insertion into the media stream.","Accordingly, as will be described in greater detail herein, a different advertisement may be directed to the same target based upon social awareness knowledge, e.g., learned from or otherwise implied from social awareness information about associated friends or family, profession, hobbies, interests, etc. The social awareness information may be identified by the media server communicating over a network with at least one social networking application. Moreover, knowledge of a particular media stream itself, e.g., which may include knowledge of the content, purpose, time of day or other factors associated with the media stream may be utilized to communicate, to the target, content that is tailored to the target to maximize interest in goods or services associated with the personalized social-awareness based content.","As used herein, the expression \u201cmedia stream\u201d or the term \u201cmedia streaming\u201d should not be limited to real-time or near real-time, serial\/sequential information feeds or streams. Rather, the term is utilized to refer to computer readable information that includes markers or other suitable earmark\/position determining features that identify locations in the computer readable code for the insertion of dynamic content. Thus, the term \u201cmedia stream\u201d comprehends software code for a video game or on-line virtual realm where a user interactively controls the sequencing of the video and\/or audio scenes, frames, chapters, sections, etc. By way of illustration, in a video game or on-line virtual realm, a user may walk past a billboard. The code for the game\/realm may include an earmark that allows dynamic content to be inserted on the billboard. As such, an advertisement may be dynamically inserted upon the virtual billboard. In this context, the advertisement is inserted into the appropriate portion of the code based upon the detected earmark, to cause the advertisement to appear in the appropriate portion of the media content, and is thus considered herein to be part of a \u201cmedia stream\u201d. The terms \u201cmedia stream\u201d and \u201cmedia streaming\u201d also comprehend traditional media streams such as audio and\/or video multimedia that is constantly received by, and normally presented to, a target, e.g., an end-user, which is delivered by a streaming provider, e.g., streamed video and\/or audio webcasts, video and radio broadcasts, podcasts, etc.","Also, the term \u201ctarget\u201d is used in the specific to refer to a particular targeted person or end-user. The term \u201ctarget\u201d can also be a more generalized term, e.g., to refer to an audience of a particular media stream, based upon some known characteristic or trait, such as a known profession, hobby, interest, demographic or other classification.","Referring now to the drawings and particularly to , a general diagram of a computer system  is illustrated. The computer system  comprises a plurality of hardware processing devices, designated generally by the reference  that are linked together by a network . Typical processing devices  may include servers, personal computers, notebook computers, transactional systems, purpose-driven appliances, pervasive computing devices such as a personal data assistant (PDA), cellular access processing devices such as smart phones, special purpose computing devices, storage devices, gaming devices, audio\/video devices such as Internet-capable DVD players, video recording devices, cable set-top boxes, and\/or other devices capable of communicating over the network . The processing devices  may execute software, including, for example, applications and\/or other code that process media information, which may be streamed across the network , or which may be stored in various formats, such as in libraries of audio and\/or video files. The software may also process information stored in databases, spreadsheets, structured documents, unstructured documents and\/or other files containing information.","The network  provides communications links between the various processing devices , and may be supported by networking components  that interconnect the processing devices , including for example, routers, hubs, firewalls, network interfaces wired or wireless communications links and corresponding interconnections. Moreover, the network  may comprise connections using one or more intranets, extranets, local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN), wireless networks (WIFI), the Internet, including the world wide web, and\/or other arrangements for enabling communication between the processing devices , in either real time or otherwise, e.g., via time shifting, batch processing, etc. The system  is shown by way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, as a computing environment in which various aspects of the present invention may be practiced.","In the illustrative system , a user operating a corresponding processing device  may interact from time to time with one or more social awareness applications, e.g., via a corresponding social networking application server . Although only one social networking application server  is illustrated for convenience of illustration, in practice, a user may participate with a plurality of different social awareness applications, each of which is likely hosted by a different social networking application server .","Exemplary social awareness applications may comprise, for example, FACEBOOK, MYSPACE, TWITTER, etc. (FACEBOOK is a registered trademark of Facebook, Inc., located in Palo Alto Calif.; MYSPACE is a registered trademark of MySpace Inc., located in Beverly Hills Calif.; TWITTER is a registered trademark of Twitter, Inc., located in San Francisco Calif.). Social awareness applications may also comprise other forms of on-line forums, chat rooms, virtual realms, online gaming, and other internet based communities of users.","Exemplary social awareness applications may also comprise, for example, presence and awareness servers . By way of illustration, many users routinely utilize applications for \u201cinstant messaging\u201d with selected user \u201cbuddies\u201d who are also simultaneously online for real time (or near real time) communication. Examples of typical presence awareness applications\/services include AOL Instant Messenger (hereinafter \u201cIM\u201d), GOOGLE IM, ICQ, MSN Messenger, YAHOO! Messenger, etc. (AOL is a registered trademark of AOL LLC, located in Way Dulles Va.; GOOGLE is a registered trademark of Google Inc., located in Mountain View Calif.; ICQ is a registered trademark of AOL LLC, located in Way Dulles Va.; MSN is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation, located in Redmond Wash.; YAHOO! is a registered trademark of Yahoo! Inc., located in Sunnyvale Calif.).","Still further, a user may, from time to time, interact with media streams, which are utilized to communicate advertisements, messages and other dynamic content to the user. Such media streams may be provided by a media server . For example, a user may be participating in an alternate realm, watching a video stream, listening to a podcast or Internet radio program, etc. Alternatively, a processing device  such as a DVD player, BLU-RAY DISC player (BLU-RAY DISC is a registered trademark of Blu-Ray Disc Association, located in Universal City Calif.), cable television set-top box, television recording device, etc., may interact with a media server  to obtain on-demand content, schedules, etc.","As yet a further example, a user may be accessing the network  by utilizing a processing device  such as a network capable game system to interact with a gaming server . By way of illustration, a user may be playing a game or otherwise interacting with a game system such as NINTENDO WII, SONY PLAYSTATION 2, SONY PLAYSTATION 3, MICROSOFT XBOX LIVE, MICROSOFT XBOX 360, etc. (NINTENDO and WII are registered trademarks of Nintendo of America Inc., located in Redmond Wash.; SONY and PLAYSTATION are registered trademarks of Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment, located in Tokyo, Japan; MICROSOFT, XBOX LIVE, and XBOX 360 are registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation, located in Redmond Wash.).","In practice, depending upon the specific implementation, each processing device  may be required to execute a client , in order to receive a media stream. In this regard, the term \u201cclient\u201d should be construed broadly to include any software and\/or hardware configuration necessary to interact with a corresponding media stream. For example, the client  may comprise a conventional Web browser, a generic media player or a customized software application and\/or hardware. Moreover, each processing device  may interact with more than one media stream or media stream type. As such, although illustrated for convenience as a single client , in practice, each processing device  may execute any one or more clients  necessary to interact with associated media streams. For example, the client  may comprise, or interact with a software application that integrates gaming and other types of media streaming processes. Alternatively, a processing device  may include a first client  for gaming, and a second client  for a non-gaming media streaming process, e.g., a DVD movie, a third client  for listening to music or other audio, etc.","Conventional media streaming processes may provide advertising content therein. However, such advertising efforts may comprise mass advertising or imperfectly targeted advertising, which may turn out to be an inefficient utilization of the marketing\/advertising budget of the advertiser. Accordingly, recipients of the advertising content that is provided within media streams may be uninterested in the advertisement. As an exemplary illustration, assume that a user is playing a video game on their computer. If the video game displays advertising content that the user is uninterested in, the user may not shift focus from the game to the advertising content. In this case, the media streaming application is an inefficient utilization of the advertising content.","According to various aspects of the present invention, however, advertisements inserted into media streams are specifically selected based upon a target audience, e.g., based upon personalized social-awareness based content that is tailored specifically for a target of the media stream. Keeping with the above-example, under certain circumstances, it may be preferable to insert, replace, add to, or otherwise modify advertising content that is to be communicated to the user. For example, the advertising content may be specifically selected to target a particular user based upon available social awareness information associated with the selected target, as will be discussed in detail herein. By way of illustration, assume that a video game manufacturer makes different video games for different sports, e.g., one for golf, one for college football, one for tennis, etc. Based upon available social awareness information, it may be determined that a particular user prefers golf over football, tennis, etc. In this scenario, the advertisement for the golf video game may be selected. As another example, different advertisements for different advertisers may be available for insertion into a media stream. Based upon available social awareness information, it may be determined that a select one of the advertisements would be more relevant to a particular user than the others. In this scenario, the more relevant advertisement may be inserted into the media steam.","As an alternative, generic advertisements may be modified or augmented based upon social awareness information. By way of illustration, an advertisement may be provided for a new video game. As such, a generic portion of the advertisement may advertise the game itself, then a directed portion of the advertisement may utilize social awareness techniques described more fully herein, to show, for example, a friend of the target actually playing the advertised video game.","Recently, a few companies have announced plans to support software that provides dynamic insertion of content such as advertisements in fixed locations into video streams. For example, media streams associated with media streaming processes may include one or more markers that are reserved or otherwise associated with advertising content that is directed to the targets, e.g., audiences of the media streams as an integral part of the media streaming process. That is, during the streaming of a given media stream, upon the occurrence of a marker, content that is associated with the marker, i.e., \u201cmarker content\u201d, is inserted into the stream. The marker content may be an advertisement, such as an audio or video advertisement, which is thus communicated to the target to provide exposure of a product or service associated with the advertisement.","As the conventional consumer landscape is flooded with advertisements, advertisers continue to look for better ways to make advertisements feel useful and impactful to the user\u2014more like advice or suggestions, than advertisements. By interleaving advertising content that can be associated with people of social interest to the target, e.g., related to people that the target cares about or otherwise socially interacts with, various aspects of the present invention associate advertisers with a more interested audience, leading to higher value opportunities for monetization.","In this regard, according to various aspects of the present invention, a media server  may be utilized to stream media content or otherwise influence streams of media content such as video and\/or audio to audiences using any number of available mediums, which may include for example, computer streaming across the network , wireless broadcasting, mobile communications using cellular, satellite and other suitable technologies, etc. As part of the content streaming process, the media server  identifies predetermined markers included in the media stream that are each provided for advertisements or other dynamically inserted content. The media server  selects ones of the markers to modify or replace the corresponding marker content with personalized social-awareness based content.","As noted in greater detail above, the media server  may utilize properties of the media stream itself and\/or the media server  may utilize properties related to the target in order to personalize inserted content with social awareness knowledge. In this regard, properties of the media stream may include properties about the marker content within the media stream, or properties such as metadata about the media stream other than the marker content.","Thus for example, the media server  may utilize properties associated with a generic advertisement corresponding to a marker location of an associated media stream to modify the generic advertisement with social awareness information to customize the corresponding marker content with personalized social-awareness based content directed to the target. The media server  may also\/alternatively utilize properties of the media stream not related to particular marker content. Thus for example, an exemplary media stream may be associated with an online alternate realm. The media server  may access metadata or other information with regard to the online alternate realm or the media stream associated with the alternate realm, to customize marker content with personalized social-awareness based content directed to the target. Thus, for example, assume the target is online in an alternate reality realm and is virtually walking towards a virtual shopping area of the virtual realm, and walks past a virtual billboard. The virtual billboard may be associated with a marker for dynamic insertion of content. As such, the media server  may combine the knowledge that the target is intending on virtually shopping to select an advertisement to insert onto the virtual billboard. The media server  may further refine this selection of advertisements with social knowledge learned about the target, e.g., that the target likes video games. As such, the media server  may place a video game related advertisement on the billboard as inserted marker content.","Even further, the media server  may use properties that describe where to get customized content, e.g., video footage, audio clips, text commentary from social contacts, etc., to replace stock marks containing generic content with personalized content if available. Thus, a target may see a live demonstration, or someone the target personally knows playing an advertised game, etc.","As further noted above, marker content may be modified based upon social awareness knowledge about the target. By way of illustration, personalized social-awareness based content inserted into a marker location may be derived from one or more social networking servers , presence and awareness servers , and\/or from any other miscellaneous information\/media sources .","Upon selecting a marker for which to modify, insert, replace, etc., its marker content, the media server  derives personalized social-awareness based content utilizing criteria discussed in detail herein, and transforms the media stream by inserting the personalized social-awareness based content into the media stream at the insertion position associated with the selected marker position. As noted briefly above, the process of transforming the media stream to include targeted, social-awareness based content, may comprise modifying and\/or adding to the existing marker content, replacing existing marker content (if present) with the personalized social-awareness based content or inserting personalized social-awareness based content at the marker location. The personalized social-awareness based content may be derived based on identified properties of the media stream and\/or based upon identified social awareness information corresponding to the target of the media stream.","Once the media stream is transformed by the insertion of the personalized social-awareness based content at the insertion position associated with the selected marker, the transformed media stream is communicated to the target to experience, e.g., watch, listen, etc.","Although discussed above with regard to a media server , the socially aware content based advertising can also be implemented by other media streaming sources, including for example, the audio\/video server  and\/or gaming server . In this context, the media server  may interact with the audio\/video server  and\/or gaming server  to provide the social-awareness knowledge utilized to derive the dynamic, directed social-aware content for insertion into the media stream. Still further, a media streaming server, e.g., the audio\/video server  and\/or gaming server  may interact with the media server  in order to ascertain social awareness based context for selecting advertisements.","According to various aspects of the present invention, advertising relevancy is thus increased by taking advantage of social network awareness to interleave content into media streams that provide a more relevant experience to the target audience. As will be described in greater detail herein, social awareness information may be utilized to interleave live or recorded footage from peers, such as may be obtained from on-line games or interactive video applications, alternate reality realms, etc. In this regard, advertisers are presented with a solution that makes their products or services feel useful and impactful to the user. By using social networking awareness, the target audience may perceive the advertisement more as advice or suggestion that advertisement. By way of illustration, by interleaving video or audio footage related to people that the target actually knows, the audience will be more interested, which may lead to higher value opportunities for monetization.","Referring to , according to aspects of the present invention, a target may utilize a processing device, designated A, to experience a media stream that is communicated by a media source, e.g., media server . As illustrated for convenience of discussion, the processing device A executes a client A which is compatible with the media stream. The target may comprise an audience of one or more users.","As illustrated, the media stream is monitored by a media personalization system  executed by the media server , to identify predetermined markers of the media stream, as will be described in detail herein. Once a marker is identified, marker content associated with the marker, if present, is evaluated and, based on data, such as from a rules database , a target database  or a secondary sources , the marker content may be modified, added to, or replaced by the media server , as will be discussed in detail herein.","In this regard, the media server  may transmit the media stream, or the media stream may be transmitted by another source, e.g., the audio\/video server , gaming server , etc. Regardless of the point of origination of the media stream, the media personalization system  executed by the media server  utilizes data stored in one or more data sources and\/or utilizes information located across the network to acquire social-awareness knowledge associated with the target. For instance, the media personalization system  may access a rules database  that may be utilized to establish rules, including profiles and other information that can be evaluated to select appropriate social-awareness knowledge associated with the target to derive personalized social-awareness based content for insertion into media streams.","The target database  may be utilized, for example, to store target profiles. For example, the target database  may include data corresponding to one or more targets associated with the media server . By way of illustration and not by way of limitation, data stored in the target database  may include personal information about one or more targets, e.g., age, gender, interests, etc., and\/or may include online relationship information associated with one or more targets, e.g., friends, relatives, co-workers, peers, etc. The target database  may also store, for example, the identification of social networking accounts associated with corresponding targets. Still further, the target database  may include necessary permissions, passwords and securities necessary to allow the media server  to access social-networking information. The media server  may use the data in the target database  to transform media streams as described more fully herein.","The data in the target database  may be acquired by the media server  using one or more suitable methods. By way of illustration and not by way of limitation, the media server  may employ a user interface, e.g., via a Web page or Web portal, that is accessible by targets to manually enter the data, e.g., into the media personalization system . As another example, the media server  may learn the identity of targets via conventional subscriptions, memberships, accounts or other associations where a person has to sign up to participate or otherwise experience an associated media stream. As an illustration, a target may be experiencing a media stream while playing an on-line video game that requires a user to sign up in order to play. Certain on-demand movie, video and\/or audio applications require membership before allowing a user to download movies, etc. As yet another example, the media server  may retrieve data from one or more servers, such as the social networking servers , the presence and awareness servers , the audio\/video servers  and\/or the gaming servers  discussed above. The media server  may access these servers via a network, such as the network  as discussed above, or by any other suitable methods.","The media personalization system  may also utilize secondary sources . Secondary sources  may comprise additional information that may be used by the media server  to transform media streams. By way of illustration and not by way of limitation, the secondary sources  may comprise data from or about the media streams themselves, e.g., from predetermined markers within the media streams and\/or marker content associated with the markers. Also, the secondary sources  may comprise data about advertisements or other dynamically insertable content, sources or links to dynamically insertable content, etc.","The rules in the rules database  may include any number of rules that may be evaluated in selecting either the markers or the acquired social-awareness knowledge associated with the target to derive personalized social-awareness based content. Thus, the rules may be used to enhance user exposure to content within media streams of media streaming processes. By way of illustration, the rules database  may include media stream monitoring rules , marker selection rules , media stream transformation rules , secondary source rules , social awareness information rules , content selection rules , content insertion rules , etc. The rules in the rules database  may be characterized in any practical manner.","The stream monitoring rules  may include rules pertaining to the monitoring of media streams performed by the media server. The marker selection rules  may include rules pertaining to the selection of markers within monitored media steams. For example, the marker selection rules  may include rules directed at selecting markers for inserting personalized social-awareness based content into the insertion position associated with the selected marker. The media stream transformation rules  may include rules pertaining to transforming media streams by inserting personalized social-awareness based content therein, e.g., whether to add to, replace, delete, or otherwise modify marker content associated with selected markers.","The secondary source rules  may include rules pertaining to the evaluation of information from secondary sources for the generation of personalized social-awareness based content to be inserted into media streams. The social awareness information rules  may include rules pertaining to the evaluation of social awareness information for the generation of personalized social-awareness based content to be inserted into media streams. The content selection rules  may include rules pertaining to the selection of the content for the generation of personalized social-awareness based content to be inserted into media streams. The content insertion rules  may include rules pertaining to the insertion of personalized social-awareness based content into media streams.","Referring to , a method  illustrating exemplary steps for carrying out aspects of the invention is shown. The method  may be implemented, for example, as a computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied therewith, the computer readable program code comprising computer readable program code configured to implement the steps set out herein with regard to . The method can be implemented by a variety of technologies including, for example, traditional personal computers and audio\/video devices, network aware set top boxes, gaming consoles, or any other processing devices such as those set out herein. Also traditionally static content systems, such as DVD players or BLU-RAY DISC players, can also be utilized since they allow the content providers to employ a mechanism to use the IP stack in the system to retrieve network content. Further, media software executed by the media server according to aspects of the invention may be implemented in any appropriate manner to implement the features and functions set out more fully herein.","At , a media stream is monitored by a media server, such as the media server  discussed above, to identify predetermined markers within the monitored media stream. Each marker designates an associated insertion position within the media stream. Further, each marker may be associated with corresponding marker content, which may be a standard advertisement or may be code that represents a space associated with the marker. The media stream may comprise, for example, a video game, an online metaverse or alternate realm application, such as SECOND LIFE (SECOND LIFE is a registered trademark of Linden Research, Inc., located in San Francisco Calif.) an audio\/video media, such as a television program, a DVD or a BLU-RAY DISC, etc., or some other form of media stream as described herein. The media server may use monitoring rules, such as may be stored in a rules database , to monitor the media stream.","The media server identifies the predetermined markers in the media stream and selects ones of the markers for insertion of personalized social-awareness based content into the media stream at . The inserted personalized social-awareness based content may modify, add to, or replace the marker content that is associated with the selected marker.","The media server may use, for example, marker selection rules or other selection techniques to select ones of the markers to insert personalized social-awareness based content into the media stream. For example, the media server may use properties of the media stream, e.g., properties of the media stream subject matter, properties of the media stream source, properties of the marker content, and\/or of the associated target of the media stream to determine whether to insert the personalized social-awareness based content into the media stream. Thus, if the media server determines that personalized social-awareness based content would be more meaningful to the target than the existing marker content, the media server may determine to modify\/add to\/replace the marker content with the personalized social-awareness based content. The media server uses the personalized social-awareness based content to replace the generic advertisements or designated content space within the media stream with content that is believed to be more meaningful\/interesting to the target, which is believed to lead to higher value opportunities for monetization for advertisers that insert personalized social-awareness based content associated with their products\/services into the media stream.","If the media server determines that the marker content associated with an identified marker is to be modified\/added to\/replaced at , the media server transforms the monitored media stream at . Transforming the monitored media stream may comprise, for example, modifying or removing a portion of the marker content associated with the marker, adding to the marker content associated with the marker, or replacing all or a portion of the marker content associated with the marker. This transformation of the media stream is intended to increase target interest in the media stream as discussed in detail herein. The media server may use media stream transformation rules to transform the media stream. Additional details in connection with the transformation will be discussed herein with respect to .","Once the media stream is transformed at , the transformed media stream is communicated to a target at . The target may comprise an audience including one or more users that are capable of observing the media stream on an associated processing device, such as one of the processing devices  described above.","Referring to , an exemplary method  is illustrated for transforming a monitored media stream according to aspects of the invention. The media stream may be any type of media stream as described more fully herein.","At least one property of the monitored media stream is identified by a media server, such as the media server  discussed above, at . The media server  may use various data sources, including for example, the secondary sources  described above, to identify at least one property of the media stream. The media server  may also use rules, such as the rules included in the rules database  discussed above, to retrieve and evaluate the data from the secondary sources .","At , social awareness information is identified. The social awareness information is associated with a target of the monitored media stream that is to be transformed. The social awareness information may be identified by the media server  using any suitable method as discussed above, e.g., using a user interface accessible by targets for entering target information, retrieving data from social networking servers, presence and awareness servers, gaming servers, and\/or audio\/video media servers, etc. The retrieved data may include data that was manually entered into or otherwise known by the corresponding servers, or could be derived from user preferences and tendencies that are inferred from information collected from the various servers. For example, the media server  can query various servers across the network  to discover information about a particular target, examples of which may include recent and upcoming programming that is scheduled to be recorded on a cable set top box, videos that were viewed on a cable set top box, games that were played on a gaming system, locations that were visited in an alternate reality application, etc. Such information may imply interests of the target to the media server . Still further, the media server  may infer\/imply interests of the target by combining acquired social-awareness knowledge from multiple sources.","Further, the acquired social-awareness knowledge may be identified, derived, inferred or otherwise acquired by the media server  through social awareness applications and\/or presence awareness applications\/services, which are utilized by contacts e.g., friends, relatives, co-workers, peers, etc., of a target. For example, a contact of the target may have information about or otherwise related to the target, which is stored on one or more computer processing devices, e.g., social networking servers assessable by the media server . For example, the media server  may evaluate information associated with a social networking home page\/profile associated with a \u201cfriend\u201d of the target. Moreover, acquired information need not be directly about the target. For example, the media server  may evaluate the information of one or more \u201cfriends\u201d of the target on a social networking server. By knowing the interests of \u201cfriends\u201d, the media server  can infer interests of the target. Thus, the media server  may mine social awareness applications and\/or presence awareness applications\/services that contact(s) of the target use, even if the target does not also use such applications. This information or a variation thereof, which may or may not have been discovered based upon information directly provided by the target, may be used to identify the social awareness information by the media server  that is utilized to derive personalized social-awareness based content directed toward interests of the target. The media server  may also use social awareness information rules to retrieve and evaluate the social awareness information.","At , at least one identified property of the monitored media stream and\/or the identified social awareness information are utilized to derive personalized social-awareness based content to be inserted into a corresponding insertion position of the monitored media stream. As one example, previously recorded or live media content from the target or an established online relationship contact, such as content that the target has not yet experienced, can be inserted as the personalized social-awareness based content. Alternatively, a positive achievement from the target's previous experience with the media stream can be inserted as the personalized social-awareness based content, such as to re-enforce the positive past achievement. For example, the positive achievement could be footage of the user completing a level of a video game, scoring a hole in one in a golf video game, etc. According to various aspects of the present invention, this past achievement may alternatively be a particular achievement over one of the target's established online relationship contacts in order to maintain a competitive atmosphere to encourage the target to continually use the product\/service associated with the personalized social-awareness based content. The media server  may use content selection rules to select the personalized social-awareness based content to be inserted into the media stream.","At , the personalized social-awareness based content is inserted into the monitored media stream at the corresponding insertion position. As discussed above, the personalized content can modify, add to, or replace all or a portion of the marker content associated with the marker being modified\/added to\/replaced. The media server may use content insertion rules to insert the personalized social-awareness based content into the media stream. Thereafter, the transformed media stream is communicated to the target.","According to various aspects of the present invention, an increase in advertisement relevancy in services\/products may be realized by utilizing social network awareness to interleave social-relevant content into the media stream. For example, social awareness may be derived by evaluating relationship contacts in social networking applications.","By way of illustration, to decide what replacement content to use, a media server, such as the media server  discussed above, can access or otherwise derive or infer information gathered from social networking systems to determine established online relationships to find friends and social contacts of the target, e.g., to find social acquaintances of the target that own and\/or use a particular product that is advertised at a corresponding marker position in an associated media stream.","For example, the media server  may know the identity of the target. By way of illustration, the target may have optionally previously specified social networking applications that the target is associated with. This approach may be beneficial, for example, where the target utilizes social networks that require security. If the target provides security authorization, the media server  can use the built in security features of the associated social networks to obtain relevant social information about the target. Moreover, such an approach may ensure that the media server  does not violate the boundaries of the social networks.","Alternatively, the media server  can investigate known social networking systems to try to identify whether the target is associated with the investigated social network, such as by querying social awareness applications known to determine whether the target is affiliated with any of the known social awareness applications. The media server  may then evaluate data obtainable with regard to social contacts, e.g., by exploring and following information with regard to social contacts. In this regard, the media server  may set a limit to the degree of separation from the target. For example, the media server  could track the social contacts of the target's friends to see for example, if a \u201cfriend of a friend\u201d may use or have published information about an advertised product.","Either way, many social network servers have Web-based portals that provide front-ends that support query mechanisms. The media server  may utilize these portals or other automated query mechanisms to explore and build socially aware knowledge with regard to a particular target. Accordingly, a dynamic system is provided that identifies interests of the target and dynamically selects advertising to market directly to the target's interests.","Still further, the media server  may infer interests of the user in order to select directed advertisements, e.g., based upon usage trends, detectable patterns or other metrics. By way of illustration, if a target logs onto a social network every day at 11:30, it may be inferred that the user is making lunch plans. As such, a directed advertisement to the target in an associated media stream that the target views in the morning may include an advertisement for a nearby restaurant. In this regard, a target profile that includes geographic information may be utilized to select only restaurants that are within a reasonable proximity to the target.","Still further, the media server  may include prioritization rules to resolve conflicts when evaluating social-awareness information. For example, a target may have a plurality of friends who all have stored video clips of them playing a game. In this regard, the media server  may select only one based upon a prioritization algorithm or randomly select one. For example, the media server may utilize the strength of relationships between the target and one or more friends in determining which friend to select. The strength of the relationship may be determined, for example, based on the frequency or longevity of interaction between the target and the friends on social awareness applications and\/or presence awareness applications, the number of common associations across multiple social awareness applications, etc.","Still further, the media server  may utilize a relevancy sorting algorithm to select the particular advertising content to direct towards a target, and\/or to select the personalized social-awareness content to augment the advertisement. For example, one friend may have entered a blog entry about a specific product\/service, wherein the blog entry corresponds to text pertaining to the product service, while another friend has been recorded interacting with the product\/service, wherein the recorded footage corresponds to audio and\/or video content pertaining to the product\/service. The media server  may decide which type of content to insert into the target's media stream based on the relevancy of the content to be inserted as it corresponds to the media steam that the target is experiencing. Thus, for example, the media server  may select the blog text to dynamically insert into a marker if the context is a billboard in a video game or alternate realm. However, the media server  may dynamically insert the video footage into a marker if the corresponding media stream is a video, a pause between scenes of a video game, etc.","Moreover, the inserted content may be derived from live events, such as where a social acquaintance is simultaneously on-line. If, for example, a social acquaintance is using the product, such as may occur if a social acquaintance is currently playing the advertised game online, the media server  may interleave a live feed of the product in action being played by the social acquaintance into the actual advertisement stream. In this regard, many gaming systems have or will soon have Internet capability. Moreover, cameras and other such devices are becoming available, which interact with these video games so that video and\/or audio capabilities can be captured by the gaming system. Once the gaming system captures the information, such captured feeds may be communicated across the network  to the media server .","As yet another example, the inserted content may be derived from previously stored footage that was previously generated by or on behalf of social acquaintances. Still further, the inserted content may be obtained from a single source, or the inserted content may be coalesced from information obtained across multiple realms to provide a more relevant experience to the target.","Thus, as a few illustrative examples, assume that a target's friend is using a product or has used a product that is to be advertised in the media stream communicated to the target. In this regard, the media personalization system  may utilize various databases and social networking applications to discover or otherwise infer that the target has a friend that has used the product. The media personalization system  may then discover or otherwise generate content that characterizes or otherwise associates the target's friend with, using, commenting on, blogging about or otherwise relating to the product. This association is then interleaved into the media stream communicated to the user so as to generate personalized social-awareness based content. The media server  could thus, for example, interleave live content of the friend interacting with the product into the media stream being communicated to the target, present a link to the friend's comments about the product on a social networking server, or communicate some other indicia that informs the target of the friend's association with the product.","As another example, the media server  could insert or otherwise play recorded personalized social-awareness based content by utilizing the ability of many online gaming systems, alternate reality applications, metaverses, etc., to record content and save that content for future playback. This content can then be inserted into the media stream communicated to the target as the personalized social-awareness based content. Some servers allow these types of content to be captured in standard video formats for distribution outside from server's realm, thus making it possible to insert the content directly into media streams associated with other types of media streaming processes without additional interfaces or transcoding steps. Thus, a video clip of a friend playing a game that may be of interest to the target may be inserted as marker content into a media stream in a completely different context, e.g., a media stream of an on-demand movie.","Even in the case that such additional interfaces or transcoding steps are required, many processing devices make it easy to provide these interfaces in a common way, e.g. public system application programming interfaces (APIs), and the additional marketing opportunities would make it more likely product providers would embrace and enable this capability. Still further, social networking information can be aggregated to provide statistics and other measures that can be dynamically integrated into the marker content. For example, if an advertisement is for a new game, the media server  may learn through exploring and querying social networking servers that 10 of the target's friends all have, play, like, etc., the game or similar games. The dynamic advertisement can thus incorporate this metric into the customized advertisement.","According to various aspects of the present invention, the personalized social-awareness based content could comprise any form of commonly used media format, e.g., video, audio, picture, etc., and may include any statistics or available metadata related to the recorded format. Further, the personalized social-awareness based content could comprise other types of media format or metadata about such other types of media format, examples of which may include touch information, movement information, scent information, vibration information, etc.","According to various aspects of the present invention, the media server provides highly targeted advertisements for products\/services that are directed toward targets by peeking target interest through the use of personalized social-awareness based content, such as real live\/recorded content from established online relationship contacts. Since products associated with the personalized social-awareness based content may be affiliated with established online relationship contacts, some of which the target may have experienced similar media streams with, the likelihood of gaining the interest of the target is even greater.","The media server  described herein is likely to attract new members to product user communities, thus increasing product usage. In addition, the media server  can be utilized to increase target attachment to a particular product\/service by promoting an exciting environment that encourages targets to return to the particular product\/service. This is desirable for media streaming processes such as games and alternative relative applications, which may include a large number of targets that may otherwise lose interest and cease use of the product service. To achieve this increase target attachment, the media server  may account for the target's previous interaction with the media streaming process in deciding the appropriate future personalized social-awareness based content to be inserted, using any of the means described herein.","Advertisement represents a large source of revenue for many company business models, and utilizing various aspects of the media server  as described more fully herein, increases the chances of monetizing on the inserted advertisements by injecting relevant content by peer groups and friends, and other social contacts, making it much more likely for the audience to pay attention to advertisements (and even looking forward to seeing new footage in advertisements to come). Ultimately, this is likely to increase the chances of the product being sold and make it more likely product providers will advertise with content providers that employ such a system.","According to various aspects of the present invention, the media server  may function as a social awareness aggregator. For instance, the media server  may proactively obtain social awareness information from a plurality of sources and aggregate the collected data to create composite information about target audience members. This aggregated composite data can be sent to advertisers who then generate the media streams. For instance, the media server  may communicate aggregated social awareness information to the game server so that the game server can select targeted advertisements to relevant target audiences. In this regard, the media server  may implement a subscription server to sell aggregated composite socially aware data. The media server  may also implement an on-demand model where it populates media streams with directed advertisements on-demand. Still further, the media server  may implement a push\/pull system where it inserts the advertisements into the media streams and sends the stream to the originating source, or the media server  may intercept or otherwise receive media streams as part of an intermediate process.","According to various aspects of the present invention, the media server  may obtain the data to create the personalized social-awareness based content described herein from, for example, a database that contains advertising content, directly from advertisers, or the media server  itself may contain the data. The media server  may access the database or the advertiser via the network , which may also be used to communicate the data from the database or advertiser to the media server . According to various aspects of the present invention, the database may include collections of advertisements that may be selected by the media server  for the creation of personalized social-awareness based content. However, the particular personalized social-awareness based content inserted into the media stream is either selected or selected and augmented based upon social awareness information as described herein.","Referring to , a block diagram of a data processing system is depicted in accordance with the present invention. Data processing system , such as one of the processing devices  or the media server  described with reference to , may comprise a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) system or other configuration including a plurality of processors  connected to system bus . Alternatively, a single processor  may be employed. Also connected to system bus  is memory controller\/cache , which provides an interface to local memory . An I\/O bus bridge  is connected to the system bus  and provides an interface to an I\/O bus . The I\/O bus may be utilized to support one or more busses and corresponding devices , such as bus bridges, input output devices (I\/O devices), storage, network adapters, etc. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks.","Also connected to the I\/O bus may be devices such as a graphics adapter , storage  and a computer usable storage medium  having computer usable program code embodied thereon. The computer usable program code may be executed to execute any aspect of the present invention, for example, to implement any aspect of any of the methods and\/or system components illustrated in . Moreover, the computer usable program code may be utilized to implement the monitoring of the media stream, the selection of the predetermined markers, and the transformation of the media steam as set out further herein.","The data processing system depicted in  may be, for example, an IBM RS\/6000 system, a product of International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y., running the Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX) operating system. An object oriented programming system such as Java may run in conjunction with the operating system and provides calls to the operating system from Java programs or applications executing on data processing system.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","Any combination of one or more computer readable medium(s) may be utilized.
