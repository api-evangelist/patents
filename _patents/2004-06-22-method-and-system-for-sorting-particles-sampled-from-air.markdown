No. 60\/147,794 filed Aug. 9, 1999, all of which are entirely incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","1. Technical Field","The present invention is generally related to the sorting of particles.","2. Description of the Related Art","The collection and monitoring of particles separated from a gas is needed in many diverse situations. Some of these situations include defense against biological warfare agents in battlefield and other military applications; and protecting the general public against: airborne pathogenic agents released by terrorist groups; genetically modified material used in biotechnology applications; infectious organisms contaminating air in hospitals, research labs, public buildings, and confined spaces such as subway systems; and pollutant aerosols that damage the respiratory system. The collection and measurement of infectious organisms are of interest to a wide community of public health officials because they can cause infectious diseases or chemical damage to the respiratory system. These particles are also of concern to the Department of Defense (DOD) because of their possible use in biological warfare and terrorism.","Air quality monitoring is also an important public health need. As the world's population rises and world travel becomes increasingly easy, the degree and pace at which communicable diseases can spread has resulted in significant concerns regarding potential epidemics from airborne disease transmission. Recirculation of air in buildings and other enclosed spaces such as subways and airplanes has lead to a potentially significant public health issues. Identification and control of infectious disease organisms in hospitals represents another major need. The Environmental Protection Agency cites indoor air pollution causing \u201csick building syndrome\u201d as a major environmental problem in the United States.","Threats from microorganisms in the air as a result of natural phenomena or human-induced activities such as the examples discussed above cannot be adequately monitored and evaluated with current technology. Early warning, hazard recognition, personal protective equipment, exposure evaluation, and environmental monitoring are needed to prevent and reduce impacts from airborne infectious or genetically modified material. Near real-time monitoring is necessary to avoid exposure and to initiate early treatment to arrest disease progression.","Systems and methods for sorting particles in a gaseous stream are provided. Briefly described, one embodiment of an apparatus includes a scanner, a sorter, which is in pneumatic communication with the scanner, and a controller, which is in electrical communication with the scanner and sorter. The scanner is adapted to receive a gaseous stream and measure a characteristic of a particle entrained in the gaseous stream. The controller is adapted to classify the scanned particle according to the measured characteristic of the particle. The sorter includes an electrically controlled valve. Responsive to the particle being classified as belonging to a first category, the controller signals the valve to deflect the trajectory of the particle.","An embodiment of a method can be broadly summarized by the following steps: receiving particles in a gaseous stream; classifying a particle from the received stream of particles according to a property of the particle, wherein the particle is classified as belong to one category of a plurality of categories, and wherein the received particle has an initial trajectory; and responsive to the particle being classified as belonging to a first category of the plurality of categories, altering the trajectory of the particle.","Other systems, methods, features, and\/or advantages will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and\/or advantages be included within the description and be protected by the accompanying claims.","Referring to , an embodiment of a aerosol particle sorter system (APSS)  includes components such as a particle scanner , a controller , a particle sorter  and a pump , which are approximately longitudinally aligned and which approximately define a longitudinal axis . The APSS  is immersed in a gas , such as the atmosphere, having particles  therein. The pump  draws gas and particles into the APSS  through an induction port  and exhausts at least the gas out of an eduction port . Generally, the particles  include many types of particles, which may be classified into predetermined categories. For example, all of the particles of type (A) can belong to category ; all of the particles of type (B) belong to category  and so on.","Gas  and particles  are drawn from the induction port  into the particle scanner . The particle scanner  scans the particles  as the particles flow through the particle scanner . From the particle scanner , the gas  and particles  flow into the particle sorter. The pump  draws the gas through the particle sorter  and exhausts at least the gas  through the eduction port .","As particles  are drawn through the particle scanner , the particles pass through region , which is known as the scan zone. When a particle in the scan zone , the particle scanner  measures physical and\/or optical properties or characteristics of the scanned particles  while the particles are in a scan zone . The measured quantities are provided to the controller  via an electrical connection .","The controller  includes a processor  and a particle characteristic database . The particle characteristic database  includes known physical and\/or optical properties of various particles. The processor  uses the measured quantities reported by the particle scanner  to determine whether a scanned particle belongs to a category of particles and whether the category of particles is one of interest. Generally, particles of interest are sorter from uninteresting particles, and the other particles exit the APSS  via the eduction portion .","Whether or not a particle is of interest or not depends upon the category of the particle, and categories are established by the operator of the APSS . Having identified a particle of interest, the controller  sends a trigger signal to the particle sorter , via an electrical connection , which prompts the particle sorter  to sort particles of interest from other particles when the particles of interest are in a target zone .","Generally, the APSS  is used to sort airborne particles and, in that case, the mean velocity (v) of the particles through the APSS  is governed by the pump . The distance (D) between the scan zone  and the target zone  is fixed and known. Consequently, the time (t) for a particle of interest to traverse the distance D is simply D divided by v(t=D\/v). The controller  triggers the particle sorter  at the appropriate time such that the particle of interest is in the target zone. In some embodiments, the controller  calculates the delay time between when a particle is in the scan zone  and when it is in the target zone . In some alternative embodiments, the operator of the APSS  provides the delay time to the APSS .","In some embodiments, the APSS  is used to sort particles when there is no gas flow through the instrument, i.e., particles that are not carried by an airflow through the instrument, but instead fall through the instrument because of gravitational acceleration. In this embodiment, the APSS  is aligned generally vertically and the particle scanner  detects a particle at two or more different vertical locations. The controller  then determines the velocity of the particle. In some embodiments, the controller  can also determine the acceleration of the particle. Generally, the acceleration is not necessary because the particles are normally falling at their terminal velocity. The controller  is adapted to determine the delay time between when a particle is scanned and when it is in the target zone  so that particles of interest can be sorted.","Generally, the APSS  is used to sort airborne particles whose drift rate through the APSS  is approximately that of the gas. In some embodiments, the pump  induces a drift rate of approximately 10 meters per second through the APSS . The controller  knows the drift rate (10 m\/sec.) and the longitudinal position of where particles are scanned and the longitudinal position of where particles are sorted. Thus, for the case of particles having constant velocity, the trigger signal for sorting a given particle is a known constant delay from the time at which the particle is scanned.","Referring to , which illustrates components of the particle scanner  as seen from above, particles entrained within a stream of air are drawn into the particle scanner  and are directed downward toward the scan zone . The scan zone  is defined by two nearly orthogonal, different-wavelength laser trigger beams (Lasers (A) and (B)), which are aimed and focused precisely to define an approximate 15-\u03bcm diameter focal volume position just upstream (about 50 micron) of a first focal plane of reflecting objective . In some embodiments, the lasers (A) and (B) are diode lasers  and , respectively, which respectively emit light at 670 and 635 nm.","As a particle  passes through the intersection of trigger beams from lasers (A) and (B) (defined as the trigger volume), light is scattered from the particle  and is detected by photomultipliers (PMTs)  and . PMT  is equipped with a narrowband interference filter such that it only detects light scattered from the trigger beam from laser (A).","Likewise, PMT  is equipped with a narrowband interference filter so that it may only detect scattered light from the trigger beam from diode laser (B). The intensity of the scattered light may be approximately proportional to the size of the particle. To avoid detection of particles outside the size range of interest, the output signals from PMTs  and  are processed by a pair of single channel analyzers (SCA)  and  which operate as discriminators in a window mode.","The PMT output pulses must exceed a preset lower voltage level and be less than a preset higher voltage level (as set in the window mode) before the SCA may provide an output pulse. Thus, fluorescence spectra are measured only for particles falling within a preset size interval.","The two SCA outputs are fed into a logic AND gate , which produces an output pulse only when the SCA output signals overlap. The output of AND gate  triggers a probe laser  to fire and also turns on a camera controller , which activates the a camera  to record only when the probe laser  fires. Thus, particles not flowing through trigger volume , which would not be illuminated by the central portion of the beam from the probe laser , and which are not in the focal region of reflecting objective , are ignored. In some embodiments, the probe laser  is a Q-switched UV laser.","The system is completed by spectrograph  with long pass filter , which disperses the fluorescence to camera  and camera controller . The output of camera controller  is fed to the controller  where data may be displayed, stored and analyzed. In particular, pattern recognition algorithms are employed by the controller  to detect and classify the particles .","Various modifications and alternatives are possible. For example, in an alternative embodiment, leakage of scattering from trigger beams from lasers (A) and (B) may be eliminated by signaling the lasers to turn off using the same signal from the logic circuit as is used to trigger the probe laser . Probe laser  is preferably a tightly focused pulsed UV laser triggerable on demand and of sufficiently high intensity or fluency to excite fluorescence in microparticles.","In a preferred embodiment, probe laser  is a Q-switched UV laser, either 266 nm, 4th harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser, 30- or 70-ns pulse duration, 0.1 to 0.2 mJ per pulse (Spectra Physics models X-30 or Y-70), or 351 nm, 3rd harmonic of a Nd:YLF laser, 120 ns pulse duration, 1.65 mJ per pulse (Quantronix). The Q-switched laser was set to fire within approximately 3 microseconds of the trigger pulse (from the AND circuit), during which time the particle traveled (at a speed of about 10 m\/s) about 30 micrometers. Various other probe lasers may be employed, depending on the type of particle and fluorescence to be detected.","The vertical displacement between the location where the particle is detected (trigger volume) and the location where the particle is probed (detection volume) can be compensated for by a small vertical displacement of the focal volume of trigger beams from lasers (A) and (B) and the beam from probe laser , which is focused at a focal plane of the reflecting objective.","Alternatively, the displacement of these two volumes may be compensated for by a variable electronic delay, with the delay based on the speed at which particles are introduced into the focal volume.","In some embodiments, multiple-wavelength excitation (e.g., one wavelength within the absorption band for tryptophan, and a longer wavelength for other biological molecules) may be used to better identify biological particles.","Reflecting objective  preferably has a large numerical aperture that can collect fluorescence from the emitting particle over a large solid angle, and focus it onto the slit of a spectrograph without chromatic aberration. In a preferred embodiment, reflective objective  (a so-called Schwartzchild reflecting objective) is manufactured by the Ealing Company and has numerical aperture 0.5.","Alternatively, the sensitivity of the particle scanner  may be increased by adding a spherical reflector on the side opposite the Schwartzchild objective, or by replacing the Schwartzchild reflective objective  with a parabolic or ellipsoidal reflector. With this modification, particles would be excited to fluoresce when they traverse the focal point of the reflector. The parabolic reflector would collect the fluorescence, which would be focused onto the slit of spectrograph  as with the Schwartzchild reflecting objective. The ellipsoidal reflector may collect the fluorescence and focus it onto the slit of the spectrograph  positioned at the second focal point of the mirror.","In another embodiment, the camera  is manufactured by Princeton Instruments. Camera  is placed at the exit port of the spectrograph  (an Acton model SP-150 with 300 groove\/mm grating blazed at 500 nm, numerical aperture 0.125, input slit width 1 mm). The image intensifier of camera  acts as a fast shutter, opening when the targeted particle is illuminated by the UV laser. A long pass filter  is placed in front of spectrograph  to block elastically-scattered light and to pass the fluorescence.","In another embodiment, the camera  is a multiple-channel photomultiplier tube (PMT), and the camera controller  is manufactured by Vtech. However, in alternative embodiments, a multiplexer can also be used. A multiple-channel PMT provides the advantages of comparable sensitivity, compactness, lighter weight, and lower cost, as compared to other controllers such as an intensified charge coupled device controller. A 32 channel system provides sufficient spectral resolution to classify bioaerosol particles and provides for rapid sampling of aerosol particles and portability.","Further details of a particle scanner  can be found in U.S. patent application Ser.

It is desired that these particles be separated from other particles in the gas . The particle receptor (A) includes a valve (A) and a filter . The valve (A) generally remains closed until it is triggered by the controller  to open. The filter  is adapted to filter particles (A) out of the gas.","The particle receptor (B) also includes a valve (B). The valve (B) remains generally open unless it is triggered by the controller  to close. Generally, one of the valves (A) or (B) is open while the other valve is closed, and the controller  causes the valves (A) and (B) to reciprocate back and forth between open and closed depending upon which category of particle is currently being sorted.","The particle deflector  includes a pump , pressurized gas canister , a valve  and a nozzle . The pump  pumps gas into the gas canister  so that the gas canister  remains pressurized.","The valve  is in pneumatic communication with the gas canister  and in electrical communication with the controller . Upon receiving a triggering signal from the controller , the valve  opens and releases pressurized gas from the gas canister . In another embodiment, the valve  is a current-loop actuated (CLA) pulse wave valve such as a Pulsed Supersonic Valve C-211 by RM Jordan, Inc, Grass Valley, Calif. In yet another embodiment, the valve  is a piezo-electric valve or a solenoidal valve, which are known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the valve  is adapted to operate, open and close, up to approximately 500 times a second or more. Currently, the Pulsed Supersonic Valve C-211 can be operated to be open for pulse lengths as short as 20 microseconds. The scope of the present invention is intended to include any valve adapted to be electrically controlled.","The nozzle  is affixed to the valve  and gas released from the gas canister  flows through the nozzle  into the particle sorter (A). The nozzle  is aligned such that the released gas is directed towards the target zone  and such that the initial trajectory of the released gas is approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal axis  of the APSS .","At the appropriate time, the controller  sends a trigger signal to the valve  and the valves (A) and (B). Responsive to the trigger signal, the valve (A) opens and the valve (B) closes, thereby causing gas to flow through the particle receptor (A) and preventing gas from flowing through the particle receptor (B). The valve  opens responsive to receiving the trigger signal, thereby causing a burst of gas  to be released from the gas canister . The gas  deflects the trajectory of a target particle (A). The valves (A) and (B) remain in their current state until the particle (A) has entered the particle receptor (A), and then they reciprocate. In other words, if particle receptor (A) is a first particle receptor and particle receptor (B) is a second particle receptor, when target particle (A) is deflected toward first particle receptor (A), it is simultaneously deflected away from particle receptor (B). The controller  controls how long the valves  remain in a given state and how long the valve  remains open.","In some embodiments, particles are sorted by deflecting the trajectory of the particles using merely the valves (A) and (B). In this embodiment, when a particle of interest is in the target zone , the valve (A) is opened and the valve (B) is closed. The valves remain in that configuration until the particle of interest has been drawn into the particle receptor (A), and then, the valves reciprocate.","In some embodiments, the particles are sorted by the particle deflector  merely deflecting the trajectory of selected particles. In this embodiment, the particle sorter (A) does not include valves , or if the valves  are present, they remain open, and in either case, the pump  draws gas through the particle receptors (A) and (B) simultaneously. When a particle of interest is in the target zone , the controller  triggers the particle deflector , which then emits the burst of gas , thereby deflecting the particles of interest such that the particles of interest flow into the particle receptor (A).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["16","60","16","64","66","66","66","66","64","66","64","64","66","64","66","64","66","16","66","64","16","64","66","64","66"]},"In some embodiments, the controller  controls not only how long the valve  of the particle deflector remains open, but also the escape velocity of the emitted gas . Such control of escape velocity is normally accomplished by controlling the pressure in the pressurized gas canister . Controlling the escape velocity provides a means for determining the amount of deflection that a given particle should receive. In this embodiment, the pump  is in electrical communication with the controller  such that the controller  can control the amount of pressure in the gas canister .","Referring to , in some embodiments, the APSS  includes a particle diluter assembly . The particle diluter assembly  attaches to the induction port  and is in electrical communication with the controller  via electrical connectors  and .","The particle diluter  includes a counter assembly  and a dilution chamber , which are in pneumatic communication via a connecting pipe . Particles  and gas  are drawn into the counter assembly via an induction port . The counter assembly  counts the particles  as they are drawn into the counter assembly  and communicates the particle count to the particle controller  via the electrical connection . From the counter assembly  the particles flow into the dilution chamber  via the connecting pipe  and through the induction port .","The dilution chamber  includes a dilution port  having a valve  and a filter  therein. If the particle current density in the particle sorter  is too great, then the particle sorter  can not effectively sort particles. To prevent this from happening, the controller  monitors the particle flux in the particle counter assembly , and when the particle flux reaches a predetermined level, the controller  opens the valve , thereby allowing gas to enter into the dilution chamber . The filter  is adapted to filter particles out of the gas flowing through the dilution port  such that clean gas dilutes the particle current density in the dilution chamber .","In some embodiments, the induction port  also includes a valve (not shown) which is in electrical communication with the controller . The controller  controls the particle current density in the APSS  by appropriately controlling the amount of gas and particles flowing through the induction port  and the amount of gas flowing through the dilution port .","In some embodiments, the pump  is a variable pump that is adapted to pump gasses at various rates, and the pump  is controllable by and in communication with the controller . The controller  uses the variable pump  to control the rate at which airborne particles flow through the APSS . By controlling the rate (velocity) at which gas and particles  are drawn into and through the APSS , the controller  controls the rate at which particles enter the target zone . Thus, the controller  can use the pump  to control the rate at which particles enter the target zone  of the particle sorter  such that the particle sorter  does not become swamped with more particles than it can handle. A variable pump can be used in conjunction with the particle diluter assembly  or independently thereof.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementation. Many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments. All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of this disclosure and the present invention and protected by the following claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The components in the drawings are not necessarily to scale.
