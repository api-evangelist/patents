title: Omni-azimuthal pattern generator for VLF and LF communication
abstract: A relative phase shift is induced in the signals of a pair of identical orthogonal antennas such that when the signals are combined the signals are 90 degrees out of phase. This is done in order to eliminate the null along the axis between the two dipole moments of the antennas such that the system has equally good reception from all azimuth angles over a broad range of frequencies. The phase shift is accomplished with the use of single pole operational amplifier circuits whose pole frequencies are adjusted by means of a potentiometer prior to implementation of the antenna system.

This null renders the antenna \u201cblind\u201d along that axis. If two antennas are used and the signals are combined, a null occurs along an axis between the two dipole moments. An ideal antenna system would be one capable of rendering equally good reception from all azimuth angles without a null in the antenna pattern(s).","It is possible to remove the null in the azimuthal response of a pair of identical orthogonal antennas by combining the two signals together ninety degrees out of phase. Adding the two signals in phase only causes the null in the azimuth pattern to shift to a position midway between the dipole moments of the two antennas.","In the past, it has been quite easy to introduce a 90-degree phase shift, at only a single frequency, by the use of a simple, single-pole electrical network. The disadvantage is that over a broad range of frequencies the user has to retune the circuit every time the frequency of operation changes. The challenge is to accomplish a ninety degree phase shift between two identical orthogonal antenna signals and be able to do so over a broad range of frequencies for example from 10 kHz to 200 kHz without exceeding a 3 dB pattern deformation.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to generate an antenna pattern that does not change as a function of azimuth angle, but has equally good reception from all azimuth angles.","It is an additional purpose to generate such an omniazimuthal antenna pattern over a broad range of frequencies in a manner that does not require manual retuning or adjustment.","These objects are accomplished through the introduction of a \u201crelative\u201d phase shift in a pair of identical orthogonally mounted loop antennas whereby operational-amplifier circuits in a network within the antenna system are all single pole circuits, with the pole frequency of the single pole circuits being adjustable by means of a potentiometer.","The omni-azimuthal pattern generator is designed to work with the AN\/BRA-34 (V) and OE-538\/BRC VLF\/LF loop antennas. It is not, however, limited as such and can be scaled and applied to other frequency ranges of interest. Inside each of these antennas are two identical orthogonally mounted loop antennas, called the \u201cFore\/Aft\u201d (F\/A) and \u201cAthwart\u201d (ATH) loops. Referring now to  the equivalent representation of the identical orthogonal antennas F\/A and ATH is illustrated. The outputs of each of these antennas is amplified in the antenna housing and presented as a balanced twisted pair transmission line.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a block diagram of the four stages of the omni-azimuthal pattern generator . The first stage is the differential driver stage . The two balanced twisted pair transmission lines from the orthogonal antennas F\/A and ATH enter the omni-azimuthal pattern generator  at the differential driver stage  at the points denoted \u201cF\/A HI\u201d, \u201cF\/A LO\u201d, \u201cATH HI\u201d, \u201cATH LO\u201d. The next stage is the all-pass network , so called because it has approximately unity gain over a wide frequency range. The all-pass network introduces a relative phase shift of 90 degrees between the two antenna signals. The signals are then combined in the combiner stage . In the final stage, the drive stage , the combined signal is amplified. The resulting output of the omni-azimuthal pattern generator  is an \u201cOMNI HI\u201d signal and an \u201cOMNI LO\u201d signal.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a circuit diagram of the differential driver stage . Operational amplifiers  and  and associated resistors serve as isolation amplifiers and to convert the balanced input into an unbalanced signal for subsequent conditioning.","Referring now to  and , there is illustrated in  a single building block circuit  of the active all-pass network  consisting of an operational amplifier  a potentiometer R, a resistor R, a capacitor Cand other circuit elements. In  there is illustrated the entire all-pass network  consisting of two parallel sets of three of the single building block circuits  in series labeled B to B. As stated above, the active all-pass network  introduces a relative phase shift of 90 degrees between the F\/A leg of the circuit along the top three building block circuits B, B, B, and the ATH leg of the circuit along the bottom three building block circuits B, B, and B. A relative rather than absolute phase shift is sufficient since the absolute phases of the signals are unimportant. The building block circuits B to B in the all-pass network  are all single pole circuits, with the pole frequency being adjustable by means of a potentiometer R.","The transfer function H(j\u03c9) of this network can be shown to be:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mi":"H","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["j","\u03c9"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":["j","\u03c9"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":[{"mi":["R","E1"]},{"mi":"C","mn":"1"}]}},{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":["j","\u03c9"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":[{"mi":["R","E1"]},{"mi":"C","mn":"1"}]}}]}},{"msub":{"mi":["R","E1"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"R","mn":"1"},{"mi":"R","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}}],"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"By cascading the several building block circuits , the phase shift from input to output of each leg of the all-pass network  can be derived as follows:\n\n\u03c6()=\u22122 arc tan (\u03c9\/2)\u22122 arc tan (\u03c9\/4)\u22122 arc tan (\u03c9\/6)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n\u03c6()=\u22122 arc tan (\u03c9\/1)\u22122 arc tan (\u03c9\/3)\u22122 arc tan (\u03c9\/5)\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Here, the \u201cpN\u201d represent the pole frequencies of each of the six building block circuits B to B of the all-pass network.
