title: Process for the production of speherical tetranitroglycouril
abstract: A spherical morphology of the high explosive tetranitroglycoluril (TNGU) has been discovered. This new morphology exhibits approximately a twofold improvement in the response of the material to impact, more than a one and a half fold improvement in friction and the same high resistance to electrostatic discharge over non-spherical TNGU produced by other methods.

Embodiments are also of use in applications requiring a high performing military grade explosive. Tetranitroglycoluril (TNGU) has a detonation performance exceeding Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) and could potentially be used in many of the same types of applications.","While structure  is a very powerful explosive, it has several disadvantages that have precluded its adoption as a standard military explosive. The first of these is its inherent instability in the presence of water. Due to the extreme electron deficiency of the carbonyl of the dinitrourea moiety, that center is incredibly susceptible to nucleophilic attack even by water through exposure to a moist atmosphere. The reactivity of this dinitrourea is unaffected through substitution at the bridgehead position. Unfortunately, this means the half-life of TNGU exposed to the atmosphere with a relative humidity approaching 85% can be on the order of days making it difficult to incorporate into formulations intended for standard military applications (8). While this feature may eliminate it from consideration for standard munition fills, it is potentially finding uses in self-remediating formulations specifically designed to have short environmental residence times after deployment and to lessen the hazards associated with unexploded ordinance (UXO).","Known polynitramines such as 1,3,5-trintro-1,3,5-hexahydrotriazine (RDX) and 1,3,5,7-tro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclooctane (HMX) are high-energy, high-density explosive compounds. They can be prepared by nitrolysis of hexamine with nitric acid and other similar procedures. RDX was first synthesized in 1906 by Brunswig (German Patent No. 299,028). It came into significant use during World II. RDX has a very good thermal stability. It under goes no decomposition below 100\u00b0 C. It begins to decompose only at a temperature above 160-170\u00b0 C. Under vacuum and after 40 hours, only 0.2 and 0.8 cmof gases evolve from a one gram sample of RDX at respectively 102\u00b0 C. and 150\u00b0 C. It melts with decomposition at 204\u00b0 C., but its explosion temperature measured by heating at the rate of 5\u00b0 C. per minute is 260\u00b0 C. The density of hexogen is very high. The crystal density (theoretical density) is 1.82 g\/cmat 20 degrees C. but its highest practical density is only 1.72 g\/cm. Its rate of detonation is 8,800 m\/s at the theoretical density and 8,520 m\/s at the highest practical density. HMX was only discovered and recognized as a valuable explosive during World War II.","Octogen has a very good thermal stability. It undergoes no decomposition below 100\u00b0 C. It begins to decompose at a temperature higher than that of Hexogen. Under vacuum and after 40 hours only 0.08, 0.09, and 0.12 cmof gases evolve from a one gram sample at respectively 100, 120, and 150\u00b0 C.","It melts with decomposition at 280\u00b0 C. but its explosion temperature measured by heating at the rate of 5\u00b0 C. per minute is 330\u00b0 C.","The density of octogen is one of the highest reported for a crystalline high explosive. The crystal density is 1.91 g\/cmat 20\u00b0 C. for the \u03b2-stable crystalline form but the highest practical density obtained by compression of powdered octogen is 1.84 g\/cm. At this density, its rate of detonation is 8,850 m\/s.","TNGU as obtained from prior art methods is obtained as small clumps of fine needles that appear to have significant gaps in between the needles (). This needle like morphology is similar to what was reported in the prior art. There are no other differences between the materials in the experimentally determined sensitivity, decomposition point, or chemical analysis.","In embodiments, one object of the present invention is to provide Tetranitroglycoluril having a spherical structure or morphology. This morphology is easily obtained through solvent\/anti-solvent interactions by first dissolving the material in 100% nitric acid (HNO) and precipitating it by introducing it below the surface of dichloromethane (DCM). The size and quality of the spheres are determined by the rate of addition of the TNGU solution as well as the ratio of HNOto DCM (table 1). It is worth noting, the only solvent system observed to generate spheres is an at least 98% HNO, DCM. In embodiments, a 100% HNOsolution is used. Using 90% HNOor other solvents such as ethyl acetate, acetone, and acetonitrile with DCM as the anti-solvent does not result in the formation of spheres.","Research in the field of higher performing explosives for military use commenced and by the 2nd World War both pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) were investigated. RDX found greater use because it is less sensitive and more powerful than PETN.","The entirety of energetic materials is defined by the American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) as \u201c . . . a compound or mixture of substances which contains both the fuel and the oxidizer and reacts readily with the release of energy and gas . . . \u201d. Energetic materials themselves are then divided into three unique classes: explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics. The class of explosives can be divided further into primary and secondary explosives.","Primary explosives are very sensitive explosives, which can be easily initiated by friction, impact, spark or heat. The initiation of primary explosives leads to a fast deflagration to detonation process with a shock wave formed, which is able to set off the less sensitive charge (main charge, secondary explosive) of an explosive device. They undergo a very fast deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) and are therefore used in initiating devices. Common primary explosives are lead(II) azide, lead(II) styphnate and mercury fulminate. The obvious disadvantage of these compounds is the toxicity of the heavy metal cations. Therefore, new less toxic primary explosives based on organic, metal free compounds were investigated and developed. Besides the development of metal free organic primaries, the replacement of the toxic cations with less toxic metals like silver, iron or copper is another topic of current interest.","Secondary explosives are not only much more stable in terms of friction, impact and electrostatic discharge, but also kinetically stable (metastable) compounds. Hence, they have to be ignited by much larger stimuli, mostly generated by a primary charge. After initiation by the detonation shockwave of primary explosives, the secondary explosive generates a shockwave which promotes the reaction front through the unreacted material. Although they need a much higher impetus to be detonated, secondary explosives exhibit much higher performances than primary explosives. Common secondary explosives are Trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX), triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB) and Nitroguanidine (NQ).","A spherical morphology of the high explosive tetranitroglycoluril (TNGU) has been discovered. This new morphology exhibits approximately a twofold improvement in the response of the material to impact, more than a one and a half fold improvement in friction sensitivity and the same high resistance to electrostatic discharge over non-spherical TNGU produced by other methods.","According to this invention, the production of a spherical morphology of tetranitrogylcoluril (TNGU) is prepared starting with a non-spherical homogenous solution of TNGU in a solvent such as, for example, nitric acid (HNO) then precipitating the TNGU through the use of an anti-solvent to obtain TNGU with a spherical morphology.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, examples and detailed in the following description.","In embodiments, this disclosure provides a new spherical structure or morphology produced in the synthesis of tetranitroglycoluril (TNGU).

The spherical morphology of TNGU is more than three times less sensitive to impact than TNGU produced via prior art methods. This new morphology of TNGU is also less sensitive to impact than HMX while having a higher energy content than HMX. The friction sensitivity of the spherical morphology is less sensitive than TNGU from the prior art, and is comparable to the friction sensitivity of HMX. The electrostatic discharge sensitivity is approximately four times less sensitive than HMX and similar to TNGU obtained via literature methods.","More specifically, by first making a homogenous solution of TNGU in a solvent such as, for example, 100% nitric acid (HNO) then precipitating the TNGU through use of an anti-solvent such as, for example, 100% dichloromethane (DCM) a spherical morphology of TNGU can be obtained. This spherical morphology has several properties which make it more desirable than other morphologies of TNGU that have been produced by the prior art. Previous methods of production of TNGU resulted in needle, or plate-like crystalline morphologies which are more sensitive compared to the spherical morphology. The spherical crystalline morphology greatly reduces hazards associated with the use of this high explosive. Synthesis of a new crystalline morphology of TNGU resulted in significantly decreasing the sensitivity of the explosive to external insult. This coupled with the improvement in the sensitivity profile of the material produced from the new process make it promising candidate as a feed stock in several high performance formulations in order to produce insensitive, high energy density formulations.","TNGU produced with the disclosed spherical structure is more than three times less sensitive to impact than TNGU produced by prior art methods. This difference in sensitivity profile makes the material isolated from the new process inherently more stable to handle and process than material isolated from the prior art methods.","This material is envisioned to be of use in applications requiring a high performing military grade explosive. TNGU has detonation performance exceeding HMX and as such could potentially be used in many of the same types of applications.","Table 2 illustrates density, heat of formation, pressure, change in
