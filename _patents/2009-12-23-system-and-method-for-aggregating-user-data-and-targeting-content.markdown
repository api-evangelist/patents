{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a system and method for aggregating user data and targeting content to users.","2. Description of Related Art","Currently, some businesses rely on mass mailings, telemarketing, online banner ads, and other non-targeted advertising systems in order to reach potential customers. These techniques are generally ineffective, as they lack the ability to target specific consumers for specific products or services in which. Furthermore, these approaches require businesses to contact a wide range of customers without any knowledge as to the likelihood that any particular one would be interested in their specific product or service, wasting valuable advertising resources.","Alternatively, some businesses target potential customers based on user-submitted customer profiles. This is particularly known in the context of online content distribution. Conventional systems collect user information based on user-submitted information online and\/or based on the online activity of the user. Currently existing profile-based systems require that a user fill out a questionnaire identifying their name, age, geographical locations, interests, etc. The system then makes generalizations about the user based on his or her completed questionnaire and\/or online activities, and uses those generalizations in order target advertisements to the user.","Users are often reluctant to divulge their personal information or invest the time in submitting the information. Furthermore, there is no incentive for the user's cooperation or honesty in submitting information. Thus, these systems rely first and foremost on the user's willingness to complete the questionnaire, and second on the user's opinion and self-reporting, with uncertain reliability and validity.","Further, conventional media is converging with new online media. As an example, it is well known for have a fan site for a specific television show. Such sites have proven useful for generating \u201cbuzz\u201d about the show, and creating a sense of community for the fans.","Thus, there is a need in the art for systems and methods for aggregating user data and targeting content to users that engages the user and provides incentive for sharing personal information. Also, there is a need to further leverage online content related to conventional content, such as fan websites for television shows. The present invention meets these needs and other needs by collecting information through quizzes and associating the user with a particular fictional or nonfictional character profile based on the user-submitted information. The user data associated with each character profile is aggregated to identify and recommend content for the user, such as television shows, news feed, web pages, promotions, advertisements, and the like. The invention can be used in connection with fan sites or other topic-specific sites that are associated with the character of the character profile.","One embodiment of the invention provides a method and system for aggregating user data and targeting content. The method preferably comprises sending a user-requested quiz associated with a character result to a user device, receiving user input associated with the quiz, assigning the user to a character result based on the received user input, aggregating user data associated with the user with a character profile associated with the character result, the character profile based on user data from a plurality of users associated with the character result, analyzing the character profile to identify content to target to users associated with the character profile, and delivering the identified content to the user. The system preferably comprises modules configured to carry out the steps of the method.","Delivering the identified content to the user may optionally comprise identifying television shows that users associated with the character profile are watching, determining the most popular shows for the character profile, and delivering a list of the most popular shows to the users associated with the character profile. Alternatively or additionally, delivering the identified content to the user may optionally comprise identifying common activities or interests for users associated with the character profile, determining the most popular activities or interests for the character profile, and delivering a list of the most popular activities or interests to the users associated with the character profile.","The identified content may optionally include one or more of user forums, web pages, news feeds, chat rooms, songs, advertisements, promotions, shops, and watch lists. The news feed may also optionally be delivered to the user.","Analyzing the character profile to identify content may optionally comprise analyzing user profiles of other users associated with the character profile. Alternatively or additionally, analyzing the character profile to identify content may optionally comprise analyzing activities of other users associated with the character profile.","Still other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of exemplary embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The present invention also is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A system and method for aggregating user data and targeting content to users is described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments. It is apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that the present invention can be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiment.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views,  is a flowchart  illustrating a method according to one embodiment. At processing block , a user request to take a quiz is received, and at processing block , the quiz is provided to the user. The quiz may be, for example, a personality test with multiple questions used to match the user with a celebrity or character on a television show. At processing block , the user input associated with the quiz, including the user's answers to the quiz questions, is received. The user input may also include personal and\/or demographic information, such as the user's name, location, age, and the like.","At processing block , the user is assigned to a celebrity or character based on his or her user input. For example, if the user is characterized as being courageous, strong, and likeable from the quiz, the user may be assigned to the hero of a popular television show. At processing block , the assigned character profile is analyzed to determine characteristics of the assigned character. In the same example, the profile of the hero may show that she is a young, adventurous woman who likes sports and traveling.","At processing block , content to target to the user is identified based on the assigned character and\/or analyzed character profile. The content may be either directly or indirectly related to the assigned character. Direct character content may include a character web page, news feeds about the character, forums\/chat rooms about the character, the character's theme song, and the like. Indirect character content may also be targeted to the user based on the analyzed character profile. Indirect character content may include television show web pages similar to the show the character is featured on, targeted advertisements or promotions based on the analyzed character profile, and the like. In the previous example, sports and traveling advertisements or promotions may be identified as being relevant to the user.","Furthermore, content may be identified to target to the user based on content of interest to users assigned to the same character. For example, if users assigned to a particular character typically listen to a certain type of music, a link to music or artist information associated with that type of music may be identified for other users assigned to that character. In another example, if users assigned to a particular character typically watch certain television shows, those television shows may be identified for other users assigned to that character. The identified television shows may also be presented as a \u201cwatch list\u201d to other users, further indicating the dates, times, and channels of upcoming episodes of the television shows. At processing block , the targeted content is delivered to the user.","By targeting content to the user based on his or her quiz result relating him or her to a particular character, it is contemplated that the user is linked into more website content assets. With the user visiting a greater number of content assets, more user clicks are made on the website, increasing the amount of internet advertising revenue generated. Furthermore, the character and\/or television show is further developed to the user, potentially increasing his or her interest in the show. It is contemplated that greater user interest in the character and\/or television show will lead to greater dedication to the show, and greater likelihood that the user will tell others about the show. With more users watching the television show, greater advertising revenue may be generated for the television show as well. Increased user interest in the character and\/or television show could also lead to greater product sales related to the character or show, such as, for example, the sales of character t-shirts, show DVDs, show soundtracks, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"],"b":["200","210","215","220","230","235","255","210"]},"If the user accepts the result at decision block , the user may be offered more quizzes to take at processing block . At decision block , if the user wishes to take another quiz, he or she is directed back to processing block  to select another quiz. Alternatively or additionally, if the user accepts the result at decision block , the user may post the result to a website, such as a social networking website, a blog, and the like, at decision block . If an external website is chosen to post the result to, the system may implement a connection process with that website in order to post the result at processing block . For example, if the user would like to post the results to Facebook\u2122, a Facebook\u2122 Connect process may be initiated.","Alternatively or additionally, if the user accepts the result at decision block , the user may select to have a badge with the result added to his or her profile page at processing block , and as shown and described with respect to . The user may select to become friends with other users, fictional or nonfictional, who received similar results at processing block . At processing block , result-specific actions may be unlocked for the user, such as a variety of \u201csuperpoke\u201d actions. For example, if the user is matched to an affectionate character on a television show in the quiz, the result-specific \u201csuperpoke\u201d actions may include a hug, a kiss, a tap, etc., of another user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["410","410"]},"The system may also suggest one or more other quizzes  for the user to take upon completion of the quiz. In this case, the system suggests \u201cWho's your TV girlfriend?\u201d, \u201cWhat's your ride?\u201d, and \u201cWhat's your style?\u201d, although any other quizzes may be suggested. The system may also suggest shows  in which the user might be interested and\/or others users  that the user may be compatible with, based on results . Further, the system may provide advertisement , which may or may not be targeted to the user based on results , for example, or by any other method, such as the method described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/559,455, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Further, the system may have a social networking feature in which the quiz can be sent to persons connected to the user and\/or recommended by the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 5"],"b":"510"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["610","640","650","610","620","630","610","650","610","610","630","640","650","650","640","650"]},"In use, when a user of one of the plurality of user systems  wants to, for example, take a quiz as described above, a request to access content is communicated to server  over network . For example, a signal is transmitted from one of the user systems , the signal having a destination address (e.g., address representing the server), a request (e.g., content request), and a return address (e.g., address representing the user system that initiated the request). Processor  accesses memory  to provide the requested content, which is communicated to the user over network . For example, another signal may be transmitted that includes a destination address corresponding to the return address of the client system, and the content responsive to the request.","As shown in , system architecture  includes web layer , cache , site application , application programming interface , and a plurality of data stores . It will be appreciated that the system architecture may vary from the illustrated architecture. For example, web layer  may directly access data stores , the site application may directly access data stores , system architecture  may not include cache , etc., as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Web layer  is configured to receive user requests, for example, to take a quiz, through a web browser and return content that is responsive to the user request. Web layer  communicates the user requests to cache . Cache  is configured to temporarily store content that is accessed frequently by web layer  and can be rapidly accessed by web layer . In one embodiment, cache  may be a caching proxy server. Cache  communicates the user requests to site application .","Site application  is configured to update cache  and to process user requests received from web layer . Site application  may identify that the user request is for a page that includes data from multiple sources. Site application  can then convert the page request into a request for content from multiple sources and transmits these requests to application programming interface . Application programming interface  is configured to simultaneously access data from the plurality of data stores  to collect the data responsive to the plurality of requests from site application . The plurality of data stores  may include, for example, data about different characters, content to target to users, and the like. It will be appreciated that in alternative embodiments only one data store  may be provided to store the data.","The data in data stores  is provided to application programming interface , which provides the content to site application . Site application  updates cache  and delivers the cached content in combination with the accessed content to web layer , which delivers browsable content to the user, such as through a quiz page.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"800"},"Computer system  includes processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), main memory  (e.g., read only memory (ROM), flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) such as synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) or Rambus DRAM (RDRAM), etc.) and static memory  (e.g., flash memory, static random access memory (SRAM), etc.), which communicate with each other via bus .","Computer system  may further include video display unit  (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT)). Computer system  also includes alphanumeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard), cursor control device  (e.g., a mouse), disk drive unit , signal generation device  (e.g., a speaker), and network interface device .","Disk drive unit  includes computer-readable medium  on which is stored one or more sets of instructions (e.g., software ) embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein.
