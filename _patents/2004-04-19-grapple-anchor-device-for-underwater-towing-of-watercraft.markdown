title: Grapple anchor device for underwater towing of watercraft
abstract: A grapple anchor device suspended underwater from an unmanned watercraft has prongs pivotally mounted on its tubular housing for hooked engagement with a tow line extended from a retrieval ship so as to tow the watercraft underwater toward the ship. A tow rod within the grapple anchor housing, connected by an anchor line to the watercraft being towed, undergoes dampened axial displacement to condition the grapple anchor device for automatic release of the prongs from the tow line in response to a reduction in the towing force exerted through the tow line after the watercraft is towed into position adjacent the retrieval ship and undergoes crane lift up onto the retrieval ship by its shipboard crane so that the tow line may be withdrawn while the watercraft is transferred onto the ship.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to underwater towing of watercraft toward a retrieval ship for shipboard crane transfer thereto.  ","Current methods for retrieving unmanned watercraft vehicles at sea involve manual handling of the watercraft after attachment thereof to an elongated tow line extended from a retrieval ship and subsequent manual detachment of the tow line from the towed vehicle for shipboard crane transfer of the watercraft onto the ship. Such retrieval methods are very cumbersome and manpower intensive. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for such towing delivery of watercraft to a retrieval ship while avoiding the problematic manual processing involved. ","In accordance with the present invention a grapple anchor device stowed on board an unmanned watercraft vehicle is deployed by suspension underwater therefrom through an anchor line attached by a loop ring to one axial end of the grapple anchor device. Prongs hingedly mounted at an opposite end of the suspended grapple anchor device are hooked to a tow line being swept below the watercraft by deployment from a retrieval ship, for underwater towing of the unmanned watercraft through the grapple anchor device which is thereby placed under tension and primed for automatic release of the prongs from the tow line in response to a reduction in the towing force in the tow line as it is winched into the retrieval ship when the watercraft is towed to a location adjacent thereto. During release of the grapple anchor device from the tow line, the watercraft is lifted onboard the retrieval ship by a crane. Release of the grapple anchor device prongs from the tow line is effected by slidable displacement of a locking collar on a tubular housing of the grapple anchor device to a release position by a pulley line actuator rendered operative by axial displacement of a towing rod during towing. The towing rod extends from one end of the tubular housing for attachment by the loop ring and the anchor line to the watercraft. Dampening means within the tubular housing minimizes such displacement of the towing rod to timely institute release of the tow line. ","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates a retrieval ship  in seawater , from which a tow line  extends, held deployed within the seawater  by a paravane  for hooked engagement of the tow line  by a grapple anchor device  suspended by a 30 foot long anchor line  from an unmanned watercraft or seawater vehicle . The grapple anchor device  was stowed onboard the unmanned vehicle  from which it was released for suspension within the seawater  below the vehicle  by the anchor line , within which tension is then applied in opposition to that in the tow line . Such tension applied to the grapple anchor  is dampened during towing to thereby place the grapple anchor device  in primed condition as hereinafter explained. When the unmanned vehicle  is towed by winch-in of the tow line  into the retrieval ship  to a position adjacent thereto, it is then lifted up by a shipboard crane  as shown in . The tow line  is then released from the primed grapple anchor device  to enable transfer of the unmanned vehicle  onto the retrieval ship  by the shipboard crane .","Referring now to ,  and , the grapple anchor device  has an elongated tubular housing  provided at one axial end  with a hinge assembly  through which four prongs  are pivotally connected to the housing  in 90\u00b0 angular relation to each other. A tang  is connected to each of the prongs  in angular relation thereto. A cylindrical prong locking collar  is slidably mounted on the housing , with a pair of projections  extending radially inwardly therefrom through guide slots  formed in the housing . In the position of the collar  as shown in , the prong tangs  are held in prong locking contact with the housing  within an annular recess  formed in the collar . When the collar  is slidably displaced from its locking position shown in  to a release position as shown in , the prong  tangs  are disengaged for angular displacement with the prongs  to a release position extending in axial alignment with the housing  from its axial end , disengaged from the tow line .","The other axial end of the housing  opposite the end  is closed by an end wall  having a central opening therein through which a connecting rod  extends and is connected to a loop ring  as shown in ,  and . The connecting rod  has a plunger disc  connected thereto within the housing , from which a central rod element  extends through a hole in a plunger plate . Axial displacement of the disc  and the rod element  from the position shown in  to the positions shown in , imposed during suspension of the device  by the anchor line , is slowed down by a hydraulic dampener  positioned within a chamber  enclosed within the housing  between the end wall  and an intermediate support . The hydraulic dampener  includes a flexible deformable tube  sealed at opposite axial ends on the plunger rod element  by end discs  and  in respective engagement with the plunger disc  and the support . Enclosed within the tube  about the rod element  is a suitable dampening fluid. Also a coil spring  is positioned within the housing chamber  in axial engagement at opposite ends thereof with the dampener end discs  and  to further resist excessive inward plunger displacement of the plunger disc  and the rod element  from the initial position as shown in .","Displacement of the collar  from its prong locking position shown in  to the release position shown in  is effected through pulleys  on the support  from which pulley lines  extend. The pulley lines  are anchored between the collar projections  and the plunger plate . Thus, when the plunger rod element  is axially displaced inwardly in one axial direction to the position shown in , it displaces the plunger  plate  inwardly on the rod element  so as to pull on the pulley line  and exert an axial release force on the collar  through the collar projections . A one-way latch (not shown) may be utilized to transmit the pulley force between the plunger rod element  and the plunger plate  in one direction only.","It will be apparent from the foregoing description that the grapple anchor device  when ejected from its stow position on the unmanned vehicle  into the seawater , sinks and hangs suspended therebelow by the anchor line , with the prongs  locked in position by the collar  so as to accommodate its engagement by the tow line  held deployed from the retrieval ship  by the paravane  as shown in . The unmanned vehicle  may then be towed through the grapple anchor device  in its primed condition as shown in  by winch-in of the tow line  into the retrieval ship . During such towing action the tension in the tow line  increases depending on towing speed to exert a pulling force on the plunger rod element  against the bias of the spring  to impart axial displacement thereto, minimized by the dampener  so as to prime the grapple anchor device  for subsequent release of the prongs  held by the collar  in working position as shown in . The rod element  is then prevented from being pulled back through the hole in the plate . The tow line  is thereafter disengaged from the prongs  when the vehicle  positioned adjacent the retrieval ship  is lifted up by the shipboard crane  as shown in , with the collar  of the grapple anchor device  slidably displaced to its release position as shown in , as a result of a reduction in tension exerted through the tow line . Upon such release of the tow line  from the prongs  the tow line  falls off the grapple anchor device  and is pulled up by continued winch-in to the deck of the ship . Such tow line disengagement from the grapple anchor device  involves axial displacement of the plunger disc  fixed to the plunger rod element  from the housing  end well , with force transfer to the plunger plate  so as to position it by means of the actuator pulleys  as shown in . The plunger plate  thereby pulls on the pulley lines  connected to the collar  through its projections  so as to slidably displace the collar  to the release position shown in , releasing the prong tangs  to enable the prongs  to be pivotally displaced to the positions shown in , allowing the tow line  to slide off the prongs  for release of the grapple anchor device  therefrom. The unmanned vehicle  may then be transferred to the retrieval ship  by the crane .","According to other towing operations the small unmanned vehicle boat  and the grapple anchor device  suspended therefrom by the anchor line  sit motionless in the seawater , while the retrieval ship  sweeps by to snag the grapple anchor device  onto the tow line  to begin pulling the paravane . When the tow line  is thereafter reeled into the retrieval ship , the tow line  slides through the anchor prongs  until the paravane  engages the grapple anchor device . Continued reel in of the tow line  then causes both the anchor device  and the paravane  to approach the ship  dragging the unmanned vehicle  closer to the ship  for retrieval.","In view of the features of the grapple anchor device  as hereinbefore described, the unmanned vehicle  may be towed without manual control or maneuver and without stopping of the ship  for retrieval purposes. Also withdrawal of the tow line  from the self-releasing grapple anchor device  is effected at the desired time without manual intervention.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3","1","5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIGS. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["7","8","6","6","7","7","8","8"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
