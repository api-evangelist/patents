amide-substituted benzimidazole and aza-benzimidazole compounds which have platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist activity, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and methods of treating PAF-mediated disorders, including inflammatory, cardiovascular and immune disorders.","Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine) is a potent inflammatory phospholipid mediator that binds to and activates platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR). PAF is produced and released by monocytes, macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), eosinophils, neutrophils, natural killer lymphocytes, platelets and endothelial cells, as well as by renal and cardiac tissues under appropriate immunological and non-immunological stimulation. PAF is similar to other lipid mediators such as thromboxane A, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes with respect to the level of potency (active at 10to 10M), tissue amount (picomoles) and short plasma half life (2-4 minutes). PAF is physiologically active and causes contraction of the airway smooth muscle, increased vascular permeability, platelet aggregation, and hypotension. Reviewed in: Prescott, S. M. et al. 2000, 69, 419-445; Honda et al. 2002, 131, 773-779; Stafforini et al. 2003, 40, 643-672.","PAF has been reported to participate in several aspects of the inflammatory response associated with the pathogenesis of atheroscloerosis, however, the precise role of PAF\/PAFR has not been defined. PAF activates the adhesive interaction of leukocytes with the vascular endothelium and the transmigration of leukocytes, promotes the release of reactive oxygen species and tissue-damaging enzymes from leukocytes and endothelial cells, induces the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines from monocytes, and causes the aggregation and degranulation of platelets. In addition, PAF receptor has been shown to recognize both PAF and PAF-like oxidized phospholipids on LDL and may promote an inflammatory response to them (Frostegard, J. et al., 1997, 17, 963-968; Leitinger, N. 2003, 14, 421-430). A PAFR antagonist was reported to reduce atherosclerotic lesion area by 62% in Ldlr\u2212\/\u2212 mice fed an atherogenic diet (Subbanagounder, G. et al., 1999, 85, 311-318). PAF may also promote smooth muscle cell proliferation, angiogenesis and elastase release. These activities have the potential to contribute to lesion formation or to the generation of occlusive thrombi at the site of plaque rupture (Reviewed in: Demopoulos, C. A. et al., 2003, 105, 705-716; Zimmerman, G. A. et al. 2002, 30, S294-S301).","PAF has also been implicated in both peripheral and neuropathic pain responses. PAF can induce hyperalgesia when injected subcutaneously into a rat paw (Bonnet, J. et al., 1981, 100, 111; Vargaftig, B. B.; Ferreira, S. H. 1981, 14, 187) and PAFR antagonists were reported to decrease the inflammatory nociceptive response in rats (Mather, L. A. 2002, 163, 430-433). PAF may also mediate neuropathic pain responses. Intrathecal administration of PAF in mice caused the development of tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia (Morita, K. et al., 2004, 111, 351-359). PAF is expressed in the spinal cord and DRG neurons. A PAFR agonist evoked an intracellular Ca flux in capsaicin-sensitive DRG but not in Pafr mice, and it has been proposed that PAF may function in both persistent pain and the sensitization of primary sensory neurons after tissue injury (Tsuda, M. et al., 2007, 102, 1658-1668).","PAF also appears to play a role in pathological allergic, hypersecretory and additional inflammatory responses. Many published studies suggest the involvement of PAF in autoimmune and inflammatory human diseases, including anaphylaxis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute inflammation, asthma, endotoxic shock, ischemia, gastrointestinal ulceration, transplanted organ rejection, reperfusion injury, inflammatory bowel diseases, edema, rhinitis, thrombosis, bronchitis, urticaria, psoriasis, retinal and corneal diseases, chemically induced liver cirrhosis, and ovimplantation in pregnancy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Therefore, one object of the instant invention is to provide a method for treating pain, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to a patient in need of such treatment. Another object is to provide methods for preventing or reducing the risk of developing inflammatory and nociceptive pain, comprising administering a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to a patient who is at risk of developing inflammatory or nociceptive pain.","Compounds and\/or pharmaceutical compositions which act as PAF receptor antagonists appear to play a role in pathological allergic, hypersecretory and inflammatory responses. Many published studies suggest the involvement of PAF in autoimmune and inflammatory human diseases, including anaphylaxis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute inflammation, asthma, endotoxic shock, ischemia, gastrointestinal ulceration, transplanted organ rejection, reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, inflammatory bowel diseases, pain, edema, rhinitis, thrombosis, bronchitis, urticaria, psoriasis, retinal and corneal diseases, chemically induced liver cirrhosis, and ovimplantation in pregnancy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of said disease or medical condition.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment atherosclerosis or pain, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention of an atherosclerotic disease event or inflammatory or neuropathic pain.","In general, PAFR antagonists can be identified as those compounds which have an ICin the \u201cPAF Binding Assay\u201d that is less than or equal to about 1 \u03bcM, and preferably 200 nM or less, and most preferably 40 nM or less.","An effective amount of a PAFR antagonist in the method of this invention is in the range of about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg of body weight per day, preferably 0.1 mg to about 30 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. A single daily dose is preferred but not necessary. For an average body weight of 70 kg, the dosage level is therefore from about 7 mg to about 2000 mg of drug dosed one to four times per day, e.g. 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 175 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, 1500 mg, or 2000 mg per dose, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to four times a day, or in sustained release form. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the patient's condition. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the PAFR antagonist will administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient, including a course of therapy lasting months, years or the life of the patient.","A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for treating or preventing any of the medical conditions described herein, in dosage amounts described herein. For example, a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerotic disease, halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease once it has become clinically manifest, and\/or preventing or reducing the risk of a first or subsequent occurrence of an atherosclerotic disease event.
