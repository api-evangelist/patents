For example, in one embodiment, the user may operate a smart phone (e.g., an Apple iPhone, etc.) to initiate the remote deposit, wherein the smart phone may automatically download and instantiate a remote deposit software component, which controls the smart phone to capture via its built-in camera, process and send the image of the check. For another example, the user may perform remote deposit by downloading and instantiating the remote deposit software component on their home computer connected to a standard home-use or office-use scanner\/photocopier\/fax machine. In one embodiment, the user's bank may receive and process the image of the check to obtain deposit information (e.g., via optical character recognition, etc.), and complete the requested deposit based on the deposit information.","The various embodiments described herein may be electronically performed by different entities such as, but not limited to a bank server, a user device, a third party agent, and\/or the like. Those embodiments may also be performed by other entities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","133","102","165","103","103","101","133","102","101","133","133"],"i":["a","b ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a "]},"In another embodiment, the user may use a mobile device equipped with a camera to capture a copy of the check, such as a: cellphone, PDA, smartphone, tablet, etc. Once a copy of the check is captured, the user's client  sends a check deposit message , to the user's, i.e., the payee's, bank ; the check deposit image may include an image of the check and accompanying client account information (e.g., account number, deposit amount, etc.). The bank's server(s) may then evaluate the check deposit message and deposit the check  (e.g., via the desktop client and the web, via an application component on the mobile device , etc.).","For example, in one embodiment, a user (e.g., the payee) who wants to deposit a check, may capture an image of the check by a user image capture device, e.g., a scanner connected to a computer, a mobile device having a built-in camera, a digital camera, and\/or the like. In another implementation, the user may take a video clip of the check and submit the video file. In one embodiment, the user may send the captured check image to a financial institution, e.g., a payee's bank with RDC service.","The RDC platform receiving the check image may then process the check image and extract deposit data from the digital check image. For example, in one implementation, the RDC may perform a series of image analysis procedures to enhance the received check image and extract deposit information such as payee's name, payee's bank, account number, bank routing number, deposit amount, and\/or the like. In one implementation, after initial verification of the extracted deposit data, the RDC may post the deposit through direct banking and save the check image and the associated check deposit information in a transaction depository. In one implementation, the RDC may generate a substitute check (e.g., an X9.37 cash letter file) based on the received check image and send it to a clearinghouse bank (e.g., a regional branch of the Federal Reserve) for check clearance. In one implementation, the RDC may confirm, or cancel the soft posting of deposit funds based on the result of check clearance.","In another example implementation, a user may deposit cash or a check at a third party agent which is located remotely from a bank. For example, the third party agent may include, but is not limited to a point of sale at a store participating in the RDC service, a RDC terminal located at a gas station, and\/or the like. In another implementation, the third party agent may be an express mailing service representative carrying a portable check\/cash reading device to provide RDC service, e.g., UPS\u00ae, Fedex\u00ae, etc. In one implementation, the user may walk in a RDC participating store and present a check or cash for deposit. The third party agent may process the remote deposit request by generating and sending an image of the check to a remote deposit server, or by calculating and verifying the presented cash for deposit.","It is to be understood that, depending on the particular needs and\/or characteristics of a RDC application, associated IDE, associated operating system, user interface, object, administrator, server, hardware configuration, network framework, and\/or the like, various embodiments of the RDC may be implemented that enable a great deal of flexibility and customization. The instant disclosure discusses embodiments of the RDC primarily within the context of remote deposit of \u201cchecks\u201d from a payee to a bank hereinafter. However, it is to be understood that the system described herein may be readily adopted for deposits of other types of negotiable instruments, such as a money order, a bank note, and\/or the like, and configured\/customized for a wide range of other applications or implementations. It is to be understood that the RDC may be further adapted to other implementations or communications and\/or data transmission applications, such as but not limited to a general entity-to-entity payment system.","For example, in some embodiments, the RDC may allow a payee to apply the deposit, or a portion thereof, to the payment of one or more bills, such as a credit card payment, insurance bill payment, car payment, etc.","For another example, in some embodiments, the RDC may allow users to apply the deposit (or portion thereof) to a non-US Dollar denominated account. For example, in one implementation, a user may wish to apply a deposit of a $100 (USD) check into a Euro-denominated account. In one implementation, if the user selects an \u201cUSD to Euro\u201d deposit option, the RDC may determine and notify the user of the exchange rate that will be used for the transaction (i.e., how much, in Euros, will be deposited into the user's account). In some embodiments, the RDC may prompt the user to approve the conversion, while in other embodiments, the conversion and deposit will occur automatically.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2B"},"Within implementations, upon receiving a user request to deposit, MultiCrop may prompt a user to provide user credentials to instantiate a remote deposit, e.g., a user account name, password, and\/or the like. Upon user login, the MultiCrop may provide instructions via a user interface for the user to deposit one or more checks. For example,  shows an example screen shot illustrating a user interface of the MultiCrop. As shown in , the MultiCrop may provide instructions A- to request the user to endorse the back of the check(s) to be deposited, place the checks on the scanner to scan one side of the check, select the scanner, and click the button for the number of checks placed on the scanner, etc.","In one implementation, as shown in , the MultiCrop may request the user to select an image capture device A-, e.g., a scanner connected to the personal computer, a camera, etc. For example, the MultiCrop application may be downloaded and installed on the user's personal computer, which may detect and control any image capture device connected to the computer via a TWAIN driver, and\/or the like. Alternative implementations of interfacing and controlling the image capture device are discussed in .","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may receive an indication of a number of checks to be deposited from the user A-. For example, as shown in , after providing user credentials to log into the MultiCrop application, a user may view icons illustrating deposit a single check, or multiple checks, and may click on the icon (e.g., to deposit three checks) to select A-.","In one implementation, if the user selects a single check to be deposited, the MultiCrop may proceed to process the crop the check image starting at A-. In another implementation, if the user selects to deposit more than one check (e.g., three checks, etc.) A-, the MultiCrop may provide instructions via a user interface for the user to deposit multiple checks at one time. For example, as shown in , the MultiCrop may instruct the user via an illustrative icon A- to request the user to evenly align multiple checks on a scanner bed.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may receive an image comprising multiple images of front sides of a plurality of checks to be deposited A-. The MultiCrop may then process the received image to extract separate check images. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may divide the received image into a number of subimages A-. For example, if the MultiCrop has received an indication that three checks are to be deposited, the MultiCrop may evenly divide the image received at  into three sub-images, wherein each sub-image contains one check image. For another example, the MultiCrop may convert the received image into a grayscale image and obtain an estimate of locations of the check images based on grayscale value analysis of the image of received at A-, as further illustrated in . For another example, the MultiCrop may convert the receive image into a bitonal virtual image with a light foreground representing the check portion and a dark background, and scan the virtual image from top to bottom to locate the light foreground so as to divide the virtual image, as further illustrated in .","In one implementation, for each sub-image, the MultiCrop may detect edges of the check A-. For example, the check edge detection at A- may be performed in one implementation as illustrated in . If the edge detection is successful A-, the MultiCrop may crop each sub-image and generate a front side check image for each check to be deposited A-. In another implementation, if the edge detection is not successful for one or more of the sub-images\u2014for example, the corner detection fails to generate a reflection-tolerable result, etc., as illustrated in FIG. H\u2014the MultiCrop may request the user the rescan the checks A-.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may provide a view of aligned cropped check images, as illustrated at B- in . In one implementation, a user may request rescanning of the checks, if the displayed cropped check images are skewed, mis-cropped, incomplete, etc. If such user disapproval A- is indicated, the MultiCrop may prompt the user to manually crop the images A-. For example, in one implementation, the MultiCrop may present the original received image comprising a plurality of check images to the user via an interactive user interface, and request the user select a boundary of each check image. The user may click on the corners of each check image, in a similar manner as illustrated in , and the MultiCrop may generate a rectangular box for check cropping based on the user indicated check corner points. For example, the user may click on a lower left corner and an upper right corner of a check image, and the MultiCrop may project a rectangular shape out of the indicated corners. For another example, the user may create a rectangular box to bound the check image on the scanner image via a user interface, e.g., the user may click and drag the mouse pointer across the top of the check image until the resulted rectangular area on the image has covered the entire check image portion. In another implementation, the user may elect to rescan the checks upon disapproval of the check images.","In one implementation, if the front sides of the checks are successfully scanned and processed, the MultiCrop may upload the front images upon user confirmation. For example, the user may click \u201csubmit,\u201d and the MultiCrop may then transfer the image data to a remote server, as illustrated at C- in . The MultiCrop may proceed to request the user scan the back sides of the checks A-, and process\/crop back sides of the checks in a similar manner as applied to front sides of the checks.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may provide a view including the cropped front sides and back sides of the check images, as the illustrated list of front side images D-, and the list of back side images D- in . The MultiCrop may then receive a user indication of deposit accounts B-. For example, the user may select a deposit account from a list of accounts associated with the MultiCrop remote deposit account, as shown at E- in .","In one implementation, for each check to be deposit, the user may enter a deposit amount B-, e.g., as shown at  in . The MultiCrop may associate check deposit metadata with each check image B-. For example, the metadata may comprise a deposit account, a deposit amount, a user name, a time stamp of the deposit submission, and\/or the like. The MultiCrop may generate a check deposit file including the check images and metadata B-, and submit the generated check deposit file to a remote deposit server B-. For example, in one implementation, the deposit file may comprise a Check 21 compliant check deposit data structure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 2C and 2D","FIG. 3A"],"b":["2","00","2","03","1240","2","05","2","06"]},"In one implementation, the image capture device may be controlled by the \u201cDeposit@Home\u201d component to read the physical checks C-, e.g., on the scanner bed. If the scanning is successful, the image device may capture an image of front sides of a set of aligned checks C-, e.g., on the scanner bed. If the image capturing is not successful, e.g., when the physical check is placed outside of a scanning range on the scanner bed, etc., the MultiCrop may display an error message C- to the user.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may detect check images on the captured image. If check images are successfully found, the MultiCrop may crop the images C-. Otherwise, the MultiCrop may display a message to the user to fix C-. For example, a user may elect to manually crop the check images , and review the cropped image C-. Upon reviewing, if the user desires to modify the cropped image, he may re-crop the images.","For example, as shown in one implementation in , a user may click the four corners F- of a check on the received scanned image via an interactive user interface to facilitate check image cropping. In one implementation, if the check image is not horizontally placed, the user may click on \u201cRotate\u201d F- to horizontalize the check image. For example, the MultiCrop may project the user selected four corners F- to a rectangular shape and rotate the check image to be horizontally placed.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may determine whether the user cropped images matches the number of checks. For example, the user may select to submit three checks at one time but only cropped two checks out of the scanned image. For another example, the MultiCrop may perform a searching procedure to detect check images on the obtained scanned image, as further illustrated in . The MultiCrop detected number of checks may not match with the user indicated number of checks. If not, the MultiCrop may display messages for the user to fix C-. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may determine whether there is error in the cropping, e.g., the MultiCrop fails to detect the number of check on the received image, etc., and may request user to manually crop the images upon user review.","In one implementation, if the scan is not complete, the user may scan back sides of the checks C- in a similar manner as discussed at C-. If the scan is complete, the user may be requested to enter deposit amounts C- for each cropped check, as illustrated at  in . The user may then click a \u201cvalidate\u201d button C- for the MultiCrop to validate the cropped check images.","As shown in one implementation in , the MultiCrop may validate the received cropped check images by performing an OCR procedure D- to examine whether the MICR\/CAR fields are readable D-. If the information can be successfully read via OCR, the MultiCrop may consider the check image to be valid. Otherwise, the MultiCrop may display error for the check D-.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may proceed to inspect every check image if there are more checks to validate D-. If any validation errors are detected D-, e.g., program call errors, invalid image format, etc., the MultiCrop may display an error message, e.g., D-. Otherwise, the MultiCrop may store the validated check images into a check image database D-. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may conduct the check validation (including MICR\/CAR validation) at a client computer via the remote deposit component, e.g., an installed \u201cDeposit@Home\u201d application. In a further implementation, the MultiCrop may inspect check images at a remote deposit server after the user has uploaded the image, and assess whether the check image is qualified for remote deposit, as further discussed in .","Upon validating each check image, the user may click submit D- and submit the check images to a remote server to process soft-posting of the deposit amounts D-.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 2E","b":["2","65","2","66","2","68"]},"In one implementation, the MultiCrop may generate an estimate of check image locations based on the number of checks and the grayscale distribution E-. For example, the received check image may be obtained by placing the checks on a scanning bed with a color contrasted to the color of the check (e.g., a dark background color). For another example, the MultiCrop may instruct the user to capture an image of the aligned checks within a dark background. In one implementation, the grayscale value of the check portions on the image may be \u201chigher\u201d (e.g., on a 0-255 grayscale value scale) as contrasted to the darker background portion. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may divide the received image E- with cutting lines across portions with \u201clower\u201d grayscale values, which are deemed to be the background portions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 2F","b":["200","2","55","2","58"]},"In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may generate a virtual image of the scaled original color image and enhance the edges of the check image F-, e.g., as shown in . In one implementation, the black and white virtual image may be generated and enhanced in a similar manner as illustrated in one embodiment in . For example, the MultiCrop may apply a media filter to remove dust and noise on the scanned image, and apply Gaussian blur to further remove any inconspicuous noise. For another example, the MultiCrop may dilate the dark pixels on the check image by a dilation matrix to convert the check to a dark blob. The MultiCrop may then invert the dilated image, and dynamically convert the image to bitonal via a histogram and threshold analysis, as discussed in one implementation in . For another example, the MultiCrop may apply a median matrix to remove blurred areas, lines on the check image, e.g., extra noise, dust, etc, and obtained an enhanced image with check images on a dark background. In one implementation, the aforementioned image transformation filters, such as the median filter, Gaussian Blur filter, and other image filter matrices mentioned throughout, may be applied via a Java image processing library, such as, but not limited to JAI, ImageJ, and\/or the like.","In one implementation, an example implementation of a 9\u00d79 Gaussian blur matrix may take a form similar to the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"float data [ ] = {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u20030, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0,",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u20031, 2, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1,",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u20031, 3, 6, 9, 11, 9, 6, 3, 1,",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u20031, 3, 7, 11, 12, 11, 7, 3, 1,",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u20031, 3, 6, 9, 11, 9, 6, 3, 1,",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u20031, 2, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1,",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u20030, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0,",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u20030, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0};",{}]},{"entry":[{},"KernelJAI kernel = new KernelJAI (new Kernel (9, 9, data) );",{}]},{"entry":[{},"PlamarImage temp = JAI.create (\u201cconvolve\u201d, img, kernel);"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In one implementation, the MultiCrop may detect a number of checks on the scan bed image by searching horizontally down the enhanced image F-, e.g., as shown in . For example, in one implementation, the MultiCrop may generate a histogram of the enhanced bitonal image to find the median value of the virtual image. The MultiCrop may use a half of median value as the threshold for determining if a row of pixels contains portions of the check or not.","For example, in one implementation, the MultiCrop may divide the virtual bitonal image into tiles (e.g., each tile has a width of 6 pixels, or 3% of the total height of the virtual image, etc.). The MultiCrop may start at the top of the image top tile through and average all of the pixel values ranging from 1-256 within the tile. If the average pixel value within a tile is greater than a threshold (e.g., 150, etc.) then the current tile is considered part of the check, e.g., a tile of \u201clight\u201d color. Otherwise, the tile is considered to be part of the background. Then the MultiCrop may start at that row and proceed to look for where the average number of pixels is below the threshold, which is considered as the bottom of the check.","When the MultiCrop scans from top tile to the bottom, if the virtual image contains multiple check images, as shown at F- in , the MultiCrop may record a tile as \u201ctop edge of the first check,\u201d \u201cbottom edges of the first check,\u201d \u201ctop edge of the second check,\u201d \u201cbottom edge of the second check,\u201d and\/or the like. The gap between the \u201cbottom edge of the first check\u201d and the \u201ctop edge of the second check\u201d may be used to cut swim lanes to separate the checks. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may then cut swim lanes on the original scan bed images F- based on the detected check edges at F-. Once the check images are cut they are set to an image array and returned back to the calling function.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may examine whether the number of detected number of checks matches with the user entered number of checks. For example, the user may click to select scanning three checks at a time, e.g., at  of , but the MultiCrop may detect edges for two check images on the virtual image at F-. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may display an error message to the user F-, and request the user either re-scan the physical checks, or re-enter\/confirm the number of checks to be deposited.","In alternative implementation, the MultiCrop may estimate the size of the detected check image and divide it evenly based on heuristics F-. For example, if the user has indicated three checks are aligned and scanned, but the MultiCrop only detects two checks on the virtual image at F-, it is possible that two checks were aligned without sufficient space, or overlapped, such that the two checks may be considered to be \u201cone check\u201d at F-. The MultiCrop may evaluate the heights of the detected checks. For example, if the height of one detected check is almost two times the height of a second detected check, the first detected check may comprise two checks consecutively aligned. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may divide the first detected check image in the middle.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may present the cut images to a user to confirm whether the cutting based on heuristics is accurate F-. Should the user approve the cutting based on check size heuristics, the MultiCrop may proceed to F-.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may keep track of the top and bottom locations of the cut images F-, wherein the top and bottom locations are used to further crop the number of checks that get returned from the Swim Lane Crop F-, e.g., as shown in . For example, using a similar histogram and threshold procedure as in F-, the MultiCrop may start at the middle of the image and look up to find the top edge of the image, and\/or look down to find the bottom edge. The image is then rotated by 90 degrees and the same edge functions are used to determine the top and bottom edges. The image is then rotated back and the cropped images are stored in an image array. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may determine the orientation of the check image to make sure it is horizontally displayed. Upon locating the top and bottom locations of check edges, the MultiCrop may project the locations to generate a rectangular cropping box on the original unscaled image at F-, and crop the original unscaled image accordingly, e.g., on the original 200 dpi scan bed image. Further implementations of check cropping are discussed in .","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may validate that the images produced are Check 21 compliant F-. The validation may determine whether the auto-cropping procedure was performed successfully. If a failure is encountered, then the user may be prompted to fix their images via a manual cropping function, e.g., at C- of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIGS. 3A-3F","FIG. 1"],"b":"165"},"In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may prepare the obtained check image into a bitonal virtual image for edge detection, which comprises a white portion without details indicating the \u201ccheck portion,\u201d and a black background, as illustrated at B- in . The MultiCrop may then perform edge detection on the virtual image and project the locations of detected edges for cropping the original check image.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may obtain a check image, which may be an original color image captured by the image capture device, e.g., a  dpi scan bed image at a size of 2.5 megabytes. To facilitate faster processing, the MultiCrop may be down sampled to reduce the image size, e.g., a quarter of the original size A-. The MultiCrop may then convert the scaled color image to a grayscale image, e.g., via the Java Advanced Image (JAI) v.3.0, etc.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may apply filters to smooth out the grayscale image to generate a black and white image A-, which may comprises a white area indicating the check portion in contrast to a black background. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may apply a median filter to remove dust and noise on the check image, e.g., by averaging out the pixel values of adjacent pixels. In another implementation, the MultiCrop may apply a Gaussian Blur filter to further remove any inconspicuous noise on the image. For example, if there is a dark spot (e.g., an inadvertent ink spot, etc.) on the front side of the check, the Gaussian Blur filter may facilitate to smooth out the image and blur the dark spot. In one implementation, the media filter, Gaussian Blur filter may be applied via a Java image processing library, such as, but not limited to JAI, ImageJ, and\/or the like.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may dilate dark pixels A- of the check image by applying a dilation filter (e.g., via JAI packages), which may convert the check portions on the image to a dark blob. The dilated image may then be inverted so that the check portion would be a light blob on a relatively darker background.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may convert the dilated image from A- to a bitonal image A-. For example, in one implementation, the MultiCrop may generate a histogram of the dilated images, and calculate an average pixel value as a threshold for bitonal conversion. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may dynamically convert the check images, e.g., by calculating and setting a bitonal threshold per every image. In another implementation, the MultiCrop may adopt a heuristic threshold value to save processing time.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may re-apply a media filter (e.g., a 11 by 11 media matrix with a plus mask generated by a JAI package, etc.) to further smooth the bitonal image A-. Then the MultiCrop may obtain a virtual image with a light foreground as the check portion, and a dark background as the non-check portion, as shown at B- at , as the counterpart of the original check image.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may divide the virtual image into columns and rows A- for edge detection. For example, in one implementation, the width of each column\/row may be 6 pixels, or 3% of the total width\/height of the check image, and\/or the like. In one implementation, if the MultiCrop receives an indication that the bitonal image may comprise more than one checks, e.g., the user indicated more than one checks are to be deposited during the image capturing, the MultiCrop may scan the bitonal check image from top row to the bottom row to locate the plurality of the checks, as discussed in . For bitonal images that comprise a single check image, or the already separated swim lane images at F- of , the MultiCrop may start row\/column searching from a middle point. For example, the middle point may be estimated as the center of the rectangular bitonal image, as shown at B- in .","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may start from the middle point and scan upward or downward to evaluate every row as shown at B- in . For each row A-, the MultiCrop may calculate an average pixel value of the current row A-, and compare the average value to a threshold value A-. For example, the threshold value may be the overall average pixel value of the bitonal image, e.g., 150. If the average pixel value is greater than the threshold value, which indicates the current row still traverses a light portion, e.g., the check portion, the MultiCrop may proceed to the next row. If the average pixel value is lower than the threshold value, which indicates the current row may be the boundary of the light foreground portion and the dark background portion, the MultiCrop may record the current row as the top or bottom edge A-. Thus the MultiCrop may start from the middle of the foreground check portion, and scan upward until it hits the top edge row, as shown at B- in , or scan downward until it hits the bottom edge row, as shown at B- in .","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may start from the middle point to scan outwards for each column A-in a similar manner. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may calculate an average pixel value of the current column A-, and compare the average value to a threshold value A-. If the average pixel value is greater than the threshold value, which indicates the current column still traverses a light portion, e.g., the check portion, the MultiCrop may proceed to the next column. If the average pixel value is lower than the threshold value, which indicates the current column may be the boundary of the light foreground portion and the dark background portion, the MultiCrop may record the current column as the left or right edge A-. Thus the MultiCrop may start from the middle of the foreground check portion, and scan to the left until it hits the left edge row B-, as shown at B- in , or scan to the right until it hits the right edge row, as shown at B- in .","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may obtain four corners of the light foreground portion by calculating intersections of the top edge, bottom edge, left edge, and the right edge.

In one implementation, the MultiCrop may convert the remaining image into an enhanced virtual image C-, divide it into rows and columns C-. Then the MultiCrop may designate the left column as the left edge C-, as shown at D- in , and scan from left to right until it hits the right edge C-, as shown at D- in . In one implementation, the MultiCrop may in turn scan rows from a middle point to detect top\/bottom edges C-.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may project the detected edge locations to the original image after the initial heuristics cut (e.g., at C-, or C-) to crop the check image C-. It should be noted that the heuristic cut of the original check image may be any of a portion of the top, bottom, left, right portions of the original received check image, or a combination of one or two cuts at different portions.","Additional embodiments of check edge detection and cropping are further illustrated in . For example, in , the MultiCrop may start scanning a virtual image from inside a light foreground outwardly, and from outside a light foreground inwardly, and compare the detected edge points.","In a further embodiment, the MultiCrop may select a check image cropping method based on the quality of the check image. For example, for a check image with good contrast, the ImageInspect may adopt a fast cropping procedure, as discussed in . Otherwise, the MultiCrop may adopt other cropping procedures based on other image quality assessment factors, as further illustrated in  .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["5","65"]},"In one implementation, the MultiCrop may generate one or more image quality scores A- to indicate the reliability of the received image. For example, if the received image is blurred, vague, disoriented, of low resolution, and\/or the like, the image may not be reliable for deposit processing. In one implementation, the image quality score may be a general numeric score based on a plurality of sub-scores, e.g., a weighted sum of sub-scores. In another implementation, the MultiCrop may determine whether the image is acceptable based on a hierarchical algorithm which generates image scores at different stages of the algorithm. For example, in one implementation, upon receiving an image, the MultiCrop may perform a first order inspection of the image, e.g., to determine an image contrast score, or a source of the image, etc. If the first order inspector determines the received image is unacceptable, e.g., the image contrast score is lower than a minimum threshold, the image may be rejected without further inspection. Such hierarchical algorithm may be further discussed in FIG. C.","In one implementation, if the MultiCrop determines the image quality score is unacceptable A-, the MultiCrop may reject the image by sending an image denial notice A- to the user. For example, the user may receive a message via a user interface displaying \u201cSorry! The check image can not be processed. Please re-scan.\u201d The user may then elect to re-capture an image to restart the remote deposit, or exit the process.","In another implementation, if the MultiCrop determines the image quality score is acceptable at A-, e.g., a general image quality score is higher than a threshold, or the hierarchical image analysis determines the image satisfies all requirements, etc., the MultiCrop may proceed to process the image to extract deposit information.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may discern different edge detection and check image cropping procedure based on the image quality score A-, wherein the score adopted may be a general image quality score, or one or more sub-scores. For example, in one implementation, the MultiCrop may determine edge detection procedures based on an image contrast score. The MultiCrop may generate an image contrast score at A- indicative of the contrast level of the received image, wherein the image contrast score may be the contrast ratio of the image, e.g., the minimum pixel value divided by the maximum pixel value, wherein the greater the ratio is, the less contrast the image has. If contrast score indicates good contrast A- (e.g., contrast ratio<0.03), the MultiCrop may proceed with a bottom mask edge detection procedure and smart cropping A-, as illustrated in ; if the contrast score is within a medium range (e.g., 0.03<contrast ratio<0.15), the MultiCrop may proceed with a four-sided edge detection and cropping A-, as further illustrated in . In another implementation, if the contrast score is below a minimum threshold (e.g., contrast ratio>0.15), the image may be rejected at A-. In other implementations, the MultiCrop may adopt different contrast level thresholds, e.g., a good contrast range for contrast ratio<0.02, a medium range for contrast ratio between 0.02 and 0.2, and unacceptable if the contrast ratio>0.2, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["5","81"]},"In another implementation, the MultiCrop may perform OCR on the image to calculate a MICR OCR score B- and\/or a CAR OCR score B-. For example, the OCR may be implemented via a Java OCR API library, e.g., Asprise OCR SKD v4.0, JavaOCR, and\/or the like.","For example, the MICR OCR score B- may be generated by counting a number of legible characters in the MICR line and calculating a percentage of the legible characters out of the total number of characters in the MICR line. For another example, the CAR OCR score B- may be generated by counting a number of legible digits in the deposit amount area and calculating a percentage of the legible digits out of the total number of digits of deposit amount on the check image. For example, the MICR OCR score may be a percentage value between 0 and 1, and the MultiCrop may request at lest 70% MICR OCR readability.","For anther example, the MICR OCR score and the CAR OCR score may be generated based on a confidence level during the OCR process. For example, as further illustrated in , the MICR OCR readability thresholds may depend on the contrast level. In a further implementation, the MultiCrop may examine whether the CAR obtained through OCR is consistent with the deposit amount received from the metadata.","In another implementation, the MultiCrop may perform endorsement detection B- over the received image, and generate a score indicating whether an endorsement is successfully detected. For example, the endorsement score may be a binary value, \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo,\u201d to indicate whether there is an endorsement. For another example, the MultiCrop may perform a signature recognition procedure over the endorsement, and generate an endorsement score to indicate a confidence level of the endorsement. For example, if lines of the endorsement are blurred or vague, the endorsement score may be low; otherwise, if lines and boundaries of the endorsement characters are clearly discernible, the endorsement score may be high.","In another implementation, the MultiCrop may generate a dimension matching score B-. For example, the MultiCrop may perform edge detection to obtain an estimate of the dimension of the check, and inspect whether it falls into a range of typical financial instrument sizes. For example, most legitimate 200 dpi checks fall within a certain maximum and minimum width and height, e.g., a typical personal check may have a ratio of width versus height as 24:11, and a typical business check may have a width versus height ratio 17:7. For example, the dimension matching score B- may be calculated as a numeric value indicating the ratio between the dimension of the check, and a standard check dimension. If the typical personal check size is 24:11, and the detected check size from the received check image is 23:11, the dimension matching score may be calculated as 24\/11: 23\/11=24\/23. When the score is close to 1, the check dimension may closely match a standard check. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may determine whether the check image's width to height ratio falls between a minimum ratio and a maximum ratio to ascertain whether the check image is in accordance with a standard size check. If the detected check image has a dimension of width versus height ratio 1:1 (e.g., a square shape), the check image may be accorded with a low dimension matching score, or may be rejected.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may generate a histogram score B- of the received image. For example, the MultiCrop may convert the received check image into a grayscale image, and generate a histogram of the grayscale image, e.g., at - of . The MultiCrop may then calculate an average value of the histogram and determine whether the image is \u201cgood\u201d based on heuristics, e.g., the mean of the histogram should be about the same for most good checks; bad checks may either be too light or too dark so the mean value will be out of range to produce a lower score. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may calculate the histogram score as a deviation to the statistical average mean value of histogram of \u201cgood\u201d check images.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may calculate a corner detection noise score B-, e.g., the corner reflection level, as further illustrated in . For example, the MultiCrop may use a corner detection algorithm to count the number of nodal points. A sharp image with little noise may fall within a normal range. If the grayscale (e.g., tiff) image is too noisy or blurry then the corner detection procedure will return a very high or low value which may be used to generate the corner detection noise score.","In another implementation, the MultiCrop may calculate a general OCR score B-, e.g., a percentage of legible characters on the check image of the total number of characters on the check image (e.g., an 80% minimum). In one implementation, heuristic value of the total number of characters on a check may be used. The MultiCrop may OCR the entire front side of the check and see if there are any other words or phrases that get returned. For example, missing characters in fields such as Name, Address, and\/or numbers like check number, may lead to a low general OCR score.","In another implementation, the MultiCrop may calculate darkness\/lightness balance scores B-, Check 21 compliance score B-, and\/or the like.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may calculate a general image quality score based on the sub-scores B--B-. For example, the general image quality score may take a weighted sum of the sub-scores, wherein the weights may be determined by a system operator. In an alternative implementation, the MultiCrop may not need to evaluate every sub-score, but adopt a hierarchical structure to save processing time. For example, different sub-scores may be prioritized, and the MultiCrop may evaluate each sub-score in a sequential order. At any step, if the MultiCrop determines the sub-score calculated at such step indicates the image is unacceptable, the MultiCrop may reject the received image without evaluating the remaining sub-scores.","In one implementation, the hierarchical algorithm structure may comprise layers of image quality scores. For example, the MultiCrop may categorize the sub-scores so that at each layer of evaluation, the MultiCrop may evaluate a category of sub-scores and determine whether the category of sub-scores exceed a minimum quality threshold. For example, the image contrast B-, darkness\/lightness and balance scores B- may be categorized as a first layer for initial quality check; MICR OCR score B-, CAR OCR score B- and the general OCR score B- may be categorized as a layer for OCR check; dimension matching score B-, corner detection noise score B- may be categorized as a layer for edge detection check, and\/or the like.","Within various implementations, scores B--B- discussed in  may be compared with a related minimum image quality threshold to determine whether the received image meets with the minimum requirement. For example, the received image may need to meet a minimum contrast level B- to be performed with OCR to extract deposit information. Such thresholds may be pre-determined by an MultiCrop operator. In an alternative implementation, the image quality thresholds may be dynamically determined and updated based on heuristics of previous image assessment. For example, as further illustrated in , the MultiCrop may determine different thresholds for images obtained via different image capture devices (e.g., scanner, camera, cellular phone, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIGS. 4A-4D"],"b":["5","00","5","02","5","03"]},"In one implementation, an example Java implementation of the MultiCrop that determines whether the image has enough contrast to be able to accurately determine the edges of the check, may take a form similar to the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"int goodContrast = 0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\/\/scores determine if the image has good contrast"},{"entry":"\u2003quadrantScore scores = ImageAnalysis.getQuadScores(img,"},{"entry":"ImageProcessingConstants.minBinCount);"},{"entry":"\u2003scores.print ( );"},{"entry":"\u2003if (scores.getTopLeftQuadrant( ) > .03) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003goodContrast++;"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003if (scores.getTopRightQuadrant( ) > .03) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003goodContrast++;"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003if (scores.getBottomLeftQuadrant( ) > .03) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003goodContrast++;"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003if (scores.getBottomRightQuadrant( ) > .03) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003goodContrast++;"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003if(goodContrast<=1 | | scores.getAverageScore ( ) < .03) {"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/image doesn't have a good dark background"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003System.out.println(\u201cSimple Crop: Image is too white.\u201d);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003img = ImageManipulation.simpleCrop(img, virtimage2);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003return img;"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003if (scores.getAverageScore ( ) < .15)"},{"entry":"\u2003{"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/image doesn't have a good dark background but may be good enough"},{"entry":"to find bottom of image"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003System.out.println (\u201cSimple Crop: Unable to detect corners.\u201d);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003img = ImageManipulation.smartSimpleCrop(img, virtimage2);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003return img;"},{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may perform edge detection check C-.

The thresholds at the next stage, e.g., the MICR OCR thresholds may be determined based on the different contrast levels. For example, if the image has good contrast, the MultiCrop may adopt a 70% MICR OCR pass rate; but if the image has medium range contrast, the MultiCrop may apply stricter MICR OCR pass rate to ensure readability, e.g., an 80% MICR OCR readability threshold, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"figref":"FIG. 5D","b":["5","20","5","22"]},"<Image>","<Name>DSC0000567<\/Name>","<Format>JPEG <\/Format>","<Size>2,635,012 bytes <\/Size>","<TimeStamp>19:33:23 06-03-2000<\/TimeStamp>","<Dimension>",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["<Width>1024<\/Width>","<Height>768<\/Height>\n\n<\/Dimension>\n\n<Source>Canon EOS 500D<\/Source>\n\n<ShootingMode>Aperture AE<\/ShootingMOde>\n\n<ShutterSpeed>1\/500<\/ShutterSpeed>\n\n<ApertureValue>6.3<\/ApertureValue>\n\n<ISOSpeed>200<\/ISOSpeed>\n\n<Lens>EF-S55-250 mmf <\/Lens>\n\n<ImageQuality>Fine <\/ImageQuality>\n\n<Flash>off <\/Flash>\n\n<WhiteBalance>Auto <\/WhiteBalance>\n\n. . .\n\n<\/Image>\n"]}}}},"In an alternative embodiment, if the metadata does not indicate the source type of the image, the MultiCrop may determine the type of the image source D- based on heuristics. For example, a scanned image and an image taken by a cellular phone camera may differ in resolution, size, dimension, contrast, and\/or the like. The MultiCrop may retrieve heuristics of different types of images D-, and compare the properties of the received image with the heuristics. For example, if heuristics indicate the size of a mobile image is generally less than 1 megabyte, then a received image at 3 megabytes in size may not be a mobile image, but a scanner image and\/or a camera photo instead. For another example, if the heuristics may indicate scanner images and mobile images may have different contrast level ranges, as the scanning bed may create a contrast background to the physical check, which may result in better contrast. In that case, the MultiCrop may determine the contrast of the received image, and if it falls in the range of a regular scanner image, the MultiCrop may proceed as if the image is a scanned image. For another example, images taken by a mobile phone may be less blurred than images generated by a video camera and\/or a webcam, as a user who takes images by a mobile phone may place a paper check in a stationary position before capturing the image, but for video and\/or webcam image capturing, the user may manually hold the paper check to the camera, which may incur blurred images due to shaking hands. For another example, images generated from video streaming frames, e.g., video camera, webcams, etc., may be more blurred due to the shake when a depositor hold a paper check up to a video camera.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may determine a hierarchical analysis for the determined image type D-. In one implementation, the hierarchical image assessment as illustrated in  may be designed based on the type of the image. For example, if the image is a scanned image D-, the MultiCrop may determine an image assessment procedure for scanned imaged D-, which may depend on thresholds obtained from heuristics from previously processed scanned images D-.","For another example, if the image is a mobile image D-, the MultiCrop may determine an image assessment procedure for mobile images D-, which may assess disorientations, skewness of the check image, as illustrated in -B, as an image captured by a cellular phone, smart phone and\/or the like may be disoriented, have a trapezoidal shape, and\/or the like.","For another example, if the image is a photo taken by a camera D-, the MultiCrop may determine an image assessment procedure for camera images D-. Similar to mobile images, camera images may be assessed including its disorientations, skewness, and\/or the like.","In another implementation, if the image is taken from a Video camera D-, e.g., a frame grabbed from video streaming, the MultiCrop may determine an image assessment procedure for video grab images D-. For example, an image generated from video streaming may have reduced resolution due to the constrained video streaming quality; and may be blurred due to the motion of the video camera. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may assess a blur level, skewness, resolution, contrast level, and\/or the like of the check image.","In another implementation, if the image is taken from a Webcam D-, the MultiCrop may determine an image assessment procedure for webcam images D-. For example, an image taken by a webcam may be blurred, skewed, and\/or the like, as a user may need to hold a check up to a webcam, which may result in a blurred image due to the user's shaking or unstable positions. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may assess a blur level, skewness, contrast level, and\/or the like of the check image.","In one implementation, if the MultiCrop determines the received image is of a new type, e.g., an image captured by a webcam, wherein heuristic data of past processing may not exist, the MultiCrop may process the new image type D-.

Otherwise, the provisionally credited funds may be deducted from the payee's account A-, and the transaction details may be provided to the user A-.","In an alternative embodiment, the bank may process the ACH debit entry, substitute check, and\/or electronic image. As noted above, the bank may present the ACH debit entry to an ACH service provider (e.g., EPN), which may be responsible for settling the transaction between the payee's bank and the payer's bank. The bank also may convert the digital image into a substitute check and present the substitute check to an intermediary bank (e.g., a regional branch of the Federal Reserve) to complete the check clearing process. In one implementation, the bank may debit the payee's account if the original check is not received and\/or sent within a predetermined period of time.","For example, the bank may require that the payee send the check and have it postmarked within five business days of sending the electronic data representative of the check. If the check is not postmarked within the predetermined period of time, the financial institution may void the provisional credit (e.g., withdraw funds from the account).","In one embodiment, upon completion of the deposit, the MultiCrop may further instruct the user to void the physical check A- to avoid representment. For example, in one embodiment, the MultiCrop may instruct the user to place the physical check to certain equipment such that a stimulus may be applied to the physical check to permanently modify the check as \u201cvoid\u201d. For another example, if the deposit takes place at a kiosk or ATM, the deposit facility may print \u201cELECTRONICALLY PRESENTED\u201d across the front of the original check when the check is scanned by equipment designed to convert the check to an electronic image for further processing. For another example, the physical check may contain a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. When the RFID tag receives a particular radio signal, the RFID tag may be modified as \u201cvoid\u201d. For further examples, if the physical checks contain tags sensitive to heat, the check may be voided by the heat generated by the application of a bright light source, such as one that may be found in a scanner.","In another implementation, the MultiCrop may void the physical check by MICR line destruction. For example, the MultiCrop may punch holes on the MICR line printed on the paper check. In one implementation, the punch mechanism may comprise a roller placed with the image capture device, e.g., inside a scanner, etc., and may be positioned to coincide with the placement to the MICR characters on the check item inserted into the scanner. The roller may comprise a spindle with several sharp protrusions (e.g., conical) on its sides, wherein the height of the spindle may be equal to or around the height of the MICR characters. In one implementation, the remote processing component running on the depositor device, e.g., the depositor's computer, Apple iPhone, and\/or the like, may control the roller to enable or disable it against the paper check inserted in the scanner, e.g., to punch holes on the check. In one implementation, when the roller is enabled by the remote processing component, the roller may rotate around its central axis to progressively punch holes along the MICR line of the paper check fed into the scanner, which may permanently distort or destroy the MICR characters. In a further implementation, the sharp protrusions on the side of the roller may be shaped to form a specific punch character, such as an \u201cX\u201d shape, a \u201c#\u201d shape, and\/or the like. The design of the punch character may adopt standardized E13B fonts and\/or other international MICR fonts so that it will be recognized by a financial institution as a MICR destruction symbol.","For another example, the MultiCrop may utilize a magnetic ink spray to chemically destroy the MICR line, which may be printed using on the paper check in a magnetic ink or toner containing iron oxide. In one implementation, a magnetic ink sprayer may be placed in the scanner used to capture images of the check. For example, the sprayer may be included in a printer cartridge with a rectangular slit, wherein the slit has the length to at least cover the height of the MICR characters. When the sprayer is enabled, the magnetic ink sprays out of the slit which generates a magnetic rectangle of the height of MICR line characters. Thus when the paper check is fed into the scanner, the magnetic sprayer may generate a line of magnetic rectangles to cover the original MICR characters. In a further implementation, similar to the punch characters as previously discussed, the split of the sprayer may be designed to form a specific magnetic character, which may represent a \u2018MICR disabled character\u2019 instead of being a rectangle slit, and standardized E13B fonts and other international MICR fonts may be adopted.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may allow the user to manually start the MICR destruction mechanism. For example, a user may press a button to initiate the roller puncher, or the magnetic sprayer, after confirming a soft post status notification is received to ensure the check deposit has been processed. For another example, the MultiCrop may remotely control the image capture device (e.g., the scanner) via the remote processing component to automatically start the MICR destruction when the check deposit has been processed. In one implementation, once the MICR destruction is launched, instructions programmed and stored with the MICR destruction mechanism (e.g., stored in an EPROM memory of the scanner, etc.) may execute commands including, placing the coordinates of the starting punch or spray, performing the punching or spraying within the pre-programmed time frame, stopping the punching or spraying when the pre-programmed time frame is reached. In a further implementation, the length of the punching or spraying time frame may be programmable, and configurable by a user via the remote processing component.","In an alternative implementation, the MultiCrop may instruct the user to physically destroy the check and submit digital evidence of check detriment. For example, the user may tear the check, capture an image of the torn check pieces, and submit the captured image to the MultiCrop for verification, as shown in .","For another example, if the user operates a video camera, the user may submit live video streaming, and\/or a video file, showing the deposited paper check being destroyed.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may create a record of the deposited check and store the deposited check record in a repository to prevent check re-presentment. For example, in one implementation, the MultiCrop may store an image of the check associated with extracted information, such as payee's name, deposit date, bank name, MICR information including the bank routing number and account number, and\/or the like. In another implementation, the MultiCrop may create a record of the check based on a portion of the check image which may be unique to represent the check. For example, in one implementation, the created check record may only include an image of the front side of a check.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0179","num":"0179"},"figref":"FIGS. 8B-8C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0180"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIG. 8B"],"b":["8","45","8","46","8","47"]},"The payee also may convert the check into electronic data by scanning the check using a Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) device. Checks typically contain MICR information (e.g., routing number, account number and check number) on the bottom left-hand corner of the check. The MICR information usually consists of characters written in a magnetic ink. The MICR information may be read electronically by passing the check through the MICR device, which may translate the characters by magnetizing the ink.","As shown in , at B-, the payee may send the electronic data to a bank that is associated with an account for depositing funds. Any means for transmitting electronic data over a communications network is consistent with an embodiment. For example, if the payee creates a digital image of the check, the image may be sent to the bank by attaching the image to an email. If the electronic data is in the form of MICR information captured by a MICR device, the device may have an output component for transmitting the electronic data to the bank over the communications network. In addition, the electronic data may include information pertaining to the account for depositing funds, such as the account number and\/or the name on the account. The account number may appear on the check itself, below the signature endorsing the check. The account number and\/or name on the account also may appear in an email, either with or without the digital image, for example.","At B-, the payee may void the check. For example, the payee may write and\/or stamp \u201cvoid\u201d on the check. At B-, the payee may send the check to the financial institution associated with the account for depositing funds. The check may be sent via a common carrier, such as the United States Post Office, FedEx\u00ae, United Parcel Service\u00ae, and the like. The process may then proceed to B-. It will appreciated that B- and B- may be performed to provide additional security features. For example, by removing the check from circulation, it may be less likely that the check will be deposited more than once.","At B-, the bank may receive the electronic data representative of the check along with information pertaining to the account for depositing funds. At B-, the bank may credit funds to the account. The credit may be a provisional credit, enabling the payee to access the funds while the check is being cleared. A provisional credit may be voided if the bank determines that the transaction is erroneous and\/or fraudulent.","At B-, the bank may generate an Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) debit entry, substitute check, and\/or electronic image. ACH transactions typically include payment instructions to debit and\/or credit an account. Banks often employ ACH service providers to settle ACH transactions. Examples of ACH service providers include regional branches of the Federal Reserve and the Electronic Payments Network (EPN). In an embodiment, a payee may receive a check in return for the sale of goods, such as a used car, for example. The payee may endorse the check and\/or send electronic data representative of the check to the payee's bank, which may be referred to as the originating depository financial institution (ODFI). As noted above, the electronic data may be generated in any number of ways. For example, the payee may use a MICR device to scan and translate the MICR information (e.g., account number, routing number, check number, etc.) located on the check and transmit the data to the payee's bank along with information pertaining to the account for depositing funds. Upon receipt of the MICR information and account information, the payee's bank may credit funds to the payee's account and generate an ACH debit entry to the payer's account, which may be presented to the ACH service provider for processing.","The ACH service provider may process the debit entry by identifying the account and bank from which the check is drawn. The bank from which the check is drawn (i.e., the payer's bank) may be referred to as a receiving depository financial institution (RDFI). If the payer's bank verifies the transaction, the ACH service provider may settle the transaction by debiting the payer's bank and crediting the payee's bank. The payer's bank may then debit the payer's account.","A substitute check is typically a paper reproduction of an original check and may be the legal equivalent of the original check. Substitute checks were authorized under The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, commonly known as Check 21. The Act was enacted to facilitate the check clearing process by allowing banks to transmit electronic images of checks (e.g., substitute checks) to other banks rather than physically sending the original paper checks. Check 21 does not require that banks use substitute checks. In fact, many banks may have voluntary agreements to accept certain electronic images of checks even though the images may not qualify as substitute checks under Check 21. If a bank does not have a voluntary agreement and\/or refuses to accept an electronic image, the financial institution is required under Check 21 to accept a substitute check in lieu of the original check.","In an embodiment, a payee may receive a check as a birthday gift, for example. The payee may endorse the check and\/or send electronic data representative of the check to the payee's bank. As noted above, the electronic data may be generated in any number of ways. For example, the payee may use a general purpose flatbed scanner and\/or digital camera to create a digital image of the front and back of the check. The payee may then attach the digital images to an email and send the digital image to the payee's bank along with information pertaining to the account for depositing funds. Upon receipt of the digital images and\/or account information, the payee's bank may credit funds to the payee's account. If the payee's bank and the payer's bank have a voluntary agreement for accepting electronic images of checks, the payee's bank may generate an electronic image of the check and\/or simply forward the digital images received from the payee to the payer's bank. If there is no agreement between the banks, the payee's bank may convert the digital images into a substitute check and present the substitute check to the payer's bank and\/or a check clearing service provider (e.g., a regional branch of the Federal Reserve) to clear the check.","Returning to , at B-, the bank may process the ACH debit entry, substitute check, and\/or electronic image. As noted above, the bank may present the ACH debit entry to an ACH service provider (e.g., EPN), which may be responsible for settling the transaction between the payee's bank and the payer's bank. The bank also may convert the digital image into a substitute check and present the substitute check to an intermediary bank (e.g., a regional branch of the Federal Reserve) to complete the check clearing process. At B-, the bank may debit the payee's account if the original check is not received and\/or sent within a predetermined period of time.","For example, the bank may require that the payee send the check and have it postmarked within five business days of sending the electronic data representative of the check. If the check is not postmarked within the predetermined period of time, the financial institution may void the provisional credit (e.g., withdraw funds from the account). At B-, the financial institution may receive the check from the payee.

In addition, the payee may convey the account number of the account where the funds are to be deposited. Any method of conveying the information is consistent with an embodiment. For example, as noted above, the payee may use a phone, email, instant messaging, and\/or fax machine. At C-, the payee may void the check and\/or send the check to the bank. The process may then proceed to C-.","It will be appreciated that C- may be performed to provide additional security features.

It will appreciated that C- and C- may be performed to provide additional security features.","security features may be consistent with an embodiment. For example, the bank may only permit certain payees to remotely deposit checks. By way of example, and not limitation, the bank may accept electronic data representative of a check and\/or accept a request to deposit a check if the payee's account is in good standing. The payee's account may be considered in good standing if the payee has a positive account balance, has a predetermined amount of funds in the account, and\/or is not delinquent on any payments to the bank. The bank also may receive the electronic data and\/or request but credit funds to the account if the account is in good standing as of the time the electronic data and\/or request was received. In addition, the bank may impose additional requirements on a payee remotely depositing a check into an account that is not in good standing. For example, as noted above, the bank may provisionally credit the payee's account upon receipt of the electronic data and\/or request but may require the payee to send the check to the bank. Thus, the account may be debited if the check is not sent and\/or received within a predetermined amount of time.","In some embodiments, the MultiCrop may impose limitations on the deposit amount and\/or the availability of the deposit. For example, the MultiCrop may place a daily, weekly, and\/or other periodic limit for the total amount of remote deposits for a given period. The MultiCrop may additionally or alternatively limit the number of periodic transactions for a given user. Depending on the implementation, such limits may be pre-specified for users (such as a default of limiting users to three remote deposits per day, and limiting total daily deposits to $10,000) and\/or determined based on risks associated with a use and\/or a transaction. For example, a user may have a pre-specified deposit limit of $10,000 per day, but if the user requests and\/or attempts to deposit an amount greater than that (e.g., a check for $15,000), rather than simply rejecting the deposit, the MultiCrop may notify the user that the amount is greater than there specified deposit limit. In some such embodiments, the MultiCrop may allow the user to request that the deposit limit be raised for this transaction, in some embodiments for an associated fee, and the MultiCrop may notify a pre-specified bank or financial institution administrator to approve or reject the request.","In some embodiments, the MultiCrop may include user and\/or transaction information in the notification to assist the administrator in making the decision, such information including the location of the user requesting the deposit, the bank on which the deposited information is drawn, the amount of time the user has been associated with the institution, prior deposit\/banking history, etc. The MultiCrop may additionally or alternatively limit the availability of some or all of the funds of deposit(s) that exceed the pre-specified amount.","Similarly, the MultiCrop may limit the availability of deposited funds according to similar defaults and\/or determinations. For example, if the user is depositing funds from a location (e.g., as determined by GPS metadata associated with a deposit from a mobile device) that is outside the user's normal geographic region (e.g., the user's mailing address and surrounding area), the amount of funds made immediately available may be less than if the user is making the deposit from his or her home. Similarly, the amount of the deposit, the account(s) to which the deposit is applied, user account balance(s), user tenure with the financial institution, and\/or other information may be utilized by the MultiCrop in determining the amount(s) and timeline for availability.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop utilizes a risk matrix, with various weighted risk factors corresponding to risk information, to determine account limitations. In another implementation, the MultiCrop may utilize risk information in a risk calculation, in which each piece of risk information is assigned a value and the amount available is determined based on the total risk value of the collected information. For example, a deposit of over $5000 may have a higher risk value than a smaller deposit amount, and, as such, may have more restrictions on availability of the full amount. Similarly, a deposit by a user that had been with a bank for to years may be determined to have a lower risk value than a user who had just become a member of the bank. In some implementations, the amounts available and\/or the deposit limits may be determined by the MultiCrop utilizing determined risk scores and thresholds such that a user who is determined to have a very low risk value has very few limitations imposed on his or her account, a user that has a determined risk value that exceeds a first threshold but is less than a second threshold may have moderate restrictions associated with his or her account, and a user that has a determined risk value that exceeds the second threshold may have even more restrictions applied to his or her account.

In some implementations, the amounts available and\/or the deposit limits may be determined by the MultiCrop utilizing determined risk scores and thresholds such that a user who is determined to have a very low risk value has very few limitations imposed on his or her account, a user that has a determined risk value that exceeds a first threshold but is less than a second threshold may have moderate restrictions associated with his or her account, and a user that has a determined risk value that exceeds the second threshold may have even more restrictions applied to his or her account. In some embodiments, the MultiCrop may utilize local and\/or national regulations in determining and\/or applying limitations to accounts and\/or deposits.","In one implementation, if the MultiCrop determines the deposit amount has exceeded a maximum one-time remote deposit amount defined by the payee's bank. If yes, the MultiCrop may notify the user via a user interface and provide options for the user to proceed. For example, the user may select to submit q request to raise the deposit limit A-, cancel the remote deposit and exit A-, or to only deposit the maximum available amount for next business day availability and send the deposit information to a closest branch for in-person deposit service A-.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0241","num":"0241"},"figref":"FIG. 10B","b":["101","10","10","81","10","82"]},"In one embodiment, the MultiCrop platform may authenticate the user login, and then retrieve user profile B-. In one implementation, the user profile may record information including the user name, user contact information, user credit history, user account information, and\/or the like. In one implementation, to assist the depositor in determining which accounts may be available for deposit, the MultiCrop may determine a list of available accounts associated with the user for deposit B-. For example, the MultiCrop may retrieve a list of user authorized accounts for remote deposits. For another example, if the MultiCrop is affiliated with a payee's bank, the MultiCrop may only retrieve a list of user accounts associated with the payee's bank.","For another example, the MultiCrop may determine that, based upon the types of the accounts, checking, savings, and investment accounts, may be available for deposit of the negotiable instrument.","In an alternative implementation, if an indication of deposit amount is available at B-, for example, the user has submitted an amount of deposit to MultiCrop, or the account selection B--B- take place after the user has submitted a check image and the MultiCrop has processed the check image to obtain deposit data, the MultiCrop may determine a list of available accounts for deposit based on the requirement of each account. For example, the MultiCrop may filter accounts that have a maximum allowable deposit amount lower than the deposit amount. For another example, to assist the depositor in determining which accounts may be available for deposit, a financial institution may display a list of financial accounts to the depositor. In a further implementation, if the MultiCrop is affiliated with a financial institution, the MultiCrop may generate a list of accounts, wherein the MultiCrop is granted access to the account by the account owner even if the account is at a different financial institution. For example, a user may submit a remote deposit request to the MultiCrop platform at Bank A but Bank A may provide an option for the user to directly deposit the check into his\/her account at Bank B, if Bank A is authorized by the user to access his\/her account at Bank B.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may display a user interface for account selection B-, e.g., a dropdown list, a click-and-choose list, etc., and the user may submit a selection of account B-. The MultiCrop may then determine whether the MultiCrop is granted permission to access the selected account B-. For example, in one implementation, as discussed above, if the MultiCrop is associated with a first payee's bank, but the selected account is associated with a different payee's bank, then the first bank needs to be granted permission by the account owner to access the account at the different bank in order to proceed with check deposit. For another example, if the MultiCrop is a remote deposit service agency, then the MultiCrop may only access an account at a payee's bank only with authorization of the account owner.","In one embodiment, if the permission is granted B-, the MultiCrop may proceed to determine whether the submitted selection of accounts include more than one account B-; and otherwise, the MultiCrop may notify the user that the selected account is unavailable B-. In one embodiment, if there are multiple accounts selected B-, the MultiCrop may display a user interface for amount allocation B- the user and request the user submit amount allocations B- for each selected account. For example, in one implementation, if the user selected to deposit into both a checking account and a savings account, the user may then split the deposit amount and enter the portions of amount associated with each account for deposit processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0247","num":"0247"},"figref":["FIG. 10C","FIG. 10C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0248","num":"0248"},"figref":"FIG. 11A","b":["11","05"]},"In one embodiment, for different devices (e.g., scanners, digital camera, mobile devices, etc.), certain permissions may be used in order to allow the browser component to remotely control the image capture device. For example, in one implementation, a user image device may require certificate authentication to allow secure remote control from the MultiCrop platform. Such certificates may be digital signatures interfacing an image capture device driver, a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted certificate, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, if the image capture device is a scanner, the drivers of the scanner may be different for different operating environments\u2014e.g., the same scanner may use a different driver depending on whether it is being operated from an environment based on one of the WINDOWS operating systems, an environment based on one of the operating systems used in APPLE computers, an environment based on a version of the LINUX operating system, etc. For example, a Canon imageFORMULA DR-7580 Production Scanner requires a DR-7580 ISIS\/Twain Driver version 1.7 for Windows 2000 SP4, XP 32 bit SP3, XP 64 bit SP3, Vista 32 bit SP2, Vista 64 bit SP2, Windows 7 32 bit and Windows 7 64 bit, and Canon LiDE 50 drivers for Mac OS X. In that case, each driver may use different certificates, and different environments may use various different environment-specific technologies to allow the scanner to be controlled from a remote web server. In such cases, the MultiCrop may obtain a large number of certificates, and may interface with a large number of different technologies, to support a large number of scanner-environment combinations and\/or other image capture device environment, in order to allow its software to control scanners for a variety of customers.","As such, in one embodiment, if the user image capture device is remotely controllable by the MultiCrop platform via A-, the MultiCrop may retrieve security certificate for the corresponding image capture device A-, and control the image capture device to obtain the check images. For example, in one implementation, the browser component, which may be a security JavaScript running on the web browser application, may create a device digital certificate to enable HTTPS on the image capture device. In one implementation, the JavaScript may download a certificate from the remote MultiCrop if available to interface with the driver of the image capture device, and create a public key for the certificate to be used in SSL encryption to establish an encrypted channel between the MultiCrop platform and the image capture device.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may instruct a user to place the front\/back sides of the check in front of the image capture device to create images of the check A-. For example, in one implementation, if a scanner connected to a computer is used, the browser component running on a home computer connected to a scanner may control the home scanner to start upon user request and automatically collect the images in an appropriate format and resolution, and can then upload the image for deposit. In such cases, the user may place the physical check in the scanner bed and to click \u201cstart\u201d on the browser interface. In one implementation, the browser component may instruct the user to flip the physical check and repeat the process for both sides of the check via a web page interface, in order to obtain images of the front and the back.","For another example, in one implementation, a mobile device, such as an Apple iPhone may initiate a pre-installed program, or download and install a software package instantly from the MultiCrop platform, which may facilitate the MultiCrop controlling the mobile device (e.g., the iPhone) to obtain and upload check images. In such cases, a user may position the mobile device and take pictures or videos of both sides of the check, as illustrated in . In a further implementation, if the mobile device is an Apple iPhone, the MultiCrop may further instruct the user to configure the system settings of the built-in camera to obtain images in compliance with quality standards, such as grayscale requirement, resolution requirement, image file size requirement, and\/or the like.","For another example, in one implementation, for kiosk\/ATM deposit, a user may be instructed from the screen of a kiosk\/ATM machine to place or insert the check into a check deposit slip for scanning, and\/or the like.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may also instruct the user to enter an amount of the check to be deposited. For example, in one implementation, the user may enter a deposit amount on an MultiCrop website, on a kiosk\/ATM machine, or send an amount number to the MultiCrop platform from a mobile device, and\/or the like.","In an alternative implementation, the MultiCrop may implement an \u201catomic deposit\u201d without requesting the user to input deposit information in addition to the check image submission. In this case, the user device (e.g., the mobile device, the home scanner, etc.) may be decoupled from the transaction once the submission of the digital image file for deposit of the check is made. The transaction is thereafter managed by the MultiCrop platform. In this manner, incomplete transactions are avoided by moving the transaction processing to the MultiCrop platform side at a financial institution (e.g., payee's bank, etc.) after the user submits the digital image file.","Any loss or severing of a communications connection between the user computing device and the MultiCrop platform, such as due to browser navigation away from the MultiCrop web page, communication failures, user logouts, etc. on the user side, will not affect the processing and the deposit of the check in the digital image file. Thus, the transaction will not be left in an orphaned state.","In another embodiment, if the image capture device is not controllable by the browser application component, the MultiCrop may load an instruction user interface page A-, and instruct the user manually upload the check images. For example, in one implementation, the MultiCrop platform may not have certificates for scanner drivers for a Macintosh computer. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may instruct the user to enter a deposit amount A- (as illustrated in a schematic user interface B- shown in ), and to scan front\/back side of the check and save the scanned image files A-. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may instruct the user to save the scanned image files in a specified format (e.g., tiff, JPEG etc.) A-, as illustrated in the schematic user interface B- and B- of . In one implementation, the MultiCrop may instruct the user to edit the check image file prior to uploading A-. For example, in one implementation, as shown in , the MultiCrop may instruct the user to crop the check image via an image editing component, during which the user may submit a selection of check image corner C- via a user interface. In a further implementation, the MultiCrop may instruct the user to convert the obtained check image into a grayscale image prior to uploading the image file. In one implementation, the user may send the obtained check images to MultiCrop platform via email, mobile MMS, MultiCrop browser uploading, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop may receive check digital files  from the remote user device. In one implementation, the user may send the obtained check images to MultiCrop platform via email, mobile MMS, MultiCrop browser uploading, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, if the user image capture device is video-enabled, the MultiCrop may receive video clips of the check. In one implementation, video files may be saved in a series of compliant formats (e.g., AVI, MPEG4, RM, DIVX, etc.) and submitted to the MultiCrop platform in similar manners with those of submitting check image files as discussed above. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may instruct or assist the user to compress one or more video files into a package (e.g., WinZip package, etc.) and submit the pack to the MultiCrop.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0260","num":"0260"},"figref":"FIG. 12A"},"Within various embodiments, Markings or other features may be incorporated into the check sleeve to assist in orienting an image of the check to the proper angle, or in distinguishing portions of the image that represent the check from non-check portions. For example, horizontal and vertical lines may be printed on the check whose position on an image can be detected allow the skew angle of the image to be determined and offset. Also, the background of the sleeve may be printed in a color or opacity that is expected to contrast with the checks that are to be placed in the sleeve, thereby providing contrast that can be used to distinguish check portions of the image from non-check portions. Additionally, one or more barcodes can be printed on the sleeve that can encode information such as the type of sleeve, the account number to which the checks are to be deposited, or a digital signature.","In further embodiments, a sleeve can be constructed that holds a plurality of checks\u2014e.g., two or more checks\u2014thereby allowing plural checks to be deposited at the same time.","As shown in , a check holder may take a form similar to a foldable, self-locking stand A-, which may be made of flexible and bendable material, such as plastic, paper, and\/or the like, and may have mechanisms to hold one or more checks in place in one or more designated spaces. In one embodiment, the check holder A- may have a front side A-on which the check to be scanned or taken a picture of will be placed. To reduce reflection, the front side of the check may provide dark background in contrast to the color of the paper check. The front side may be made of light absorbing materials to reduce reflection. In one implementation, the front side A-may comprise a rectangular area with printed information \u201cplace the check here\u201d A-to instruct the user to place the check. In another implementation, instructions of how to position the check may be included, e.g., the user may be instructed to place the check in a horizontal or vertical position.","In another implementation, the front side of the check holder may comprise printed information with regard to instructions A-of remote deposit, such as instructions as to how to initiate the remote deposit capture application, download an application package from a remote server, place the paper check in the check holder, capture an image of the check holder containing the check and send the captured image to the remote server using the downloaded application package. In another implementation, the frond side of the check holder may comprise an institution trademark logo and promotion information for the MultiCrop.","In a further implementation, to facilitate the remote deposit, the check holder may be customized for an individual depositor. For example, in one implementation, the front side of the check holder may comprise a barcode printed thereon A-, which includes information with regard to the depositor, such as, but not limited to depositor name, depositor account number, depositor bank routing number, and\/or the like. In a further implementation, a user may capture an image of the check placed on the check holder, creating a visualization of the check associated with the barcode so that the MultiCrop may process the received image and obtain depositor information from the barcode. In another implementation, other information may be printed on the front side of the check holder, such as, but not limited to, the depositor's MultiCrop membership name, the payee's bank name, and\/or the like.","For another example, the barcode A-may be a code that enables a given financial institution to recognize its own check holder, and verify that the customer is using a holder provided by that particular financial institution as opposed to a holder provided by a different financial institution. In one implementation, a financial institution may provide various different check holders (e.g., check holders for different sized checks, holders with different types of line markings, holders with different luminescence properties, etc.), and the barcode may be used to assist the processing of the image that results from scanning checks positioned in the sleeve. For example, if one check holder has particular line markings or particular luminescence properties, the barcode may comprise information indicative of those properties so that the image processing techniques can be tuned for use with the particular check holder being used. As another example, each customer of a financial institution can be provide with one or more check holders that are customized for that customer, and the barcode may encode the customer's account number, customer number, or other identifying information. If the barcode encodes the customer's account number or customer number, that information may be used to determine the account to which a check is to be deposited. For another example, the barcode may also encode certain security techniques, such as digital signatures, to deter against counterfeit sleeves and\/or counterfeit barcodes.","Within various implementations, the barcode A-may use a variety of formats. For example, the barcode may be a line format, such as a alphanumeric code, or a two-dimensional code, such as data matrix. As another example, the barcode can be used to orient the angle of an image of the check\u2014e.g., by detecting the skew of the lines or boundaries of the code, and correcting for the detected angle. As another example, the front side of the check holder may comprise more than one rectangular areas to place the check, and there may be multiple barcodes associated therewith, e.g., one barcode next to each area into which a check may be inserted.","In one embodiment, the check holder A- may comprise a small flap extension A-at the bottom of the front side to hold the check be placed within the area A-, and the small flap may hold the check at a slight angle so as to deflect glare-light which may be incurred by a camera lens. In a further implementation, the front side of the check may comprise a transparent layer affixed thereon, so that the check may be inserted between the transparent layer and the front side of the check, wherein the transparent layer may assist to hold the check within the rectangular area  A-and to reduce reflection on the surface of the check.","In one embodiment, the check holder is supported by foldable flaps A-on the left and the right side of the front side. The foldable flaps may be adjusted to create a steep fold angle to hold the check upright and deflect light away from the camera. In an alternative embodiment, as shown in , the foldable flaps may be folded to the back of the front side of the check holder, so that the folded check holder B- may be inserted in to a mobile phone sleeve B-. A depositor may carry the folded check holder B- which is conveniently placed in his mobile phone sleeve B- together with the mobile phone B-, and may capture images of a check with the check holder and the camera built in the mobile phone for remote deposit conveniently.","In one implementation, the user may capture an image of the check placed on the check holder and submit the image to the MultiCrop. In one implementation, the captured images may be processed to identify which portion(s) of the images represent the check. The process of determining which portions of the check represent the image may include image enhancement, check corner detection, dewarping, cropping and\/or the like, as further illustrated in .","In further implementations, the MultiCrop may process the received image of the check holder comprising the check. The MultiCrop may detect the barcode on the received image, and obtain information embedded in the barcode. For example, a barcode reader may be adopted to obtain information encoded in the barcode, such as, but not limited to the depositor's name, depositor account number, payee's bank information, etc. In one implementation, upon performing OCR on the check image to extract deposit information, the MultiCrop may compare the extracted deposit information with the relevant information obtained from barcode reading. If any inconsistency is detected, the MultiCrop may send a notification to the user, e.g., by displaying a message to the smart phone or the home computer, to reject the image and request re-submission of the check image.","For example, for security concerns, a payee's bank may provide individualized check holder for a user to engage in remote deposit service, e.g., the individualized check holder may comprise a barcode with embedded information of the user's account information and the payee's bank's routing number. If the user uses the check holder, attempting to capture an image of a check belonging to his spouse, child, friends, and\/or the like, the payee's bank may reject the remote deposit.","In an alternative implementation, if the MultiCrop determines the extracted deposit information from OCR matches the barcode information, the MultiCrop may proceed with processing the deposit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0274","num":"0274"},"figref":"FIG. 13A","b":["13","80","13","81","13","82"]},"In one embodiment, a user may submit a remote deposit request  by sending a MMS message to the MultiCrop platform A-.

For example,  shows an exemplary diagram of MultiCrop remote deposit via multimedia messaging service (MMS) within embodiments of the MultiCrop, wherein the user may send a message to phone number \u201c1111,\u201d which represents the MMS deposit service. A user may elect to take a picture B- or take video B- of a physical check.","In one implementation, upon verification at the MultiCrop platform A-, if the user is not registered, a text message may be sent to deny deposit request A-. Otherwise, if yes, the user may generate and send a remote deposit message, A- by taking a picture A- of the check and attach the captured image in a MMS message A-. For example, the MMS message may comprise an image of the front side of the check and an image of the back side of the check. In one implementation, the user may enter deposit information in the MMS body such as, deposit amount, deposit account number, and\/or the like.","Within various embodiments, deposit via MMS may require registration with the MultiCrop platform as discussed above. For example, the MultiCrop platform may verify whether the user is a qualified member for MMS deposit service. In one implementation, the user may register his cellular phone number with the MultiCrop platform as a member qualified for MMS service, and MultiCrop may verify whether the cellular phone number associated with a MMS message is registered. If not, the MultiCrop platform may send a message back to the user indicating transaction has been denied.","In another implementation, the user may include a personal identifying pin B- in the MMS body for verification. For example, in one implementation, a qualified MMS deposit user may first send a text message to MultiCrop (e.g., number \u201c1111\u201d as in ) to request deposit, and may receive a verification pin from the MultiCrop platform. The user may then send the MMS deposit message including the identification pin as an authorization of the deposit.","In another implementation, as shown at A-, live video streaming of a check may be captured and transmitted to the MultiCrop platform. For example, a user may request to establish a real-time video streaming link with the MultiCrop platform when submitting the remote deposit request. In such cases, the user device and the MultiCrop platform may employ streaming video streaming software packages such as Apple Quicktime Streaming Servers, Marcromedia Communication Server, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the user may create a video in a common streaming media format such as MPEG4, 3GPP and\/or the like, and upload an encrypted HTTP streaming video on the MultiCrop web server. For example, in one implementation, a user may employ an Apple iPhone may establish HTTP live streaming to the MultiCrop platform via Quicktime Software systems.","In one embodiment, upon receiving the MMS message from a user mobile phone, the MultiCrop system may process the check image attached in the MMS message to extract deposit information.

For example, the MultiCrop platform may receive and process biometrics data from the user -, e.g., a payee may be instructed to submit an image or video clip of himself by posing his face in front of the web camera, or the cellular phone camera. In one implementation, the remote deposit processing component running on the user's device may provide a user interface which instructs the user to position his face within a specified area in order to produce a quality front side view.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop platform may take a snap picture of the video of the user to perform face recognition procedures for user authentication, obtaining payee information for check clearance, and\/or the like. In one implementation, in order to obtain quality images of the user, the MultiCrop platform may automatically take multiple snap images from the video. If none of the obtained photos is qualified during the facial recognition, for example, the photo is too blurred, the user submitting a profile view of his face, and\/or the like, the MultiCrop platform may request the user to re-submit identifying information. In one implementation, the user may select re-producing facial recognition video, or switch to other identifying methods, such as submitting login information, and\/or the like.","Upon identifying the user, the MultiCrop platform may instruct the user to hold the check in front of the camera to produce video capture -.

In an alternative implementation, as a video file is usually large, to achieve efficiency, the remote processing component may generate images from the video clip -. For example, in one implementation, the MultiCrop system may utilize video screen capture software packages to generate screen frame grabs and save the grabbed image files. In one implementation, software such as Apple QuickTime, WM Capture, CamStudio, and\/or the like, may be employed to obtain frame grabs of the check video streaming.","In another implementation, the remote deposit application at the user's computer may automatically take consecutive snap pictures of the check when the user holds the check in front of the camera. For example, the user may be requested to hold the check in position for 3 seconds, during which the remote deposit application may capture snap pictures every 100 ms to generate 30 frames of the check, and submit the images to the MultiCrop platform.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop system may determine whether the snapped images are usable -. For example, the resolution and file format of the check images may be checked. For another example, the MultiCrop system may perform an initial OCR on the images to examine whether the texts in the image are legible. If the MultiCrop system obtains multiple images of the check, then the image with the best quality may be used to optimize performance. For example, the MultiCrop system may select the image with the highest solution, with the least corner reflection as discussed in , with the least skewness or distortion as discussed in , and\/or the like. In one embodiment, if none of the images is qualified, the MultiCrop may request the user to re-produce check images via the camera at -.

The MultiCrop may further utilize the user camera for check destruction. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may request the user to destroy the physical check - after successful deposit. For example, in one implementation, the MultiCrop system may display a message \u201cPlease tear the check to your camera.\u201d The user may then submit a video clip of tearing the check -, while the deposit application may take snap shots. In one implementation, the MultiCrop system may verify validity of the check destruction -, e.g., verifying the check shown in the received snap pictures is the same as the deposited one, and then send a deposit acknowledgement message to the user to confirm the deposit -.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop system may implement user face recognition, capturing snap pictures of the check and capturing destruction of the check in real-time.

For example, the Check 21 Act may require that the image be of a certain image quality. Although there are several ways in which image quality may be determined, one manner in which it may be done is to perform an OCR operation on the check to determine if at least a portion of the information in the image is determinable. The bank may first attempt to extract and recognize characters within the digital image. Any extracted characters may then be compared to previously known information or information submitted by the account owner in the deposit request.

For example, to deskew the image, the MultiCrop may determine the angle(s) of one or more reference line(s) within the check image. In one implementation, the angle of the line or lines may be determined using a coordinate system as a reference. For example, the angle of the line may be determined in reference to a set of horizontal and vertical axes B- established within the check image, as shown in . The image may then be digitally rotated towards the direction that the check image may be horizontally positioned, e.g., the angle may be zero.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may use reference points in the check to facilitate the proper rotation of the image. In one implementation, a check may have several horizontal lines near the bottom of the check, used by the check writer to sign the check and to note the use of the check. In such cases, the MultiCrop may rely on the two long edges of the digital image and\/or the printed lines within the check as reference points\/lines. If the image is rotated so that the long lines and\/or the lines within the check are horizontal (e.g., the angle between the reference line and the established horizontal axis B- is zero), then the check image may be properly deskewed.

For example, if the difference between the Y-coordinate values between horizontal bottom left samples and the horizontal bottom right samples is smaller than an acceptable constraint, such as, but not limited to 3 pixels, then the horizontal bottom edge is considered to be strictly horizontal without skew.","In one implementation, false samples due to noise or other unnecessary samples may be removed. For example, vertical bottom samples whose Y-coordinate values exceed the Y-coordinate range defined by the horizontal samples as discussed above, may be discarded.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may apply similar procedures on the top samples of the horizontal top left and right and see if the difference is smaller than the minimum constraint. If yes, the vertical top left and right samples that exceeds the range defined by the horizontal Top Left and Top right may be discarded. In this way, the MultiCrop may eliminate points that have reflection that hugged the top and bottom edges.","In one embodiment, line projections may be performed based on the sample points in a progressive manner. For example, in one implementation, for every sample points D-, the MultiCrop may apply least squares to project a line D-; and for every projected line base on the 10 sample points, the angle of the current line with the last projected line D-. For another example, the MultiCrop may project the sample line based on a different number of sample points, e.g., determined based on the quality of the check image, and\/or the like. If the angle is greater than a predetermined constraint, denoted by \u201cAngleMax,\u201d the current line may be discarded D-, but may be kept track in place of the newly detected line.

Similarly, for vertical line projections, such average line calculation may be adopted if the X-coordinate values of the sample points are sufficiently close.","In an alternative implementation, for projected horizontal lines, a Y-coordinate value may be extracted from the currently projected line and the old projected line at the same X-coordinate value. If the difference in the Y-coordinate values is significantly large, the currently projected line may be discarded, to counter noise and reflection around the check image that may not be filtered out.","After detecting projected lines, the MultiCrop may locate the four corners by calculating intersections of the four lines D-. For example, in one implementation, the Kramers Rule may be applied to use determinants to calculate the intersections for each line. In one implementation, the MultiCrop may keep four lines (two horizontal and two vertical) to calculate the corners. In alternative implementations, the MultiCrop may obtain at eight lines: vertical left top, vertical left bottom, vertical right top, vertical right bottom, horizontal top left, horizontal top right, horizontal bottom left, and horizontal bottom right, to locate the corners. For example, the intersection of the vertical top left line and horizontal top left line may be located as the top left corner.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may determine whether an intersection is a good corner by calculating the inner angles C-. For example, in one implementation, the four inner angles may be calculated and summed up. If the sum is equal to, or within a sufficiently small difference to 360 degrees, the corners are considered to be good. Otherwise, in one implementation, the MultiCrop may assume three out of the four corners are good, and may detect the bad corner D-.","In one implementation, the MultiCrop may calculate the differences between the angles to detect the bad corner. For example, if the difference between the bottom left and bottom right angles, the difference between the top right and bottom right angles are sufficiently small, but the difference between the top left and top right angles is greater than a maximum tolerance level, e.g., AngleMax, the MultiCrop may determine the top left corner is a bad corner. In such cases, the MultiCrop may re-calculate the top left corner by rectangular projection based on the other three corners.","In an alternative implementation, the MultiCrop may utilize the projected lines to re-calculate the detected bad corner C-. In the above example, if the top left corner is detected as bad, which may imply the projected vertical left top line and the horizontal top left line are not accurate, then the last available vertical left bottom sample line C- and the last available horizontal top right sample line C- may be extended so that there intersection may be re-calculate as the top left corner C-.","In one implementation, in the dewarping and cropping B-, the virtual images may be oriented to make the bottom horizontal based on the lines from the horizontal bottom projections.

Payee may be required to perform the void process within a predetermined period of time.","When a negotiable instrument is deposited using electronic means, there may arise the situation when the physical negotiable instrument \u201ctransforms\u201d to exist in essentially two forms: the original physical negotiable instrument and the newly generated digital form. While the newly generated digital form may undergo processing through the federal check clearinghouse, the physical form is typically left in possession of the bearer of the negotiable instrument, e.g. the person that deposited the check. Although a financial institution may send instructions to the depositor to destroy or transfer possession of the physical negotiable instrument upon transmission of the digital form, the financial institution may have little to no way to force the depositor to actually destroy the negotiable instrument without limiting access to the funds. Unless the depositor destroys the negotiable instrument, the duality described above may continue to propagate, i.e. both the physical negotiable instrument and the digital form may continue to exist contemporaneously.","Thus, a financial institution may wish to cause the alteration of the physical negotiable instrument with or without the assistance of the depositor to render the physical form of the negotiable instrument non-negotiable. In other words, the financial institution may cause the alteration of the appearance of the physical negotiable instrument to a point that makes it difficult or impossible to present the physical negotiable instrument in another transaction, thus effectively destroying the negotiable instrument, with or without the participation of the depositor. For example, the appearance of the negotiable instrument may be changed to show the term, \u201cVOID\u201d. Thus, if the negotiable instrument is presented again, the term may indicate that the holder negotiable instrument has previously deposited or attempted to deposit the negotiable instrument.

The change may be permanent or temporary. There are various types of ink that may be used, the present disclosure not being limited to any one particular type. Some examples of modifiable inks are inks sensitive to light, heat or sound. An ink that is sensitive to light may be configured to modify based upon exposure to a certain magnitude of light for a certain period of time. For example, a light sensitive ink may change its appearance based upon a bright light, such as a light from a scanner, being applied for a long period of time. The time may be determined based upon various scan speeds of a typical scanner. For example, the scan speed of a scanner at a high resolution may be slower than the scan speed of a scanner at a low resolution.","If the ink is sensitive to heat, the ink may be configured to modify its appearance based upon the heat generated by the application of a bright light source, such as one that may be found in a scanner. If the light source is applied for a long period of time, the ink may be configured such that the heat generated by the absorption of the light by the ink will create a certain amount of heat within the ink, thus causing the change in the ink. Unmodified modifiable section A- may also have a mechanism sensitive to other types of stimuli, such as a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. When the RFID tag receives a particular radio signal, the RFID tag may be modified. When the RFID tag is read at a later time, the modification may indicate that the deposit of the negotiable instrument may have occurred. The RFID tag may also, among other uses, be used to track the location of check A-.","In an alternative embodiment, check A- has modified modifiable section A-, which was unmodified modifiable section A-.

Check A- now shows the term, \u201cVOID\u201d within modified modifiable section A-. The change may be used to provide information to prevent a second or subsequent presentment of check A- for deposit.","In an alternative embodiment, an ink sensitive to various stimuli that modifies after removal of a protective cover may be employed. Check A- has removable coating A-which seals modifiable ink section A-from exposure to stimuli. The stimuli may be of various types, including, but not limited to, air or light. For example, prior to deposit of the negotiable instrument, there may be a requirement to remove coating A-to indicate the underlying code, which is shown as \u201cVO\u201d. Upon removal of coating A-, ink section A-is exposed to light, causing the ink to modify to show \u201cVO\u201d. Thus, coating A-may be of a range of materials that blocks the exposure of section A-to a stimulus.","Once exposed, ink section A-may be permanently or temporarily modified. Ink section A-indicia may also be encoded to increase the difficulty of defeating the void process. For example, ink section A-may be a bar code unique to check A- itself and may be designed in a manner that is difficult to determine what the bar code will be. In order to deposit check A-, coating A-may be removed to show the encoded indicia.

In turn, computers employ processors to process information; such processors  may be referred to as central processing units (CPU). One form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative circuits to pass binary encoded signals acting as instructions to enable various operations. These instructions may be operational and\/or data instructions containing and\/or referencing other instructions and data in various processor accessible and operable areas of memory  (e.g., registers, cache memory, random access memory, etc.).

These stored instruction codes, e.g., programs, may engage the CPU circuit components and other motherboard and\/or system components to perform desired operations. One type of program is a computer operating system, which, may be executed by CPU on a computer; the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Some resources that may be employed in information technology systems include: input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer; memory storage into which data may be saved; and processors by which information may be processed. These information technology systems may be used to collect data for later retrieval, analysis, and manipulation, which may be facilitated through a database program. These information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop controller  may be connected to and\/or communicate with entities such as, but not limited to: one or more users from user input devices ; peripheral devices ; an optional cryptographic processor device ; and\/or a communications network .","Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients, servers, and intermediary nodes in a graph topology.

In another embodiment, the cryptographic processor and\/or transceivers may be connected as either internal and\/or external peripheral devices  via the interface bus I\/O. In turn, the transceivers may be connected to antenna(s) , thereby effectuating wireless transmission and reception of various communication and\/or sensor protocols; for example the antenna(s) may connect to: a Texas Instruments WiLink WL1283 transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 3.0, FM, global positioning system (GPS) (thereby allowing MultiCrop controller to determine its location)); Broadcom BCM4329FKUBG transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, FM, etc.); a Broadcom BCM4750IUB8 receiver chip (e.g., GPS); an Infineon Technologies X-Gold 618-PMB9800 (e.g., providing 2G\/3G HSDPA\/HSUPA communications); and\/or the like.

Also, to implement certain features of the MultiCrop, some feature implementations may rely on embedded components, such as: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), Digital Signal Processing (\u201cDSP\u201d), Field Programmable Gate Array (\u201cFPGA\u201d), and\/or the like embedded technology. For example, any of the MultiCrop component collection (distributed or otherwise) and\/or features may be implemented via the microprocessor and\/or via embedded components; e.g., via ASIC, coprocessor, DSP, FPGA, and\/or the like. Alternately, some implementations of the MultiCrop may be implemented with embedded components that are configured and used to achieve a variety of features or signal processing.","Depending on the particular implementation, the embedded components may include software solutions, hardware solutions, and\/or some combination of both hardware\/software solutions. For example, MultiCrop features discussed herein may be achieved through implementing FPGAs, which are a semiconductor devices containing programmable logic components called \u201clogic blocks\u201d, and programmable interconnects, such as the high performance FPGA Virtex series and\/or the low cost Spartan series manufactured by Xilinx. Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the MultiCrop features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the MultiCrop system designer\/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or mathematical operations. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be circuit flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the MultiCrop may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate MultiCrop controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the \u201cCPU\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor\u201d for the MultiCrop.","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like.

Peripheral devices often include types of input devices (e.g., cameras).","It should be noted that although user input devices and peripheral devices may be employed, the MultiCrop controller may be embodied as an embedded, dedicated, and\/or monitor-less (i.e., headless) device, wherein access would be provided over a network interface connection.","Cryptographic units such as, but not limited to, microcontrollers, processors , interfaces , and\/or devices  may be attached, and\/or communicate with the MultiCrop controller. A MC68HC16 microcontroller, manufactured by Motorola Inc., may be used for and\/or within cryptographic units. The MC68HC16 microcontroller utilizes a 16-bit multiply-and-accumulate instruction in the 16 MHz configuration and requires less than one second to perform a 512-bit RSA private key operation. Cryptographic units support the authentication of communications from interacting agents, as well as allowing for anonymous transactions. Cryptographic units may also be configured as part of the CPU. Equivalent microcontrollers and\/or processors may also be used. Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include: Broadcom's CryptoNetX and other Security Processors; nCipher's nShield; SafeNet's Luna PCI (e.g., 7100) series; Semaphore Communications' 40 MHz Roadrunner 184; Sun's Cryptographic Accelerators (e.g., Accelerator 6000 PCIe Board, Accelerator 500 Daughtercard); Via Nano Processor (e.g., L2100, L2200, U2400) line, which is capable of performing 500+MB\/s of cryptographic instructions; VLSI Technology's 33 MHz 6868; and\/or the like.","Generally, any mechanization and\/or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and\/or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However, memory is a fungible technology and resource, thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the MultiCrop controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the operation of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; however, such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  will include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum; a (fixed and\/or removable) magnetic disk drive; a magneto-optical drive; an optical drive (i.e., Blueray, CD ROM\/RAM\/Recordable (R)\/ReWritable (RW), DVD R\/RW, HD DVD R\/RW etc.); an array of devices (e.g., Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)); solid state memory devices (USB memory, solid state drives (SSD), etc.); other processor-readable storage mediums; and\/or other devices of the like. Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.","The memory  may contain a collection of program and\/or database components and\/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s)  (operating system); information server component(s)  (information server); user interface component(s)  (user interface); Web browser component(s)  (Web browser); database(s) ; mail server component(s) ; mail client component(s) ; cryptographic server component(s)  (cryptographic server); the MultiCrop component(s) ; and\/or the like (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the MultiCrop controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Plan 9; Be OS; Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and\/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and\/or the like); and\/or the like operating systems. However, more limited and\/or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS, IBM OS\/2, Microsoft DOS, Microsoft Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista\/XP (Server), Palm OS, and\/or the like. An operating system may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and\/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may enable the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the MultiCrop controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the MultiCrop controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, and\/or the like.","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and\/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective\u2212) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, dynamic (D) hypertext markup language (HTML), FLASH, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, wireless application protocol (WAP), WebObjects, and\/or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the MultiCrop controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the MultiCrop database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the MultiCrop database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the MultiCrop. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the MultiCrop as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Computer interfaces in some respects are similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, capabilities, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS\/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/XP\/Vista\/7 (i.e., Aero), Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), web interface libraries (e.g., ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, etc. interface libraries such as, but not limited to, Dojo, jQuery(UI), MooTools, Prototype, script.aculo.us, SWFObject, Yahoo! User Interface, any of which may be used and) provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by, with, and\/or atop operating systems and\/or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and\/or operation of program components and\/or system facilities through textual and\/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact, and\/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The user interface may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","A Web browser component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and\/or the like. Web browsers allowing for the execution of program components through facilities such as ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, web browser plug-in APIs (e.g., FireFox, Safari Plug-in, and\/or the like APIs), and\/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, and\/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. Also, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar operations of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the MultiCrop enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective\u2212) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POPS), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and\/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the MultiCrop.","Access to the MultiCrop mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POPS, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC),  International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash operation), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the MultiCrop may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the MultiCrop component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the MultiCrop and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The MultiCrop database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the MultiCrop database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the MultiCrop database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the MultiCrop database  may be integrated into another component such as the MultiCrop component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A users table includes fields such as, but not limited to: a user_ID, user_name, user_password, user_bank_ID, account_ID, transaction_ID, user_accountNo, user_transaction, user_hardware, and\/or the like. The user table may support and\/or track multiple entity accounts on a MultiCrop. A hardware table includes fields such as, but not limited to: hardware_ID, hardware_type, hardware_name, data_formatting_requirements, bank_ID, protocols, addressing_info, usage_history, hardware_requirements, user_ID, and\/or the like. A transaction table includes fields such as, but not limited to transaction_ID, transaction_time, transaction_account, transaction_payee, transaction_bank, transaction_payer, transaction_status, transaction_clearance, and\/or the like. A check table includes fields such as check_ID, account_ID, transaction_ID, image_timestamp, image_MICR, image_status, image_user, image_device, image_account and\/or the like. An accounts table includes fields such as, but not limited to account_ID, user_ID, bank_ID, account_number, routing_number, account_type, account_amount, account_limit, and\/or the like. An Image Thresholds table includes fields such as threshold MICR, threshold_CAR, threshold_contrast, threshold_condition, threshold_imagedevice_type, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the MultiCrop database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search MultiCrop component may treat the combination of the MultiCrop database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the MultiCrop. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the MultiCrop may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The MultiCrop may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The MultiCrop database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the MultiCrop database communicates with the MultiCrop component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The MultiCrop component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the MultiCrop component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the MultiCrop that was discussed in the previous figures. As such, the MultiCrop affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The MultiCrop transforms uploaded check images and check deposit information inputs via MultiCrop components image upload component , image analysis component  (example embodiments of which may be found in ), MICR extraction component  (example embodiments of which may be found at  in ), TIFF generation component , CAR Extraction component  (example embodiments of which may be found at  in ), cash letter generation component  (example embodiments of which may be found at  in ), soft post component , endorsement detection component  (example embodiments of which may be found at  in  and ), representment detection component  (example embodiments of which may be found in ), multiple check cropping component  (example embodiments of which may be found in ), smart check cropping component  (example embodiments of which may be found in ), and\/or image inspection component  (example embodiments of which may be found in ) into deposit confirmation outputs. Alternative embodiments of the MultiCrop components are discussed in .","The MultiCrop component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective\u2212) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D)HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and\/or the like), WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the MultiCrop server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The MultiCrop component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the MultiCrop component communicates with the MultiCrop database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The MultiCrop may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The structure and\/or operation of any of the MultiCrop node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the MultiCrop controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Jini local and remote application program interfaces, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.","For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., JSON, SOAP, and\/or like parsers) that may be employed to parse (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like.
