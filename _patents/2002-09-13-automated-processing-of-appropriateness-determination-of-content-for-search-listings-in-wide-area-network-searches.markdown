title: Automated processing of appropriateness determination of content for search listings in wide area network searches
abstract: A method and system for improving the efficiency of a database processing system for evaluating candidate data items representing search listings that are submitted for inclusion into a search engine database. Candidate search listings are automatically assessed for quality, style, and relevance to evaluate risk of unfavorable reception by a user and of potential exposure volume. Search listings which are higher-risk or higher-volume are routed through manual editorial review while lower-risk, lower-volume search listings are routed for immediate inclusion in the search database without manual editorial evaluation. Accordingly, human editorial efforts can be devoted to manual review of high-risk or high-volume search listings while efficiency is simultaneously improved in the processing system as a whole.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates to the field of automated document content analysis, and more specifically to a mechanism for automated determination of the appropriateness of a search listing for inclusion in a wide area network search engine database.","The Internet is a wide area network having a truly global reach, interconnecting computers all over the world. That portion of the Internet generally known as the World Wide Web is a collection of inter-related data whose magnitude is truly staggering. The content of the World Wide Web (sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Web\u201d) includes, among other things, documents of the known HTML (Hyper-Text Mark-up Language) format which are transported through the Internet according to the known protocol, HTTP (Hyper-Text Transport Protocol).","The breadth and depth of the content of the Web is amazing and overwhelming to anyone hoping to find specific information therein. Accordingly, an extremely important component of the Web is a search engine. As used herein, a search engine is an interactive system for locating content relevant to one or more user-specified search terms, which collectively represent a search query. Through the known Common Gateway Interface (CGI), the Web can include content which is interactive, i.e., which is responsive to data specified by a human user of a computer connected to the Web. A search engine receives a search query of one or more search terms from the user and presents to the user a list of one or more documents which are determined to be relevant to the search query.","Search engines dramatically improve the efficiency with which users can locate desired information on the Web. As a result, search engines are one of the most commonly used resources of the Internet. An effective search engine can help a user locate very specific information within the billions of documents currently represented within the Web. The critical function and raison d'\u00eatre of search engines is to identify the few most relevant results among the billions of available documents given a few search terms of a user's query and to do so in as little time as possible. Thus, a critical function of search engines is determination of relevance of documents to a search query.","Generally, search engines maintain a database of records associating search terms with information resources on the Web. Search engines currently acquire information about the contents of the Web primarily in several common ways. The most common is generally known as crawling the Web and the second is by submission of such information by a provider of such information or by third-parties (i.e., neither a provider of the information nor the provider of the search engine). Another common way for search engines to acquire information about the content of the Web is for human editors to create indices of information based on their review.","To understand crawling, one must first understand that documents of the Web can include references, commonly referred to as links, to other documents of the Web. Anyone who has \u201cclicked on\u201d a portion of a document to cause display of a referenced document has activated such a link. Crawling the Web generally refers to an automated process by which documents referenced by one document are retrieved and analyzed and documents referred to by those documents are retrieved and analyzed and the retrieval and analysis are repeated recursively. Thus, an attempt is made to automatically traverse the entirety of the Web to catalog the entirety of the contents of the Web.","Due to the fact that documents of the Web are constantly being added and\/or modified and also to the sheer immensity of the Web, no Web crawler has successfully cataloged the entirety of the Web. Accordingly, providers of Web content who wish to have their content included in search engine databases directly submit their content to providers of search engines. Other providers of content and\/or services available through the Internet contract with operators of search engines to have their content regularly crawled and updated such that search results include current information. Some search engines, such as the search engine provided by Overture Services, Inc. of Pasadena, Calif. (http:\/\/www.overture.com) and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,361 which is incorporated herein by reference, allow providers of Internet content and\/or services to compose and submit brief titles and descriptions to be associated with their content and\/or services in results as a search query. As the Internet has grown and commercial activity has also grown over the Internet, some search engines have specialized in providing commercial search results presented separately from informational results with the added benefit of facilitating commercial transactions over the Internet. One such search engine is the search engine described in the '361 Patent and provided by Overture Services, Inc. as described above.","Since search engines which provide unwanted information are at a distinct disadvantage to search engines which minimize presentation of unwanted information, search engine providers have a strong interest in maximizing relevance of results provided to search queries. Providers of search engines therefore often review the content of individual search listings for desirability and appropriateness prior to including each listing in their database for real-time delivery of search results in response to a search query.","Due to the overwhelming amount of information on the Web, such review is a daunting task. In addition, content review generally has not lent itself to automation since the appropriateness of a particular search listing depends upon subtleties of human perception of both the search listing itself and the content referenced by the search listing. Operators of search engines have general had to choose between (i) automatically generating search results of listings having questionable relevance and therefore less value to the user or (ii) manually generating more relevant search listings by human editing but on a drastically reduced scale. While manually edited search listings tend to be far more relevant and therefore far more effective in attracting users to a search engine, manual editing of search listings is very expensive in both time and resources and significantly delays availability of newly submitted search listings to users of the search engine. Delayed availability of search listings reduces the currency of search listings produced as results in response to search queries.","What is needed is a mechanism by which review of one or more search listings can be efficiently performed while maintaining accurate analysis of the impression of a given search listing on a human user seeing the search listing and\/or the content referenced by the search listing.","In accordance with the present invention, candidate search listings are automatically evaluated to determine the likelihood that the search listings comport with a content policy. Specifically, candidate search listings that are determined to be lower-risk and lower-volume search listings can be automatically and quickly approved for inclusion in the search listing database for immediate serving as results in response to a real-time query by a user. Parties submitting candidate search listings for inclusion in a search engine database benefit from quick approval and availability of submitted search listings. In addition, such parties can be automatically notified of automated approval or rejection of submitted listings, providing greater satisfaction and promoting confidence in the efficiency and effectiveness of the candidate search listing evaluation process.","Another benefit of quickly and automatically approving lower-risk, lower-volume candidate search listings for inclusion in a search listing database is that valuable human resources can be dedicated to more careful editorial review of candidate search listings which are automatically determined to be either not lower-risk or not lower-volume search listings. Thus, quality of the editorial review of candidate search listings increases while efficiency of editorial review of all candidate search listings simultaneously increases.","The automated preprocessing to assess likelihood that a candidate search listing comports with the predetermined content policy includes generally quality, style, and relevance analysis. Quality analysis assesses the nature of the content and, specifically, the likelihood and degree to which the content of the candidate search listing is objectionable. Some types of content are so objectionable as to be unilaterally prohibited by a search engine provider, and so the detection of such blocked content in a candidate search listing results in the automatic rejection of the listing and notification of the submitting source of such rejection and the reasons for the rejection. Suspect terms are terms which indicate that a more thorough review of the candidate search listing is warranted. Detection of suspect content in the search listing causes the search listing to be routed for manual review of the search listing to determine whether the search listing comports with the content policy and notification of the submitter that such manual review is being undertaken. Likewise, sexual and gambling content in a search listing does not automatically flag the search listing for rejection but does flag the search listing for a more thorough, manual review by the human editor. Nonsensical, junk text within a search listing however does cause the search listing to be automatically rejected and the submitter notified.","In automated evaluation of the style of a candidate search listing, generally three actions are possible. It should be noted that the three actions are not mutually exclusive. First, the candidate search listing can be marked for rejection and automatically sent back to the submitting source with an indication of the reasons for the rejection. Second, the candidate search listing can be flagged for manual review and routed to a human editor with notification of same to the submitter. Third, the candidate search listing can be automatically modified to comport with the predetermined style policy and once edited automatically included in the database. The style policy can specify various style criteria which must be met by a search listing to be included in the search engine database, including rules on capitalization of characters, rules on punctuation, prohibitions of contact information in the search listing, prohibitions against superlatives, and similar criteria as illustrative examples.","In the automated relevance determination of a candidate search listing, the relevance of a submitted listing to a search term is determined by algorithmically screening the content of an assocaited web page to verify a set of relevance criteria. Relevance criteria include such things as (i) whether the associated URL address refer to an existing document, (ii) whether the referenced document contains the associated search term, and (iii) whether the search term, title, and description of the search listing are relevant to the referenced document. Such relevance criteria are only representative and could include any criteria deemed appropriate to a relevance determination. Like the evaluation of style, generally three actions are possible from an automated relevance determination. First the search listing can be definitively considered relevant to the search term and thus approved for automatic processing. Second, the search listing can be determined marginally relevant to the search term and thus routed for manual review by a human editor. Third, the search listing can be determined to be decidedly not relevant to the search and automatically rejected.","In accordance with the present invention, editorial review of lower-risk candidate search listings involving relatively lower-volume search terms is automated to allow human editors to focus more attention on candidate search listings involving higher-volume search terms and therefore involving higher risk of unfavorable exposure and\/or of cluttering search results with marginally relevant search listings. Accordingly, the average time required to evaluate a submitted search listing is greatly reduced and many lower-volume, lower-risk search listings can be approved almost immediately, thus increasing the efficiency and profitability of a search engine provider.","Greatly simplified for illustration purposes,  shows a search engine  which is coupled to, and serves, a wide area network  which is the Internet in this illustrative embodiment. A number of host computer systems A\u2013D are coupled to Internet  and provide content to a number of client computer systems A\u2013C. For example, while only four (4) host computer systems and three (3) client computer systems are shown, it should be appreciated that (i) host computer systems and client computer systems coupled to the Internet collectively number in the millions of computer systems and (ii) host computer systems can retrieve information like a client computer system and client computer systems can host information like a host computer system.","Search engine  is a computer system which catalogs information hosted by host computer systems A\u2013D and serves search requests of client computer systems A\u2013C for information which may be hosted by any of host computers A\u2013D. In response to such requests, search engine  produces a result set of any cataloged information which matches one or more search terms specified in the search request. Such information, as hosted by host computer systems A\u2013D, includes information in the form of what are commonly referred to as web sites. Such information can be retrieved through the known and widely used hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) in a portion of the Internet widely known as the World Wide Web. A single multimedia document presented to a user is generally referred to as a web page and inter-related web pages under the control of a single person, group, or organization is generally referred to as a web site.","While searching for pertinent web pages and web sites is described herein, it should be appreciated that some of the techniques described herein are equally applicable to search for information in other forms stored in a wide area network and accessible through other network protocols. In addition, editorial authority can be exercised by any person or organization hosting information submitted by another. For example, stringent quality controls can be implemented in a privately operated intranet or in any network, LAN or WAN, and not only in the Internet. Similarly, Internet Service Providers or providers of web hosting services can use the techniques described herein to enforce policies with respect to hosted content.","Search engine  is shown in greater detail in . Search engine  includes a search server  which receives and serves search requests from any of client computer systems A\u2013C using a search database . Search engine  also includes a submission server  for receiving search listing submissions from any of host computers A\u2013D. Each submission requests that information hosted by any of host computers A\u2013D be cataloged within search database  and therefore available as search results through search server .","To avoid providing unwanted search results to client computer systems A\u2013C, search engine  includes an editorial evaluator  which evaluates submitted search listings prior to inclusion of such search listings in search database . This function serves an important business requirement for any provider of a search engine by ensuring the satisfaction of legal and contractual content filtration and presentation obligations. Standardizing the presentation and format for search result listings can also increase the effectiveness of the overall presentation of search results and can aid search engine providers in the effort to generate more relevant results to users.","In this illustrative embodiment, search engine \u2014and each of submission server , editorial evaluator , and search server \u2014is all or part of one or more computer processes executing in one or more computers. Briefly, submission server  receives requests to list information within search database . Each such request includes one or more candidate search listing, generally of the form of search listing  (). It should be appreciated that search listing  is submitted to search engine  and is therefore originally created externally with respect to search engine . For convenience, the party submitting search listing  is sometimes referred to as the owner of search listing . However, it should be appreciated that the party submitting a search listing is not necessarily the creator of the referenced information.","Search listing  includes an account field  which identifies an entity on whose behalf the request is made. Account field  enables search engine  to limit search listing requests to a number of trusted entities and\/or to charge fees for serving requests to include search listings in search database . In an alternative embodiment in which no fees are charged for serving such requests, account field  is omitted.","Term field  of search listing  specifies a particular search term to which search listing pertains. For example, a search term, \u201ctravel,\u201d can be associated with a search listing pertaining to travel information.","URL  of search listing  specifies an address within Internet  of the information associated with the term of term field . URL  is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and identifies a specific web page in this illustrative embodiment. URLs are well-known and are not described further herein. It is appreciated that a URI can also be used in URL . Generally, URL  is data identifying information, e.g., a document, which is available through Internet  and for which the user may be searching. Other known types of information references can be used in place of a URL.","Search listing  includes a description field  which includes a brief description of the information found at the address of URL . Description field  is used to provide the user a brief synopsis of the web page identified by URL  to thereby assist the user in determining the relevance of the web page to a requested search. It should be appreciated that description field  is supplied by the owner and, initially, is relevant to\u2014and accurately descriptive of\u2014the information referenced URL  only to the degree the owner of search listing  has made it so.","Category field  of search listing  specifies a category within which the search term of term field  belongs as determined by the owner of search listing . Such helps distinguish synonymous search terms. For example, the term \u201cbook\u201d can be used to refer to a printed literary work, the placing of a bet at a horse race, or the making of a reservation, e.g., for a hotel or flight. Category field  can be used to distinguish each meaning of the term \u201cbook.\u201d In this illustrative embodiment, category field  is optional and therefore need not be specified in search listing .","In this illustrative embodiment, search listings of search database  are ordered according to bids for higher placement for specific search terms. In general, higher bids for a given search term are listed earlier within search results pertaining to the search term. Maximum bid field  and bid type field  specify, respectively, the maximum amount that the submitter of search listing  is willing to pay for top placement in a results list and the type of bid. In this illustrative embodiment, bids can be static or automatic with a maximum bid specified, but it should be appreciated that any form of bid, bid value, or bid plus other relevance consideration can be used to rank results to a user query. The types of bids represented in bid type field include fixed bids and automatically incremented bids in this illustrative embodiment. If the bid is fixed, maximum bid field  represents a fixed bid amount. If the bid is automatically incremented, maximum bid field  represents a maximum bid amount up to which, but not beyond, the bid can be automatically incremented.","In this illustrative embodiment, manual editorial evaluation of search listing  can be requested by the entity submitting search listing . Such a request prevents automated editorial evaluation in the manner described here and is represented in manual evaluation request flag .","Search listings are organized and evaluated in the context of a marketplace in this illustrative embodiment. Thus, the objectionable quality of any portion of search listing  can be evaluated in the context of the marketplace for which search listing  is intended. That marketplace is indicated within marketplace field . Alternatively, marketplace field  can specify one or more marketplaces to which search listing  is applicable. In this illustrative embodiment, valid marketplaces include the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan.","Submission server  receives one or more search listings and forwards them to editorial evaluator  which determines the appropriateness of including each search listing in search database . Processing by editorial evaluator  in making such a determination is illustrated by logic flow diagram  ().","In step , editorial evaluator  receives search listing  (). Logic flow diagram  () shows processing of a single search listing. If multiple search listings are received, each is processed according to logic flow diagram  independently of, and concurrently with, other search listings.","Editorial evaluator  is shown in greater detail in . Submitter interface  receives the search listings from submission server  which is a web server in this illustrative embodiment. Search listings are received individually as CGI data received through Internet  conforming to the general structure shown in  or as a collection of multiple search listings in a data format readable by submission server , e.g., a table of comma-separated values or some other conventional spreadsheet-compatible format in this illustrative embodiment. Web servers, CGI, and various spreadsheet-compatible data formats are well known and are not described further herein.","Submitter interface  receives the search listings sought to be included in search database  and forwards the search listings to search listing receipt manager . Search listing receipt manager  creates a search listing receipt for each submitted search listing. A search listing receipt is a data structure which represents both the search listing and its status as it is processed by editorial evaluator . In addition to the fields shown in , a search listing receipt includes data representing the entity submitting the search listing, dates of creation and modification of the search listing receipt and of evaluation and completion of the processing of the receipt as well as other events in the evaluation, flags representing various types of content determined to be associated with the search listing, editorial notes, the person or system evaluating the search listing, various scores for such things as relevance and quality, current status, and final disposition.","Submitter Interface  requests creation of search listing receipts by placing data representing a search listing on a search listing receipt queue. Such data is processed by search listing receipt manager . In particular, search listing receipt manager  dequeues such data from the search listing receipt queue and forms a search listing receipt by combining such data with the various search listing receipt fields described above.","When a receipt is created for a particular search listing, the search listing\u2014in the context of its receipt\u2014is ready for evaluation for inclusion in search database . Search listing receipt manager  submits search listing receipts for such evaluation by placing such search listing receipts on an import queue .","Search listing import manager  manages processing of search listing receipts as they are considered for inclusion in search database . New candidate search listing receipts are dequeued by search listing import manager  from import queue . Search listing import manager  records data representing various assessments of the substance of each search listing receipt. Such completes step  () in this illustrative embodiment.","Each search listing receipt processed by search listing import manager  () is submitted to style and quality manager . In steps  (, style and quality manager  () assesses quality and relevance, respectively, of the term specified in term field  () in the context of description field  and the information identified by URL . Steps  ( are shown as being performed independently and concurrently. However, it should be appreciated that steps \u2013 can be performed sequentially in either order.","In step , style and quality manager  assesses the quality of the search listing. In particular, style and quality manager  assesses the information identified by URL  () and the information contained within description field  for questionable, offensive, or sensitive content. It should be noted that, for illustration purposes, some objectionable terms are identified herein explicitly. No offense is intended.","Quality assessment in step  () is described below in greater detail. Briefly, several categories of objectionable terms are maintained in search database  (). In this illustrative embodiment, these categories include blocked terms, suspect terms, sexual terms, gambling terms, junk text, banned terms, and indexed terms.","Blocked terms are terms so likely to be objectionable that any search listing containing a blocked term is marked for rejection by style and quality manager , even prior to further editorial evaluation. Examples include such terms as \u201cwhore,\u201d \u201cincest,\u201d \u201cbestiality,\u201d and \u201cMicrosoft sucks.\u201d Of course, terms which are even more objectionable can be imagined as well. Such terms are so likely to be offensive that the reputation of search engine  could be tarnished by including such terms in search results. In addition, the search engine may be required by law or contractual obligation to prevent display of specific objectionable terms to users. Accordingly, detection of a blocked term in a search listing results in immediate rejection of the search listing in this illustrative embodiment.","Suspect terms are terms which are potentially objectionable such that a search listing including such terms should be marked for closer evaluation. Examples include \u201cbody solutions,\u201d \u201ccity search,\u201d \u201cnissan.com,\u201d \u201ccable black box,\u201d \u201csexy girls,\u201d and \u201ccondoms.\u201d These and other suspect terms can be legitimate, non-objectionable search terms or can be objectionable and subject to rejection, depending upon the context and overall impression given by the suspect term. Accordingly, style and quality manager  marks a search listing which includes a suspect term for further review but not immediately for rejection.","Sexual terms are terms which are sexual in nature and\/or appeal to prurient interests. Salacious content associated with a search listing is not necessarily grounds for rejection. However, it is preferred that users requesting searches are presented with the option of excluding sexual content since some users may find sexual content rather offensive and repugnant while other users may actually seek out sexual content. Accurately identifying information associated with a search listing as sexual in nature allows such search listings to be appropriately filtered in accordance with user-specified preferences.","Gambling terms are terms associated with gambling activities. Like sexual terms, gambling terms are not immediately marked for rejection but instead are identified as gambling terms to facilitate filtering to exclude gambling terms. Examples include \u201cblackjack,\u201d \u201cpoker,\u201d \u201ccraps,\u201d and \u201cslots.\u201d While some users may find gambling terms objectionable, more users find web sites pertaining to gambling simply annoying. Providers of sexual and gambling web sites often attempt to cause information about their web sites to be presented to users notwithstanding an absolute lack of interest in such web sites on the part of those users, perhaps in hopes of luring a curious new customer for a web-based pay service. As a result, many users searching for information find themselves bombarded with unwanted solicitations to visit sexually- and\/or gambling-oriented web sites. By allowing gambling-oriented web sites and sexually-oriented web sites to be filtered from search results, the value of the search results provided by search engine  is significantly enhanced.","Junk text is nonsensical text, and style and quality manager  identifies junk text within a search listing. Junk text in a search listing produced as a search result can reflect poorly on search engine  and is therefore not allowed. Accordingly, style and quality manager  marks search listings associated with junk text immediately for rejection and for further review.","Germany requires that some terms be banned from web sites and other terms be indexed in web sites. Accordingly, if the subject search listing is applicable to the German marketplace as indicated in marketplace field  (), style and quality manager  () identifies banned and\/or indexed terms in the subject search listing. Detection of banned terms in the subject search listing result in immediate rejection of the search listing in the manner described herein with respect to blocked terms. In addition, detection indexed terms in the subject search listing results in marking of the subject search listing for manual editorial review in the manner described herein with respect to suspect terms.","In step  (), style and quality manager  () of editorial evaluator  also checks each search listing for format and style. For example, URL  () must specify a valid URL, e.g., a valid address of an existing web page in Internet . In addition, each field of search listing  has minimum and maximum field lengths and allowable data formats. Each field is checked by style and quality manager .","Style checking by style and quality manager  is described more completely below. Briefly, style checking involves rejection of search listings which include superlatives or contact information and undesirable style characteristics are automatically edited out of the search listing. For example, multiple consecutive instances of a punctuation mark (e.g., \u201cSale!!!\u201d) are replaced with a single instance (e.g., changed to \u201cSale!\u201d), some punctuation marks are removed altogether (e.g., *, !, {, }, [, ], <, >, |, \\, ^, =, and \u02dc), and an exclamation point ending a sentence is replaced with a period. Exceptions are provided in search database  for legitimate uses of punctuation marks in trade names such as \u201cYahoo!\u201d and \u201cE*TRADE.\u201d","A few other style characteristics are enforced in this illustrative embodiment. URLs are not permitted in title field  () and description field . Any URLs found there are replaced with only the domain name portion of the replaced URL. Title field  and description field  are properly capitalized in accordance with the grammar rules of the language in which the title and description are presented. It is preferred that acronyms are recognized and permitted to be in all capital letters and that unusually capitalized but otherwise legitimate proper nouns (e.g., \u201ceBay\u201d) are also recognized and permitted. In addition, \u201cInternet\u201d is edited to begin with a capital \u201cI\u201d and double spaces are removed and space inserted after punctuation where ever appropriate in accordance with the language in which search listing  is submitted. By enforcing such style requirements, the reputation of search engine  as providing a professional, high-quality service is maintained and the users' experience is improved thereby increasing use of, and therefore value of, search engine .","Thus, style and quality manager  of editorial evaluator  assesses the search listing for objectionable content such as blocked terms, suspect terms, sexual terms, gambling terms, junk text, and banned and indexed terms and enforces format and style requirements in step .","In step , relevance manager  assesses the search listing for relevance of the referenced information to the associated search term. Relevance manager  assigns a relevance score ranging from 0 to 100 wherein 0 represents no relevance at all and 100 represents perfect relevance. Relevance scoring by relevance manager  is described more completely below. Briefly, style and quality manager  verifies such things as (i) does the address of URL  actually refer to an existing document (i.e., is the address functional)?, (ii) is the search term of term field  contained within the web page referenced by URL ?, (iii) is the search term relevant to the web page referenced by URL ?, (iv) is the search term relevant to the title and description specified in fields \u2013?, (v) are the title and description relevant to the web page referenced by URL ?, (vi) is there adult and\/or gambling content within the web page referenced by URL ?, (vii) are the referenced information, title and description in a specific language, e.g., English?, and (viii) are there blocked and\/or suspect content on the referenced web page? In addition, style and quality manager  determines whether the referenced document modifies navigation interfaces as implemented by client computers A\u2013C in a manner determined by the provider of search engine  to be impermissible. For example, some documents can specify non-standard behavior of user interface mechanisms, such a \u201cback\u201d GUI buttons, to prevent a user from freely navigating the Web. In this illustrative embodiment, style and quality manager  disallows such navigational interference as a matter of policy and any search listings referencing such documents are rejected outright.","Once style and quality manager  and relevance manager  have determined in steps \u2013 the quality and relevance of the referenced web page, respectively, style and quality manager  and relevance manager  provide the results of those steps to search listing manager . Processing according to logic flow diagram  () transfers to test step  in which disposition manager  of editorial evaluator  determines whether manual or automatic editorial evaluation is appropriate for the subject search listing .","Step  is shown in greater detail as logic flow diagram  (). In test step , disposition manager  determines whether the subject search term, as identified by term field  (), mandates manual evaluation. In general, some search terms are sufficiently ambiguous and\/or sufficiently popular that manual evaluation is still warranted. In this illustrative embodiment, manual evaluation is mandated for search terms which have been searched at least  times in the prior month. In an alternative embodiment, manual evaluation is mandated for search terms which have been searched at least 1,000 times in the prior month. Of course, this threshold is illustrative only. The threshold can be increased or decreased to affect the proportion of search listings singled out for manual editorial evaluation. Search terms which have been searches fewer than the predetermined threshold number of times are identified as lower-volume search terms. Lower-volume search terms represent a lower-risk to the provider of search engine  of an unfavorable perception if an objectionable search listing for a lower-volume search term is included in search database  without manual editorial evaluation. Accordingly, the trade-off between processing efficiency versus careful and accurate assessment of search listings favors routing all search listings involving higher-volume search terms to manual evaluation. It should be appreciated that the specific predetermined threshold which identifies lower-volume search terms depends upon the respective values attributed to efficient analysis of submitted search listings and accurate assessment of quality of submitted search listing according to the business priorities of the provider of search engine .","If the subject search term mandates manual evaluation, processing transfers to step  in which step  determines that manual evaluation is appropriate. Accordingly, processing from test step  () transfers to step  in which the search listing is evaluated in a manual process in the manner described more completely below. Conversely, if the subject search term does not mandate manual evaluation, processing transfers to test step  ().","In test step , disposition manager  determines whether the subject search listing is of poor quality as determined in steps \u2013. Examples of poor quality in this illustrative embodiment include (i) search terms, titles, descriptions, and URLs which are outside a predetermined range of acceptable lengths; (ii) a maximum bid which is outside a predetermined range of acceptable values; (iii) a title or description which includes superlatives; (iv) a title or description which includes contact information; and (v) a search listing with a relevance score below a predetermined threshold. Other criteria could also be considered depending on the editorial guidelines for search listing approval. In this illustrative embodiment, the predetermined threshold relevance score is set at sixty (60). A search listing with a relevance score of less than sixty (60) is determined to be of poor quality. Furthermore, a search listing with a relevance score is less than a second, lower predetermined threshold (e.g., forty (40) in this illustrative embodiment), is marked for automatic rejection without any manual editorial evaluation.","If the subject search listing is determined to be of poor quality, manual evaluation is determined in step . Conversely, if the subject search term is not determined to be of poor quality, processing transfers to test step .","In test step , disposition manager  determines whether the subject search listing includes and\/or references objectionable content. Disposition manager  makes such a determination if any of the following conditions are met: (i) the subject search listing, e.g., search listing  (), is determined in step  to include blocked content, suspect content, adult content, gambling content, banned content, or indexed content or (ii) information associated with the subject search listing which is crawled for relevance analysis in step  is determined to include blocked content, suspect content, adult content, gambling content, banned content, or indexed content. It should be noted that junk text does not immediately disqualify the subject search listing for automatic evaluation in this illustrative embodiment and that other sets of requirements for determining objectionable content could be used as needed. If disposition manager  determines that the subject search listing includes and\/or references objectionable content, processing transfers to step  in which manual evaluation is selected. Conversely, if disposition manager  does not determine that the subject search listing includes and\/or references objectionable content, processing transfers to test step .","In test step , disposition manager  determines whether the URL of the subject search listing (e.g., stored in URL ) has ever been previously determined to reference information which includes blocked content, suspect content, adult content, gambling content, banned content, or indexed content. In this illustrative embodiment, banned and indexed content are only checked in the subject search listing is applicable to the German marketplace. If URL  has previously been determined to reference such objectionable content, processing transfers to step  in which manual evaluation of the subject search listing is selected. Conversely, if disposition manager  does not determine that URL  has previously been rejected, processing transfers to test step . Disposition manager  maintains a list of previously rejected URLs to detect re-submitted URLs in newly submitted search listings.","In addition to recording previously rejected URLs, disposition manager  maintains statistics regarding previous dispositions of previously submitted search listings by each party. Thus, if a particular submitter of search listings has a relatively high percentage of submitted listings rejected, newly submitted search listings can be routed for manual editorial review regardless of the assessed quality and style of the newly submitted search listings. The percentage of previously rejected search listings can be based on a simple ratio of total search listings rejected to total search listings submitted. Alternatively, the percentage can be weighted such that more recently submitted are given greater consideration than earlier submitted search listings, thus implementing a type of forgiveness for submitters of search listings who improve the quality of submitted search listings over time. Thus, a relationship between the number of search listings submitted by a particular submitter and the number of those search listings rejected serves as a measure of the trustworthiness of the submitter. Other measures of trustworthiness can include how long the submitter has been submitting search listings\u2014on the premise that long-time, return submitters are more trustworthy\u2014and the volume of search listings submitted, measured as either the total number of search listings submitted or the total value bid for all search listings submitted by the submitter.","As described above, the consequence of unusually poor trustworthiness of the submitter is mandated manual editorial evaluation. Relatively highly trusted submitters can benefit in several ways. Search listings submitted by relatively highly trusted submitters can be routed for abbreviated and\/or expedited manual editorial review if manual editorial review is determined to be warranted. Such abbreviated manual editorial review can omit various steps in the manual editorial evaluation process which can be considered redundant checks and\/or cross checks. Expedited manual editor evaluation is appropriate since relatively highly trusted submitters, by definition, tend to submit search listings which are appropriate and would have few, if any, policy and\/or style violations. Another way relatively highly trusted submitters can benefit is by provisional acceptance and inclusion in search database  of any submitted search listings pending manual review of the search listings if manual review is determined to be proper in the manner described herein. These benefits can also be combined such that search listings submitted by relatively highly trusted submitters are provisionally accepted and included in search database  pending subsequent abbreviated and\/or expedited manual editorial evaluation is manual editorial evaluation is determined to be warranted.","In test step , disposition manager  determines whether manual evaluation has been requested by the submitter of the subject search listing. In submitting search listings for inclusion in search database , the user submitting each search listing is provided with the opportunity to request manual editorial evaluation of the search listing. A user may make such a request if acceptance of the search listing is questionable and delay in including the search listing in search database  is to be avoided. Such a request is recorded in search listing  in manual evaluation requested flag . If manual evaluation is requested, processing transfers to step  in which manual evaluation of the subject search listing is selected as described below. Conversely, if manual evaluation has not been requested for the subject search listing, processing transfers to test step .","In test step , disposition manager  determines whether the marketplace for which the subject search listing is intended mandates manual evaluation. As described above, each search listing, e.g., search listing , is associated with a marketplace, e.g., marketplace . In this illustrative embodiment, a marketplace is a country, network, or other unit having a culture and\/or a set of laws specifying mores or other guidelines of propriety. In certain marketplaces, it is desirable to have all search listings carefully evaluated manually prior to inclusion in search database . For example, if a relatively new marketplace is served by search engine , it may take some time and experience to fully develop a list of blocked and suspect content for that marketplace. Diverting all search listings for that marketplace to manual evaluation allows that marketplace to be served prior to full development of a comprehensive list of block and suspect content to enable automated evaluation of search listing for that marketplace.","If a search listing is applicable to multiple marketplaces as indicated in marketplace field  (), the search listing is evaluated independently for each marketplace in which the search listing is applicable. Thus, is it possible that a search listing can be designated for manual editorial review based on applicability for one marketplace yet be designated for automated editorial review for another marketplace.","If disposition manager  determines that the marketplace of the subject search listing mandates manual evaluation, processing transfers to step  in which disposition manager  determines that the subject search listing is to be evaluated manually in step  (). Conversely, if disposition manager  () determines that the marketplace does not mandate manual evaluation, processing transfers to step  () in which disposition manager  determines that automatic analysis of the subject search listing as performed up to this point in processing is sufficient. Accordingly, upon determination in step  that automatic editorial evaluation is sufficient, the subject search listing is placed on-line, i.e., is included in search database  and is made available for presentation to a user as a resulting search listing in response to a search query. Thus, lower-risk, lower-volume search listings are processed very quickly and made available to the searching public in a very short amount of time and requiring very little human resources in approving such search listings for inclusion in search database .","Manual evaluation in step  involves human editors reading the various fields of the subject search listing and evaluating the subject search listing in view of predetermined editorial standards. Briefly, a human editor reads and evaluates the subject search listing for objectionable content as described herein. In particular, the human editor determines whether the search listing, or the information referenced by the search listing, includes blocked content and, if the search listing and\/or associated information includes suspect content, the human editor can determine whether the suspect content is excessively objectionable given the context of the suspect content. The human editor also determines whether the search listing and\/or associated information includes adult and\/or gambling content. If the search listing is categorized as including adult and\/or gambling content, inclusion of such content is not grounds for rejection of the search listing since proper categorization allows such content to be filtered by a user requesting a search. If the search listing includes junk text, the human editor determines whether the junk text is meaningless and\/or confusing in the context of the entirety of the search listing and associated information. In addition, if the search listing is targeted at a particular marketplace for which content is banned (e.g., Germany), the human editor determines whether the search listing includes such banned or indexed content.","The ultimate determination as to whether a search listing is to be accepted or rejected is based upon a set of editorial guidelines which are based in part on business objectives and marketplace notions of propriety. As such, the editorial guidelines depend upon the prevailing obligations regarding such notions and objectives of search engine . If a search listing is rejected by a human editor, the submitter of the search listing is notified of such rejection and is provided with reasons for the rejection by the human editor. The submitter is provided with an opportunity to re-submit the search listing after amending the search listing to overcome the reasons for rejection and\/or altering the style and\/or content of the site to be referenced by the subject search listing.","Quality Assessment","As described above with respect to step  (), style and quality manager  () analyzes the quality of the subject search term. To do so, style and quality manager  uses evaluation criteria  () which is a collection of databases and which is accessible to style and quality manager . Of course, evaluation criteria  are merely illustrative. Evaluation criteria  can be replaced with other criteria according to the particular content policies to be implemented and enforced within search engine . Processing by style and quality manager  in assessing quality of the subject search listing is illustrated in logic flow diagram  (). Initially within logic flow diagram , the subject search listing is marked\u2014within its search listing receipt\u2014as not rejected and for automated editorial evaluation.","In test step , style and quality manager  determines whether a blocked term or phrase is included in the search term, title, description, or URL of the subject search listing. Blocked terms and phrases are represented in block term database  (). In analyzing the search term itself, style and quality manager  compares both raw and canonical forms of the search term to blocked terms and phrases stored in blocked term database . As used herein, a canonical form of a word or phrase is the word or phrase as it appears in standard usage. If the search term of the subject search listing is non-standard, the raw and canonical forms will differ.","Style and quality manager  performs two distinct types of analysis in determining whether the search term represents a blocked term or phrase: sub-string comparison and token comparison. Which type of analysis is applicable is determined by the particular term or phrase and is predetermined and specified in each of the databases of evaluation criteria  ().","In both types of analysis, comparison by style and quality manager  is case\u2014and accent-insensitive. For example, the blocked term, \u201cincest,\u201d matches \u201cIncest,\u201d \u201cinCest,\u201d and \u201c\u00edncest.\u201d Sub-string analysis matches word or phrases which includes the blocked term as a sub-string. For example, \u201cfamilyincest,\u201d and \u201cincestisbest\u201d match the blocked term, \u201cincest.\u201d Similarly, unusual punctuation does not preclude matching of the blocked term; \u201c.ince.est.\u201d and \u201ci!n!c!e!s!t\u201d match the blocked term, \u201cincest.\u201d","Token analysis matches only whole words as delimited by a predetermined set of delimiters. In this illustrative example, the predetermined set of delimiters include white space (spaces and tabs and such) and the following characters: comma, period, semicolon, colon, apostrophe, quotation mark, exclamation point, at sign (\u201c@\u201d), pound sign, dollar sign, percent sign, ampersand, asterisk, carat, parentheses, underscore, hyphen, plus sign, equals sign, square and regular brackets, vertical bar (\u201c|\u201d), less-than sign, greater-than sign, question mark, slash (\u201c\/\u201d), accent (\u201c\u2018\u201d), and tilde. Token analysis is generally preferred for objectionable terms which can be sub-strings of unobjectionable terms. For example, \u201crape\u201d can be a blocked term, but \u201cgrape\u201d and \u201cscrape\u201d should not be blocked.","Style and quality manager  compares the search term, title, description, and URL of the subject search listing to blocked terms stored in blocked term database  according to the type of analysis specified for each term: either sub-string or token. If a blocked term is found in any of those fields, processing transfers to step  in which style and quality manager  marks the subject search listing for rejection. In step , style and quality manager  marks the subject search listing for manual editorial evaluation. If not blocked term is found in any of those fields of the subject search listing in test step , style and quality manager  skips steps \u2013 and the subject search listing remains unmarked for rejection and marked for automated editorial evaluation.","In test step , style and quality manager  determines whether the search term, title, description, or URL of the subject search listing includes a suspect term or phrase. Suspect terms and phrases are represented in suspect term database  of evaluation criteria . Analysis in test step  is analogous to the determination of included blocked terms described above with respect to test step . If the search term, title, description, or URL of the subject search listing includes a suspect term or phrase, processing transfers to step  in which style and quality manager  marks the subject search listing for manual editorial evaluation. The flag indicating whether the subject search listing is to be rejected is not affected and remains as set prior to test step . If the search term, title, description, and URL of the subject search listing are determined to not include a suspect term or phrase, style and quality manager  skips step .","In test step , style and quality manager  determines whether the search term, title, description, or URL of the subject search listing includes a sexual term or phrase. Sexual terms and phrases are represented in sexual term database  of evaluation criteria . Analysis in test step  is analogous to the determination of included blocked terms described above with respect to test step . If the search term, title, description, or URL of the subject search listing includes a sexual term or phrase, processing transfers to step  in which style and quality manager  marks the subject search listing for manual editorial evaluation.

The flag indicating whether the subject search listing is to be rejected is not affected and remains as set prior to test step . If the search term, title, description, and URL of the subject search listing are determined to not include a gambling term or phrase, style and quality manager  skips step .","In test step , style and quality manager  determines whether the search term, title, or description of the subject search listing includes junk text. The URL of the subject search listing is not checked for junk text in this illustrative embodiment. However, in an alternative embodiment, style and quality manager  includes the URL of the subject search listing in the analysis of junk text.","Various items of junk text are represented in junk text database  of evaluation criteria . Any match in that database found by style and quality manager  indicates that the search listing contains junk text and a positive condition is detected in test step . In addition, style and quality manager  compares the search term, title, and description of the subject search listing to the contents of comprehensive dictionary  of evaluation criteria . Comprehensive dictionary  represents all words from all search terms, titles, and descriptions stored in search database  (). If style and quality manager  is unable to match any word of the search term, title, or description of the subject search listing in comprehensive dictionary , style and quality manager  determines that the subject search listing includes junk text.","If the search term, title, or description of the subject search listing includes a gambling term or phrase, processing transfers to step  in which style and quality manager  marks the subject search listing for rejection. The flag indicating whether the subject search listing is to be manually evaluated is not affected and remains as set prior to test step . If the search term, title, and description of the subject search listing are determined to not include a gambling term or phrase, style and quality manager  skips step .","If the subject search listing is for the German marketplace, banned and indexed terms must also be checked. Otherwise, quality checking is complete. Thus, if quality and style manager  determines in test step  that the marketplace for the subject search listing is not Germany, processing according to logic flow diagram  completes.

In this illustrative embodiment, separate flags are maintained for each search listing for detected conditions. In particular, each search listing receipt includes flags for blocked terms, blocked URLs, suspect terms, suspect URLs, sexual terms, sexual URLs, gambling terms, gambling URLs, junk text terms, junk text URLs, banned terms, banned URLs, indexed terms, and indexed URLs. Flags for blocked, suspect, sexual, gambling, junk text, banned, and indexed terms indicate the presence of blocked, suspect, sexual, gambling, junk text, banned, and indexed terms or phrases in a search listing's search term, title, or description. Flags for blocked, suspect, sexual, gambling, junk text, banned, and indexed URLs indicate the presence of blocked, suspect, sexual, gambling, junk text, banned, and indexed terms or phrases in a search listing's URL. The use of separate flags facilitates representation to the submitter of the search listing the reasons for rejection of and\/or concern regarding the submitted search listing. Furthermore, maintaining flags specific to the URL of a search listing enables quick detection and analysis of other search listings for the same, objectionable web page.","Style Assessment","As described above, also with respect to step  (), style and quality manager  assesses the stylistic qualities of the subject search listing and enforces certain style rules upon the subject search listing. Processing by style and quality manager  in assessing and enforcing style of the subject search listing is illustrated in logic flow diagram  ().","In test step , style and quality manager  determines whether the title or description of the subject search listing includes superlatives. By disallowing superlatives in the titles and descriptions of search listings, inadvertent endorsements by search engine  are avoided. Style and quality manager  detects superlatives by finding matching entries in superlatives database  of evaluation criteria .","If style and quality manager  determines that the title or description of the subject search listing includes a superlative, processing transfers to test step  in which style and quality manager  determines whether any matching superlatives are permissible exceptions as represented in superlative exceptions database .

In this illustrative embodiment, algorithmic diagnostic tool  provides an application programming interface (API) by which relevance manager  deposits search listings with algorithmic diagnostic tool  for relevance analysis and later fetches results of such analysis from algorithmic diagnostic tool . Relevance manager  fetches results of relevance analysis when signaled by algorithmic diagnostic tool  that results are ready to be fetched.","Algorithmic diagnostic tool  is shown in greater detail in . HTML downloader  downloads web pages referenced by search listings for relevance analysis. HTML downloader  can crawl a web site, i.e., retrieve web pages recursively, to a predetermined link depth. If the link depth is one, HTML downloader  retrieves the web page referenced by the URL of the search listing and, at link depth one, all pages referenced by that web page. If the link depth is two, HTML downloader  retrieves all web pages referenced by web pages at link depth one. In this illustrative embodiment, the predetermined link depth is zero. Thus, only the web page referenced directly by the URL of a search listing is retrieved by HTML downloader . In addition, the link depth can specify that only links commonly hosted with the web page are traversed and analyzed. Specifically, only links having the same base domain name are analyzed. Thus, a web page is not penalized for lack of relevance of referenced documents provided by others.","HTML downloader  stores any retrieved web pages in a HTML cache  for later analysis. This enables HTML downloader  to schedule web page retrieval for times of relatively light network traffic and to avoid retrieving numerous web pages from a single one of host computers A\u2013D, thus avoiding excessive interference with the business of that host computer.","Phantom searcher  uses a conventional text searching technique for determining relevance scores for three relationships. The relationships involve the search term of a subject search listing, the title and description fields of the subject search listing, and the web page referenced by the URL of the subject search listing. Phantom searcher  uses Lucene, a known and conventional text searching engine which is part of the open-source Jakarta project associated with the Apache web server project.

Accordingly, phantom searcher  obtains a relevance score representing the relevance of the search term to the web page referenced by the search listing. As described more completely above, a search listing with a relevance score below a predetermined threshold, e.g., sixty, is of sufficiently questionable quality that manual editorial evaluation of the search listing is required. Furthermore, if the relevance score of the search listing is below a second, lower predetermined threshold, e.g., forty, the search listing is automatically rejected.","Phantom searcher  provides the title and description of the subject search listing and, as a reference text, the web page referenced by the URL of the subject search listing as stored in HTML cache  and performs relevance analysis using Lucene index database . Accordingly, phantom searcher  obtains a relevance score representing the relevance of the search listing's title and description to the web page referenced by the search listing.","It should be appreciated that there are various ways to score relevance of one text to another. However, in this illustrative embodiment, the following TFIDF (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency) formula is used to quantify relevance of one or more terms to a body of text represented as a document: \n\n","In equation (1), tfrepresents the square root of the frequency of the term t in the query. In particular, a given term can be present in a search query more than once. The square root of the term t in the document is represented by tf. The inverse document frequency idf is determined according to the following equation: \n\n","In equation (2), the number of documents is the total number of documents in the index database and document frequency is the number of documents in the index which include the term t.","Returning to equation (1), normis determined according to the following equation: \n\n","Returning again to equation (1), normrepresents the square root of the number of tokens in the document in the same field as the term t. Lastly, coord is determined according to the following equation: \n\n\nwhere termsrepresents the total number of terms in the query and document combined and termsrepresents the total number of terms in the search query.\n","Prior to relevance determination, both bodies of text to be compared, e.g., the search query and the web page associated with a search listing, are preprocessed to improve accuracy of relevance comparisons. The first step of the preprocessing is tokenization. Specifically, the body of text is divided into words delimited by white space and punctuation. The body of text is made case-insensitive by converting the entirety of the text to a uniform case\u2014e.g., lower-case in this illustrative embodiment. Stop words, i.e., those words which are commonly used but which carry little semantic meaning\u2014such as \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cof,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d etc., are removed from the text. Lucene's Porter Stemming mechanism is applied to the text to remove verb tense endings such as \u201ced\u201d and \u201cing.\u201d In addition, common spelling errors are removed and plural words are converted to singular form. Thus, the text is distilled such that the substantive content of the text is more easily comparable.","Phantom searcher  normalizes these three relevance scores to floating point values between zero and one and combines them using, in this illustrative embodiment, a weighted average. Of course, various weights and mathematical combinations can be used to arrive at an assessment of relative relevance. However, in this illustrative embodiment, the three relevance scores are normalized to a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0 prior to calculated a weighted average of the normalized scores. The specific weights used in this illustrative embodiment are (i) 2.0 for the relevance score between the search term and the referenced web page; (ii) 0.75 for the relevance score between the search term and the title of the search listing; and (iii) 0.5 for the relevance score of the title and description to the referenced web page.","To normalize the various relevance scores prior to forming the weighted average, phantom searcher  applies the following equation to each relevance score: \n\n","In equation (5), x represents the relevance score and f(x) represents the normalized relevance score which is between the values 0.0 and 1.0. C is a constant selected according to the distribution of x. In this illustrative embodiment, C is selected such that the average relevance score is normalized to the value 0.5. Using a measured average x (represented as x), C is determined by solving the following equation: \n\n","Lexical analyzer  improves accuracy of relevance scores determined by phantom searcher . In particular, if a search listing is determined by phantom searcher  to have a particularly low relevance score, lexical analyzer  collects semantic alternatives for the search term of the subject search listing and causes phantom searcher  to score relevance for the subject search listing using such semantic alternatives. In this illustrative embodiment, semantic alternatives include synonyms, hyponyms, and meronyms and are represented in dictionary . Dictionary  can be the known and conventional WorldNet lexical database of the English language and is not described further herein. Extended dictionary  is an extension of dictionary  and represents equivalency relationships between search terms as determined by search engine  and\/or by human providers of search engine . Extended dictionary  allows accuracy of relevance scores returned by algorithmic diagnostic tool  to be fine tuned and improved as experience analyzing search terms accumulates.","In this illustrative embodiment, lexical analyzer  analyzes semantic alternatives for the search term if the determined relevance is below a predetermined threshold, e.g., 0.25. In such cases, lexical analyzer  determines the relevance score of each synonym of the search term and adds the relevance score, weighted by 1.0, to the previously determined weighted average relevance score. If the new relevance score is at least the predetermined threshold, relevance analysis stops. Conversely, additional synonyms are analyzed in the same manner.","If all synonyms are exhausted and the cumulative relevance score is still below the predetermined threshold, lexical analyzer  adds weighted relevance scores of hyponyms of the search term to the cumulative relevance score in the same manner. A hyponym of a given word is a more specific version of the word. The relation of a term to a hyponym of the term is that of set to subset. For example, \u201ccar\u201d is a hyponym of \u201cvehicle.\u201d","If all hyponyms are exhausted and the cumulative relevance score is still below the predetermined threshold, lexical analyzer  adds weighted relevance scores of meronyms of the search term to the cumulative relevance score in the same manner. A meronym of a given word is a word that described a part or portion of the given word. The relation of a term to a meronym of the term is that of whole to part. For example, \u201cengine\u201d and \u201ctire\u201d are meronyms of \u201ccar.\u201d","If all meronyms are exhausted and the cumulative relevance score is still below the predetermined threshold, lexical analyzer  adds weighted relevance scores of related terms of the search term to the cumulative relevance score in the same manner. A related term is a much more subjective notion and generally connotes a common context. For example, a user interested in the term \u201cpregnancy\u201d is possibly also interested in the term \u201cbaby\u201d since the two terms share a context\u2014e.g., procreation.","Once all related terms of the search term have been analyzed, the resulting cumulative relevance score is considered final regardless of the relation of the cumulative relevance score to the predetermined threshold.","Page classifier  determines a probability that the web page referenced by the URL of the subject search listing includes sexual content and\/or gambling content. Probability scores for sexual and gambling content are maintained independently. Page classifier uses a probability-based, machine-learning, text classifier  for such analysis. In this illustrative embodiment, text classifier  is the known and conventional Rainbow program.","Algorithmic diagnostic tool  returns the probability values determined by page classifier  and permits relevance manager  () to set a threshold at which a web page is deemed to have sexual or gambling content. Page classifier  () sets a low-confidence flag for the subject search listing if the referenced web page includes media-rich content such as sound, video, and\/or images which are particularly difficult to analyze automatically.","In this illustrative embodiment, algorithmic diagnostic tool  is multithreaded such that various types of analysis of various search listings and associated web pages takes place concurrently.","The above description is illustrative only and is not limiting. The present invention is defined solely by the claims which follow and their full range of equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 5"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
