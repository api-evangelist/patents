{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Software applications are often written with one language for users in mind. Menus, dialogs, labels, and\/or other text shown by the application may be fixed in that language. By contrast, other applications are internationalized. Internationalization typically involves designing the application in a special way so that it may be adapted to different languages and regional variations.","The present disclosure relates to translation of applications that may be executed remotely. Internationalization of applications is costly, and many applications simply are not internationalized. Moreover, internationalization typically localizes or translates text in menus, buttons, labels, and\/or other well-defined user interface components. Images, audio clips, and videos are either not translated or produced manually and\/or separately for each language translation. By contrast, in various embodiments of the present disclosure, video and\/or audio generated by an application are captured and automatically translated in real-time. To this end, language recognition and translation techniques may be employed. The translated text and\/or audio may be presented in place of, or in conjunction with, the source text and\/or audio. Under approaches described herein, software developers do not have to make changes to their applications to facilitate internationalization. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments. The networked environment  includes one or more computing devices  in data communication with one or more clients  by way of a network . The network  includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks. Although a client-server architecture is described for the networked environment , it may be the case that the computing device  and the client  correspond to peers in a peer-to-peer architecture.","The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example, a plurality of computing devices  together may comprise a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device  is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores  as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store , for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and\/or functional entities described below.","The components executed on the computing device , for example, include a server application , a translation service , a plurality of wrappers . . . N, a plurality of applications . . . N, a plurality of media encoders . . . N, one or more media sources , and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The server application  may correspond to a game server application or another type of application session server. The server application  is executed to launch applications , which are executed within the wrappers . The server application  is also executed to obtain application input data  from the clients  and provide the application input data  to the respective wrapper .","The server application  is also executed to send application output data  that is captured from the application  to the clients . The server application  may communicate with the client  over various protocols such as, for example, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), simple object access protocol (SOAP), representational state transfer (REST), real-time transport protocol (RTP), real time streaming protocol (RTSP), real time messaging protocol (RTMP), user datagram protocol (UDP), transmission control protocol (TCP), and\/or other protocols for communicating data over the network . The server application  is configured to maintain state information  and input queues  associated with the executing applications .","The translation service  is executed in conjunction with the server application  to translate video and\/or audio signals generated by the applications  and\/or the media sources . In some embodiments, the translation service  may be configured to translate various forms of media streams that have been encoded by the media encoders . To this end, the translation service  may be configured to recognize text in a video signal, translate the text into a different language, and then incorporate the translated text in the video signal. The translation service  may also be configured to recognize speech in an audio signal, translate the speech into a different language, and then incorporate the translated speech into the audio signal. Where the video and\/or audio signals are generated by the applications , the applications  are thereby translated and localized without the developers having to internationalize the applications .","The application  may correspond, for example, to a game or other types of applications. As non-limiting examples, the application  may correspond to a first-person shooter game, an action game, an adventure game, a party game, a role-playing game, a simulation game, a strategy game, a vehicle simulation game, and\/or other types of games. The application  may be a game originally designed for execution in a general-purpose computing device or in a specialized video game device such as, for example, a video game console, a handheld game device, an arcade game device, etc. The applications  may also correspond to mobile phone applications, computer-aided design (CAD) applications, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) applications, photo manipulation applications, video editing applications, office productivity applications, operating systems and associated applications, emulators for operating systems, architectures, and capabilities not present on a consumer device, and other applications and combinations of applications.","The application  may expect to access one or more resources of the device on which it is executed. Such resources may correspond to display devices, input devices, or other devices. In some cases, the application  may request exclusive access to one or more of the resources, whereby no other applications may have access to the particular resources.","The wrapper  corresponds to an application that provides a hosted environment for execution of the application . In various embodiments, the wrapper  may be configured to provide a virtualized environment for the application  by virtualizing one or more of the resources that the application  expects to access. Such resources may include a keyboard, a mouse, a joystick, a video device, a sound device, etc. In this way, the wrapper  is able to provide input commands to the application  as if the wrapper  emulates a keyboard, a mouse, an accelerometer, a touch screen, or another type of input device.","Further, the wrapper  is able to obtain a video signal generated by the application  as if the wrapper  emulates a display device, an audio device, or another type of output device. The wrapper  is able to encode the video signal and\/or audio signal by way of a media encoder  into a media stream. To this end, the wrapper  may include various types of media encoders , such as, for example, Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) encoders, H.264 encoders, Flash\u00ae media encoders , etc. Such media encoders  may be selected according to factors such as, for example, data reduction, encoding quality, latency, etc. In some embodiments, the wrappers  may communicate directly with the clients  to obtain the application input data  and to serve up the application output data .","Different types of wrappers  may be provided for different applications  or classes of applications . As non-limiting examples, different wrappers  may be provided for applications  using different application programming interfaces (APIs) such as OpenGL\u00ae, DirectX\u00ae, the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), and so on. Where the application  is configured for execution in a specialized video game device or another type of computing device, the wrapper  may include an emulation application that emulates the device. In some embodiments, the output of the application  may be captured by the wrapper  at a device level. For example, the application  may be executed in a physical game console, and the video output may be captured by way of a video graphics array (VGA) connection, a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) connection, a component video connection, a national television system committee (NTSC) television connection, and\/or other connections.","The state information  that is maintained by the server application  includes various data relating to application sessions that are currently active. For example, the state information  may track the users that are currently participating in the application session, status information associated with the users, security permissions associated with the application session (e.g., who can or cannot join), and so on. In some embodiments, some or all of the state information  may be discarded when an application session ends. The input queues  collect input commands from the application input data  for a given application . The input commands may be reordered to a correct sequence and delays may be inserted between commands to ensure that they are interpreted correctly when presented to the corresponding application .","In one embodiment, one or more media sources  may be provided to generate video and\/or audio signals independently from an application . As a non-limiting example, the media source  may correspond to a video file, digital video disc (DVD), Blu-Ray\u00ae disc, three-dimensional (3D) video stream, holographic video stream, cable television stream, broadcast television stream, radio stream, images, and\/or other media streams. It is noted that an image processed by the translation service  may comprise one or more component images. Such component images may form a larger scene or may be another visual representation such as, for example, a 3D composite, holographic projection, etc. Accordingly, the server application  in conjunction with the translation service  may be employed to translate movies, television, radio programs, and other forms of streaming media in real-time. In other embodiments, the media source  may correspond to a presentation, such as a Microsoft\u00ae PowerPoint\u00ae presentation or other presentation, a portable document format (PDF) file, and\/or other media sources .","The data stored in the data store  includes, for example, applications , media encoders , wrappers , saved state data , user data , translation data , device interfaces , and potentially other data. The applications  correspond to a library of different applications that are available to be launched as applications . The applications  may correspond to executable code within the computing device . Alternatively, the applications  may correspond to code that is executable within another type of device but is not executable within the computing device . Such applications  may be referred to as \u201cbinaries,\u201d read-only memory images (ROMs), and other terms. A particular application  may be executed as multiple instances of the applications  for multiple application sessions.","The media encoders  correspond to the various types of media encoders  that may be employed in the computing device . Some media encoders  may correspond to specific formats, such as, for example, H.264, MPEG-4, MPEG-2, and\/or other formats. The wrappers  correspond to the executable code that implements the various types of wrappers . The wrappers  are executable in the computing device  and may be executed as multiple instances of the wrappers  for multiple application sessions.","The saved state data  corresponds to application states that have been saved by the applications . Because the applications  may be executed in a virtualized environment, the applications  may write state information to a virtual location, which is then mapped for storage in the data store  as the saved state data . The saved state data  may correspond to data saved normally by the application  or may correspond to a memory image of the application  that may be resumed at any time. The user data  includes various data related to the users of the applications , such as, for example, security credentials, application preferences, language translation preferences, billing information, a listing of other users that are permitted to join application sessions started by the user, and so on.","The translation data  corresponds to various data that may be employed to facilitate translation of media streams by the translation service . To this end, the translation data  may incorporate various mappings to and from various languages. It is noted that the languages may be localized languages for a given locale, e.g., United States English, United Kingdom English, and so on. The mappings between languages may incorporate simple dictionary-style word-based translations as well as more complex semantic-analysis rules to determine the correct translations in context. The translation data  may include data to facilitate text recognition, speech recognition, text generation, and\/or speech generation. For example, the translation data  may include fonts for text generation and voice samples for speech generation.","The translation data  may incorporate rules to facilitate translation of text to and from left-to-right styles, right-to-left styles, horizontal styles, vertical styles, and so on. Such style translations may be applied within a page or within multiple pages as applicable, e.g., for an electronic book reader to convert a book that is right-to-left formatted into a book that is left-to-right formatted. Additionally, the translation data  may facilitate recognition of systems of units and conversion between a system of units associated with a first language and a system of units associated with a second language. Such systems of units may correspond to currencies, the metric system, the United States customary system, and so on. For currency conversion and\/or other dynamic conversions, external data may be employed in the translation data .","The device interfaces  correspond to images, animations, code, hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), cascading style sheets (CSS), and\/or other data that may be used to generate a graphical representation of a virtualized computing device. It is noted that an application  that is executable on a particular computing device platform may be associated with a multitude of device interfaces . As a non-limiting example, the Android\u00ae platform for smartphones may be supported by a multitude of different models of smartphones. Some of the models may have mini-keyboards with a touchscreen, while others may have merely a touchscreen with no physical mini-keyboard. The models may have different controls and casings. Therefore, different device interfaces  may be provided for different models of Android\u00ae smartphones.","In some embodiments, multiple different device interfaces  may be used in conjunction with one wrapper . Where the emulated computing device does not include an integrated display, the device interface  may include a representation of an external display device showing video generated by the emulated computing device. Similarly, other non-integrated external devices that may connect to the emulated computing device (e.g., keyboards, mice, etc.) may be represented by the device interface .","The client  is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The clients  may be geographically diverse. The client  may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, set-top boxes, music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, electronic book readers, or other devices with like capability.","The client  may include a display . The display  may comprise, for example, one or more devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRTs), liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, gas plasma-based flat panel displays, LCD projectors, or other types of display devices, etc. The client  may include one or more input devices . The input devices  may comprise, for example, devices such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, accelerometers, light guns, game controllers, touch pads, touch sticks, touch screens, push buttons, optical sensors, microphones, webcams, and\/or any other devices that can provide user input. Additionally, various input devices  may incorporate haptic technologies in order to provide feedback to the user. The output devices  may correspond to the output sections of haptic input devices , vibration devices, buzzing devices, audio devices, indicator lights, seven-segment display devices, and so on.","The client  may be configured to execute various applications such as a client application  and\/or other applications. The client application  is executed to allow a user to launch, join, play, or otherwise interact with an application  executed in the computing device . To this end, the client application  is configured to capture input commands provided by the user through one or more of the input devices  and send this input over the network  to the computing device  as application input data .","The client application  is also configured to obtain application output data  over the network  from the computing device  and render a screen  on the display . To this end, the client application  may include one or more video and audio players to play out a media stream generated by an application . In one embodiment, the client application  comprises a plug-in within a browser application. The client  may be configured to execute applications beyond the client application  such as, for example, browser applications, email applications, instant message applications, and\/or other applications.","In some embodiments, multiple clients  may be employed for one or more users to interact with the application . As non-limiting examples, some clients  may be specialized in display output, while other clients  may be specialized in obtaining user input. It is noted that different clients  may be associated with different latency requirements which may affect a delay employed before providing input commands to the application . In some embodiments, the client application  may simply correspond to a media player to play out a media stream served up and translated by the server application  from the media source .","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  is provided. To begin, a user at a client  sends a request to launch an application  to the server application . The server application  obtains the corresponding application , media encoder , and wrapper  from the data store . The server application  then launches the application  in the corresponding wrapper . The server application  tracks the status of the application  within the state information . Various techniques related to applications  that are executed remotely are described in U.S. patent application entitled \u201cRemotely Emulating Computing Devices\u201d filed on May 24, 2011 and assigned application Ser. No. 13\/114,534, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The wrapper  provides a hosted environment for execution of the application . In some embodiments, the hosted environment may include a virtualized environment for the application  that virtualizes one or more resources of the computing device . Such resources may include exclusive resources, i.e., resources for which the application  requests exclusive access. For example, the application  may request full screen access from a video device, which is an exclusive resource because normally only one application can have full screen access. Furthermore, the wrapper  may virtualize input devices such as, for example, keyboards, mice, etc. which may not actually be present in the computing device . In various embodiments, the wrapper  may correspond to a virtual machine and\/or the wrapper  may be executed within a virtual machine.","The user at the client  enters input commands for the application  by using the input devices  of the client . As a non-limiting example, the user may depress a left mouse button. Accordingly, the client application  functions to encode the input command into a format that may be transmitted over the network  within the application input data . The server application  receives the input command, adds it to the input queue  for the application , and ultimately passes it to the wrapper . In some cases, the input command or a group of input commands may be translated from a form associated with one type of input device  into a translated form associated with a virtualized input device provided by the wrapper .","In some embodiments, other different input commands may be presented to the application  from those that were generated by a client . As a non-limiting example, if a user sends a mouse down command and the client application  loses focus, the wrapper  may be configured to send a mouse down command followed by a mouse up command. In various embodiments, the input commands may be relayed to the wrapper  as soon as possible, or the input commands may be queued by the wrapper  in the input queue  and relayed to the application  sequentially from the queue according to another approach.","Meanwhile, the graphical output of the application  is captured by the wrapper  and encoded into a media stream. Additionally, the audio output of the application  may be captured and multiplexed into the media stream. The graphical output and\/or audio output of the application  may be captured by hardware devices of the computing device  in some embodiments. The media stream is transmitted by the server application  to the client  over the network  as the application output data . The client application  obtains the application output data  and renders a screen  on the display . In some embodiments, a graphical representation of an emulated computing device is rendered in the client  according to a device interface , where at least a portion of the graphical output of the application  is rendered on the screen  of the graphical representation of the emulated computing device.","Subsequently, other users may join the application  and participate like the first user. A user may start an application  at one client  and continue the application  at another client . Furthermore, multiple users at diverse locations may participate in an application . As a non-limiting example, an application  may have been developed to be executed in one device with multiple game controllers. As another non-limiting example, an application  may have been developed to be executed in one device, where one side of the keyboard controls the first player and the other side of the keyboard controls the second player.","Where the input devices  incorporate haptic technologies and devices, force feedback may be provided to the input devices  within the application output data . As a non-limiting example, a simulated automobile steering wheel may be programmed by force feedback to give the user a feel of the road. As a user makes a turn or accelerates, the steering wheel may resist the turn or slip out of control. As another non-limiting example, the temperature of the input device  may be configured to change according to force feedback. In one embodiment, force feedback generated from the application input data  of one client  may be included in the application output data  sent to another client . Force feedback or other output data may be mapped to different output devices  of the client . For example, a vibration device of a virtualized smartphone may be mapped to an audio sample to be played out on another type of client  without a vibration device.","Because the client  is decoupled from the hardware requirements of the application , the application  may be used remotely through a diverse variety of clients  that are capable of streaming video with acceptable bandwidth and latency over a network . For example, a game application  may be played on a client  that is a smartphone. Thus, the client  need not include expensive graphics hardware to perform the complex three-dimensional rendering that may be necessary to execute the application . By contrast, the hardware of the computing device  may be upgraded as needed to meet the hardware requirements of the latest and most computationally intensive applications . In various embodiments, the video signal in the media stream sent by the server application  may be scaled according to the bitrate and\/or other characteristics of the connection between the computing device  and the client  over the network .","Translation of the video and\/or audio signals generated by the application  or video and\/or audio signals generated by a media source  may be provided in various embodiments by the translation service . Users may have the opportunity to specify a preferred language for translation and to enable or disable the translation. With video, the translation service  is configured to translate text recognized in the video in real-time. Because the translation service  may be hosted in a networked plurality of computing devices  under a utility computing model, significant computing resources may be available to accomplish the real-time translation. The translation service  may be capable of translating closed captioning for a video in the same way.","The translation service  may maintain the visual appearance of the original text or break the visual appearance of the original text in some scenarios. In maintaining the visual appearance of the original text, the translation service  may remove the original text (e.g., by interpolating nearby background pixels) and then replace the original text with the translated text. The translated text may be modified to fit in the screen  area consumed by the original text. The translated text may be in a font, color, font weight, etc. that is similar to the original text. For example, where the original text is Korean, the translated English text may mimic the style of Korean characters.","As a non-limiting example, the original text in Mexican Spanish may include a currency value such as a number of pesos. The translation service  may be configured to transform the currency value into United States dollars when the original text is translated into United States English. Similar conversions may be made with other localized systems of units. The translation service  may be able to translate a symbol of one currency into a symbol of another currency. For example, a dollar symbol may be translated into a pound symbol, a yen symbol may be translated into a euro symbol, etc.","As another non-limiting example, the application  may relate to an electronic book that is in Arabic and is read from right to left. In this example, the translation service  may perform semantic analysis on the video and translate the text into a left to right format. The style in which the translated text is presented may be altered from the original to facilitate ease of reading in the translated format. In some cases, translation may not happen in real time due to building a buffer for semantic and contextual analysis.","In some embodiments, the application  may generate an audio signal with speech that may be translated. In one embodiment, text corresponding to the speech may be obtained through an application programming interface (API) of the application  or other metadata associated with the application . In another embodiment, the speech may be recognized in real-time by the translation service . The speech may then be translated into the preferred language of the user and rendered in a translated format. The translated format may be presented to the user as subtitles to the video and\/or as translated speech in the audio signal. The translated speech may replace the original audio entirely, or the translated speech may be mixed in with the original audio.","In some embodiments, the application  may be configured to translate at least a portion of the input data obtained from the client  into the language associated with the application . Such data may include, for example, written or spoken communication from a user to another user of the application. Where the input data includes speech, the speech may also be translated into the language of the application .","Turning now to , shown is one example of a screen rendered in a client  () in the networked environment  (). In this example, the screen depicts the video output of an application  () that corresponds to a game where one is driving a vehicle. The application  is configured to use United States English as the original language. A status dashboard shows various statistics such as a score (\u201cScore: 3200\u201d), a speed (\u201cSpeed: 1 mph\u201d), and a fuel level (\u201cGas: 2.4 Gal\u201d). These statistics are presented as customized in the application  for the United States locale according to the system of units employed in the United States.","The game view shows a visual scene in the game application  where the player is currently located. In this case, the player is currently approaching a stop sign. The stop sign corresponds to a stop sign customarily seen in the United States, being an octagon bearing the letters \u201cSTOP.\u201d The game view may correspond, for example, to an entirely computer-generated scene, an actual video recorded at a location, a computer-generated scene incorporating samples from actual photos and\/or videos, etc.","Moving on to , shown is another example of a screen rendered in a client  () in the networked environment  (). In this example, the screen corresponds to a translated version of the screen () into Spanish as used in Central America. The video signal generated by the application  () has been translated by the translation service  (FIG. ). The status dashboard has been translated from what was seen in the status dashboard (). The score has been translated to read \u201cCuenta: 3200.\u201d The speed has been translated to read \u201cVelocidad: 1.6 km\/h.\u201d The fuel level has been translated to read \u201cGas: 9.1 L.\u201d It is noted that the gas and fuel level have been translated by the translation service  from the United States customary system of units to the metric system as associated with the Central American Spanish localized language.","In addition, text recognized in the game view has been translated. The stop sign of the game view () has been translated to read \u201cALTO.\u201d As shown in , the translated text of the game view and the status dashboard have been incorporated into the screen so as to maintain the visual appearance of the original text. For example, similar fonts, colors, text rotations, etc. may be employed. Also, the original text is deleted, and the translated text is superimposed on top of the former location of the original text. In other embodiments, the translation service  may be configured to translate the symbol of the stop sign, for example, from the octagon style to a circular style employed by other countries. In this way, the translation service  may convert a representation common to a first language or culture to a different representation common to a second language or culture.","The translation service  may be further configured to alter the translated text to fit within the screen space reclaimed from the original text by abbreviating the translated text, using an alternate translation, and so on. In some cases it may not be practical to replace the original text with the translated text. In such cases, the translated text may be presented in a subtitle, dialog, audio channel, or through some other approach which may break the visual appearance of the video signal.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the server application  according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of  provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the server application  as described herein. As an alternative, the flowchart of  may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the computing device  () according to one or more embodiments.","Beginning with box , the server application  obtains a user language preference from the client  (). Such a language preference may be stored in the user data  () or obtained in each session. In some cases, the user language preference may be determined automatically based on geolocation using a network  () address, a global positioning system (GPS) location of the client , stored address information, and\/or other data. The language preference may refer to a generic language or a localized version of a language.","In box , the server application  executes a selected application  () from the applications  () within the appropriate wrapper  (). In box , the server application  encodes the image signal and\/or audio signal generated by and captured from the application  into a media stream using one or more media encoders  (). The image signal may correspond to a video signal or a stream of images. In box , the server application  translates the media stream from an original language into the preferred language using the translation service  (). One example of such a media stream translation by the translation service  is given in the flowchart of . In some embodiments, the translation may be enabled or disabled in response to a user command sent from the client . Further, the preferred language may be modified by the user, and the original language in the source signals may be dynamically determined. In box , the server application  sends the media stream to the client  over the network  as application output data  ().","In box , the server application  obtains input data from the client  in the application input data  (). Such input data may, for example, correspond to input commands, text communications, audio communications, and\/or other forms of input data for the application . In box , the server application  determines whether at least a portion of the input data is to be translated. If at least a portion of the input data is to be translated, the server application  proceeds to box  and translates the input data from the preferred language into the original language of the media stream. The server application  then continues to box . If the input data is not to be translated, the server application  instead proceeds from box  to box .","In box , the server application  provides the input data to the application  via the wrapper . In various embodiments, the input data may be provided to the application  through one or more virtualized input devices of the wrapper . In box , the server application  determines whether more input data is to be obtained. If more input data is to be obtained, the server application  returns to box  and obtains the input data from the client . If no more input data is to be obtained, the server application  continues to box  and determines whether the session of the application  is to be ended. If the session of the application  is not to be ended, the server application  returns to box  and continues encoding the video signal and\/or audio signal generated by the application  into the media stream. Otherwise, the portion of the server application  ends.","Turning now to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the translation service  according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of  provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the translation service  as described herein. As an alternative, the flowchart of  may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the computing device  () according to one or more embodiments. Although the translation service  is described as performing both video and audio translation, either video or audio translation may be exclusively performed in some embodiments.","Beginning with box , the translation service  obtains the video from a media stream. In box , the translation service  obtains an image from a frame of the video. In box , the translation service  recognizes text contained in the image. To this end, the translation service  may detect the language of the text and\/or the format of the text. For example, the text may be formatted left-to-right, right-to-left, vertically, horizontally, etc. Instead of automatic detection, the translation service  may refer to metadata associated with the application  () in some circumstances. In box , the translation service  translates the source text into the preferred language of the user.","In box , the translation service  determines whether the visual appearance of the text is to be replicated in the image. If so, the translation service  moves to box  and replaces the source text in the image with translated text in a preferred language. To this end, the translation service  may remove the source text from the image by replicating or interpolating background areas into the screen area of the source text. The translated text may then be superimposed onto the area vacated by the source text. The translated text may be altered, e.g., with an abbreviation, alternate translation, etc., to fit into the space vacated by the source text.","The translated text may be rendered in a color, font, or other text style that is similar to the source text. Currencies, systems of units, symbols, and\/or other representations may be converted as appropriate given representations common to the localized languages. For example, colloquialisms in one dialect of a language may be translated into other words or phrases within a different dialect of the language. The reading style of the text may also be altered, e.g., right-to-left may be converted to left-to-right, etc. In some cases, the original reading style may be mimicked due to space constraints, e.g., a word written vertically in Japanese may be also written vertically in English, etc. The translation service  then proceeds to box .","If the translation service  instead determines in box  that the visual appearance of the text is not to be replicated, the translation service  instead moves from box  to box  and incorporates the translated text into a subtitle or other auxiliary display. As a non-limiting example, a dialog box may be provided at the bottom with the translated text. As another non-limiting example, subtitles may be superimposed in a bottom portion of the image or near or on the location of the source text in the image. In one embodiment, the translated text may be rendered as speech in an audio signal. The translation service  then proceeds to box .","In box , the translation service  determines whether there is another frame of the video to be processed. If there is another frame to be processed, the translation service  returns to box  and obtains an image from the other frame of the video. If there is not another frame to be processed, the translation service  proceeds from box  to box .","In box , the translation service  obtains audio from the media stream. In box , the translation service  recognizes speech in the audio. A language associated with the speech may be dynamically determined or determined through metadata associated with the application . In box , the translation service  translates the speech into the preferred language or another language. In one embodiment, the translation service  may convert the speech to text and then generate translated text from the text. In box , the translation service  generates audio from the translated speech using, e.g., a text-to-speech converter or other software. In box , the translation service  updates the media stream with the translated video and\/or audio. In one embodiment, the translated text and\/or audio is sent separately to the client  to be rendered separately by the client application  (). Thereafter, the portion of the translation service  ends.","With reference to , shown is a schematic block diagram of the computing device  according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
