title: Condensation polymers for antimicrobial applications
abstract: A number of cationic antimicrobial polymers have been synthesized by a condensation polymerization in bulk. The initial polymer formed has backbone tertiary nitrogens, which are subsequently quaternized using a suitable quaternizing agent (e.g., alkyl halide). The cationic polymers include polyamides, polycarbonates, polypolyureas and polyguanidiniums having a cationic repeat unit comprising the quaternary ammonium nitrogen as a backbone nitrogen. The cationic polymers can be active against Gram-negative, Gram-positive microbes, and/or fungi.

Most antimicrobial agents used in these products are small molecules, including anilides (e.g., triclocarban), bis-phenols (e.g., triclosan), biguanides (e.g., chlorhexidine) and quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., cetylpyridium chloride and cetrimide). Among them, triclosan is one of the most extensively used compounds. Triclosan is present in more than 50% of consumer products including soap, deodorant, toothpaste, mouth wash, cosmetics (e.g., Garden Botanika\u00ae Powder Foundation, Mavala Lip Base, Jason Natural Cosmetics and Movate\u00ae Skin Litening Cream HQ), cleaning supplies, kitchen utensils, children's toys, bedding, socks, shoes and trash bags. It is effective against Gram-positive bacteria, while it has little activity against (Gram-negative bacteria) and molds. At high concentrations, it is biocidal with multiple cytoplasmic and membrane targets. However, at low concentrations, it is bacteriostatic by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis. On the other hand, triclosan has cumulative and persistent effects on the skin. It was found in human breast milk and urine samples. At minimal concentrations of triclosan (<\u03bcg\/L) and chlorine (<mg\/L), common household tap water levels, triclosan can degrade to form toxic derivatives, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. Moreover, in sunlight and wastewater chlorine treatment, it also forms highly toxic carcinogenic dioxin-like compounds. After use, it is discharged into water. Triclosan was found in 85 out of 139 streams and rivers in 30 states in the US, and is toxic to aquatic species. It is persistent in the environment, and was detected in sediments in a Swiss lake as far back as the 1960s. Therefore, the use of triclosan in consumer products will be banned in Europe and in the United States within 2 years.","Many strains of bacteria spores (e.g., species), Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., mycobacteria) and Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., ()) have intrinsic resistance to the antimicrobial agents listed above. Moreover, these antimicrobial agents are not effective against biofilms. For example, () and () biofilms were found in disinfectant chlorhexidine solution, biofilm in iodophor antiseptics and on the interior surface of polyvinyl chloride pipes used in the production of providone-iodine antiseptics. Overuse of these antimicrobial agents has led to drug resistance in microbes. Major concerns include cross-resistance and co-resistance with clinically used antimicrobial agents, which may present a potential public health risk.","Most small molecule antimicrobial agents do not physically damage the cell wall, but rather penetrate the cell wall and act on specific intracellular targets. Consequently, bacterial morphology is preserved, allowing bacteria to easily develop resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been explored as an alternative. AMPs (e.g., magainins, alamethicin, protegrins and defensins) do not have a specific target in microbes. They interact with microbial membranes based on electrostatic interaction, inducing damage to the microbial membranes by forming pores in the membranes. The physical nature of this action prevents microbes from developing resistance to AMPs. Although efforts have been made to design synthetic peptides with various structures over the last two decades, high manufacturing cost has limited their application in personal care products.","A number of cationic polymers that mimic the facially amphiphilic structure and antimicrobial functionalities of peptides have been proposed that can be more easily prepared at low cost and on large scale compared to peptides. For example, antimicrobial polynorbornene and polyacrylate derivatives, and pyridinium copolymers were synthesized either from amphiphilic monomers (homopolymers) or from cationic (hydrophilic) monomer and hydrophobic comonomer (random copolymers). However, most antimicrobial polymers reported in the literature are non-biodegradable and\/or require several steps of synthesis. With the high volume of poorly degradable single-use consumer products already destined for landfills, the problem would be exacerbated by the addition of non-biodegradable antimicrobial materials that destroy bacteria and fungi responsible for slow landfill degradation.","A number of biodegradable cationic polycarbonates having high potency towards pathogenic microbes and low toxicity. These cationic polycarbonates degrade in aqueous solution especially in an alkaline environment which is often found in consumer care products. On the other hand, the synthesis of polycarbonates requires several steps like monomer synthesis, ring-opening polymerization and post-quaternization, which can translate into high consumer prices.","Currently, biodegradable, safe and cost-effective antimicrobial agents are needed for use in personal care products that can kill multidrug-resistant bacteria and fungi, remove biofilms, and prevent drug resistance.","Accordingly, a cationic polymer is disclosed, comprising:","a cationic repeat unit of formula (1):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"14.65mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US09580554-20170228-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"W\u2032 is a single bond or a divalent linking group having a structure *\u2014C(\u2550O)-L\u2032-*, wherein L\u2032 is divalent radical comprising 1-20 carbons and L\u2032 is linked to carbon 1,","L\u2032 is a divalent radical comprising 1-20 carbons,","Land Lare independent divalent hydrocarbon groups comprising 2-20 carbons, and","Q\u2032 is a divalent radical comprising a positive-charged nitrogen which is covalently bonded to 4 carbons, and","adjacent repeat units of the cationic polymer are covalently linked in a head-to-tail arrangement, wherein nitrogen labeled 2 is designated a tail and W\u2032 is designated a head.","Also disclosed is a method of killing a microbe, comprising contacting the microbe with an above-described cationic polymer.","Also disclosed is an antimicrobial composition comprising an above-described cationic polymer and at least one other chemical component.","The above-described and other features and advantages of the present invention will be appreciated and understood by those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, drawings, and appended claims.","The disclosed cationic polymers are biodegradable materials comprising cationic repeat units having at least one quaternary nitrogen in the polyamine backbone.

The polyamines can be biocompatible, biodegradable, non-hemolytic, and non-cytotoxic at concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and are therefore attractive for a wide range of consumer products such as, for example, cosmetics, skin lotions, and antibiotic drugs. The polyamines are capable of forming ionic complexes with anionic materials, making them potentially useful as carriers for gene and\/or drug delivery applications.","The term \u201cbiodegradable\u201d is defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials as degradation caused by biological activity, especially by enzymatic action, leading to a significant change in the chemical structure of the material.

The 96-well plate was then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for bacterial samples and room temperature for fungi samples under constant shaking of 100 rpm for 18 hours and 42 hours, respectively. MIC was regarded to be the least concentration where no observable microbial growth was detected by the microplate reader after the incubation duration. Broth containing only microbes was used as the negative control. Six replicates were tested for each concentration of polymer and the control.","Killing Efficiency Test","The same procedure as described for MIC measurement was used to determine the concentration of polymer that kills the microbes, and the microbial samples were inoculated and prepared accordingly. After incubating for 18 hours for bacterial samples and 42 hours for fungi samples, wells containing polymers at various concentrations of 0.0 MIC (0.0 times MIC), 0.5 MIC (0.5\u00d7MIC), 1.0 MIC (1.0\u00d7MIC), and 2.0 MIC (2.0\u00d7MIC) were collected individually and diluted through a series of tenfold. The diluted microbial solution (20 microliters) was streaked onto an agar plate (LB Agar from 1st Base). The plates were then incubated for 18 hours at 37\u00b0 C. for bacterial samples and 42 hours at room temperature for fungi samples. The colony-forming units on each plate were counted.","Killing Kinetics Test","The same procedure as described for the killing efficiency test was used to assess the duration time required for polymers to achieve 99.9 killing efficiency of microbes. Eight duration times of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 18 hours were selected, and the microbes were treated at 1.0 MIC and 2.0 MIC concentration of polymers.","For polymers P31a, P31c, P31a, P32a, P32b, P32d, P34a, P34b, P48a, P48b, P49a and P49b, TSB was used for all bacterial samples and YMB for fungi samples when assessing antimicrobial activities.","Hemolysis Assay","Fresh rat red blood cells (RBCs) suspension was diluted 25 times with PBS to achieve 4% v\/v blood content. Polymers were dissolved in PBS at various concentrations with a constant DI water concentration of 20% v\/v. Diluted blood suspension was treated with an equal volume of polymer solution and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. After centrifugation of the mixtures at 1000 g-force for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., 100 microliters of supernatant was transferred into a 96-well culture plate, with 4 replicates for each polymer concentration. The hemoglobin released was then measured using a microplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland) at 576 nm. Untreated RBCs suspension was used as the negative control while RBCs suspension treated with 0.1% Triton-X was the positive control. Percentage of hemolysis was calculated as follows:\n\nHemolysis (%)=[O.D.of the treated sample\u2212O.D.of negative control)\/(O.D.of positive control\u2212O.D.of negative control)]\u00d7100%\n\nIn Vitro Cytotoxicity\n","Cytotoxicity of polymers was investigated by MTT assay, where HDF cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 10cells per well, and cultured in 100 microliters of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 5% penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 4.5 g\/L D-glucose and 110 mg\/L sodium pyruvate, and incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% COfor 24 hours. Polymers were dissolved in the cell culture medium at various concentrations. The prepared solution (100 microliters) was then used to substitute the medium in each well. Each condition was tested in six replicates. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% COfor 6 hours. After 6 hours of treatment with the polymer, 100 microliters of fresh culture medium and 20 microliters of MTT solution (5 mg\/mL) were added to replace the solution in each well. The plates were then maintained at 37\u00b0 C., 5% COfor 4 hours. Dimethyl sulfoxide (150 microliters) was added to each well to dissolve the internalized purple formazan crystals after removing the medium. The absorbance readings of formazan crystals were taken to be the absorbance at 550 nm subtracted by the absorbance at 690 nm (TECAN, Switzerland). Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of absorbance of the control cells without any treatment.","Antimicrobial Activity","Antimicrobial activity of the polymers was assessed against four different microbes of clinical relevance: , and . The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all polymers were determined using the broth microdilution method, and were taken to be the lowest concentration where no observable microbial growth was detected by the microplate reader after the incubation duration with an initial microbial loading of 3\u00d710CFU\/mL. Toxicity of polymers was evaluated via the hemolysis assay with fresh rat red blood cells. Both MIC and 50% hemolysis (HC50) values of the respective polymers are listed in Table 3. Lower MIC and higher HC50 values are desirable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0276","num":"0276"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"154pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Amine",{},{},"MIC",{}]},{"entry":["Exam-","Polymer","Carbonyl","Amine","Monomer","ED-2003",{},"(mg L)","HC"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"12"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ple","Name","Monomer","Monomer","(mol %)","(mol %)","RX",{"i":"S.

microbes tested, without inducing significant hemolytic effect or toxicity towards the red blood cells. The respective killing efficiency of both polymers on Gram-positive , Gram-negative and fungi was then further evaluated. Using polymers P32c and P32d, each at a concentration of MIC or 2.0 MIC (2\u00d7MIC), at least 99.9% of bacteria were eradicated after 18 hours of incubation, and at least 99.9% of fungi were eradicated after 42 hours, as illustrated in the bar graphs of  (),  (), and  (). This result was also obtained in the case of multidrug-resistant , indicating the effectiveness of the polymers. The duration needed for the polymers to achieve 99.9% killing efficiency was also assessed using as the model microbes. As shown in  (overlapping pair of graphs), more than 50% of the bacteria were killed after 30 minutes exposure to 2.0 MIC concentration of polymers P32c and P32d. A killing efficiency of 99.9% was achieved within 4 hours and 2 hours of treatment at MIC concentration and 2.0 MIC, respectively. Based on this trend, the duration is expected to further decrease at increased concentration of each polymer.","The respective MIC values of polymers P48a, P48b, P49a and P49b against S. and P. were similar to those of P32c and P32d. The presence of JEFFAMINE, even at 10 mol %, did not appear to reduce the antibacterial activity of polymers. P48a without JEFFAMINE and P49b with 10 mol % JEFFAMINE were selected to test for killing efficiency against , P. and . The results are shown in  (series of bar graphs). The polyether chain of JEFFAMINE did not weaken the effectiveness of polymer against bacteria\/fungi. At least 99.9% of bacteria and fungi were eliminated after 18 hours incubation at MIC and 2.0 MIC concentrations.","Cell Viability","Through MTT assay, cytotoxicity of polymers P32c, P32d, P48a, P48b, P49a, and P49b was evaluated using the HDF cell line. The resulting cell viability is depicted in  (bar graph). Whereas P32c and P32d were effective against the microbes, they have shown to be toxic to the cells. Less than 80% cells remained viable after 6 hours of treatment with P32c at 31 mg\/L, and with P32d at 16 mg\/L. On the contrary, cell viability was clearly higher at these concentrations when the HDF cells were treated with the P48 and P49 polymers prepared with JEFFAMINE. In particular, even at 1000 mg\/L, more than 60% cells survived after treatment with P48b and P49b, indicating that the presence of JEFFAMINE significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of polymers, even at the high concentrations. This result demonstrates that the biodegradable polyamides are promising antimicrobial agents for use in consumer care products.","The polyamides of the 59 polymer series were similarly effective against the bacteria tested as compared to the polyamides of 48 and 49 series (P48a versus P59a, P49a versus P59c, P48b versus P59e). Polyamide P59d and polyurea P60a had low MIC values against , indicating that the urea groups in the backbone of the polymer might not adversely affect antimicrobial activity.","Antimicrobial polymers that were synthesized by condensation polymerization and quaternized show excellent water-solubility and potent antimicrobial activity against a panel of clinically relevant microbes including multi-drug resistant . The polymers contain amide bonds that remain intact in aqueous solution, including weakly alkaline environments, making them attractive for personal care products due to their longer shelf-life. On the other hand, the amide bond is enzymatically degradable, which avoids eco-toxicity. The use of succinate monomer improved cell viability at comparable antimicrobial potency relative to the 2-methylmalonate monomer (compare P48a with P32c in  at 250 mg\/L concentration). Further improvement in cell viability at comparable antimicrobial potency was obtained by the introduction of JEFFAMINE in an amount up to 10 mol % (compare P48a with P48b in  at 1000 mg\/L concentration).","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.
