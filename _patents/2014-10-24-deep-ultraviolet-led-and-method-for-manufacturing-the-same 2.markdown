There is also known a technique of replacing such a p-GaN contact layer with a p-AlGaN contact layer that is transparent to the deep ultraviolet rays, and further replacing the Au electrode with an Al reflecting electrode with high reflectivity, thereby improving the LEE (Light Extraction Efficiency) as well as improving the EQE (External Quantum Efficiency).","Non Patent Literature 1 and Non Patent Literature 2 report that, regarding the above technique, inserting a Ni layer, which is as thin as 1 nm and thus has suppressed absorption of deep ultraviolet rays, between the Al reflecting electrode and the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer to obtain ohmic contact therebetween was found to improve the LEE to 15% and also improve the EQE from 3.8% to 7%.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Patent Literature 1: WO2012\/127660 A","Patent Literature 2: JP 5315513A"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Non Patent Literature 1: Proceedings of the 60th Lecture Presentation in Spring of the Japan Society of Applied Physics (Spring 2013, Kanagawa Institute of Technology) 29p-G21-10","Non Patent Literature 2: CREST Research Area of the Strategic Basic Research Programs \u201cLight\/Photon Science and Technology toward Creation of New Function,\u201d Report on the termination of the research for a research subject \u201cResearch of 230-350 nm Band InAlGaN-based Deep Ultraviolet High-Efficiency Light Emitting Device\u201d (research period: October, 2007 to March, 2013)"]}},"However, when a transparent p-AlGaN contact layer is used, the forwarding voltage is increased by about 5 V as compared to when the conventional p-GaN contact layer is used. Thus, the wall-plug efficiency (WPE) deteriorates to 3%. This is estimated to be due to the reason that ohmic contact between the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer and the Al reflecting electrode cannot be sufficiently secured even if a Ni layer is inserted. Further, stacking the Ni layer while controlling the thickness thereof to as thin as 1 nm involves great technical difficulties, and thus has a great influence on the production cost and yield when producing products. Thus, improvement of the LED structure to obtain WPE at about an equal level to EQE is still a challenge to be achieved.","In response to such a background, Patent Literature 1 discloses improving the light extraction efficiency by providing an opening in the p-GaN contact layer, thereby causing a part of light from a light emitting layer that has passed through the opening to be partially reflected by a reflecting metal layer. However, the influence of absorption of light by the p-GaN contact layer other than the opening cannot be eliminated. That is, it has been basically impossible to control and suppress absorption of light by the p-GaN contact layer.","Meanwhile, in Patent Literature 2 that is related to an invention of the applicant of the present invention, the LEE is improved by forming one or more photonic crystals with a periodic structure that satisfies Bragg scattering conditions at an interface between two structures with different refractive indices at a given depth position of a light extraction layer. However, the embodiment of Patent Literature 2 is related to improving the LEE by forming the photonic crystal periodic structure in the light extraction layer and thus suppressing total reflection of light with the design wavelength at the interface. That is, Patent Literature 2 does not specifically disclose introducing a photonic crystal periodic structure for reflection purposes that is formed such that it penetrates a plurality of layers by giving priority to transmission of light with the photonic crystal periodic structure.","It is an object of the present invention to increase the light extraction efficiency of a deep ultraviolet LED while maintaining high power conversion efficiency thereof.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a deep ultraviolet LED with a design wavelength of \u03bb, including a reflecting electrode layer, a metal layer, a p-type GaN contact layer, and a p-type AlGaN layer that are sequentially stacked from a side opposite to a substrate, the p-type AlGaN layer being transparent to light with the wavelength of \u03bb; and a photonic crystal periodic structure provided in a range including at least an interface between the p-type GaN contact layer and the p-type AlGaN layer in a thickness direction. The photonic crystal periodic structure has a photonic band gap.","Regarding a decrease in the wall-plug efficiency (WPE) with an increase in the contact resistance, which becomes a problem when the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is improved by providing the p-type AlGaN layer and high-efficiency Al reflecting electrode, it is possible to lower the contact resistance and improve the wall-plug efficiency (WPE) by providing a p-type GaN contact layer, while it is possible to improve the LEE by providing a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure in the p-type GaN contact layer and the p-type AlGaN layer.","The reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure reflects light with the wavelength of \u03bb by having a photonic band gap. Thus, as the absorption of light by the metal layer and the p-type nitride semiconductor can be suppressed, the light extraction efficiency can be increased.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for manufacturing a deep ultraviolet LED, including a step of preparing a stacked structure with a design wavelength of \u03bb, the stacked structure including a reflecting electrode layer, a metal layer, a p-type GaN contact layer, and a p-type AlGaN layer that are sequentially stacked from a side opposite to a substrate, the p-type AlGaN layer being transparent to light with the wavelength of \u03bb;","a step of preparing a mold for forming a photonic crystal periodic structure, the photonic crystal periodic structure being provided in a range including at least an interface between the p-type GaN contact layer and the p-type AlGaN layer in a thickness direction;","a step of forming a resist layer on the stacked structure and imprinting a structure of the mold to the resist layer; and","a step of forming a photonic crystal periodic structure by sequentially etching the stacked structure using the resist layer as a mask.","This specification contains the descriptions of the specification and\/or drawings of the Japanese patent application JP 2014-043388 that serves as a basis for priority claim of the present application.","According to the present invention, it is possible to significantly improve the LEE while avoiding deterioration of the WPE.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. As an example, a deep ultraviolet LED structure of an AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet LED is shown that can prevent deterioration of ohmic contact by using a p-GaN contact layer (i.e., p-GaN contact layer) and a transparent p-AlGaN contact layer (i.e., p-AlGaN contact layer) in combination, thereby preventing deterioration of the WPE as well as improving the LEE without requiring thinness of a stacked metal layer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIGS. 1A"],"b":["1","2","3","4","5","100","3","4","100","1","101","3","4"]},"The columnar structure  is provided in the range including the interface between the p-GaN contact layer  and the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  in the thickness direction.","As shown in , a columnar structure may have a structure in which the structure does not reach the interface between the p-GaN contact layer  and the Ni layer . As shown in , a columnar structure may have a structure in which the structure does not reach the interface between the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  and the p-AlGaN layer . In addition, as shown in , a columnar structure may have a structure in which the structure does not reach the interface between the p-GaN contact layer  and the Ni layer .","That is, it is acceptable as long as the photonic crystal periodic structure is provided in the range including at least the interface between the p-type GaN contact layer  and the p-type AlGaN contact layer  in the thickness direction.","It should be noted that a photonic crystal periodic structure  shown in  shows a view of a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure that is formed such that it penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer  to the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer . (An)other layer(s) may also be included within the range that the relative order of the layer  to the layer  is unchanged. It should be noted that the transparent p-type nitride semiconductor contact layer  may typically be referred to as a p-type nitride semiconductor layer, and such p-type nitride semiconductor layer may combine the function of the p-AlGaN layer .","The photonic crystal periodic structure  or  is a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure in which triangular lattices, each of which includes circular holes with bottom surfaces, are repeated as unit structures on the planes of the stacked layers. It should be noted that the unit structures may also be other unit structures such as tetragonal lattices. The photonic crystal periodic structure is desirably formed on the entire planes of the stacked layers to improve the LEE, but may also be formed on a part of the planes.","The transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  may also be understood as a structure in which the thickness of a p-GaN contact layer, which absorbs light with the wavelength \u03bb, is partially replaced by a p-AlGaN contact layer that contains 50% Al and is transparent to light with the wavelength \u03bb. Herein, the term \u201ctransparent\u201d means that the transmissivity with respect to light with the wavelength \u03bb is greater than or equal to 95%, for example. As the Ni layer  strongly absorbs light with the wavelength \u03bb, it is desirable that the Ni layer  be ideally extremely thin, as thin as about 1 nm. However, the Ni layer  may also have a thickness of greater than or equal to about 10 nm by taking practicality into consideration.","The reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure  or  refers to a structure in which, as represented in , the depth h is ideally controlled so that the bottom surfaces of the circular holes are located at the interface between the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  and the p-AlGaN layer . It should be noted that the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  may combine the function of the p-AlGaN layer . In such a case, the bottom surfaces of the circular holes (i.e., depth h) may be located in the p-AlGaN layer .","Further, it is also possible to provide a LED structure in which a transmissive photonic crystal periodic structure is also formed on the light extraction surface side of a sapphire substrate , for example, in addition to the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure  or  in accordance with this embodiment. Such a structure may rather have improved LEE than a LED structure that has a single reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure formed therein.","According to this embodiment, regarding a decrease in the wall-plug efficiency (WPE) with an increase in the contact resistance, which becomes a problem when the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is improved by providing a transparent p-type nitride semiconductor contact layer and a high-efficiency Al reflecting electrode, it is possible to lower the contact resistance with the electrode by providing a p-GaN contact layer, while it is possible to improve the LEE by providing a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure.","A deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED in which the photonic crystal periodic structure described in the first embodiment is designed to satisfy the following requirements. That is, the photonic crystal periodic structure has transparent p-AlGaN and the air, which have different refractive indices, formed as two structures at the bottom surface, and satisfies Bragg scattering conditions represented by the following formula provided that the average refractive index of the structures is n(where nis the function of the period a and the radius R of the circular hole) and the period is a.\n\n=2\u2003\u2003(Formula 1)\n","Herein, the order m is an important parameter that is in the range of 1<m<5 and determines the radius R of the circular hole, the period a, and the processing depth h that maximize the LEE. Specifically, the order m at which the LEE is maximum is selected from the range using the FDTD method (a finite-difference time-domain method) described below. The range of the order m is limited herein for the following reason. That is, if m=1, the diameter of the pillar structure is about several 10 nm, which makes little difference from a differential spatial resolution of 20 nm that results when a computation model is discretized, without the need to conduct simulation with the FDTD method. Thus, m=1 may be excluded from the range as such a value is not determined to correctly reflect the shape of the actual periodic structure. If m=5, the period in the deep ultraviolet LED is about 400 nm, which greatly differs from the design wavelength of 280 nm. Thus, m=5 may be excluded from the range.","According to the second embodiment, it is possible to improve the LEE, which is difficult to be achieved with a periodic structure that only has a period a, which has about the same value as the design wavelength of the deep ultraviolet LED, and the radius R of a circular hole.","The deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED in which the parameters of the photonic crystal periodic structure with the photonic band gap described in the second embodiment are determined in accordance with the following procedures. That is, the band structure of the TE polarized components is analyzed by a plane wave expansion method using R\/a, which is the ratio of the radius R of the circular hole to the period a tentatively determined in advance, the design wavelength \u03bb, and the dielectric constants \u2208and \u2208of the two structures corresponding to the refractive indices nand nof the respective structures. Specifically, the dielectric constants \u2208and \u2208are input to the Maxwell's electromagnetic field wave equation (Formula 2) represented by the following formula, which has been obtained by expanding the plane wave with a wavelength of \u03bb by a magnetic field H, to compute eigen values in the wave number space and thus analyze the photonic band structure of the TE polarized components. Then, the photonic band gap is determined from the analysis results, and such determination is repeated hereinafter. Accordingly, one or more candidates of R\/a at which the photonic band gap is maximum is\/are selected from the tentatively determined R\/a.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0052"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","msup":{"mi":["G","\u2032"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":"\u025b","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"G","mo":"-","msup":{"mi":["G","\u2032"]}}}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["k","G"],"mo":"+"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"+","msup":{"mi":["G","\u2032"]}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mi":"H","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mi":["G","\u2032"]}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"},{"mi":"c","mn":"2"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"\/"}}},{"mi":"H","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"G"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Formula","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}]}}}}},"Herein, \u2208denotes an inverse number of a dielectric constant, G denotes a reciprocal lattice vector, \u03c9 denotes frequency, c denotes light velocity, and k denotes a wave number vector.","It should be noted that the photonic band structure of the TE polarized components is analyzed herein in order to cause light with the wavelength \u03bb from the light emitting layer to be maximally reflected by the interface to the light extraction surface side. This can be explained by the fact that the electric field of TE light will easily accumulate on the plane of the periodic structure at a connected portion of dielectrics that are provided in parallel with the plane of the periodic structure, and thus that light with the wavelength \u03bb will be reflected by the plane of the electric field due to Bragg scattering when the parameters of the periodic structure and the wavelength \u03bb satisfy the Bragg scattering conditions.","Further, the parameters of the photonic crystal periodic structure  or  are desirably parameters obtained by computing the period a and the radius R of the circular hole, which have been obtained from the selected candidate R\/a, and the processing depth h of the periodic structure with a period of greater than or equal to a, for each order m of the Bragg scattering conditions, conducting simulation on each parameter group using the FDTD method, and selecting from the simulation results an optimal combination of the order m, the period a, the radius R, and the depth h that most improves the LEE.","According to the third embodiment, TE light from the light emitting layer is reflected by the photonic crystal periodic structure. Thus, it is possible to increase the degree of freedom of selection of the types of the reflecting electrode layer and the metal layer and improve the LEE.","A deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the fourth embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED characterized in that the formation (processing) depth h of the photonic crystal periodic structure  or  described in the third embodiment is greater than or equal to the period a as a condition to obtain high LEE. It should be noted that as the depth h, the total thickness of the portion of the photonic crystal periodic structure that penetrates at least the p-GaN contact layer  and the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  is desirably greater than or equal to \u2154 of the period a, and more preferably, greater than or equal to the period a.","Even the depth h that is greater than or equal to \u2154 of the period a is effective as a reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure in view of the limitation of the processing accuracy due to the high aspect ratio. However, it is desirable to provide the depth h that is greater than or equal to the period a as in the fourth embodiment by overcoming the limitation of the accuracy using the production method described below.","According to the fourth embodiment, the effect of improving the LEE can be maximally extracted.","The deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the fifth embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED, characterized in that the photonic crystal periodic structure described in the fourth embodiment is the photonic crystal periodic structure  (reference numeral  of ) that penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer  to the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer .","According to the fifth embodiment, the photonic crystal periodic structure  can be formed at a time (in succession) such that it penetrates layers of from the reflecting electrode layer. Thus, the technical difficulty of forming the photonic crystal periodic structure in some of the layers in the LED can be avoided, thus enabling simplification of the production steps and cost reduction.","A deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the sixth embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED that has the deep ultraviolet LED structure described in the fifth embodiment and has a structure in which layers described below are sequentially and relatively stacked. That is, as exemplarily described above, the deep ultraviolet LED includes, from the substrate side, the p-AlGaN layer  as a p-type nitride semiconductor layer, the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  as a transparent p-type nitride semiconductor contact layer, and the p-GaN contact layer  as a contact layer on the metal layer side. The reflecting electrode layer and the metal layer can be obtained by, though not particularly limited thereto, combining an Al (or Au) reflecting electrode and a Ni (or Pd or Pt) layer. In particular, as the type of metal, metal whose adhesion to the inner wall of the circular hole can be suppressed is desirably used.","According to the sixth embodiment, a highly advantageous effect of improving the LEE of the deep ultraviolet LED can be expected to be achieved by adopting such a layer structure.","A deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the seventh embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED characterized in that the photonic crystal periodic structure  or  described in the first to sixth embodiments is formed by using a imprint technology of a nanoimprinting lithography method. The nanoimprinting lithography technology is an optimal process for forming a fine projection\/recess structure pattern on the order of nm to \u03bcm on the entire surface of a large substrate with a size of 8 inches, for example.","It should be noted that photoresist used in the imprint technology of the nanoimprinting lithography method should have high fluidity so as to closely fill a mold with a fine projection\/recess structure pattern. However, the fluidity will cause deterioration of the etching selectivity of the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer . Herein, the deep ultraviolet LED in accordance with the eighth embodiment of the present invention is a deep ultraviolet LED characterized by having a photonic crystal periodic structure formed by a imprint technology using a bi-layer resist method that can provide both high fluidity and high etching selectivity.","According to the seventh embodiment, a photonic crystal periodic structure designed in accordance with this embodiment can be accurately imprinted to resist in a large area in units of nm.

is clear from the tables and drawing, there is no big difference in the LEE rate of change depending on whether an Al electrode or an Au electrode is used when the other conditions are the same.

In this case, the radius R of the circular hole was set to 89.5 nm, the period a was set to 224 nm, and the depth h was set to 390 nm so as to allow the thickness of only a portion, which penetrates the p-GaN contact layer  and the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer , of the photonic crystal periodic structure  that is formed such that it penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer  to the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  to be greater than or equal to the period a as in the case where the order m of the Bragg scattering conditions is set to 4. The thickness of the p-GaN contact layer  was changed in increments of 50 nm in the range of 0 to 200 nm.","As is clear from Table 10, even when the order m is 3, it is considered that the advantageous effect of suppressing absorption of light by the p-GaN contact layer  due to the introduction of the reflecting photonic crystal periodic structure is expected to be achieved as long as the p-GaN contact layer  has a thickness that is less than about 50 nm.","The steps of specifically forming the photonic crystal periodic structures described in Examples 1 to 3 above using a nanoimprinting lithography method will be hereinafter described with reference to the drawings. Although an example of the photonic crystal periodic structure  shown in , which is formed such that it penetrates all layers of from the Al reflecting electrode layer  to the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer , will be described, the basic steps are the same even when the photonic crystal periodic structure  that penetrates both the p-GaN contact layer  and the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  is formed.","First, a mold for accurately reproducing the photonic crystal periodic structure  or , which has been designed with any of the methods described in Examples 1 to 3, in the plurality of target layers is created. For the mold, a resin mold  is desirably used so that it can follow the warp of the substrate and the layers stacked thereon, which would become prominent if the substrate size is increased.","It should be noted that photoresist used in the imprint technology of the nanoimprinting lithography method should have high fluidity so as to closely fill a mold with a fine projection\/recess structure pattern. However, the fluidity will cause deterioration of the etching selectivity of the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer . Thus, a bi-layer resist method, which can provide both high fluidity and high etching selectivity, is suitable for solving such a problem.","Specifically, an organic resist material such as novolac resin, which will improve the etching selectivity of the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer , is applied onto the Al reflecting electrode layer  by a spin coater or the like for the stacked structure of the deep ultraviolet LED in which layers of up to the Al reflecting electrode layer  have been stacked (), whereby an organic resist film  is formed. Further, silicon-containing resist with high fluidity is applied onto the organic resist film  to form a silicon-containing resist film  (). The thickness of the silicon-containing resist film  is controlled so as to favorably secure the mold release characteristics of the mold, taking into consideration the viscosity of the material and the like. Typically, the silicon-containing resist film  may be thinner than the organic resist film .","The photonic crystal periodic structure  or  designed in accordance with any of Examples 1 to 3 is imprinted to the silicon-containing resist film  using the resin mold  with the use of the nanoimprinting lithography method, the basic structure of which is shown in . It should be noted that a silicon-containing resist film remains in the recessed portions of the fine projection\/recess structure during imprint ().","Next, the silicon-containing resist film that remains in the recessed portions is etched by plasma  of oxygen-containing gas and fluorine-containing gas until the organic resist film  is exposed. At this time, the projection portions of the silicon-containing resist film  are also etched ().","After that, the silicon-containing resist film  is exposed to oxygen-containing plasma to form a silicon oxide film , and then, a region of from the Al reflecting electrode layer  up to the interface between the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  and the p-AlGaN layer  is etched at a time by chlorine-containing plasma  with the silicon oxide film used as a mask (). As the chlorine gas, Cl, BCl, or the like is used. Using the chlorine-containing plasma  can secure high selectivity of the transparent p-AlGaN contact layer  with respect to the mask. Thus, high-accuracy processing with a high aspect ratio is possible. Finally, the organic resist film  and the silicon oxide film are removed by ashing ().","Although this embodiment has illustrated an example of an AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet LED (Light Emitting Diode), it can also be applied to optical semiconductor light emitting elements made of other materials as long as such light emitting elements have similar structures.","1) When the film thickness of the p-GaN contact layer is about 200 nm, it is possible to totally reflect incident light and suppress absorption, and thus improve the total value of the LEE increase-decrease rate by 10% or more as long as the depth of the photonic crystal is greater than or equal to 1 period.","2) In the case of 1), the Ni layer can be formed as thick as about 10 to 30 nm. Thus, it is possible to obtain ohmic contact with the p-GaN contact layer, suppress an increase in the drive voltage, and drastically improve the WPE.","3) In the case of 1), the degree of freedom of selection of the reflecting electrode material is increased.","4) A nanoimprinting method that uses bi-layer resist can create a photonic crystal at a time such that it penetrates layers of from a reflecting electrode to a p-GaN contact layer. Thus, as it is not necessary to perform high-precision positioning such as a liftoff process for fine patterns, there is a significant advantage in the production cost.","A process, such as simulation, and control can be implemented by software processing with a CPU (Central Processing Unit) or a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) or by hardware processing with an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) or a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).","In the aforementioned embodiments, structures and the like that are shown in the attached drawings are not limited thereto, and can be changed appropriately within the range in which the advantageous effects of the present invention can be achieved. Besides, such structures and the like can be implemented by being changed appropriately within the scope of the objects of the present invention.","Each component of the present invention can be freely selected, and an invention with a freely selected structure is also included in the present invention.","It is also possible to record a program for implementing the function described in this embodiment on a computer-readable recording medium, and cause a computer system to read the program recorded on the recording medium and execute the program so as to perform a process of each unit. It should be noted that the \u201ccomputer system\u201d herein includes an OS and hardware of peripheral devices and the like.","In addition, the \u201ccomputer system\u201d also includes a website providing environment (or displaying environment) if the system uses a www system.","The \u201ccomputer-readable recording medium\u201d means a portable medium such as a flexible disk, a magneto-optical disk, ROM, or CD-ROM; or a storage device such as a hard disk incorporated in a computer system.
