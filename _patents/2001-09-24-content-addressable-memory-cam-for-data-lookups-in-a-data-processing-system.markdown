title: Content addressable memory (CAM) for data lookups in a data processing system
abstract: Power consumption is reduced in a content addressable memory of a data processing system or a data processor. The content addressable memory includes at least a first single bit storage (), a word line (WL), at least one bit write line (BLWT, BLWC) and a hit/miss line (H/M), and at least a first single bit compare circuit (), the first single bit storage including at least a first output (A; A) and the first single bit compare circuit including at least a first compare bit input (BLCT; CB ) and two field effect transistors (). In order to reduce the power consumption, the first output (A; A) of the single bit storage () is applied to the gate of only one, a first field effect transistor () of the two field effect transistors (). For an additional reduction of the power consumption, two single bit storages () are connected to a shared compare circuit (). In case of a mismatch, only one out of four compare nodes (C, C, C, C) of the shared compare circuit is switched high, i.e. changes its potential.

The single bit is written into the flip-flop  by addressing the flip-flop  via a word line WL and applying a low-level signal or a high-level signal to a bit line write true BLWT and the complement of the applied signal to the bit line write complement BLWC. The flip-flop comprises a P-FET , a P-FET , as well as an N-FET  and an N-FET . The word line WL switches an N-FET  and an N-FET  and one bit is clocked and stored in the flip-flop . After storing a 1-bit in flip-flop  node A comprises a high-level signal and node B comprises a low-level signal, while after storing a 0-bit, node A comprises a low-level signal and node B comprises a high-level signal.

Instead the single bit compare circuit  comprises an N-FET  and an inverter .","As in single bit compare circuit , the node A is connected with the gate of P-FET  and the node B is connected with the gate of P-FET . Accordingly, as shown in , node A is connected with only one gate of a FET as well as node B is connected with only one gate of a FET.","In the single bit compare circuit , shown in , the drain of the P-FET  is connected with the bit line compare complement BLCC, the drain of the P-FET  is connected with bit line compare true BLCT, and the node C is connected with the gate of N-FET , as in the single bit compare circuit , shown in FIG. . As shown in , the source of the P-FET  is connected with the high-level potential and the drain of the P-FET  is connected with the hit\/miss line H\/M, the hit\/miss line H\/M is connected with the source of the N-FET , the drain of the N-FET  is connected with the low-level potential (ground) and the gate of the N-FET  is connected with node C, as in the single bit compare circuit , shown in FIG. .

In the following the function of the single bit CAM circuit , shown in , will be described in detail. As in the single bit CAM circuit  of , for comparing, whether or not a compare bit CB  (0-bit or 1-bit; low or high-level signal) matches with the 0-bit or 1-bit stored in the single bit storage  of , the compare bit CB  is applied to the terminal , shown in FIG. . The compare bit CB  is inverted by the inverter  and applied to the bit line compare complement BLCC, while the output signal of the inverter  is applied to the input of the inverter  and the inverted signal of the inverter  is applied to the bit line compare true BLCT.","In contrast to the single bit CAM circuit , if the compare bit CB  matches with the bit stored in the single bit storage , the electric potential of the node C in  remains at the low-level (ground) potential as well as the hit\/miss line H\/M in  remains at the high-level potential (V).","In contrast to the single bit CAM circuit , in case that the compare bit CB  does not match with the bit stored in the single bit storage  of , the node C in  changes from the low-level potential (ground) to the high-level potential (V) as well as the hit\/miss line H\/M changes from the high-level potential (V) to the low-level potential (ground).","Before comparing the bit stored in the single bit storage  of  with another compare bit CB  or before storing another bit to be compared in flip-flop  of , a restore signal NREST comprising the high-level potential (V) is applied to the gate of N-FET  pulling the potential of the node C in  to ground, whereafter the node C comprises a low-level potential (ground).

Accordingly, each of them comprises a different bit line write true BLWT, a different bit line write complement BLWC but both comprise a common word line WL (not shown) for independently storing a single 0-bit or 1-bit in each of them. In addition, such as single bit storage  in  comprises the nodes A and B, the single bit storage  shown in  comprises the nodes A and B and the single bit storage  comprises the nodes A and B.","Each of the two P-FETs  and , the P-FETs  and , the P-FETs  and  and the P-FETs  and  are parallel connected, i.e. the sources are connected with each other as well as the drains are connected with each other. The drains of each of these P-FETs are connected with each other forming the node C. The connection of the sources of the P-FETs  and  forms the node C, the connection of the sources of the P-FETs  and  forms the node C, the connection of the sources of the P-FETs  and  forms the node C, and the connection of the sources of the P-FETs  and  forms the node C. The node C is connected with the output of the NOR gate , the node C is connected with the output of the NOR gate , the node C is connected with the output of the NOR gate  and the node C is connected with the output of the NOR gate . The first input of the NOR gate  is connected with the terminal  for applying a first compare bit CB  (0-bit or 1-bit) to the boarding , the second input of the NOR gate  is connected with the terminal  for applying a second compare bit CB  (0-bit or 1-bit) to the boarding . The first input of the NOR gate  is connected with the first input of the NOR gate  and the terminal  is connected with the second input of the NOR gate  via the inverter . The terminal  is connected with the first input of the NOR gate  via the inverter  and the second input of the NOR gate  is connected with the second input of the NOR gate . The first input of the NOR gate  is connected with the first input of the NOR gate  and the second input of the NOR gate  is connected with the second input of the NOR gate .","The node A of the single bit storage , i.e. the single bit storage  in , is connected with the gate of the P-FET  and the gate of the P-FET , the node B of the single bit storage  is connected with the gate of the P-FET  and the gate of P-FET , the node A of the single bit storage , i.e. the single bit storage  in , is connected with the gate of the P-FET  and the gate of the P-FET . The node B of the single bit storage  is connected with the gate of the P-FET  and the gate of the P-FET .","As in , the node C is connected with the source of the N-FET  and the gate of the N-FET . The terminal  is connected with the gate of the N-FET  and the input of the inverter , the drain of the N-FET  is connected with the low-level potential (ground), the drain of the N-FET  is connected with the low-level potential (ground), the source of the P-FET  is connected with the high-level potential (V), the gate of the P-FET  is connected with the output of the inverter  and the drain of the P-FET  is connected with the source of the N-FET  as well as with the hit\/miss line H\/M.","In the following the function of the boarding  will be described in detail. It is assumed that a 1-bit is stored in the single bit storage  as well as a 1-bit is stored in the single bit storage  in similar manner as described with regard to the single bit storage  of FIG. . Accordingly, the node A comprises a high-level potential (V), the node B comprises a low-level potential (ground), the node A comprises a high-level potential (V) and the node BD comprises a low-level potential (ground).","Furthermore, in a first non-limiting example a 1-bit (CB ) is applied to the terminal  and a 1-bit (CB ) is applied to the terminal . In other words, the bits to be compared and stored in the single bit storage  and the single bit storage  match with the compare bits CB  and CB . The node C, the node C, and the node C comprise the low-level potential, while the node C comprises a high-level potential as will be easily derived by one skilled in the art. As the high-level potential is applied to the gate of the P-FET  and to the source of the P-FET  (node C) as well as to the gate of the P-FET  and to the source of the P-FET  (node C), the node C as well as the gate of the N-FET  remains on its low-level potential and the hit\/miss line H\/M remains on its high-level potential (V), in case of a match.","Accordingly, none of the nodes A, B, A and B is loaded with driving the P-FETs  to .","Before applying a 0-bit (CB ) to the terminal  and a 1-bit (CB ) to the terminal  in a second non-limiting example, the low-level potential (ground) is applied to the terminal  (NREST) and the hit\/miss line H\/M remains on the high-level potential (V). When the 0-bit is applied to the terminal  and the 1-bit is applied to the terminal  and , the nodes C, C and C comprise the low-level potential (ground), while the node C comprises the high-level potential(V). Since the low-level potential (ground) is applied to the gate of the P-FET  and the high-level potential(V) is applied to the source of the P-FET  (node C) the P-FET  opens and pulls the node C to the high-level potential (V). Since the node C is connected with the gate of the N-FET , the N-FET  pulls the hit\/miss line H\/M to the low-level potential (ground) indicating that the compare bits CB  (0-bit) and CB  (1-bit) do not match with the bits to be compared and stored in the single bit storages  (1-bit) and  (1-bit).","Before applying another two bits to the terminals  and  to be compared with the bits stored in the single bit storages  and , the low-level potential (ground) is applied to the terminal  (NREST), which opens the N-FET  and pulls the node C as well as the gate of the N-FET  back to the low-level potential (ground). In addition, the restore signal (NREST) is inverted by the inverter  and the inverted signal (the high-level potential) is applied to the gate of the P-FET . The P-FET  opens and pulls the hit\/miss line H\/M back to the high-level potential.","Accordingly, only one node of the nodes A, B, A and B is loaded with driving the P-FETs  to .","In contrast, when using the known solution, shown in , for comparing two stored bits with two compare bits, eight FETs, when using the solution according to the invention, shown in , four FETs and when using the solution according to the invention, shown in , only one FET needs to be driven by a set of two single bit storages.","According to the inventive solutions, shown in , the significant reduction of FETs, which have to be switched, in order to perform a comparison of one or more compare bits with stored bits in a content addressable memory (CAM), allows to significantly reduce the power consumption, the noise generated by the switching of the FETs and enables to use longer hit\/miss lines. Thereby, a content addressable memory may be built, which comprises a significantly increased storage capacity, i.e. a \u201cbroader\u201d CAM, which nevertheless comprises a lower power consumption per bit and may be used in a data processing system and\/or in a data processor, such as a microprocessor, at a higher clock speed with regard to the known solution. The reduction of noise increases the reliability of a content addressable memory (CAM) according to the invention and reduces the negative impact of noise on other electronic components with regard to the known solution.","Summarized, for an additional reduction of the power consumption per bit to be compared with regard to the single bit CAM circuit , as shown in , two single bit storages, i.e. particularly two single bit storage cells, are connected to a shared compare circuit, i.e. particularly the two-bit compare circuit . In case of a mismatch only one out of the four nodes C, C, C and C is switched high, i.e. changes its potential.","The change of the potential of the node C of the boarding , as shown in , is slightly slower than the change of the potential of the node C of the single bit CAM circuit , as shown in FIG. . However, this is more than compensated, since the hit\/miss line H\/M of the boarding  is loaded only with the half of the number of N-FETs, i.e. two N-FETs i  and  instead of two times these N-FETs with regard to two single bit CAM circuits . This results in a change of the potential of the hit\/miss line HIM of the boarding , which is significantly faster than the change of the potential of the hit\/miss line H\/M of the single bit CAM circuit .","In addition, it should be noted that the combination of the inverter  and the P-FET  is only necessary once per hit\/miss line H\/M, instead of two combinations of the inverter  and the P-FET  with regard to two single bit CAM circuits .","It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the boarding of two single bit storages, as shown in , can be easily extended to a boarding, which comprises more than two single bit storages and more than a two-bit compare circuit, which also comprises the mentioned advantages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG.
