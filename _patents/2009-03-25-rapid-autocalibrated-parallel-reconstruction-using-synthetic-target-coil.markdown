title: Rapid auto-calibrated parallel reconstruction using synthetic target coil
abstract: In a rapid auto-calibrated partially parallel reconstruction method, the unaliasing process is approached by convolution. The image combination is performed on a low-resolution image matrix before unaliasing, and the unaliasing process is effectively performed once for a single synthetic target coil instead of for each individual coil.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/039,240, filed Mar. 25, 2008, whose disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. HL079110 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is directed to image reconstruction and more particularly to image reconstruction by generating an unaliased data set corresponding to a synthetic (i.e., virtual) coil.","Parallel imaging revolutionizes data acquisition in magnetic resonance imaging. SENSE is a well known image-domain-based parallel reconstruction method which is optimum in terms of SNR of the reconstructed image. However, SENSE requires knowledge of accurate RF coil sensitivity maps. Artifacts can appear if the estimated sensitivity profile is wrong.","GRAPPA is a coil-by-coil autocalibrated parallel reconstruction method. It has been shown that GRAPPA can achieve good image quality and suppress residual aliasing artifacts even when coil sensitivity profiles are difficult to acquire.","Parallel imaging can also be combined with non-Cartesian k-space sampling to achieve further scan time reduction or reduce image artifacts. Iterative SENSE reconstruction is effective in non-Cartesian parallel imaging but computation and memory intensive. GRAPPA has also been extended to non-Cartesian parallel imaging. These methods inherit the advantages of GRAPPA in Cartesian k-space sampling. Recently, Hu et al reported a GRAPPA-type autocalibrated partially parallel reconstruction method termed BOSCO which was successfully applied to spiral parallel imaging. BOSCO is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/785,734, filed Apr. 19, 2007, whose disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure. Similarly to GRAPPA, the unaliasing process in BOSCO is also carried out as a convolution operation. This process is performed coil-by-coil, and the final image is the combination of the unaliased coil images.","The coil-by-coil reconstruction was proposed in original GRAPPA largely because of its greater robustness to the phase cancellation problem compared to single coil autocalibrated approaches. However, coil-by-coil reconstruction has a computational disadvantage when a large number of coils are used for parallel imaging, since its reconstruction time grows as a square of the number of coils. Recently, the advance of hardware has permitted the application of large coil arrays having up to 128 receiver channels for improved performance of parallel imaging. The problem of computational load and memory limitations in image reconstruction due to the increased number of receiver channels has emerged.","It is therefore an object of the invention to address the problem of computational and memory limitations in image reconstruction due to the increased number of receiver channels.","To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention is directed to a new rapid auto-calibrated partially parallel reconstruction method. Similarly to GRAPPA-type reconstruction methods, the unaliasing process is performed by convolution. However, the image combination can be performed on a low-resolution image matrix before unaliasing, and the unaliasing process can be effectively performed once for a single synthetic target coil instead of for each individual coil, which results in significant computation reduction when a large number of receiver channels are used for data acquisition. Throughout the present specification, \u201clow-resolution\u201d should be construed to mean having a lower resolution than the image to be ultimately generated.","Compared to the existing partially parallel reconstruction methods, the main advantage of the present invention is its computational efficiency when a large number of receiver channels are used for data acquisition. In the present invention, the image combination is performed rapidly on a small matrix prior to the training and the unaliasing process, and the training and the unaliasing convolution only need to be performed once. By contrast, in GRAPPA and BOSCO, the training and the unaliasing process are performed for each individual component coil, and the final image combination is performed on a full resolution matrix size.","Currently a major limitation to non-Cartesian parallel imaging is its computational and memory intensity. BOSCO is a non-iterative k-space based non-Cartesian parallel imaging method. Therefore, it has a significant computational advantage compared to the iterative reconstruction methods, such as SENSE. However, the computational load of BOSCO is proportional to the number of receiver channels used for data acquisition. With the tendency to increase receiver channels in MRI systems for parallel imaging, BOSCO can become impractical for certain applications when computational time is critical, such as non-Cartesian real time imaging, without installing dedicated computational hardware. The present invention is expected to be a useful tool in such applications.","GRAPPA is an extension of AUTO-SMASH and VD-AUTO-SMASH. In AUTO-SMASH and VD-AUTO-SMASH, as well as the original SMASH technique, composite fully sampled low frequency k-space lines are formed for the data fitting. These composite k-space lines are usually the simple sum of the auto-calibration signal (ACS) lines acquired in each coil with phase calibration prior to summation, which results in problems of SNR degradation and phase cancellation in reconstructed images. In GRAPPA, this problem is addressed by performing unaliasing on each coil and forming the final image by combining individual unaliased coil images. By contrast, in the present invention, the problem is approached by forming a composite full FOV image prior to the unaliasing process, and the unaliasing is performed on a single synthetic (virtual) coil.","The unaliasing process in the present invention can be performed either in the image domain or the k-space domain. When performed in the image domain, the present invention can be combined with RIB reconstruction for region-by-region parallel reconstruction, which provides the advantage to optimize the reconstruction within an arbitrary region in image space. A certain choice of the basis functions and the size of region of interest can have advantages in particular applications. A preferred embodiment is disclosed herein using Fourier harmonics as basis function and full FOV as the region of interest when performing the process in the image domain.","The present invention provides a rapid, partially parallel reconstruction method for arbitrary k-space trajectories. This method is based on the principle that the unaliasing process in parallel imaging can be carried out by convolution with small kernels in k-space, as demonstrated by GRAPPA for Cartesian k-space sampling and BOSCO for non-Cartesian k-space sampling. In contrast to GRAPPA and BOSCO, in the present invention, the image combination is performed before the unaliasing process on a low resolution image matrix, and the unaliasing is performed only for a single synthetic target coil, which renders a significant computational advantage when a large number of receiver channels are used for data acquisition.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be set forth in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements or method steps throughout.","The original GRAPPA reconstruction method reconstructs the missing k-space lines by a linear combination of the neighboring acquired lines.

(11); examples of such basis functions are used in the above-noted BOSCO.","The convolution model of GRAPPA reconstruction works well for Cartesian partially parallel imaging. When data is sampled along Cartesian trajectories in k-space, the shift and direction between the missing lines and the acquired ACS lines are consistent throughout k-space. Therefore, the weighting coefficients estimated from the low-frequency region can be applied for reconstructing missing lines in the high frequency region. When data is acquired along non-Cartesian trajectories in k-space, however, this geometric consistency of the k-space sampling pattern does not exist anymore. Consequently, it is not straightforward to apply the GRAPPA convolution process for non-Cartesian partially parallel imaging.","In the above-noted. BOSCO, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to reconstruct the unaliased image using the convolution model described in Eq. (1) with small and non-constrained convolution kernels after gridding the k-space data onto Cartesian grids. Based on BOSCO theory, we can derive the same reconstruction process for non-Cartesian partially parallel imaging after the k-space data are interpolated onto Cartesian grids using gridding. Similarly to GRAPPA, BOSCO is a coil-by-coil reconstruction method where unaliasing is performed on each coil and the final image is the combination of unaliased coil images.

This is true if the following assumptions are satisfied: a) the weighting coefficients given in Eq. (3) are smooth in space, and b) the weighting coefficients given by Eq. (9) are smooth in space. Assumption a) is valid, since these coefficients generally reflect the sensitivity profiles, which are smooth in space.
