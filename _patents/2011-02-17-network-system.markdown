The UAN  and the HAN  may perform wired or wireless communication by means of a communication unit, and may perform two-way communication.","In this specification, the term \u201chome\u201d means not only a household as a lexical meaning but also a group in which specific components such as buildings or companies gather.

The energy consumption component may be the same component as the energy consumption component  or may be another component distinguished from the energy consumption component .","The energy generation component  may be a power plant as an example. The energy distribution component  distributes or transmits energy generated in the energy generation component  and\/or energy stored in the energy storage component  to the energy consumption component  that consumes the energy. The energy distribution component  may be a power transmitter, substation, sub-control center, or the like.","The energy storage component  may be a storage battery, and the energy management component  generates information for driving one or more of the energy generation component , the energy distribution component , the energy storage component  and the energy consumption component , related to energy.

In this embodiment, there is no limitation in the kind of the energy consumption component .","Specifically, the energy generation component  may be another component of the UAN , which generates energy to be supplied to the HAN . The energy management component  may be provided as a separate configuration or may be included in another component as an energy management function.","Specifically, the energy management component  that constitutes the UAN  or the energy management component  that constitutes the HAN  may be built in one or more of the plurality of components that constitute the networks  and , or may exist as a separate device. The energy management component  may recognize the information related to energy (energy information) and the state information of a component controlled by the energy management component .","The energy generation component , the energy distribution component  and the energy storage component  may be individual components, or may constitute a single component.

The energy generation components  and , the energy distribution components  and , the energy storage components  and , the energy management components  and , the energy metering components  and , the energy consumption component and the central management component  may independently exist, or two or more of them may constitute a single component.","For example, the energy management component  or , the energy metering component  or  and the central management component  may exist as single components so as to be configured as a smart meter, an EMS and a home server, which perform their functions, respectively. Alternatively, the energy management component  or , the energy metering component  or  and the central management component  may constitute a single system.","When a function is performed, it may be sequentially performed in a plurality of components and\/or communication units. For example, an energy management function may be sequentially performed in the energy management component, the energy metering component and the energy consumption component.","In the network system, a plurality of UANs  may communicate with a single HAN , and a single UAN  may communicate with a plurality of HANs .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Referring to , in the network system according to the present disclosure, a specific component  may receive information related to energy (hereinafter, referred to as energy information ) by means of a communication unit. The specific component  may further receive additional information (environment information, time information and the like) by means of the communication unit. In this instance, the information may be received from another component. That is, at least energy information is contained in the received information.","The specific component  may be a component that constitutes the UAN  or a component that constitutes the HAN . As described above, the energy information  may be one of information related to electricity, water, gas and the like. Hereinafter, information related to electricity will be described as an example of the energy information, but information related to other energy sources may be identically applied.","For example, the kind of information related to the electricity may include time-based pricing, curtailment, grid emergency, grid reliability, energy increment, operation priority, and the like.","The information may be divided into scheduled information previously produced based on previous information, and real-time information changed in real time. The scheduled information and the real-time information may be divided by whether or not predict information after the current time (in the future).","The energy information  may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the energy information  may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels. Also, the energy information  may be divided into time of use (TOU) information, critical peak pattern (CPP) information or real time pattern (RTP) information according to the change in the pattern of data with respect to time.","According to the TOU information, a data is changed step by step depending on time. According to the CPP information, a data is changed step by step or in real time depending on time, and emphasis is displayed at a specific point of time. According to RTP information, a data is changed in real time depending on time.","In a case where the energy information is time-based pricing information as an example, the time-based pricing information is changed. The time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels.","In a case where the specific component  receives a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal, one signal may be recognized as an on-peak signal, and the other signal may be recognized as an off-peak signal.","Alternatively, the specific component  may recognize information on at least one drive, which contains the time-based information, and may recognize an on-peak or off-peak signal by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information. For example, in a case where the specific component  recognizes information divided into levels or real pricing information, it recognizes an on-peak or off-peak signals by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information.","In this case, the value of the information on drive may be at least one of time-based pricing, electric energy, the variation of time-based pricing, the variation of electric energy, the average of time-based pricing and the average of electric energy. The value of reference information may be at least one of an average, the average between maximum and minimum values of power information during a predetermined period of time and the reference variation of power information during the predetermined period of time (e.g., the slope of consumed electric energy per unit time).","The value of reference information may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The value of reference information may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","In a case where the specific component  (e.g., the energy consumption component) recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased. The driving scheme of the specific component may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal posterior to the start of operation.","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output is maintained under an operable condition. In this case, the operable condition means that the value of the information on drive is less than a predetermined reference. The value of the information on drive may be time-based pricing, consumed electric energy, operation time, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The predetermined reference may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The predetermined reference may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. However, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total output amount of the specific component during the entire drive period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level. Alternatively, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total consumed power or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire operation period may be decreased as compared that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","The curtailment information is information related to a mode in which the specific component is stopped or a small amount of time-based pricing is taken. As an example, the curtailment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system. If the specific component  recognizes curtailment information, the output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased as described above.","The grid emergency information is information related to a power failure or the like. As an example, the grid emergency information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system. The information related to a power failure or the like has a relation with the reliability of a component using energy. In a case where the specific component  recognizes grid emergency information, it may be immediately shut down.","The grid reliability information is information related to the supply amount of electricity supplied or information related to the quality of electricity. The grid reliability information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be determined by a component (e.g., an electric home appliance) through the frequency of AC power supplied to the component.","That is, if a frequency lower than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is small (information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied). If a frequency higher than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is large (information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied).","In a case where the specific component recognizes shortage of the amount of electricity or poor quality of electricity in the grid reliability information, an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased. On the other hand, in a case where the specific component recognizes the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied, the output may be increased, or the operation may be converted from an off-state to an on-state.","The energy increment information is information related to a state that surplus electricity is generated because the amount of electricity used by a component is less than that of power generation. As an example, the energy increment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes energy increment information, the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Among the information related to energy, the on-peak information, the curtailment information and information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as high-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively expensive.","On the other hand, among the information related to energy, the off-peak information, the energy increment information and the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as low-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively cheap.","The information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information) may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component). That is, the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component into at least two or more.","As an example, in a case where the information related to energy is recognized as a Boolean signal, the time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component may be divided into two. In a case where the information related to energy is divided into a plurality of levels or recognized as real-time information, the time period or pricing period may be divided into three or more.","Meanwhile, the information related to energy cost corresponding to at least time may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component. That is, the information related to energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) or pricing zone (time period) into at least two or more. As described above, the divided time period or pricing period may be determined based on the kinds of the recognized information (the Bloolean signal, the plurality of levels and the real-time information).","In other words, the information related to fluctuation of energy cost may be recognized by dividing a determination factor for driving the specific component into two or more, and functions on time and energy cost may be included in the determination factor.","In a case where the information related to energy cost is divided into two levels or more, the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined according to the information divided into levels.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized information related to energy cost is not divided based on a specific reference (e.g., real-time cost information), it is compared with predetermined information, and the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined based on the compared result.","Here, the predetermined information may be reference information (e.g. reference value) for dividing the information related to energy cost, and the compared result may be whether not the information related to energy cost is more or less than the reference value.","Specifically, each of the kinds of information related to energy may be divided into first information  that is raw information, second information  that is refined information, and third information  that is information for performing the function of the specific component. That is, the first information is a raw data, the second information is a refined data, and the third information is a command for performing the function of the specific component.","The information related to energy is included a signal, and the signal is transmitted. In this instance, one or more of the first to third information may be transmitted several times while the content of the information is not converted but only the signal including the information is converted. For example, as shown in , a component that receives a signal including the first information may convert only the signal and transmit a new signal including the first information to another component.","Therefore, it is described in this embodiment that the conversion of signal is a different concept from the conversion of information. In this instance, it can be readily understood that when the first information is converted into the second information, the signal including the first information is also converted into the signal including the second information. However, the third information may be transmitted several times in the state that the content of the third information is converted or in the state that only the signal including the third information is converted while the content of the third information is identically maintained.","Specifically, in a case where the first information is raw information on time-based pricing, the second information may be refined information on the time-based pricing. The refined information on the time-based pricing is information in which the time-based pricing is divided into a plurality of levels or analysis information. The third information is a command generated based on the second information.","The specific component may generate, transmit or receive one or more of the first to third information. The first to third information are not necessarily transmitted or received in sequence. Only a plurality of pieces of third information without the first and second information may be transmitted in sequence or parallel. Alternatively, the first and third information may be transmitted or received together, the second and third information may be transmitted or received together, or the first and second information may be transmitted or received together.","As an example, in a case where the specific component receives the first information, it may transmit the second information or may transmit the second and third information. In a case where the specific information receives only the third information, it may generate and transmit new third information.","Meanwhile, in the relation between two pieces of information, one is a message and the other is a response for the message. Thus, each of the components that constitute the network system may transmit or receive a message. In a case where each of the components receives a message, it may respond to the message. Therefore, in the case of an individual component, the transmission of a message is a relative concept with the response for the message.","The message may include a data (first or second information) and\/or a command (third information).","The command (third information) may include a command for storing the data, a command for generating the data, a command for processing the data (including the generation of an additional data), a command for generating an additional command, a command for transmitting the additionally generated command, a command for transmitting a received command, and the like.","In this specification, the response for the received message means storage of the data, processing of the data (including generation of an additional data), generation of a new command, transmission of the newly generated command, simple transmission of a received command (including generation of a command for transmitting the received command to another component), operation, transmission of the stored information, transmission of an acknowledge message (acknowledge character or negative acknowledge character), or the like.","For example, in a case where the message is first information, the specific component that receives the first information may generate second information by processing the first information, or may generate the second information and new third information, as a response for the message.","The specific component that receives the message may provide a response related to energy. Here, the term \u201cresponse\u201d may be understood as a concept including an operation through which the specific component can perform a function. As an example, the HAN  may perform an operation related to energy by receiving a message.","The response (operation) related to energy, provided by the specific component, will be described in detail. For example, the specific component may be an energy consumption component. The energy consumption component may be driven so that the energy cost when it is driven based on the recognition for energy information is reduced as compared with that when it is driven without the recognition for energy information.","The specific component may include a plurality of modes in which it is driven to perform its own function. The plurality of modes are a first mode and a second mode in which energy cost is relatively saved as compared with that in the first mode. The specific component may be driven in at least one of the first and second modes. Here, the first mode may be a general mode and the second mode may be a power saving mode. Alternatively, the first and second modes may all be power saving modes.","The general mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed without recognition of energy information. On the other hand, the power saving mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed based on the recognition of energy information so as to save energy cost.","In a case where the first and second modes are power saving modes, the first mode may be specified as a driving scheme for saving energy cost and the second mode may be specified as a driving scheme in which the energy cost in the second mode is more saved than that in the first mode.","Meanwhile, in a case where the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component) is driven, at least a portion is recognized in a driving scheme including at least drive time and course. In this case, an unrecognized portion may be generated so as to save energy cost, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme.","For example, at least a portion of the driving scheme may be recognized under the control of the energy management component, the control of the energy consumption component, or the like. In a case where a specific driving scheme is further required so as to save energy cost, an unrecognized portion of the driving scheme may be newly generated, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme so as to save energy.","It will be apparent that the process of generating the unrecognized portion may be omitted. In this case, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme. On the other hand, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme may be omitted. In this case, the process of newly generating the unrecognized portion may be performed.","The drive time may include a drive start time or drive end time. The course may include a drive period of the specific component and the power of the specific component.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be a scheme recommended by the specific component so as to save energy cost. Here, the specific component may be an energy consumption component (control component) or the energy management component. As an example, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific drive time, the specific drive time may be converted into another time so as to save energy cost, and a specific course may be generated.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific course, the specific course may be converted into another course so as to save energy cost, and a specific time may be generated. Under the control described above, a change in time or power may be made with respect to the output function of the specific component based on time.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be performed within a set range. That is, in the process of recognizing at least a portion of the driving scheme, the generation or conversion of the driving scheme may be performed within a predetermined reference in which the recognized portion appears (e.g., restriction set by a user, constraint set under the control of the energy management component or energy consumption component, or the like).","Therefore, in a case where the set range is out of the predetermined reference, it is restricted to generate the unrecognized portion or to convert the recognized portion into another scheme.","Another embodiment is proposed.","Cost information may further included in the recognized driving scheme. That is, in a case where the cost information is recognized, a portion related to the drive time or course may be generated. The generated driving scheme may be recommended.","Meanwhile, a response of the specific component based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), e.g., a power control for power saving driving, may be performed. An output decrease (including an output of zero) or output increase may be included in the output control. It is as described above that the output is decreased or zero, maintained or increased based on the recognition for the information (on-peak or off-peak) related to energy cost.","If high-cost information is recognized, the output may be zero or decreased. Specifically, the output in the recognition of the high-cost information may be decreased as compared with that in the recognition of low-cost information. As described above, the decrease of the output may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the high-cost information is recognized posterior to the start of the operation of the specific component.","In a case where the output of the specific component is zero or decreased, the function to be performed by the specific component may be lost as compared with a normal case. Therefore, a response for restoring the lost function may be performed. As an example, after the output of the specific component is decreased, the specific component may be controlled so that the total operation time of the specific component is increased or so that the output is increased in at least a time period.","In other words, if specific reference information related to energy information is recognized in a period after the output of the specific component is controlled, the response for controlling the output may be released. Here, the term \u201cperiod\u201d may be divided based on a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized.","The total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a specific target in the process of performing the function of the specific component. As an example, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (washing machine, drying machine, cooking appliance or the like) intermittently driven (or driven in a specific course), the total operation time may be understood as a time until a corresponding course is completed.","On the other hand, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (refrigerator, water purifier, or the like) driven at normal times, the total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a target set for performing the function of the specific component. For example, the set target may be a target temperature, a target amount of ice produced, or a target amount of clean water in the refrigerator.","The total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time set before the output of the specific component is decreased. In a case where the output of the specific component is not decreased, the total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time of the specific component. However, although the total operation time of the specific component is increased, the specific component is controlled so that the total energy cost generated through the drive of the specific component can be saved as compared with that when the output of the specific component is not decreased.","If the high-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased. However, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total output of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated under a normal output. Alternatively, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total power consumption or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased as compared with that when the specific component is operated under the normal output.","If the low-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the driving of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output in a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Meanwhile, in a case of a specific condition (additional condition) is generated based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), the response of the specific component, e.g., the output control for power saving driving, may be limited. That is, the output of the specific component may be maintained. Here, the term \u201climitation\u201d may be understood as the release of the output control performed or not performed.","The specific condition includes a case where influence on energy cost is minute even though the output control of the specific component is not performed or a case where it is necessary to prevent a function to be performed by the specific component from being degraded when the output of the specific component is controlled.","Whether or not the influence on the energy cost is minute may be determined based on a predetermined reference (time-based pricing, power consumption or information on operation time). The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The case where the function to be performed by the specific component is degraded may be considered as a case where the specific component is a defrosting heater, for example.","In a case where it is controlled to decrease the output in a high-cost time period and to increase the output in the low-cost time period, the driving of the defrosting heater is more frequently performed than that during a normal time (setup period). In this case, the temperature of a storage room in the refrigerator is increased, and thus, the control of the output can be limited.","As still another example, in a case where the component includes a plurality of energy consumption components, the energy consumption components to be controlled may be differently selected according to the kind or state of the energy information or additional information. For example, the energy consumption components to be controlled may be differently selected according to the energy cost value or energy cost level. The reference information may include a first reference information and a second reference information greater than the first reference information. Alternatively, the reference information value may include a single value. For example, if the value of the energy information or additional information is greater than the second reference information value, the power of a first energy consumption component (function performing component that consumes energy) may be controlled (operation limitation). If the value of the energy information or additional information is between the first and second reference information values, the power of a second energy consumption component (function performing component that consumes energy) may be controlled (operation limitation). If the value of the energy information or additional value is smaller than the first reference information value, electricity may be stored in an energy storage component (the operation of a function performing component that stores energy may be started).","That is, any one of a plurality of control objects or methods may be selected according to the kind or state of the energy information or additional information.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component, the sum of powers of a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute the component and perform the same function may be decreased. The plurality of energy consumption components may be the same kind or different kinds from one another. In a case where the high-cost information is recognized, only some energy consumption components may be turned off, or the power of the some energy consumption components may be decreased. Alternatively, in a case where the high-cost information is recognized, the power of each of the power consumption components may be decreased while the plurality of power consumption components maintain an on-state. Alternatively, in a case where the high-cost is recognized, the power of the plurality of energy consumption components may be decreased with the same power amount or power reduction rate. Alternatively, in a case where the high-cost information is recognized, the power of the plurality of energy consumption components may be decreased with a different power amount or power reduction rate. Alternatively, in a case where the high-cost information is recognized, the plurality of energy consumption components may be alternately turned on and turned off.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component, among a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute the component, the function performance of one or more energy consumption components may be limited, and the function of another one or more energy consumption components may be performed. The power consumption of the energy consumption components of which function is limited is greater than that of the energy consumption components of which function is performed. For example, in a case where the high-cost information is recognized while a component with relatively high power is operated, energy consumption components with high power may be turned off, and energy consumption components with low power may be turned on.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component, the operation of energy consumption components that satisfy a limitation condition may be limited among a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute the component. In this instance, the limitation condition may be power consumption, energy used cost or limitation order. That is, among the plurality of energy consumption components, the operation of energy consumption components of which power consumption or energy use cost exceeds a reference value may be limited. Alternatively, the limitation condition may be power consumption that is relatively large among the plurality of energy consumption components.","As still another example, in a case where the operation mode of the component includes a plurality of processes, at least one of the plurality of processes may be limited in the section in which the high-cost information is recognized. The limitation means that the process is stopped or the power consumption in the performance of the process is decreased. For example, in a case where the component is a washing machine, the operation mode may be a standard course, quilt course, wool course or the like. The plurality of processes may include at least one of soaking, washing, rinsing, dehydrating and drying processes. The limited process may be automatically set, or may be manually set or changed.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component, two or more of a plurality of factors related to the operation of one or more energy components (function performing components) that constitute the component may be changed. The factor may include operation speed, operation time, power, operation rate and the like. If the value related to any one of two or more factors is decreased, the value of another factor may be increased.","As an example, when an energy consumption component is a motor, the rotation speed of the motor may decrease, and a rotation time may increase. When the energy consumption component is a heater, the output of the heater may decrease, and an operation time may increase. That is, when high-cost information is recognized, two or more factors associated with the operations of one or more energy consumption components may vary.","Alternatively, when the energy consumption component is a motor, the operation pattern of the motor may vary. Specifically, when the energy consumption component is a motor that rotates a drum included in a washing machine or a washer, the motor may rotate in one direction or another direction. In the case of a washing machine or a washer, the motor is controlled for laundry to be lifted and then dropped. A drum driving motion may be changed according to the rotation speed of the motor and a rotation angle in a specific direction. The drum driving motion may be divided into a general driving motion and one or more special motions (which have a rotation speed faster than the general motion or a large rotation angle in one-time rotation). Furthermore, the power consumption amount of the motor that is driven in the special motion is greater than the power consumption amount of the motor that is driven in the general motion. In this example, when high-cost information is reduced while the motor is being driven in the special motion, the washing machine or the washer may perform the general motion. When the high-cost information is recognized while the general motion is being performed, the washing machine or the washer performs a specific motion to be originally performed at a time when low-cost information is recognized.","As another example, the operation may be controlled based on the specific order of a plurality of components which may be operated with respect to energy. The specific order may be any one of the order of components which must be firstly operated, the order of operation start, and the order of energy consumption amount or energy usage cost. For example, the bigger the current energy consumption amount, the current energy usage cost, the energy consumption amount for a predetermined time, and the energy usage cost for a predetermined time are, it may be set at the latter order. Alternatively, the operation order may be manually selected by a user, and a plurality of the same or other species components may be set at the same order.","In a case where high-cost information is recognized during the operation of a plurality of components, the operation of the component in the last order may be limited. Alternatively, the operation of a plurality of components in the latter orders (components in a plurality of orders) may be limited. And, if low-cost information is recognized in the state where the operation of components is limited, the components with their operations limited may be again operated. The reference for limitation on operation may be any one of the number of operable components and available total energy consumption amount or total energy usage cost. At this time, the limitation on operation of components may be immediately performed. Alternatively, in a case where the operation of a component consists of a number of processes, the operation of the component may be limited after one process is completed. Alternatively, the operation of the component may be limited after high-cost information is recognized and a predetermined time is passed. Alternatively, after a component whose operation is to be limited has consumed a predetermined amount of energy or the energy usage cost reaches a certain level, the operation of the component may be limited. Information notifying that the operation is limited may be displayed in the display unit of a component with its operation limited. Alternatively, information notifying that the operation is limited may be displayed in the display unit of other component which may control the component.","As another example, only when the time for recognition of high-cost information (e.g., on-peak time) exceeds a reference time, the control may be performed for reducing the energy which the component has used. Alternatively, high-cost information is recognized, and then the control is immediately performed for reducing energy, and when the time for performing the control has passed a predetermined time, whether the high-cost information may be recognized for maintenance or change of the current state may be again determined. This is intended to prevent the method of operating the component from being often changed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0171"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"]},"Referring to , first and second component  and  that constitute the network system may perform wired or wireless communication by means of a communication unit .

Also, the control panel  further includes a temperature and time setting dial  for setting a cooking temperature and time and a selection button  for executing the set cooking temperature and time.","The temperature and time setting dial  may be manipulated to search functions such as automatic cooking, memory cooking, keeping warm, and so on. Also, whether the function is available according to the power supply type may be displayed through the display unit . In detail, the display unit  includes a mode display part  for displaying the current power supply type and the operating heating mode, a temperature\/time display part  for setting and displaying a heating temperature and a heating time, and an information display part  for displaying the power supply information and information of cooking modes limited in usage and available functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0504","num":"0503"},"figref":["FIG. 45","FIGS. 46 to 48"]},"Referring to , after a main power source of a cooker  connected to a power management network is pushed, the main power source of the cooker  is turned on by a user.","Here, in operations S and , a power supplied into the cooker  is supplied from a power supply source having the lowest supply price among a plurality power supply sources through an energy management component . Here, a supply amount of the power supplied as described above is not considered.","When the main power source of the cooker  is turned on, as shown in , power supply information including a power supply price and supply amount per a unit time in each power supply source is displayed on the information display part . Here, in operation S, the power supply information may be successively varied according to rotation manipulation of the mode setting dial .","When the user selects the power supply source through the above-described process, a power control circuit of a cooker power management unit  is selected according to the power supply amount. That is, when the power supply amount of the power supply source selected by the user is sufficient, the cooker  is operated in a normal mode in which all cooking modes can be performed without limiting functions.","As shown in , current time electricity charge and supply amount and next time electricity charge and supply amount of the currently selected power supply source are displayed on the information display part . An English initial \u201cN\u201d that informs the normal mode is displayed on the mode display part  to inform the operating of the cooker  in the normal mode to the user. Here, in operations s and S, the sufficient power supply amount represents that the power can be supplied until a cooking mode in which the longest time and maximal output are required in the automatic cooking mode of the cooker  is completely performed.","When the power supply amount of the power supply source selected by the user is not sufficient, the power supply type of the energy saving mode in which a portion of the cooking mode of the cooker  is limited by the cooker power management unit  may be performed.","As shown in , the cooking mode limited in usage is disposed on the information display part . Also, in operation S, an English initial \u201cE\u201d that informs the energy saving mode is displayed on the mode display part  to inform the operating of the cooker  in the energy saving mode to the user.","The heating mode limited as described above is limited in usage from the function in which a relatively longest output is required according to the supply amount of the power supplied from the selected power supply source. Thus, when the power supply type of the energy saving mode is performed in the cooker  according to an embodiment, roast cooking and grill cooking in which the power consumption is relatively high and the cooking time is required for a long time are firstly limited.","Thus, the user selects the power supply type of the cooker  in the energy saving mode when the roast or grill cooking is not frequently used to operate the cooker  using a power using a relatively low price in operations S and . Also, whether the main power source of the cooker  is turned off may be determined in operation S.","According to the embodiments, the energy source may be effectively produced, used, distributed, and stored to perform the effective management of the energy source.","According to the network system according to the embodiment, the energy source may be effectively produced, used, distributed, and stored to perform the effective management of the energy source. Therefore, the industrial applicability is significantly high.","Although embodiments have been described with reference to a number of illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art that will fall within the spirit and scope of the principles of this disclosure. More particularly, various variations and modifications are possible in the component parts and\/or arrangements of the subject combination arrangement within the scope of the disclosure, the drawings and the appended claims.
