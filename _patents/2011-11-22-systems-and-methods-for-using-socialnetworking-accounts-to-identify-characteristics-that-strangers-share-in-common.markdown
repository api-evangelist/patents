{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["In recent years, social-networking platforms (such as FACEBOOK, TWITTER, and LINKEDIN) have become popular with numerous Internet users. Such social-networking platforms may enable users to stay in touch with one another and\/or connect with new people. For example, a user of a social-networking platform may create a personal account (sometimes referred to as a profile) and add one or more other users of the social-networking platform to a list of friends associated with his or her personal account. In this example, once the user and the other users have become friends on the social-networking platform, these users may be able to view personal information associated with each others' personal accounts and potentially identify one or more characteristics that they share in common.","However, the process of becoming friends on such a social-networking platform may involve one or more obstacles that delay the users' ability to view each others' personal information. For example, a user of a social-networking platform may send a friend request to another user to initiate the process of becoming friends on the social-networking platform. The user may then need to wait for the other user to accept the friend request before the user is able to view the personal information associated with the other user's personal account. As a result, these users may be unable to identify characteristics that they share in common upon coming in contact with one another for the first time (e.g., at a work function, at a social event, or in an online forum).","In addition, some Internet users may choose to utilize only a limited number of social-networking platforms. Unfortunately, users of one social-networking platform may be unable to interact with users of another social-networking platform. As a result, these users (like those mentioned in the example above) may be unable to identify characteristics that they share in common upon coming in contact with one another for the first time. As such, the instant disclosure identifies a need for efficient and effective mechanism for enabling users of different social-networking platforms to identify characteristics that they share in common upon coming in contact with one another for the first time.","As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for using social-networking accounts to identify characteristics that strangers share in common. In one example, a computer-implemented method for using social-networking accounts to identify characteristics that strangers share in common may include (1) facilitating registration for a service capable of determining whether strangers who come in contact with one another share one or more characteristics in common, (2) obtaining, as part of the registration for the service, permission for the service to access at least a portion of one or more social-networking accounts associated with each of the strangers, (3) determining, subsequent to the registration for the service, that the strangers registered for the service have come in contact with one another, and then (4) providing the service to the strangers in response to this determination by (a) analyzing personal information about the strangers accessible via the social-networking accounts associated with the strangers, (b) determining, based on the analysis of the personal information, whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common, and then (c) providing characteristics information that indicates whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common to one or more computing devices associated with one or more of the strangers to facilitate presentation of the characteristics information to the strangers upon coming in contact with one another.","Examples of such characteristics that the strangers may share in common include, without limitation, a common friend, a common acquaintance, a common employer, a common profession, a common school, a common place of residence, a common online follower, a common person being followed online, a common religion, a common relationship status, a common political affiliation, a common conference, a common check-in location, a common association with a particular organization, a common association with a particular social-networking platform, a common business connection, a common musical interest, a common favorite book, a common favorite movie, a common favorite musical artist, a common favorite television show, a common favorite game, a common favorite activity, a common favorite athlete, a common hobby, and\/or any other suitable characteristics that the strangers may share in common.","In some examples, the method may also include obtaining one or more usernames and one or more passwords associated with the strangers' social-networking accounts. In such examples, the method may further include enabling the service to access the strangers' social-networking accounts by entering the usernames and passwords associated with the strangers' social-networking accounts. The strangers' social-networking accounts may represent a plurality of social-networking accounts associated with a plurality of different social-networking platforms (such as FACEBOOK, TWITTER, and LINKEDIN).","In some examples, the method may also include accessing the strangers' social-networking accounts to obtain the personal information and storing a copy of the personal information in a storage device associated with the service to facilitate analyzing the personal information. The method may further include implementing a data mining technique that provides at least a portion of the service and\/or a machine learning technique that provides at least a portion of the service.","In some examples, the method may also include parsing the personal information about the strangers into informational components and comparing the informational components parsed from the personal information about the strangers. In such examples, the method may further include identifying at least one pattern of informational components that is common to each of the strangers. In addition, the method may include configuring the characteristics information by (1) identifying the informational components that represent the common pattern and then (2) reforming the informational components that represent the common pattern to facilitate presentation of these informational components to the strangers upon coming in contact with one another.","In some examples, the method may also include determining that a computing device associated with a particular stranger is located physically proximate to a different computing device associated with a different stranger. In one example, the method may include using a transponder (such as a near field communication (\u201cNFC\u201d) technology, a radio frequency identification (\u201cRFID\u201d) technology, a contactless smart card technology, or a Bluetooth technology) associated with the computing device and a different transponder associated with the different computing device to determine that the computing device is located physically proximate to the different computing device.","In some examples, the method may also include receiving a communication manually initiated by at least one of the strangers that indicates that the strangers have come in contact with one another. In one example, the method may include detecting an in-person encounter between the strangers. In another example, the method may include detecting an online encounter between the strangers.","In one embodiment, a system for implementing the above-described method may include a registration module programmed to (1) facilitate registration for a service capable of determining whether strangers who come in contact with one another share one or more characteristics in common and (2) obtain, as part of the registration for the service, permission for the service to access at least a portion of one or more social-networking accounts associated with each of the strangers. The system may also include a service module programmed to (1) determine, subsequent to the registration for the service, that the strangers registered for the service have come in contact with one another and (2) provide the service to the strangers in response to this determination by (a) analyzing personal information about the strangers accessible via the social-networking accounts associated with the strangers, (b) determining, based on the analysis of the personal information about the strangers, whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common, and then (c) providing characteristics information that indicates whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common to one or more computing devices associated with one or more of the strangers to facilitate presentation of the characteristics information to the strangers upon coming in contact with one another.","In another embodiment, the above-described method may be encoded as computer-readable instructions on a computer-readable-storage medium. For example, a computer-readable-storage medium may include one or more computer-executable instructions that, when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, may cause the computing device to (1) facilitate registration for a service capable of determining whether strangers who come in contact with one another share one or more characteristics in common, (2) obtain, as part of the registration for the service, permission for the service to access at least a portion of one or more social-networking accounts associated with each of the strangers, (3) determine, subsequent to the registration for the service, that the strangers registered for the service have come in contact with one another, and then (4) provide the service to the strangers in response to this determination by (a) analyzing personal information about the strangers accessible via the social-networking accounts associated with the strangers, (b) determining, based on the analysis of the personal information, whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common, and then (c) providing characteristics information that indicates whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common to one or more computing devices associated with one or more of the strangers to facilitate presentation of the characteristics information to the strangers upon coming in contact with one another.","Features from any of the above-mentioned embodiments may be used in combination with one another in accordance with the general principles described herein. These and other embodiments, features, and advantages will be more fully understood upon reading the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","Throughout the drawings, identical reference characters and descriptions indicate similar, but not necessarily identical, elements. While the exemplary embodiments described herein are susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail herein. However, the exemplary embodiments described herein are not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the instant disclosure covers all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the appended claims.","As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for using social-networking accounts to identify characteristics that strangers share in common. The term \u201cstrangers,\u201d as used herein, generally refers to users of a service who do not know one another, or do not know one another very well. In addition, for purposes of simplicity, the terms \u201cstrangers\u201d and \u201cusers\u201d may be used interchangeably throughout the instant disclosure.","In one example, two or more strangers may register for a service capable of determining whether the strangers share any characteristics in common. As part of the registration process, the strangers may each provide permission for the service to access one or more of their social-networking accounts. After registering for the service, the strangers may meet one another for the first time at a social event and wonder if they have any mutual friends or share any common interests. The service may detect this in-person encounter between the strangers based on transponders integrated in the strangers' mobile devices. In response to detecting this in-person encounter, the service may access the strangers' social-networking accounts to analyze personal information about the strangers.","In one example, the service may determine, based on this analysis of the strangers' personal information, that the strangers have two mutual friends and both enjoy gardening. The service may generate characteristics information that identifies the strangers' mutual friends and common interests and then provide the characteristics information to the strangers' mobile devices for presentation to the strangers. By presenting the characteristics information to the strangers when they come in contact with one another for the first time, the service may help the strangers become instantly familiar with one another and provide a common-ground basis upon which the strangers may build a friendship.","The following will provide, with reference to , detailed descriptions of exemplary systems for using social-networking accounts to identify characteristics that strangers share in common. Detailed descriptions of corresponding computer-implemented methods will also be provided in connection with . In addition, detailed descriptions of an exemplary computing system and network architecture capable of implementing one or more of the embodiments described herein will be provided in connection with , respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","100","104"]},"The system may also include a service module  programmed to (1) determine, subsequent to the registration for the service, that the strangers registered for the service have come in contact with one another and (2) provide the service to the strangers in response to this determination by (a) analyzing personal information about the strangers accessible via the social-networking accounts associated with the strangers, (b) determining, based on the analysis of the personal information about the strangers, whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common, and then (c) providing characteristics information that indicates whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common to one or more computing devices associated with the strangers to facilitate presentation of the characteristics information to the strangers upon coming in contact with one another. Although illustrated as separate elements, one or more of modules  in  may represent portions of a single module, application, and\/or service (such as the service described herein).","In certain embodiments, one or more of modules  in  may represent one or more software applications or programs that, when executed by a computing device, may cause the computing device to perform one or more tasks. For example, and as will be described in greater detail below, one or more of modules  may represent software modules stored and configured to run on one or more computing devices, such as the devices illustrated in  (e.g., computing devices ()-(N), server , and\/or social-networking platforms ()-(N)), computing system  in , and\/or portions of exemplary network architecture  in .

For example, characteristics information  may indicate that two particular strangers who have come in contact with one another have two mutual friends and both enjoy gardening. Although characteristics information  generally represents information that identifies one or more characteristics that particular strangers share in common, characteristics information  may also, in some examples, represent information that indicates that particular strangers share no known characteristics in common.","Database  may represent portions of a single database or computing device or a plurality of databases or computing devices. For example, database  may represent a portion of server  in , computing system  in , and\/or portions of exemplary network architecture  in . Alternatively, database  in  may represent one or more physically separate devices capable of being accessed by a computing device, such as server  in , computing system  in , and\/or portions of exemplary network architecture  in .","Exemplary system  in  may be implemented in a variety of ways.

As shown in , system  may include computing devices ()-(N) and social-networking platforms ()-(N) in communication with server  via a network . In addition, social-networking platforms ()-(N) may collectively include social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N).","In one embodiment, one or more of modules  from  may, when executed by at least one processor of server , enable server  to use social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N) to identify characteristics that strangers share in common. For example, and as will be described in greater detail below, one or more of modules  may cause server  to (1) facilitate registration for a service capable of determining whether strangers who come in contact with one another share one or more characteristics in common, (2) obtain, as part of the registration for the service, permission for the service to access at least a portion of one or more social-networking accounts associated with each of the strangers, (3) determine, subsequent to the registration for the service, that the strangers registered for the service have come in contact with one another, and then (4) provide the service to the strangers in response to this determination by (a) analyzing personal information about the strangers accessible via the social-networking accounts associated with the strangers, (b) determining, based on the analysis of the personal information, whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common, and then (c) providing characteristics information that indicates whether the strangers share one or more characteristics in common to one or more computing devices associated with one or more of the strangers to facilitate presentation of the characteristics information to the strangers upon coming in contact with one another.","Computing devices ()-(N) generally represent any type or form of computing device capable of reading computer-executable instructions.

For example, registration module  may, as part of server  in , facilitate registration for a service capable of determining whether users of computing devices ()-(N) share one or more characteristics in common. In this example, users of computing devices ()-(N) may be strangers who do not know one another very well or even at all.","The systems described herein may perform step  in a variety of ways. In some examples, registration module  may provide a user interface accessible to the users of computing devices ()-(N) to enable the users to register (or sign up) for the service. In one example, registration module  may provide a website that facilitates registration for the service to the users of computing devices ()-(N) via network . In this example, the website may interface with registration module  via network  to enable the users of computing devices ()-(N) to transmit user input to registration module  as part of the registration process.","In another example, registration module  may provide a software application or plug-in capable of being downloaded by the users of computing devices ()-(N) to enable the users to register (or sign up) for the service. In this example, the downloadable software application or plug-in may interface with registration module  via network  to enable the users of computing devices ()-(N) to transmit user input to registration module  as part of the registration process.","In some examples, the user interface provided by registration module  may enable each of the users of computing devices ()-(N) to create, as part of the registration process, a personal profile associated with the service. For example, the user of computing device () may enter user input to create a username (e.g., \u201cJJOHNSON\u201d) and password (e.g., \u201cMYPASSWORD\u201d) associated with this service profile. In this example, registration module  may obtain the user input entered by the user of computing device () and create the user's profile for the service based on the user input.","As will be described in greater detail below, this service may be capable of determining whether strangers who come in contact with one another share any characteristics in common. Examples of such characteristics that the strangers may share in common include, without limitation, a common friend, a common acquaintance, a common employer, a common profession, a common school, a common place of residence, a common online follower, a common person being followed online, a common religion, a common relationship status, a common political affiliation, a common conference, a common check-in location, a common association with a particular organization, a common association with a particular social-networking platform, a common business connection, a common musical interest, a common favorite book, a common favorite movie, a common favorite musical artist, a common favorite television show, a common favorite game, a common favorite activity, a common favorite athlete, a common hobby, and\/or any other suitable characteristics that the strangers may share in common.","As illustrated at step  in , one or more of the various systems described herein may, as part of the registration process, obtain permission for the service to access at least a portion of one or more social-networking accounts associated with the strangers. For example, registration module  may, as part of server  in , obtain permission (whether implicit or explicit) for the service to access at least a portion of social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N) associated with the users of computing devices ()-(N). In one example, such permission may be implied by the users' attempts to register for the service. In another example, such permission may be explicitly obtained from the users as part of the registration process.","The systems described herein may perform step  in a variety of ways. In one example, registration module  may obtain one or more usernames (such as nicknames, screen names, and\/or email addresses) associated with social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N). In this example, registration module  may also obtain one or more passwords associated with social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N). By obtaining such usernames and passwords associated with social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N), registration module  may enable the service to access at least a portion of social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N) by entering the usernames and passwords in social-networking platforms ()-(N).","In a more specific example, a user of computing device () may enter his username (e.g., \u201cJOHNJOHNSON@EMAIL.COM\u201d) and password (e.g., \u201cMYPASSWORD\u201d) associated with social-networking platform () into the user interface provided by registration module . In this example, the user of computing device () may also enter a different username (e.g., \u201cJJOHNSON\u201d) and a different password (e.g., \u201cMYOTHERPASSWORD\u201d) associated with social-networking platform (N) into the user interface. Registration module  may then obtain the user's usernames and passwords via the user interface and store the usernames and passwords as part of registration information  located in database . Upon storing the user's usernames and passwords as part of registration information , registration module  may enable the service to access at least a portion of social-networking accounts () and () by entering the usernames and passwords in social-networking platforms ()-(N).","Although the above example demonstrates that usernames and passwords associated with a particular user may vary across different social-networking platforms, such usernames and\/or passwords may also, in some examples, remain identical across different social-networking platforms. For example, a user of computing device (N) may enter her username (e.g., \u201cJANEJACKSON@EMAIL.COM\u201d) and password (e.g., \u201cPASSWORD1\u201d) associated with social-networking platform () into the user interface provided by registration module . In this example, the user of computing device (N) may enter additional user input indicating that the same username and password also apply to her social-networking account associated with social-networking platform (N).","In one example, registration module  may provide certain terms and conditions for use of the service to the users registering for the service. For example, prior to obtaining the usernames and passwords associated with the users registering for the service, registration module  may provide a dialog box that displays the terms and conditions for use of the service to the users. In this example, the terms and conditions may explicitly request permission from the users to access social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N) as part of the service. The users may need to agree to such terms and conditions to qualify for the service and\/or to complete the registration process.","As illustrated at step  in , one or more of the various systems described herein may, subsequent to the registration process, determine that the strangers registered for the service have come in contact with one another. For example, service module  may, as part of server  in , determine that the users of computing devices ()-(N) have come in contact with one another. In this example, the users of computing devices ()-(N) may be strangers at the point in time that service module  determines that the users have come in contact with one another.","The systems described herein may perform step  in a variety of ways. In some examples, service module  may detect an in-person encounter between the users of computing devices ()-(N). For example, service module  may detect the in-person encounter by determining that computing device () is located physically proximate to computing device (N). In one example, service module  may receive at least one communication from at least one of computing devices ()-(N) via network . The communication received by service module  may indicate that computing devices ()-(N) are located physically proximate to one another.","In some examples, each of computing devices ()-(N) may include a transponder capable of transmitting communications to and\/or receiving communications from compatible transponders located within a particular operating range. In such examples, the service may use the transponders included in computing devices ()-(N) to determine that the users of computing devices ()-(N) have come in contact with one another. Examples of such transponders include, without limitation, NFC technologies, RFID technologies, contactless smart card technologies, Bluetooth technologies, and\/or any other suitable transponders.","In a more specific example, the users of computing devices ()-(N) may attend a particular social event and bring computing devices ()-(N) to the social event. While attending the social event, the users may bring computing devices ()-(N) sufficiently close to one another to facilitate communication between the transponders included in computing devices ()-(N). For example, the transponder included in computing device () may transmit (or broadcast) a communication capable of being received by the transponder included in computing device (N). The communication transmitted by the transponder may specify that computing device () transmitted the communication and\/or indicate that the user of computing device () is registered for the service.","In one example, the transponder included in computing device () may transmit the communication in response to user input. For example, the user of computing device () may manually enter user input that initiates transmission of the communication. In another example, the transponder included in computing device () may be configured to periodically transmit such a communication to facilitate detection of an in-person encounter between the user of computing device () and at least one other user registered for the service (e.g., the user of computing device (N)).","In one example, in response to receiving the communication, the transponder included in computing device (N) may prompt computing device (N) to transmit an additional communication to service module  via network . The additional communication transmitted by computing device (N) may indicate that computing devices ()-(N) are located physically proximate to one another. Service module  may receive the additional communication transmitted by computing device (N) and then determine, based at least in part on the additional communication, that the users of computing devices ()-(N) have come in contact with one another.","In another example, the transponder included in computing device (N) may transmit a reply communication to the transponder included in computing device (). The reply communication may specify that computing device (N) received the communication transmitted by computing device () and\/or indicate that the user of computing device (N) is registered for the service. The transponder included in computing device () may then receive the reply communication transmitted by the transponder included in computing device (N).","In this example, in response to receiving the communication, the transponder included in computing device () may prompt computing device () to transmit a further communication to service module  via network . The further communication transmitted by computing device () may indicate (similar to the additional communication described above) that computing devices ()-(N) are located physically proximate to one another. Service module  may receive the further communication transmitted by computing device () and then determine, based at least in part on the further communication, that the users of computing devices ()-(N) have come in contact with one another.","In some examples, service module  may detect an online encounter between the users of computing devices ()-(N). In one example, service module  may detect the online encounter by receiving a manually initiated communication indicating that the users of computing devices ()-(N) have come in contact with one another in an online forum (such as a message board or chat room). For example, the user of computing device () may meet the user of computing device (N) in an online chat room hosted by CHATROULLETTE.COM. In this example, while chatting in the online chat room hosted by CHATROULETTE.COM, the user of computing device () may obtain sufficient information about the user of computing device (N) (e.g., the username associated with the user's profile for the service) to identify the user of computing device (N) to service module .","Upon obtaining such information about the user of computing device (N) in the online chat room, the user of computing device () may manually initiate transmission of a communication to service module  via network . The manually initiated communication may indicate that the users of computing devices ()-(N) have come in contact with one another in an online forum. Service module  may receive the manually initiated communication and then determine, based at least in part on the manually initiated communication, that the users of computing devices ()-(N) have come in contact with one another.","The users of computing devices ()-(N) may have varying degrees of familiarity with one another at the point in time that service module  determines that the users have come in contact with one another. In some examples, the users of computing devices ()-(N) may not know one another at all at the point in time that service module  determines that the users have come in contact with one another. For example, the users of computing devices ()-(N) may be coming in contact with one another for the first time on this occasion. In one example, the users of computing devices ()-(N) may have never heard of one another prior to coming in contact with one another on this occasion. In another example, the users of computing devices ()-(N) may have heard of one another but never come in contact with one another prior to this occasion.","In other examples, the users of computing devices ()-(N) may be at least somewhat familiar with one another at the point in time that service module  determines that the users have come in contact with one another.

For example, service module  may access one or more of social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N) and copy personal information about the users of computing devices ()-(N) from such social-networking accounts to database  immediately after the users register for the service.","In one example, service module  may enter the username \u201cJOHNJOHNSON@EMAIL.COM\u201d and password \u201cMYPASSWORD\u201d in social-networking platform () to access social-networking account () associated with the user of computing device ().

In this example, as shown in , social-networking account () may include personal information that identifies the user (in this example, \u201cJohn Johnson\u201d), the user's connections (in this example, \u201cKeri Hollister,\u201d \u201cTracy Bowman,\u201d \u201cRochelle Foster,\u201d \u201cNaomi Lewis,\u201d \u201cRoss Harper,\u201d and \u201cTyler West\u201d), the user's employer (in this example, \u201cState Insurance\u201d), the user's past employer (in this example, \u201cCustom Computers\u201d), the user's education (in this example, \u201cState University\u201d), and the user's place of residence (in this example, \u201cReno, Nev.\u201d). Upon accessing social-networking account (), service module  may copy the user's personal information included in social-networking account () to personal information  located in database .","Similarly, service module  may enter the username \u201cJANEJACKSON@EMAIL.COM\u201d and password \u201cPASSWORD1\u201d in social-networking platform () to access social-networking account (N) associated with the user of computing device (N). In this example, as shown in , social-networking account (N) may include personal information that identifies the user (in this example, \u201cJane Jackson\u201d), the user's friends (in this example, \u201cAngie Adams,\u201d \u201cTracy Bowman,\u201d \u201cRon Drake,\u201d \u201cNaomi Lewis,\u201d \u201cRichard Newton,\u201d and \u201cHope Tolbert\u201d), the user's employer (in this example, \u201cCustom Computers\u201d), the user's past employer (in this example, \u201cUniversal Capital\u201d), the user's education (in this example, \u201cState University\u201d), the user's place of residence (in this example, \u201cLas Vegas, Nevada\u201d), the user's religion (in this example, \u201cChristian\u201d), the user's political affiliation (in this example, \u201cConservative\u201d), the user's favorite books (in this example, \u201cTHE CALL OF THE WILD,\u201d \u201cHAMLET,\u201d and \u201cA TALE OF TWO CITIES\u201d), the user's favorite movies (in this example, \u201cGONE WITH THE WIND,\u201d \u201cFORREST GUMP,\u201d and \u201cSCHINDLER'S LIST\u201d), the user's favorite musical artists (in this example, \u201cTINA TURNER\u201d and \u201cPRINCE\u201d), and the user's hobbies (in this example, \u201cPainting,\u201d \u201cGardening,\u201d and \u201cGuitar\u201d). Upon accessing social-networking account (N), service module  may copy the user's personal information included in social-networking account (N) to personal information  located in database .","In some examples, service module  may analyze personal information  and determine, based on this analysis, whether the users of computing devices ()-(N) share any characteristics in common. In one example, service module  may parse at least a portion of personal information  into informational components associated with the users. For example, service module  may divide at least a portion of personal information  associated with the users of computing devices ()-(N) into informational components that represent different categories of information (such as friends, employers, places of residence, religions, political affiliation, favorite books, favorite movies, favorite musical artists, and\/or hobbies).","In some examples, service module  may implement one or more artificial intelligence techniques used to analyze personal information . For example, service module  may implement one or more data mining and\/or machine learning techniques used to (1) divide at least a portion of personal information  and (2) reform the portion of personal information  into the informational components associated with the users of computing devices ()-(N). Such data mining and\/or machine learning techniques may be configured to perform one or more approximation algorithms on personal information  to facilitate dividing and reforming the portion of personal information  into the informational components.","In some examples, service module  may be able to recognize that different types of informational components parsed from personal information  represent substantially similar categories of information. These different types of informational components may result from varying nomenclatures used across social-networking platforms ()-(N). For example, social-networking account () in  includes a \u201cfriends\u201d category of information, and social-networking account () in  includes a \u201cconnections\u201d category of information. In this example, both the \u201cfriends\u201d category included in social-networking account () and the \u201cconnections\u201d category included in social-networking account () may effectively represent known friends of the user of computing device ().","In some examples, service module  may treat the informational components that represent substantially similar categories of information as if they represented the same category of information. For example, service module  may identify at least one informational component that represents the user's friends enumerated in social-networking account () and at least one other informational component that represents the user's connections enumerated in social-networking account (). In this example, service module  may treat both of these different types of informational components as effectively representing known friends of the user of computing device ().","In some examples, upon parsing the portion of personal information  into informational components associated with the users of computing devices ()-(N), service module  may compare the informational components associated with the users to determine whether the users share any characteristics in common. In one example, service module  may identify at least one pattern in the compared informational components that is common to both the user of computing device () and the user of computing device (N). For example, service module  may compare at least one informational component that identifies known friends of the user of computing device () with at least one other informational component that identifies known friends of the user of computing device (N).","In some examples, service module  may determine, based on this comparison of the informational components, whether the users of computing devices ()-(N) share any characteristics in common. For example, service module  may determine that the users of computing devices ()-(N) are both friends with Naomi Lewis and Tracy Bowman by identifying character patterns \u201cNaomi Lewis\u201d and \u201cTracy Bowman\u201d in informational components that represent known friends of the users. In another example, although not demonstrated by the illustrations shown in , service module  may determine that the users of computing devices ()-(N) share no known characteristics in common.","In some examples, service module  may generate characteristics information  that indicates whether the users of computing devices ()-(N) share any known characteristics in common. In one example, service module  may configure characteristics information  by identifying any informational components that represent a pattern that is common to the users of computing devices ()-(N) and then reforming these informational components to facilitate presentation of these informational components to the users upon coming in contact with one another. For example, upon identifying character patterns \u201cNaomi Lewis\u201d and \u201cTracy Bowman\u201d in informational components that represent known friends of the users of computing devices ()-(N), service module  may reform these informational components to represent at least a portion of characteristics information .","In one example, as shown in , characteristics information  may include information that identifies the users that have come in contact with one another (in this example, \u201cJohn Johnson\u201d and \u201cJane Jackson\u201d), friends that the users share in common (in this example, \u201cNaomi Lewis\u201d and \u201cTracy Bowman\u201d), education that the users share in common (in this example, \u201cState University\u201d), an employer (whether past or present) that the users share in common (in this example, \u201cCustom Computers\u201d), a religion that the users share in common (in this example, \u201cChristian\u201d), favorite books that the users share in common (in this example, \u201cHAMLET\u201d and \u201cA TALE OF TWO CITIES\u201d), and a hobby that the users share in common (in this example, \u201cGardening\u201d). In another example, although not demonstrated by the illustration shown in , the characteristics information generated by service module  may include information indicating that the users of computing devices ()-(N) share no known characteristics in common.","In other examples, service module  may generate characteristics information that represents an abstract level of commonality between the users of computing devices ()-(N). In these examples, service module  may ensure that the users' privacy is protected by initially withholding certain details about the users' common characteristics from the characteristics information. By initially withholding such details, service module  may avoid disclosing more information about the users of computing devices ()-(N) than is necessary for the users to determine whether they wish to learn more about one another.","In one example, the characteristics information may include a commonality score that represents the level of commonality between the users of computing devices ()-(N). For example, service module  may compute, based on the analysis of personal information , a commonality score of 75% that represents the level of commonality between the users of computing devices ()-(N). In this example, the commonality score of 75% may indicate that the users of computing devices ()-(N) have a fairly high level of commonality.","In addition, when computing the commonality score, service module  may apply weighted multipliers to certain characteristics based on the relative importance of such characteristics to the users of computing devices ()-(N). For example, the users of computing device ()-(N) may feel that the \u201creligion\u201d characteristic is twice as important to them as the other characteristics. In this example, the user of computing devices ()-(N) may configure the service to apply a \u201c2\u00d7\u201d weighted multiplier to the portion of the computation associated with the \u201creligion\u201d characteristic.","Similarly, when computing the commonality score, service module  may override the computation based on certain incompatibilities between the users of computing devices ()-(N). For example, the user of computing device () may generally dislike democrats. In this example, the user of computing device () may configure the service to always compute a commonality score of 0% whenever the user comes in contact with a democrat (regardless of whether the user and the democrat share any characteristics in common).","In another example, the characteristics information may include a heat map that graphically represents the users' level of commonality by coloring different regions of a multi-dimensional table (such as a planar or cubic table) to indicate varying degrees of commonality across different areas of interest. For example, service module  may generate a heat map that includes a brightly colored region that represents a relatively high level of commonality in a particular area of interest and at least one darkened region that represents a relatively low level of commonality in a different area of interest. In this example, the brightly colored region of the heat map may indicate that the users of computing devices ()-(N) have several mutual friends, and the darkened region of the heat map may indicate that the users of computing devices ()-(N) share no hobbies in common.","In one embodiment, service module  may ensure that the heat map does not initially disclose the different areas of interest represented by the different regions. For example, service module  may configure the heat map to simply show that the users share varying degrees of commonality across the different areas of interest represented by the different regions. In this example, service module  may intentionally fail to identify the different areas of interest represented by the different regions of the heat map in order to avoid disclosing more information than is necessary for the users to determine whether they wish to learn more about one another.","In a further example, the characteristics information may include a raw count that represents the number of known characteristics that the users share in common. For example, service module  may calculate, based on the analysis of personal information , a raw count indicating that the users of computing devices ()-(N) share 8 known characteristics in common. In this example, the raw count may simply indicate that the users of computing devices ()-(N) share 8 known characteristics in common rather than identifying the 8 known characteristics that the users share in common.","In some examples, service module  may provide characteristics information  to one or more of computing devices ()-(N) to facilitate presentation of characteristics information  to the users of computing devices ()-(N). For example, service module  may transmit characteristics information  to each of computing devices ()-(N). In this example, computing devices ()-(N) may each receive characteristics information  and then present characteristics information  to the users. By facilitating presentation of characteristics information  to the users of computing devices ()-(N) when the users of computing devices ()-(N) come in contact with one another, service module  may help the users become instantly familiar with one another and\/or provide a common-ground basis upon which the users may build a friendship.","In some examples, service module  may act as a brokering mechanism that obtains various personal information about the users of computing devices ()-(N) but avoids disclosing certain details from such personal information. For example, service module  may be able to access any personal information included in social-networking accounts ()-(N) and ()-(N) but unable to disclose certain details from such personal information. In this example, the users of computing devices ()-(N) may have defined, as part of the registration process described above, which details service module  is able to disclose to other users that have registered for the service.","In some examples, the users of computing devices ()-(N) may enable service module  to disclose additional details that have yet to be disclosed to one another. For example, upon reviewing the characteristics information provided to computing device (), the user of computing device () may verify that he and the user of computing device (N) share a fairly high level of commonality. In this example, the user of computing device () may then provide permission for the service to disclose additional details about him to the user of computing device (N) in an attempt to learn more about one another.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["710","710","710"]},"Computing system  broadly represents any single or multi-processor computing device or system capable of executing computer-readable instructions.
