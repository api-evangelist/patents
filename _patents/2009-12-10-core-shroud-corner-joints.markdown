The government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field","The disclosed concept relates generally to nuclear reactors and, more particularly, to core shrouds for nuclear reactors. The disclosed concept also relates to an associated method of assembling core shrouds.","2. Background Information","The primary side of nuclear reactor power generating systems which are cooled with water under pressure, comprises a closed circuit that is isolated from and in heat-exchange relationship with a secondary side for the production of useful energy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","12","14","10","16","14","18","16","10","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","10","14","22","24","26","24","10","26","22","28","10","30","10","32","34","37","36","22","22","37","36","38","26","40","14","40","42","44"]},"As shown in simplified form in , a core shroud  is positioned inside the circular core barrel , and includes a plurality of vertically extending plates  that convert the inner profile of the core barrel  to a stepped circumferential profile that generally matches the peripheral outline of the fuel assemblies  (shown in simplified form in ) within the core . The simplified cross-section view of  also shows a thermal shield , which is interposed between the pressure vessel  and core barrel . Some plants have neutron pads in lieu of the thermal shield.","Typically, the plates  that form the stepped circumferential profile are substantially flat and abut at right angles at intersecting, corner, locations. As a result of machining and\/or forming, some reactor vessel internals, however, include atypical corner joints. By way of example, these atypical corner joints can be characterized as being round for outside corner locations, being \u201ckey-like\u201d (e.g., without limitation, having a groove) for interior locations and\/or having relatively large pockets of open areas. Each atypical corner joint provides an area for flow to bypass the adjacent fuel assembly due to the low hydraulic resistance in these corners. In fact, flow calculations have shown a relatively high axial velocity in atypical core shroud corners. Among other disadvantages, this may result in unacceptable fuel rod vibration, which leads to fuel assembly grid-to-rod fretting, and may also cause elevated cross-flow velocities in this region.","There is, therefore, room for improvement in core shrouds and corner joints therefor.","These needs and others are met by embodiments of the disclosed concept, which provide an improved design and assembly method for nuclear reactor core shrouds wherein, among other benefits, the corners of the core shroud assembly are preferably of a unitary design comprising one single continuous piece of material that is devoid of any seems or associated gaps or voids.","As one aspect of the disclosed concept, a core shroud is provided. The core shroud comprises: a number of planar members; a number of unitary corners; and a number of subassemblies each comprising a combination of the planar members and the unitary corners.","Each of the unitary corners may be substantially identical. Each of the unitary corners may comprise a unitary extrusion including a first planar portion and a second planar portion disposed perpendicularly with respect to the first planar portion. At least one of the subassemblies may comprises a plurality of the unitary corners, wherein the first planar portion of one of the unitary corners is joined to the second planar portion of another one of the unitary corners, in order that the unitary corners are disposed side-by-side in an alternating opposing relationship.","As another aspect of the disclosed concept, a nuclear reactor is provided which comprises: a pressure vessel; an annular core barrel seated within and supported by the pressure vessel; and a core shroud supported within the core barrel, the core shroud comprising: a number of planar members, a number of unitary corners, and a number of subassemblies each comprising a combination of the planar members and the unitary corners.","The core shroud may further comprise a number of flow deflectors, and each of the unitary corners of the core shroud may include a curved interior junction and a curved exterior junction. Each of the flow deflectors may include a curved portion and a number of substantially flat portions disposed opposite the curved portion, wherein the curved portion is structured to mate with a corresponding one of the curved interior junction and the curved exterior junction. The nuclear reactor may further comprise a number of grids disposed within the core shroud, wherein the substantially flat portions of the flow deflectors are structured to engage and support a portion of a corresponding one of the grids.","As a further aspect of the disclosed concept, a method of assembling a core shroud is provided. The method comprises: providing a number of planar members; extruding a plurality of unitary corners; joining a combination of the planar members and the unitary corners to form a number of subassemblies; and joining a plurality of the subassemblies to form at least a portion of the core shroud.","The method may further comprise joining a plurality of the subassemblies to form a quarter perimeter segment of the core shroud, and may still further comprise joining four of the quarter perimeter segments to form the core shroud.","For purposes of illustration, embodiments of the disclosed concept will be described as applied to core shrouds although it will become apparent that they could also be applied to replace or otherwise eliminate corner joints between joined components of other internals assemblies (e.g., without limitation, battle-former assemblies) to address and overcome problems associated therewith (e.g., without limitation, baffle-jetting).","Directional phrases used herein, such as, for example, interior, exterior, inside, outside, top, bottom and derivatives thereof, relate to the orientation of the elements shown in the drawings and are not limiting upon the claims unless expressly recited therein.","As employed herein, the term \u201cunitary\u201d shall mean one single continuous piece of material that is devoid of any seems, joints or connections and which may be formed using any known or suitable method or process such as, for example and without limitation, an extrusion process.","As employed herein, the term \u201cnumber\u201d shall mean one or an integer greater than one (i.e., a plurality).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["100","102","106","100","108","110","102","108","110","108","110","108","110","100"]},"As shown in , the disclosed concept entails the fabrication of each core shroud corner as a unitary corner  such as, for example and without limitation, a unitary extrusion having the desired corner shape. The open areas associated with conventional inside and outside corners ,  () are, therefore, eliminated. Such open areas can result from forming (e.g., without limitation, bending) and\/or from welding the seems (not shown in ) where two planar portions abut and are joined to make the corner joint. Recent changes in manufacturing extrusion technology have made this possible. For example and without limitation, up to about 4.75 inch\u00d74.75 inch\u00d71 inch or larger full-length (e.g., without limitation, see length, L, of  which may be, for example and without limitation, about 180 inches (not shown to scale)) extruded shapes are possible. Thus, as shown in , each unitary corner  (two are shown) includes a first planar portion  and a second planar portion  disposed perpendicular to the first planar portion , and without any seem or other connection therebetween. This is particularly advantageous where, as in the example of , the width (e.g., without limitation, about 4.75 inch) when welded to a similar extrusion , is sufficiently wide to accommodate a perimeter location having a single fuel assembly  (see, for example, fuel assemblies  in locations \u201cA\u201d in ). The unitary extruded shapes  (e.g., unitary corners) can then be laser welded or otherwise suitably joined, for example, to form a subassembly , as shown in .","To complete the perimeter of the core shroud near the pair of fuel assemblies  designated as \u201cA\u201d in , continued welding of three pairs of the unitary corners  is completed to form a subassembly , as shown in . For the other two typical perimeter locations, which have two or three fuel assemblies in a row (see, for example, fuel assemblies  at the locations designated as \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in ), planar members  (),  () of differing widths  (),  (), are welded to a unitary corner  to form subassemblies , , which are shown in , respectively. Specifically,  show planar members ,  of widths , , respectively, that can be laser welded or otherwise suitably joined to a unitary corner  to accommodate core fuel assembly locations \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC,\u201d respectively, of . In the example of , the first planar member  includes opposing edges ,  and a first width  measured by the distance therebetween, whereas the second planar member  of  has opposing edges ,  and a second width  therebetween, which is greater than the first width  of first planar member .","The exemplary method of forming the perimeter  of the core shroud  (), involves welding or otherwise suitably joining two of the subassembly , shown in , to the subassembly , shown in , resulting in the subassembly , shown in . Lastly, to complete a quarter perimeter segment, or subassembly , of the core shroud  (; also referred to generally as  in ), the unitary corner subassembly  of  and the subassembly , shown in , are welded or otherwise suitably joined to subassembly  of . In the example shown and described herein, each of the quarter perimeter segments  includes eleven of the unitary corners , two of the first planar members , and one of the second planar members , as shown in . Finally, four of the quarter perimeter segments  are welded or otherwise suitably joined together to form the complete core shroud , shown in  (see also core shroud  of ).","It will be appreciated that any known or suitable alternative configuration, number and\/or assembly sequence of components (e.g., without limitation, unitary corners ; first planar members ; second planar members ) and subassemblies (e.g., without limitation , , , , , ) could be employed, without departing from the scope of the disclosed concept.","It will also be appreciated that while components (e.g., without limitation, unitary corners ; first planar members ; second planar members ) are preferably welded using laser technology, as generally indicated in simplified form in , that any known or suitable alternative method, process or mechanism could be employed to suitably join the core shroud components (e.g., without limitation, unitary corners ; first planar members ; second planar members ) and\/or subassemblies (e.g., without limitation , , , , , ).","Among other advantages, the disclosed concept eliminates the inside and outside corner void areas associated with the known core shroud designs. The void areas are the result of extensive machining, bending and\/or forming operations. The disclosed concept provides a unitary corner and therefore eliminates all seems at the corner, and also eliminates welding corner joints that are difficult to inspect due to lack of accessibility. The only welds are at locations away from the corners, which are substantially flat and\/or relatively easy to access and facilitate inspection.","Additionally, in stages, each unitary corner extrusion  can be laser welded or otherwise suitably joined to like extrusions  (see, for example, ) and\/or associated planar members ,  (see, for example, ). Each of the unitary corners  may also be substantially identical, with the first planar portion  of one unitary corner  being joined to the second planar portion  of another unitary corner , in order that the unitary corners  are disposed side-by-side in an alternating opposing relationship (best shown in ). Moreover, it will be appreciated that the assembly method can employ rigid-like tooling and\/or fixtures (not shown) to hold the extruded unitary corners , planar members ,  and\/or subassemblies , , , , , . Therefore, weld distortion, which can be caused for example by heat, is minimized. Furthermore, compared to conventional welding processes that use consumable electrodes, laser welding results in minimal heat input, which should further result in better dimensional control. This will improve core cavity dimensions, particularly at the final stage of welding the four quarter perimeter segments  (), whereas the current process results in significant machining being required after welding, in order to meet core cavity dimensional requirements.","The extruded unitary corner design of the disclosed concept eliminates the welding of corner joints altogether and, therefore, eliminates a significant amount of machining work and time and cost associated therewith. Additionally, due to the possibility of less machining being necessary after welding, a further savings may be available by way of the ability to potentially use thinner extruded shapes. The possibility exists for the aforementioned subassemblies , , , , ,  to be fabricated by qualified suppliers, in order that partial or full core shroud assemblies could be shipped to a designated manufacturing facility for final assembly or completion of core shroud  (; see also core shroud assembly  of ).","It will also be appreciated that the potential exists to incorporate the disclosed unitary corner concept with respect to other reactors internals assemblies (e.g., without limitation, baffle-former assembly corner joints (not shown)). For example and without limitation, an extruded unitary corner could be retro-fitted to an existing baffle-former design to eliminate corner joints between baffle plates (not shown) of a baffle-former assembly (not shown). Thus, the potential for undesirable \u201cbaffle jetting\u201d is eliminated. \u201cBaffle jetting is a result of water jetting from inside the baffle-former core cavity toward the direction of the core as a result of gaps or openings in the corner joint.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 13A-15","FIGS. 13A-15","FIGS. 14 and 15","FIGS. 13A-15","FIGS. 14 and 15","FIG. 15","FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"b":["16","18","302","304","304","302","112","108","302","306","308","306","112","108","302","302","46","46","302","108","46","302","100","310"]},"Implementation of the aforementioned exterior flow deflector  and \u2032 for exterior corners  of the core shroud  is shown in the non-limiting examples of  and , respectively. As with the interior flow deflectors , previously discussed, the height of the exterior flow deflectors , \u2032 can be made to be consistent with the height of the fuel assembly grids  (partially shown in phantom line drawing in ). Each exterior flow deflector , \u2032 preferably includes a curved portion  and a number of substantially flat portions  (two are shown) disposed generally opposite the curved portion . The curved portion  is structured to mate with, and be suitably joined (e.g., without limitation, welded) to, the curved exterior junction  of the exterior corner  of the core shroud, as shown in . It will, however, be appreciated that any known or suitable alternative number, shape and\/or configuration of flow deflectors (not shown) other than, or in addition to, those that are shown and described herein, could be employed without departing from the scope of the disclosed concept. For example and without limitation,  shows two different exterior flow deflectors , \u2032 disposed on the exterior corner  of the core shroud , each of which has a different length. Additionally, as shown in exaggerated form in , the flow deflector  may include a chamfer . Such chamfer , which may for example, be formed as part of a fillet weld, would help, for example, to avoid undesired interaction (e.g., without limitation, a \u201csnag\u201d) with a grid during fuel assembly loading and unloading. It will also be appreciated that such flow deflectors (e.g., without limitation, , , \u2032) could be incorporated independently (e.g., as a separate solution from the disclosed unitary corner concept), for example, with an existing core shroud design, to improve the flow-related problems associated with the corner joints thereof. It will, therefore, further be appreciated that such flow deflectors (e.g., without limitation, , , \u2032) are not required in a least some embodiments in accordance with the disclosed concept.","While specific embodiments of the disclosed concept have been described in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the disclosure. Accordingly, the particular arrangements disclosed are meant to be illustrative only and not limiting as to the scope of the disclosed concept which is to be given the full breadth of the claims appended and any and all equivalents thereof."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A further understanding of the disclosed concept can be gained from the following description of the preferred embodiments when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A and 13B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIGS. 13A and 13B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A and 16B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
