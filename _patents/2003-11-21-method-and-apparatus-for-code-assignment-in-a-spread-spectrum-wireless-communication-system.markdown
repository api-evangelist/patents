More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for code assignment in a spread-spectrum wireless communication system.","2. Background","In a spread spectrum wireless communication system, a base station communicates with multiple mobile users. In one system, a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, such as specified in the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe IS-95 standard,\u201d or the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-2000 Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems,\u201d hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe cdma2000 standard,\u201d codes are applied to the data and control information. The codes identify the target recipient as well as the sender. Operation of a CDMA system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d and also in U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d both assigned to the assignee of the present application for patent and hereby expressly incorporated by reference. The forward link from base station to mobile users assigns a unique Walsh code to each mobile with which it transmits, wherein the Walsh code identifies the mobile. Similarly, the reverse link from the mobile user to the base station uses a Pseudorandom Noise (PN) code for channelization.","Alternate spread spectrum systems incorporate a variety of codes for the two-way identification. A problem exists as codes may be reused in neighboring cells and\/or sectors, creating interference for adjacent neighbors. Therefore, a method is needed to provide the two-way identification of wireless communications while minimizing and\/or reducing the interference experienced by neighboring cells and\/or sectors. Similarly, there is a need for a code assignment method that achieves that reduces neighbor interference.","The disclosed embodiments provide a novel and improved method for code assignment in a spread spectrum wireless communication system. In one aspect, in a wireless communication system adapted for Large Area Synchronized-Code Division Multiple Access (LAS-CDMA) transmissions having a plurality of LS codes, a method includes determining a size of an Interference Free Window (IFW), calculating a plurality of subsets from the plurality of LS codes, each subset comprising LS codes as a function of the IFW, assigning a first of the plurality of subsets to a first portion of the system, and assigning a second of the plurality of subsets to a second portion of the system.","In another aspect, a wireless communication system incorporating an LAS-CDMA protocol includes a first cell, the first cell being assigned a first subset of LS codes; and a second cell, the second cell being assigned a second subset of LS codes, wherein the first and second subsets have a null cross-correlation within a predetermined interference free window. Note that the LS codes within the first and second subsets also have a null cross-correlation with a predetermined IFW that is typically wider than that between cells.","In another aspect, in a Large Area Synchronized-Code Division Multiple Access wireless communication system, a method includes transmitting a first communication within a first cell, the first communication identifying at least one mobile station within the first cell by a first LS code within a first subset of LS codes; and transmitting a second communication within a second cell, the second communication identifying at least one mobile station within the second cell by a second LS code within a second subset of LS codes, wherein a cross-correlation of the first and second subsets is null within an interference free window.","In another aspect, a controller in a Large Area Synchronized-Code Division Multiple Access wireless communication system includes a first set of instructions for determining an interference free window size for communications between neighboring cells; and a second set of instructions for determining at least two sets of LS codes based on the interference free window size, a first set for identifying mobile stations in a first cell and a second set for identifying mobile stations in a neighboring cell, wherein the two sets of LS codes have a null cross-correlation within an interference free window. This is also true of the LS codes within each of the subsets with respect to each other.","According to still another aspect, in a Large Area Synchronized-Code Division Multiple Access wireless communication system, the system having a first cell and a first cell neighborhood, a computer data signal is embodied on a carrier wave, the signal including a first portion comprising information for transmission to a first mobile user in a first cell; and a second portion comprising a first LS code corresponding to the first mobile user, wherein the first LS code is part of a first set of LS codes exclusively assigned to the first cell within the first cell neighborhood.","In many spread-spectrum communication systems codes are applied to transmission signals for channelization. Often a first type of code is applied to the data signals to identify the designated mobile user, and a second type of code is applied that is specific to the base station. A CDMA system, for example, has a large number of codes available for spreading the data and control information transmitted in a wireless system, allowing one base station to communicate with multiple mobile users. The CDMA codes include a Walsh code assigned to each mobile user and a Pseudorandom Noise (PN) code specific to the base station. Both codes are applied to data signals transmitted by the base station. A set of Walsh codes is a set of orthogonal binary sequences, wherein the cross-correlation over time is zero. The Walsh codes are generated using a Hadamard matrix, wherein recursion allows expansion of a base code, or seed, into lengthier codes, thus increasing the size of the Walsh code set.","However, in contrast to Walsh codes, PN codes do not require synchronization such as used to implement Walsh codes. Rather, PN codes may be generated by linear feedback shift registers, wherein binary bits are shifted through the different stages of the register. Output bits from the last stage form the PN codes. PN codes have an auto-correlation characteristic that allows codes to align at the receiver. The combination of Walsh and PN codes allows identification of the base station and mobile station for wireless transmissions. Other systems may incorporate other codes and\/or combinations of Walsh, PN, and other codes to identify the mobile user and the base station.","Large Area Synchronized-Code Division Multiple Access (LAS-CDMA) Systems","In another type of spread spectrum wireless communication system, referred to as a Large Area Synchronized-Code Division Multiple Access (LAS-CDMA) system, specially designed codes, referred to as \u201cLS\u201d and \u201cLA\u201d codes, are used to spread the signals for transmission. LAS-CDMA is a technique for spread-spectrum and time-division multiple access that creates channels through the use of time division and orthogonal codes. One LAS-CDMA system is described in the \u201cPhysical Layer Specification for LAS2000,\u201d a candidate proposal to the China Wireless Telecommunication Standard (CWTS).","In a LAS-CDMA system, communications are transmitted in frames, wherein a fixed number of sub-frames are included in each frame. Each sub-frame is then segmented into a predetermined number of time slots. The LS and LA codes are used for channelization, as in other CDMA systems, wherein the LS and LA codes are designed to have a small or zero cross-correlation over time.","A first type of code, the LS code, is applied to the data or symbols in each time slot. The LS code identifies the mobile user that is the target of the transmission. Within a given cell and\/or sector, different LS codes are applied to each mobile user. In preparing each transmission, the appropriate LS code is modulated by a symbol, as described hereinbelow, to form a symbol modulated LS code.","A second type of code, the LA code, identifies the cell and\/or sector, i.e., the base station operating within the area. Unlike the LS code that is applied to each time slot, the LA code is applied to the entire sub-frame, and defines the time allotted to each segment of the sub-frame. Application of a given LA code to the entire sub-frame results in various sized time gaps between modulated symbols. The combination and order of the gap sizes serves as an identification of the cell and\/or sector.","An exemplary embodiment of a LAS-CDMA system is illustrated in . The system  is a LAS-CDMA system including a plurality of cells , , , , , , each having a base station , , , , , , respectively, for communication with mobile stations , , , , , , within the system . A forward channel is used for transmission of data from base stations , , , , , , to mobile stations , , , , , , within system . Each mobile station , , , , , , uses a reverse channel for transmission of data to at least one of base stations , , , , , . In other LAS-CDMA systems, the cells may be as configured in , or may be positioned in an alternate manner, wherein each base station is associated with at least one cell and\/or sector.","As illustrated in , a first portion of the system  is referred to as cell . Other portions of the system  that are located in close proximity to cell  make up a neighborhood of cell . In system , the illustrated portion of the neighborhood of cell  includes cells , , and . Other portions within the neighborhood of cell  are not shown, but may be located anywhere in close proximity to cell . In one embodiment, a cell neighborhood includes those cells that border the cell geographically. In alternate embodiments, the neighboring criteria that determines which portions are included in a neighborhood may be made according to the interference experienced between cells, or some other criteria that relates to the interaction of wireless transmissions within cells.","Within system , signals are prepared for transmission by formatting the signals into frames of a predetermined protocol.  illustrates one embodiment of a forward channel protocol  used in system  for transmitting data and control information in 20 ms frames, wherein each frame  includes a header field  and multiple sub-frames . The header field  designates pilot bursts and control information for the sync word and the sync sub-channel. The header field  is followed by a sequence of nine sub-frames , numbered 0, 1, 2, . . . 8. The sub-frames  are evenly spaced within the frame . Note that the header field  is made up of a first number of chips and each of the sub-frames  is made up of a second number of chips, wherein the second number is not necessarily equal to the first number. As used herein, a chip is defined as the sample in time.","As illustrated in , each sub-frame  includes a predetermined number of time slots , wherein each time slot  corresponds to an LS code modulated by a symbol. In the present embodiment, each sub-frame  includes 17 time slots, labeled 0, 1, 2, . . . 16. Each time slot  includes a modulated LS code and a subsequent gap  of variable size defined by the LA code. Note that the LS code is assigned to the mobile user, while the LA code is assigned to the base station. The modulated LS code is composed of a pair of complementary components, identified as \u201cC\u201d and \u201cS\u201d components as discussed in detail hereinbelow. Each C component is 64 chips and is preceded by a 4 chip gap. Each S component is 64 chips and is preceded by a 4 chip gap. Therefore, each modulated LS code consumes 136 chips: (4+64+4+64). The minimum size of any time slot  is, therefore, 136 chips.","In the present embodiment, the time slots  are not assigned a common chip length, but rather each time slot  within a sub-frame  is assigned a unique chip length. The chip length of each time slot  is determined by the gap  appended to the modulated LS code, wherein the sizes of the gaps  are not uniform over the entire sub-frame . The sizes of gaps  are determined by the assigned LA code. The LA code defines the size of each gap  within the time slot . The LA code is effectively a pattern that is applied to the entire sub-frame . LA codes are described in detail hereinbelow.","In one embodiment, the frame  is composed of 23,031 chips. The header field  is assigned 1545 chips, and each sub-frame  is assigned 2559 chips. As each sub-frame  contains 17 time slots , and each time slot  includes an LS code of 136 bits and a variable size gap , each time slot  is, therefore, at least 136 chips long, sufficient for the LS code. Note that if a time slot  is equal to 136 chips, there is no gap .","LA Codes","The gaps  are determined by the LA code of the cell and\/or sector. Specifically, a LA code is a code used to determine the boundaries of time slots within a sub-frame and to identify a cell and\/or sector. LA codes may be designated by the following parameters, (N, K0, K):\n\n","A pulse is a function with unit energy and infinitesimal duration. Each pulse identifies a time boundary for a time slot . The minimum pulse interval is determined by the size of the LS code. In the present embodiment, the LS code consumes 136 chips, and therefore the minimum pulse interval is 136 chips. Alternate embodiments may implement LS codes with different lengths and hence different minimum pulse intervals.","As the LA code defines the timing boundaries over the entire sub-frame , the total LA code length refers to the length of the sub-frame , including all time slots . In the present embodiment, the total LA code length is 2559 chips. Note that the LA code is a parsing scheme that covers the entire sub-frame ; and therefore, the total LA code length is defined as the length of the sub-frame , and not the length of the LA code that lists the time intervals assigned to each time slot  within the sub-frame . With respect to , while one LS code is applied to each time slot , one LA code is applied to the entire sub-frame .","As illustrated in , each sub-frame  is 2559 chips, wherein a chip is defined as the sample after spreading. The total LA code length, K, is given as the length of one sub-frame . Each sub-frame  is segmented into a predetermined number of segments, each segment allocated sufficient chips to accommodate one LS code. The number of pulses, N, corresponds to the number of segments after segmentation. For example, as illustrated in , each sub-frame  is segmented into 17 segments, i.e., N=17. The minimum pulse interval, K0, is measured in chips and is constrained to a length of at least equal to one LS code, i.e., 136 chips. While K0 defines the minimum segment length of a time slot , not all time slots  are equal to the minimum segment length, and perhaps no time slot  is equal to the minimum segment length. Each time slot  is assigned a segment length. When the segment length of the time slot  is greater than 136 chips, the difference is made up by gap  subsequent to the S component of the modulated LS code.","In the present embodiment, LA codes are given having parameters (17,136,2559), i.e., N=17; K=136; and K=2559. An exemplary LA code is illustrated in . Seventeen pulse intervals are assigned index values from 0 through 16, each corresponding to one of the 17 time slots  of . Each pulse interval has an associated chip length and pulse position in time with respect to the other pulses. The pulse positions in time for each index value are illustrated below the LA code. The corresponding pulse positions for the LA code illustrate the chip beginning of each time slot . Within the LA code, from the left, the first pulse interval corresponds to a first time slot  of  (labeled \u201c0\u201d). The first pulse interval is equal to 136 chips, or the minimum pulse interval. Therefore, the first time slot  has a gap  equal to zero. Continuing with the LA code, the next pulse interval is associated with the second time slot , labeled \u201c1.\u201d This interval is 138 chips, and therefore the corresponding pulse occurs at (136+138)=274. The second time slot  has a gap  equal to two chips. Successive pulse intervals within the LA code define the timing boundaries of the time slots  within sub-frame , wherein the final pulse occurs at the time corresponding to the 2559th chip. Within the LA code of the illustrated embodiment, successive pulse intervals are two chips greater than previous pulse intervals, until the end of the LA code. Alternate embodiments may implement an alternate assignment of pulse intervals. The combination and order of pulse intervals creates a pattern. The pattern is then permuted to create multiple patterns, providing distinct LA codes applicable to multiple cells and\/or sectors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},"LS Codes","While LA codes are used to identify cell and\/or sector, LS codes are used in LAS-CDMA to spread the transmitted signal and create multiple code divided transmission channels.

Each occurrence of an LS code consists of a pair of codes of equal length: a C component and a S component. The C and S components are separated by gaps.

Note that subset A is then assigned to cell , as this cell is not a neighbor of cell . As in the schedule illustrated in , no neighboring cells are assigned a common code set.","In accordance with one embodiment, a process of assigning LS code subsets determines the size of the IFW. This is the acceptable level of interference allowed in the system. For example, an IFW=[0,0] indicates that no offsets maintain the desired cross-correlation property. In other words, there is no window of offsets that is interference free. Similarly, an IFW=[\u22121,+1] indicates that a group of LS codes can be found that maintains these properties for offsets of +1 to (\u22121). The size of the LS subset is calculated as a function of the IFW selected. Specific code subsets are formed, wherein the number of codes available for a subset is determined from the selected IFW and the length of the LS codes. The LS codes may be assigned to subsets sequentially or in some other fashion, wherein in one embodiment, at least three subsets are formed providing complete isolation of cells with a honeycomb layout, as illustrated in . Alternate embodiments may incorporate alternate numbers of subsets and allow different isolation. Still other embodiments may incorporate additional subsets to provide additional isolation of cells. Each system may be implemented to accommodate the vagaries of the transmission environment. For example, one system may require less isolation due to a sparse concentration of expected mobile users or due to a specific type of terrain, while other systems may require additional isolation beyond neighboring cells due to a dense concentration of users. As an example, consider the case illustrated in , for a total of 128 LS codes, wherein a desired IFW=[\u22121,+1] corresponds to 64 LS codes per subset. The available codes may then be assigned to subsets.","In one embodiment the system  selects the IFW based on the multi-path propagation delay profile of a mobile user. Note that the MAI and ISI within the IFW may be reduced. It is more difficult to remove or reject the MAI and ISI outside of the window. As the size of the IFW increases, the number of LS codes that maintain the IFW decreases. However, the number of LS code subsets increases. For example, as discussed hereinabove, with an LS code length of 128 bits, an IFW=[\u22121,+1] results in subset size of 64 LS codes. As there are a total of 128 codes, this allows two subsets of 64 LS codes. For an IFW=[\u22123,+3], the resultant LS code subset size is 32, and there are, therefore, four subsets that may be formed from the 128 LS codes.","A LS code subset is then assigned to one cell. A check is made to see if the same code subset is used in a neighboring cell. This is to ensure that neighboring cells are using distinct subsets. If no neighboring cell is using the same subset, processing continues to determine if all cells have been assigned. If a neighboring cell uses the same LS code subset, processing continues to select a different LS code subset. The different LS code subset may be the next sequential subset of codes or may be a disjoint set of codes. The processing continues until all cells in the system have been assigned code subsets.","The process will typically be performed by a base station controller (not shown) that provides control for multiple base stations within a wireless telecommunication system. The processing may alternately be performed by each base station, wherein each base station within a system, such as stations , , , , , , communicates with each other base station in the selection of LS code subsets. In such an embodiment, once a base station has selected a LS code subset, this selection is communicated to other base stations within the system. Negotiation between base stations may be used to allow each base station to isolate communications within the corresponding cell from neighboring cells, i.e., the neighborhood, while allowing each neighbor to perform the same with respect its neighborhood. The assignment of LS code subsets is a dynamic process and may be modified or changed due to changing circumstances within a given system. When for example, the desired IFW changes, it may be necessary to change the LS code assignments. In this case, fewer codes may be available to form subsets. In another instance, the concentration of mobile users may change, requiring a smaller IFW and making more codes available.","According to one embodiment, a wireless LAS-CDMA communication system implements multiple LS code subsets, wherein each LS code subset is assigned to a cell and\/or sector within the system and different subsets are assigned to neighboring cells. The subsets are formed to achieve a desired IFW, wherein the IFW determines the number of codes in each subset. Application of such subsets to neighboring cells reduces the interference between neighboring cells. In one embodiment, the size of the subsets is determined by the length of the codes and the IFW according to an arborescence structure. In this way, the interference experienced by neighboring cells in a wireless communication system is reduced.","Thus, a novel and improved method and apparatus identifying mobile users in a wireless transmission in a wireless communication system has been described.
