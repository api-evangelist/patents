{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to the application of a cosmetic product to human keratinous materials, especially the skin or the lips.","More particularly, the invention relates to applying a product (also termed a \u201ccomposition\u201d) initially in the form of a piece of solid product (also termed a \u201cproduct mass\u201d), especially a stick (also termed a \u201cknob\u201d).","The present invention also pertains to solid cosmetic compositions for making up and\/or for care of the skin and\/or lips, procuring a glossy effect.","Lipsticks have long been packaged as sticks for direct application to the lips. In this case, the formulation of a lipstick must satisfy various requirements, on the one hand of a mechanical nature so that it can glide on and so that the stick is stable during application and to prevent it from breaking, and on the other hand of a transferring nature in order to guarantee comfortable application as well as a sufficient deposit, of the correct quality, on the lips.","These requirements are generally considered to be antagonistic and mean that restrictions are placed on the formulations which could usefully be relaxed.","Application US 2004\/0 096 258 discloses a device for packaging and applying a lipstick that comprises a vibration generator and a heat generator. The vibration generator can be used to carry out a massaging action with a hot surface.","It is also known from European patent application EP 0 223 603 for stick lipsticks to undergo a flaming operation during manufacture thereof, consisting of briefly heating the surface of the stick in order to increase the surface gloss.","Application EP 1 595 472 A2 discloses a device comprising an electrical resistance for reshaping the application surface of a product contained in a body.","Heat is generally considered to be detrimental to the mechanical staying power of a product formed as a stick and thus U.S. Pat. No. 4,393,975 proposes a refrigeration device that can protect the stick from heat.","The publication US 2008\/0 143 214 discloses a packaging device comprising a cap coated with a heating wire in order to heat up a stick of hair removal wax or a lipstick.","At the same time, in addition to the color which is the essential characteristic of a lipstick, users frequently desire gloss. While it is relatively easy to provide liquid formulae with gloss, this is much more difficult with a product in the form of a solid mass.","Thus, there is a need for providing a lipstick in the stick form with more gloss.","Many users would also like performance in terms of the staying power of the makeup.","However, the performances in terms of gloss and staying power are generally obtained by different, frequently antagonistic mechanisms.","Thus, there is a need for products to be available that can provide both gloss and staying power.","Finally, the sensory aspect is very important for products formed into sticks, because the user is only in contact with the product during application, especially as regards lipsticks, and the improvement in performances in terms of gloss and staying power cannot be obtained without having regard to this sensory aspect.","It is known that a certain number of ingredients that are capable of providing the product with advantageous characteristics in terms of gloss or staying power, for example, such as polymers, especially when they have a relatively high molecular weight, are detrimental to the application qualities or may even render application impossible.","The qualities of mechanical strength or heat resistance further complicate the formulator's task by rendering difficult the production of sticks with a weak structure with the aim of providing good transfer.","One known solution for incorporating certain compounds that are difficult to apply when cold consists of reducing the diameter of the stick, for example to 8 mm, and of providing a shaft around the stick on the case.","Such sticks used on such cases necessitate a lower wax content in order to provide them with staying power. However, consumers generally prefer fatter sticks with a diameter of more than 10 mm.","There exists a need for improving the performances of a product in the form of a solid mass both on the sensory level and\/or as regards the finished makeup while retaining in the product mechanical properties that are compatible with packaging as a stick or in another solid form and with application by friction to the surface to be treated.","A need also exists for the development of a means that can be used to incorporate into a product all of the compounds necessary for producing properties of staying power and\/or gloss that are satisfactory without, however, deleteriously affecting the application qualities of the product.","In particular, a need exists for the development of a means that can be used to incorporate into such a product one or more oils necessary for producing satisfactory gloss properties without deleteriously affecting the application qualities of the product.","It is known that a glossy character can conventionally be provided in this type of composition by using glossy oils, which are generally viscous. Using such compounds then generally affects the qualities of application comfort in particular in terms of glide. The addition of fluid oils, i.e. with a low viscosity, can certainly overcome this problem, but unfortunately may prove to be prejudicial because of the migratory nature of such oils.","Thus, a need exists for a mode of makeup that can exploit the high gloss of certain viscous oils without, however, requiring the use of compounds that could make up for such a high viscosity.","There also exists a need for a mode of makeup that allows the use of large quantities of high gloss viscous oils that up to now have not been considered because they have not been deemed to be compatible with good application quality.","More precisely, the invention proposes a novel mode of making up and\/or skin care that can satisfy all of the requirements mentioned above.","Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention concerns a method for making up and\/or for non-therapeutic care of non-fibrous human keratinous materials, in particular the skin, the mucous membranes or the nails, characterized in that an outer surface of a piece of solid cosmetic composition having a temperature-sensitive dynamic coefficient of friction equal to 0.5 or more at 25\u00b0 C., more preferably equal to 0.6 or more at 25\u00b0 C., is brought into contact with or into the vicinity of a heating device in order to heat said piece in a localized manner so as to soften essentially only said outer surface and to reduce the dynamic coefficient of friction thereof, in which method the outer surface of the thus heated composition is then applied to the region to be treated, and in particular to be made up, said composition being different from a composition in the form of a stick lipstick with a diameter of 12.7 mm, and in particular being defined as follows, the quantities being expressed as a percentage by weight",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"BHT","0.06"]},{"entry":[{},"PEG-45\/DODECYL GLYCOL COPOLYMER","6"]},{"entry":[{},"OCTYLDODECYL NEOPENTANOATE","18"]},{"entry":[{},"POLYBUTENE","15"]},{"entry":[{},"TRIISOSTEARIN","7"]},{"entry":[{},"OCTYLDODECYL\/PPG-3 MYRISTYL ETHER","1"]},{"entry":[{},"DIMER DILINOLEATE"]},{"entry":[{},"BIS-DIGLYCERYL POLYACYLADIPATE-2","15"]},{"entry":[{},"ISOSTEARYL ISOSTERATE","10"]},{"entry":[{},"DISTEARDIMONIUM HECTORITE","1"]},{"entry":[{},"YELLOW 6 LAKE","7"]},{"entry":[{},"RED 7","4"]},{"entry":[{},"TITANIUM DIOXIDE","1"]},{"entry":[{},"POLYETHYLENE","5"]},{"entry":[{},"MICROCRYSTALLINE WAX","7"]},{"entry":[{},"MICA","2.94"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The piece of the composition may be permanently in contact with or in the proximity of the heating device which latter may be activated prior to application of the composition in order to raise the temperature of the outer surface of the piece of the composition.

For such a stick of product, application after heating becomes possible, with superior performances as regards gloss.","With the invention, a composition can be packaged in the form of a stick, for example with a diameter of 7 mm or more, preferably with a relatively large diameter, for example 10 mm or more, for example 50 mm or less, without problems as regards staying power or product transfer, since the structuring compounds introduced, which are problematic to cold application, are less so when the temperature is increased.","The product may be a product for application to the lips, especially a lipstick or a lip gloss. The products concerned by the invention are not, however, limited to makeup products, and the invention also concerns non-therapeutic skin care products.","The product may be heated in a variety of manners, for example by being exposed to infrared radiation or to radioelectrical radiation.","The product may also be heated by blowing hot air, by being exposed to ultrasound vibrations or by heat transfer in contact with or in the proximity of a hot surface which, for example, is applied radially against the outer surface, in particular the end of a stick. The hot surface may also come into contact axially against the outer surface, in particular the end of the stick. The hot surface may have the shape of a bevel tip, an inverted cone or be concavely dished, in particular spherical.","The piece of product, especially the stick, may pass through the hot surface; to this end, it may be annular in shape.","The piece of product may be in the form of a stick, with the hot surface coming into contact with or facing the end face of the stick, for example.","Heating may take place only at the end of the stick, whereupon the hot surface does not, for example, cover the lateral surface of the stick.","The piece of product may initially be molded into the desired shape, for example into the shape of a stick, with no armature, as is the case with conventional lipsticks, or onto an armature and\/or a grasping portion, being supported at the end of a wand, for example.","The product may be heated while the piece of product is entirely contained in a packaging device.","During application, the user's fingers do not need to come into contact with the product.","The product may be heated while the piece of product is at least partially exposed to ambient air.","The outer surface of the product may be heated to a temperature Tof 40\u00b0 C. or more, or even 45\u00b0 C. or more, more preferably 50\u00b0 C. or more. The outer surface may be heated to a temperature Tin the range 40\u00b0 C. to 95\u00b0 C., preferably in the range 45\u00b0 C. to 85\u00b0 C., or more preferably in the range 45\u00b0 C. to 75\u00b0 C. The temperature of the application surface, in particular the end of the stick, must not be such as to run the risk of burning upon application. For this reason, a delay may possibly be necessary between the time at which the end is heated and application to the keratinous materials.","The temperature difference between the heated outer surface and the portion of the product that remains solid may be 5\u00b0 C. or more, or preferably 15\u00b0 C. or 20\u00b0 C. or more, at least at the start of application, or even 30\u00b0 C. or more.","Only the product can come into contact with the treated region during application.","During application, the piece of product may remain integral with a base portion comprising a mechanism that can displace the product mass relative to a surface of the base portion intended to be grasped by the user, especially a mechanism comprising two parts that can rotate with respect to each other.","The outer surface softened by the heating device may be supported by the piece of cosmetic composition that is solid at the moment of application. In a variation, the softened outer surface may be supported differently, after transfer onto a support serving for application. Thus, in one implementational example of the invention, the product may be heated and removed with an applicator or a finger in order to apply it to the skin or lips. The piece of product may be contained in a cup and the upper surface of the product present in the cup may then be heated up.","The heating device may or may not remain integral with the piece of cosmetic composition that is solid at the moment of application of the softened outer surface to the human keratinous materials.","In another aspect, the invention pertains to a device for packaging and application of a product in the form of a solid piece, especially a stick, comprising:\n\n","In other words, especially in the case of heat transfer by conduction, convection or infrared radiation, the heat is not transmitted to the application surface from the core of the piece of the product, but from the outside.","Advantageously, as mentioned above, the product may have a dynamic coefficient of friction of 0.5 or more at 25\u00b0 C., preferably 0.6 or more at 25\u00b0 C.","The heating device may be housed in a cap closure of the support in order to allow the outer surface to be heated with the cap in place on the support. The heating device may also be housed elsewhere than in the cap closure of the support.","The heating device may be accommodated in a housing onto which the support may be engaged such that heating can take place when the support is engaged in the housing, especially a housing comprising an opening into which the piece of solid product can be engaged, preferably without the entirety of the support being disposed inside the housing.","The heating device may be integral with the device for packaging and application.","The heating device may be arranged to come into contact with the outer surface.","The heating device may be arranged so that the piece of product can pass through it; in particular, it may comprise a hot surface which is annular in shape.","The heating device may comprise a control means allowing the user to control its operation. This control means may comprise a switch present on the support or on a cap closure of the support.","The heating device may comprise an electrical resistance to heat a surface that can come into contact with or into the proximity of the application surface.","The heating device may comprise an infrared emitter arranged to subject the application surface to infrared light in order to heat it, a means for emitting radioelectrical radiation that can raise the temperature of the outer surface, a fan to blow hot air onto the outer surface or a source of ultrasound to heat up the outer surface.","The heating device may also comprise at least two components that are capable of producing an exothermic reaction when mixed.","The piece of product may be in the shape of a stick and the outer surface may be defined by the end of the stick.","The heating device may comprise a source of electrical energy comprising one or more storage batteries or cells.","The heating device may comprise an electrical generator actuated by the user.","The heating device may comprise means for heating the piece of the composition to a pre-defined temperature despite wear of said piece. This means may comprise an elastically deformable member that ensures contact with or a constant distance between the outer surface to be heated and the heating device, compensating for wear of the piece of the composition.","If appropriate, these means may also comprise a temperature sensor that can be used to adjust the heating power, for example to increase it if the outer surface is further from the heat source.","In a further aspect, the invention also pertains to a method for making up and\/or for non-therapeutic care of non-fibrous human keratinous materials, in particular the skin, the mucous membranes or the nails, comprising the steps consisting of\n\n","Dynamic Coefficient of Friction","In order to characterize the dynamic coefficient of friction of the product, an apparatus may be used comprising a carriage which is displaced over a length of 100 mm on ball bearings.","Proper displacement of the carriage is ensured by means of a rigid linkage to the moving beam of a traction and compression machine (TAXT2 from the supplier Rheo) placed in the horizontal position via a magnet fixed to the rear of the carriage.","The product S, the dynamic coefficient of friction of which is to be determined, is cut at one end with a tungsten wire with a diameter of 250 \u03bcM by displacing the wire relative to the stick at a rate of 100 min\/min and perpendicular to its longitudinal axis in order to have a contact surface that is flat and parallel to the sliding surface W.","A force Fn normal to the sliding surface W is applied to it using a weight. This weight is such that the pressure exerted on the surface of the product S in contact with W is 7.9\u00d710MPa.","The product may be in the form of a stick that is a cylindrical body of revolution.","In the case in which the cross section of the stick is not circular, the stick is caused to slide in the direction of the minor axis of its section, displacing the major axis parallel thereto.","The coefficient of friction is defined as the ratio of the tangential force Ft applied to the body caused to move in the direction M over the normal force Fn to which that body is subjected, as illustrated in .","In a friction test, a first transitional phase when the motion of the system is starting up can be distinguished from a second phase under steady conditions.","In the first phase, the tangential force increases to a maximum that corresponds to the system beginning to move. This maximum corresponds to the static frictional force, termed static Ft, and can be used to define a static coefficient of friction (\u03bcs):\n\n\u03bc=static \n","where Fn is the normal force applied.","The tangential force Ft then decreases and generally reaches a more stable regime. The dynamic coefficient of friction is defined in this phase of movement as the ratio of the dynamic frictional force (tangential force) over the normal force applied (Fn):\n\n\u03bc=dynamic \n","The coefficient of friction is a dimensionless quantity, a function of the two surfaces in contact and the contact conditions.","The sliding surface is defined by artificial skin with reference \u201cBIO SKIN Plate Black K275\u201d from the supplier MACREPOS, with a width equal to or greater than that of the section of the stick.","For a measurement at 25\u00b0 C., the assembly formed by the apparatus and the composition is at 25\u00b0 C.","The artificial skin is placed on a support that may be heated to the temperature at which the dynamic coefficient of friction is to be measured. As an example, the stick initially at a temperature of 25\u00b0 C. is applied to the artificial skin heated, for example, to 45\u00b0 C. if the measurement is to be carried out at 45\u00b0 C. The temperature of the surface of the artificial skin may be monitored with an optical thermometer.","In certain embodiments, the dynamic coefficient of friction of a composition of the invention is 0.6 or more, or even 0.7 or 0.8, at 25\u00b0 C. The dynamic coefficient of friction at 25\u00b0 C. of the compositions of the invention may be 5 or less.","The stick may have a diameter of 12.7 mm at its contact zone with the sliding surface, but other values are possible, for example from 7 mm to 50 mm.","Hardness Parameter","The invention is of advantageous application to compositions that are relatively hard at ambient temperature and which become sufficiently soft under the action of heat to be applicable.","The hardness may be measured at 20\u00b0 C. using the \u201ccheese-wire\u201d method, which consists of transversely cutting a stick of product, preferably a cylindrical body of revolution, using a rigid tungsten wire with a diameter of 250 \u03bcm by displacing the wire relative to the stick at a rate of 100 mm\/min. The hardness corresponds to the maximum shear force created by the wire on the stick at 20\u00b0 C., that force being measured using a DFGHS 2 dynamometer from the supplier Indelco-Chatillon. The measurement is carried out three times then averaged.","The mean of the three values recorded using the dynamometer mentioned above, denoted Y, is given in grams. This mean is converted into Newtons then divided by L, which represents the largest dimension passed through by the wire. In the case of a cylindrical stick, L is equal to the diameter in meters.","The hardness is converted using the equation below:\n\n(10\u00d79.8)\/\n\nFor a measurement at a different temperature, the whole stick is heated to the temperature at which the hardness is to be measured.\n","In accordance with this method, the hardness at 20\u00b0 C. of examples of the composition in accordance with one aspect of the invention is greater than 80 Nm, in particular greater than 100 Nm, preferably greater than 120 Nm.","A composition of the invention is cosmetically or dermatologically acceptable, i.e. it contains a non-toxic physiologically acceptable medium that is capable of being applied to the lips of human beings. The term \u201ccosmetically acceptable\u201d as used in the context of the invention means a composition with an agreeable appearance, odor and feel, suitable for use in cosmetics.","In accordance with a variation, the cosmetic compositions under consideration of the invention further contain at least one colorizing agent. As will be defined below, this definition covers any organic or inorganic material that is capable of procuring a colored and\/or optical effect.","In accordance with another variation, the compositions of the invention may advantageously comprise at least 30% by weight of a fatty phase with respect to the total composition weight, especially at least 50% by weight, or even at least 70% by weight.","In accordance with another variation, the compositions of the invention comprise a fatty phase containing at least 5%, in particular at least 7% and especially at least 10% by weight of solid fats with respect to the total weight of the fatty phase, or even at least 20% by weight, or furthermore at least 30% by weight.","The term \u201csolid\u201d characterizes the state of the composition at ambient temperature (25\u00b0 C.) and at atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg).","Oil","The oil may be selected from any cosmetically acceptable oils, especially mineral, vegetable or synthetic oils; in particular hydrocarbon and\/or silicone and\/or fluorinated oils, volatile or non-volatile, and mixtures thereof.","In the context of the present invention, the term \u201csilicone oil\u201d means an oil comprising at least one silicon atom, and in particular at least one Si\u2014O group.","The term \u201cfluorinated oil\u201d means an oil comprising at least one fluorine atom.","More precisely, the term \u201chydrocarbon oil\u201d means an oil principally comprising atoms of carbon and hydrogen and optionally one or more functions selected from hydroxyl, ester, ether and carboxyl functions.","Glossy Oil","A composition according to the invention advantageously contains at least one glossy oil.","More precisely, the term \u201cglossy oil\u201d in the context of the invention means a hydrocarbon or silicone oil with a molecular mass of more than 400 g\/mol, or even more than 500 g\/mol, especially more than 650 g\/mol.

No. 6,340,258, U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,276, U.S. Pat. No. 6,371,673, U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,096 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,293,926, the contents of which are herewith incorporated by reference.","The cap  comprises a heating device  that can heat up the end  of the stick S prior to applying it to the keratinous materials, for example the skin or lips.","The heating device  may house a source of electricity, not shown, for example containing one or more storage batteries or cells, and a heating means comprising, for example, an electrical resistance supplied by the source of electricity.","Examples of heating means that may be suitable are disclosed in US 2007\/0 286 665 A1, for example.","The heating means is disposed so as to raise the temperature of a heating surface  which, in the example shown in , can come into contact with the stick S as shown in  in order to raise the temperature of the distal end  thereof.","The heating device  may comprise a switch  that enables the user to start or stop the heating device  as well as an operating indicator , for example a light that illuminates when the heating surface  is being heated.","The heating device  may optionally comprise any means for regulating the temperature of the heating surface , so that it does not exceed a predefined value.","When the heating surface is inaccessible to the user, a higher heating temperature that, however, is compatible with the product may be allowed. In contrast, when the heating surface  can be touched by the user, a temperature not exceeding 65\u00b0 C. is preferred.","The heating device  may also if necessary incorporate a delay time which means that the end  of the stick S can only be heated up for a predefined period, in order to avoid premature wear of the source of electrical energy and\/or to avoid heating the entire stick to an excessive temperature.","The heating device  may advantageously comprise any sensor that is suitable that can only start up the heating function in the case of effective contact of the heating surface with the end  of the stick S.","As an example, the heating device  may comprise a contact pressure sensor between the heating surface  and the stick S, and only allow the heating surface  to be heated when contact with the stick S is confirmed.","The heating surface  may, for example, be defined by a contact part , which is, for example, axially movable along the axis X relative to the body  of the heating device  against the resilience of an elastic return means  such as a spring, for example, housed inside the contact part , as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0458","num":"0531"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["25","20","13"]},"The contact part  may, for example, comprise a metal that is a good conductor of heat, with a small wall thickness, in order to have a low thermal inertia. In certain embodiments, the contact part  may, for example, comprise aluminum.","The heating surface  may have any shape adapted to the geometry of the end  of the stick, for example a bevel tip shape substantially complementary to the shape of the end  of the stick S, as illustrated in , or another shape, for example a shape that is concave towards the stick S, in particular in the shape of a spherical hood as illustrated in , a conical or truncated cone shape as illustrated in  or a substantially planar shape perpendicular to the axis X, as illustrated in .","When the shape of the heating surface  is not a symmetrical body of revolution about the axis X, the device  may comprise means for rotational indexing of the base portion  and cap  so as to allow the cap  to be fixed on the base portion  only in a predefined angular orientation between the two, in which the heating surface  can be applied in a predefined manner, compatible with its geometry, against the stick S.","The stick S which is, for example, a stick of a lipstick, may have a section in the range 0.1 to 5 cmor even in the range 0.15 to 1 cm, and the device  may be used by initially switching on the heating device  and waiting for the period necessary for the end  of the stick that defines the application surface to be heated to the desired temperature.","Coming up to temperature may, for example, be indicated by the light  which may, for example, change from a continuously illuminated state indicating that the device has been switched on to a flashing illumination or color change when the temperature is reached. Other methods for indicating the state of illumination may be used without departing from the scope of the invention.","Once the end of the stick has heated up, the base portion  can be separated from the cap  and the user can apply the product from the stick onto the lips or other keratinous materials. Softening of the product at the end  of the stick ensures comfortable application, good transfer onto the lips with a thick deposit that may be glossy on application.","As an example, the application may be carried out without using an applicator. In other words, only the composition, and more precisely the softened surface, is brought into direct contact with the region to be treated.","The body of the stick S is at ambient temperature or at a slightly higher but insufficient temperature to compromise the mechanical strength necessary to withstand the mechanical forces engendered by application. The difference in temperature between the application surface and the body of the stick, in particular at the end opposite to the application surface, is at least 20\u00b0 C., for example, or even at least 30\u00b0 C. when the stick is at its initial length, when used for the first time.","The device  may be used in a similar manner when making up the skin, whereupon the stick may have a larger section if appropriate.","The heating device does not have to be incorporated into a cap  of the packaging device, but be present in a housing  that is distinct from the device for packaging the stick S, as illustrated in .","The housing  may house an electrical source and\/or comprise a means for connection to an electrical source, for example the mains via a low voltage transformer.","The housing  may also comprise start means  such as a start\/stop switch, as well as one or more lights  and  to indicate that it is connected to the power supply and\/or when the operating temperature is reached.","In the example of , the housing  comprises an opening  in which the base portion  may be introduced at least partially as illustrated in , in order to bring the end  of the stick close to a heating means  present in the housing .","The opening  has a section, for example, that is adapted to one of the parts of the base portion such that engaging that base portion in the housing brings the end  of the stick into a predefined position, in at least two directions in space, relative to the heating means.","The housing  may comprise any suitable sensor  that can detect positioning of the base portion  on the housing  and possibly the positioning of the stick relative to the heating means.","Heating the end of the stick S may take place by conduction, in contact with a hot surface, in the manner described above. In this case, the heating means comprises a heating surface that can be heated to an adequate temperature using any heating means, for example an electrical resistance.","The end of the stick may also be heated without contact, for example by IR radiation and\/or convection, and\/or by vibrations and\/or radioelectrical radiation or any other source providing heat.","As mentioned above, the housing  may comprise any suitable sensor, especially optical, capable of evaluating the distance between the end  of the stick and the heating means  in order to ensure that it cannot be switched on until a predefined distance has been reached and\/or to regulate the heating power as a function of the separation between the heating means and the end of the stick S.","In certain variations, the heating means  may be a system for heating by emitting infrared radiation towards the end  of the stick, for example by means of a halogen or incandescent lamp, or by blowing hot air towards the end .","In certain variations, the end  of the stick S may also be heated up by exposure to radioelectrical radiation, for example microwaves, focused at the end  of the stick S.","In yet more variations, the end  of the stick S may be heated up by ultrasound vibrations.","In the variation of , the heating device  comprises a heating means  that is integral with the base portion  and which may comprise, as illustrated, an annular-shaped heating means , through which the stick S can pass. The heating means  has, for example, a section that is greater than or equal to that of the stick S.","The heating device  may, for example, comprise a control means  which the user can press to start the operation of the heating means . The heating means  may, for example, comprise a heating resistor that can heat up the end  of the stick S by conduction, convection and\/or radiation (for example infrared, microwaves, etc.).","If necessary, the heating means  may also participate in application of the product associated with the stick S and to this end may have an upper face  of suitable shape, for example beveled.","In order to use the device in the example under consideration, the user can bring the end  of the stick to the heating means  and start heating by pressing the control means .","The heating device may comprise an indicator light  indicating the operation of the heating means  to the user.","The user may then interrupt heating when it can be visually ascertained that the end  of the stick has changed appearance following the rise in temperature, and for example has become glossy.","At that moment, the user can optionally then displace the end  a little further upwards in order to facilitate application of the product, without contact with the heating means . In a variation, the user can apply the product by bringing not only the stick S but also the heating means  into contact with the lips or the skin.","If necessary, the surface of the heating means  that can come into contact with the skin may be flocked or have a textured surface appearance facilitating application.","In the variation illustrated in , the stick S passes through a heating means  defining an opening  with a smaller section with respect to the section of the body of the stick.","In this example, softening of the stick S in contact with the heating means  may then be accompanied by deformation of the stick through the heating means . This can increase the accuracy of application of the product and prevent the stick S from being advanced so far with respect to the heating means  that sufficient softening is not achieved.","The outer surface of the heating means  may be tapered, as illustrated in , in order to reduce the contact surface between the treated region and the heating means .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0491","num":"0564"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":"200"},"The application surface  is heated up, for example, by being brought into contact with or close to a hot surface, for example by introducing it into a housing provided with a heating means such as the housing described above with reference to .","In the examples below, the percentages by weight are indicated with respect to the total composition weight.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0494","num":"0567"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Function","% by weight"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Phase A","Preservative",{},"0.06"]},{"entry":[{},"Diisostearyl malate ","glossy oil","5.0"]},{"entry":[{},"Bis-diglyceryl polyacyladipate-2 ","pasty","11.15"]},{"entry":[{},"1,3,5-trimethyl 1,1,3,5,5-pentaphenyl trisiloxane ","glossy oil","28.55"]},{"entry":[{},{},"glossy oil","16"]},{"entry":[{},"Hydrogenated castor oil\/sebacic acid copolymer ","fluid oil","5.05"]},{"entry":[{},"Phenyl trimethicone "]},{"entry":["Phase B","Iron oxides (and) iron oxides","pigment","4.30"]},{"entry":[{},"Blue 1 lake",{},"1.3"]},{"entry":[{},"Titanium dioxide",{},"1.79"]},{"entry":[{},"Red 28 lake",{},"2.60"]},{"entry":["Phase C","Microcrystalline wax ","wax","3.10"]},{"entry":[{},"(hydroxystearyloxy)Calkyl stearate ","wax","3.10"]},{"entry":["Phase D","Hydrogenated castor oil dimer dilinoleate ",{},"5"]},{"entry":[{},"Hydrogenated castor oil isostearate ","pasty","5"]},{"entry":[{},"VP\/EICOSENE COPOLYMER ",{},"5"]},{"entry":["Phase E","HDI\/trimethylol hexyllactone crosspolymer","filler","5"]},{"entry":[{},"TOTAL",{},"100"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"(1) "}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":"(2) "}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":"(3) "}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00004"},"sup":"(4) "}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00005"},"sup":"(5) "}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00006"},"sup":"(6) "}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00007"},"sup":"(7) "}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00008"},"sup":"(8) "}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00009"},"sup":"(9) "}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00010"},"sup":"(10) "}}]}}]}}},"The ingredients of phase A were added to a pan.
