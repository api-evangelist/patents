{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61\/388,107 filed Sep. 30, 2010 entitled \u201cA Process for Characterization of Geometry on 2D and 3D Datasets Using Boxcounting,\u201d the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.","Various industries rely on computer-based modeling applications to perform tasks related to research, development, economics, etc. Such applications often include features for data interpretation, model generation, model refinement and model-based simulation. For reservoir modeling in the oil and gas industries, a seismic to simulation application may provide interactive tools that allow a user to load and interpret seismic data, for example, to identify geologic features such as facies, geobodies, etc. Such interactive tools often render information to a display to allow a user to visually inspect and interpret the data. Depending on experience and level of expertise, visual inspection and interpretation can be time consuming. For example, where an application performs ant tracking as a tool to visually enhance features in seismic data, a user may iteratively adjust one or more ant tracking parameters in an effort to optimize the enhancement algorithm and ultimately facilitate interpretation. In turn, interpretation can be used for model generation, model refinement and model-based simulation. Accordingly, a faulty or suboptimal interpretation can confound subsequent workflow efforts. According to an embodiment, various technologies and techniques provide for analysis of data, which may be actual data, processed data, simulation data, etc. Such technologies and techniques may increase accuracy of visual-based data interpretation and expedite workflows.","A method can include performing box counting on an optimal or base data set and performing box counting on a test data set where the box counting provides parameter values that allow for an objective comparison of the test data set to the base data set. In turn, additional test data sets may be provided until parameter values for a test data set and the base data set are within a pretermined threshold. Such a method may optionally be applied to processes that rely on subjective judgment, for example, as judged via visual comparison of data sets. Various other apparatuses, systems, methods, etc., are also disclosed.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The following description includes the best mode presently contemplated for practicing the described implementations. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but rather is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the implementations. The scope of the described implementations should be ascertained with reference to the issued claims.","As described in various examples herein, box counting can characterize a spatial distribution of a property in a dataset. Such characterization can provide one or more parameters values that allow for expeditious comparison and decision making. One parameter described herein is referred to as a \u201cfractal dimension\u201d, or more formally, the Minkowski-Bouligand dimension, Minkowski dimension or box counting dimension (e.g., estimate of a fractal dimension of a set in a Euclidean space). Another parameter described herein is a regression coefficient or fit coefficient, which may be based on fitting box counting values to a model such as a line. Further, according to an embodiment, a parameter may be directional, for example, to characterize isotropy or anisotropy.","In general, one or more parameters stemming from a box counting analysis can be used to classify multidimensional data (e.g., 2D images, 3D volumes, etc.) according to a spatial distribution of one or more properties, where box counting may be performed in a single dimension or in multiple dimensions. Values for the one or more parameters can be used as quality indicators, classification metrics, identification metrics, workflow triggers, etc. For example, regarding workflow triggers, a subsequent workflow process may depend on a parameter value meeting a trigger criterion, which may be a data quality criterion, a data enhancement quality criterion, etc.","In the realm of subsurface geological analysis, one or more parameters associated with a box counting process may be quality indicators for seismic processing and facies simulation. For example, parameters values obtained from a box counting process may indicate similarity between an optimum or base case and different simulations cases in an iterative optimization process. As the number of simulation cases may be quite large (e.g., greater than about 10 and possibly greater than about 100), visual inspection may be impractical. Accordingly, such a process may output information as to a top 5 simulation cases (e.g., or other suitable number) and allow for rendering information to a display for visual inspection and optionally selection of a best simulation case. According to an embodiment, a best simulation case may be used as a seed for further simulation cases (e.g., using a simulation parameter value generation process that relies on one or more parameter values of the best case).","According to an embodiment, a box counting analysis can characterize a geometrical distribution of one or more properties in data, whether actual data, processed data, simulation data, etc., using one or more parameters. In turn, values for parameters can be used as, or to generate, signatures of the data. For example, a parameter value by itself may be a signature of a property in a data set, or two parameter values may be combined using an equation (e.g., optionally a weighted equation) to provide a signature of a property in a data set. Yet further, where multiple properties are of interest, a signature for a data set may depend on parameter values for each of the properties (e.g., via an equation that depends on a box counting parameter value for a first property of a data set, a box counting parameter value for a second property of a data set, etc.). Where a subsurface volume has multiple associated data sets, property analysis for each data set may be performed where a signature optionally depends on values from each property analysis.","According to an embodiment, a box counting process can characterize data and output one or more parameters that are quality indicators for an image or a volume, classifiers for an image or a volume, identifiers for an image or a volume, etc. With respect to geometries, data may include features representative of complex geometries.","According to an embodiment, a box counting process can output one or more quality indicators to optimize one or more other processes. For example, a box counting process may output image parameter values as quality indicators to control a process that enhances images for seismic structural interpretation or a process that performs a facies population analysis.","Structural interpretation of reflection seismic data is an activity that may be carried out in a number of industries (e.g., oil and gas exploration and development, mining, water development, waste management, COsequestration, etc.). Structural interpretation may be carried out on seismic sections and may involve interpretation of faults and\/or of seismic horizons. An approach to facilitate and accelerate structural interpretation may include running structural enhancement processes over the seismic data as to highlight the faults (e.g., consider ant tracking, variance cube, etc.). These structural enhancement processes may involve optimization of a number of variables, which may be commonly carried out through an iterative process that is validated by visual analysis of the resulting seismic volume.","According to an embodiment, a box counting process can be implemented where resulting cross plot and fractal dimension values serve as parameters that characterize the visual quality of the seismic information. In turn, seismic enhancement process variables can be iterated so as to optimize, for example, a fractal dimension parameter value or one or more other parameter values.","As to facies population analysis, for a field of 3D modeling properties (e.g., for geologic modeling and reservoir simulation), many different algorithms exist. Such different algorithms may have a number of control variables and a final result may be validated by visual verification.","According to an embodiment, a box counting process may be performed on a resulting 2D or 3D property model where output from box counting is cross plotted and a fractal dimension value determined as at least one parameter to characterize the spatial distribution of one or more properties of the property model. In turn, property population process variables can be iterated as to optimize, for example, a fractal dimension parameter value or one or more other parameter values or any particular combination of parameter values.","To facilitate explanation of various examples of box counting and related processes,  shows an example of a system  that includes various management components  to manage various aspects of a geologic environment . For example, the management components  may allow for direct or indirect management of sensing, drilling, injecting, extracting, etc., with respect to the geologic environment . In turn, further information about the geologic environment  may become available as feedback  (e.g., optionally as input to one or more of the management components ).","In the example of , the geologic environment  may be outfitted with any of a variety of sensors, detectors, actuators, etc. For example, equipment  may include communication circuitry to receive and to transmit information with respect to one or more networks . Such information may include information associated with downhole equipment , which may include equipment to acquire information, to assist with resource recovery, etc. Other equipment  may be located remote from a well site and include sensing, detecting, emitting or other circuitry. Such equipment may include storage and communication circuitry to store and to communicate data, instructions, etc.","As to the management components  of , these may include a seismic data component , an information component , a pre-simulation processing component , a simulation component , an attribute component , a post-simulation processing component , an analysis\/visualization component  and a workflow component . In operation, seismic data and other information provided per the components  and  may be input to the simulation component , optionally with pre-simulation processing via the processing component  and optionally with post-simulation processing via the processing component .","According to an embodiment, the simulation component  may rely on entities . Entities  may include earth entities or geological objects such as wells, surfaces, reservoirs, etc. In the system , the entities  may include virtual representations of actual physical entities that are reconstructed for purposes of simulation. The entities  may be based on data acquired via sensing, observation, etc. (e.g., the seismic data  and other information ).","According to an embodiment, the simulation component  may rely on a software framework such as an object-based framework. In such a framework, entities may be based on pre-defined classes to facilitate modeling and simulation. A commercially available example of an object-based framework is the MICROSOFT\u00ae .NET\u2122 framework (Redmond, Wash.), which provides a set of extensible object classes. In the .NET\u2122 framework, an object class encapsulates a module of reusable code and associated data structures. Object classes can be used to instantiate object instances for use in by a program, script, etc. For example, borehole classes may define objects for representing boreholes based on well data.","In the example of , the simulation component  may process information to conform to one or more attributes specified by the attribute component , which may include a library of attributes. Such processing may occur prior to input to the simulation component . Alternatively, or in addition to, the simulation component  may perform operations on input information based on one or more attributes specified by the attribute component . According to an embodiment, the simulation component  may construct one or more models of the geologic environment , which may be relied on to simulate behavior of the geologic environment  (e.g., responsive to one or more acts, whether natural or artificial). In the example of , the analysis\/visualization component  may allow for interaction with a model or model-based results. Additionally, or alternatively, output from the simulation component  may be input to one or more other workflows, as indicated by a workflow component . Further, dotted lines indicate possible feedback within the management components . For example, feedback may occur between the analysis\/visualization component  and either one of the processing components  and .","According to an embodiment, the management components  may include features of a commercially available simulation framework such as the PETREL\u00ae seismic to simulation software framework (Schlumberger Limited, Houston, Tex.). The PETREL\u00ae framework provides components that allow for optimization of exploration and development operations. The PETREL\u00ae framework includes seismic to simulation software components that can output information for use in increasing reservoir performance, for example, by improving asset team productivity. Through use of such a framework, various professionals (e.g., geophysicists, geologists, and reservoir engineers) can develop collaborative workflows and integrate operations to streamline processes. Such a framework may be considered an application and may be considered a data-driven application (e.g., where data is input for purposes of simulating a geologic environment).","According to an embodiment, the management components  may include features for geology and geological modeling to generate high-resolution geological models of reservoir structure and stratigraphy (e.g., classification and estimation, facies modeling, well correlation, surface imaging, structural and fault analysis, well path design, data analysis, fracture modeling, workflow editing, uncertainty and optimization modeling, petrophysical modeling, etc.). Particular features may allow for performance of rapid 2D and 3D seismic interpretation, optionally for integration with geological and engineering tools (e.g., classification and estimation, well path design, seismic interpretation, seismic attribute analysis, seismic sampling, seismic volume rendering, geobody extraction, domain conversion, etc.). As to reservoir engineering, for a generated model, one or more features may allow for simulation workflow to perform streamline simulation, reduce uncertainty and assist in future well planning (e.g., uncertainty analysis and optimization workflow, well path design, advanced gridding and upscaling, history match analysis, etc.). The management components  may include features for drilling workflows including well path design, drilling visualization, and real-time model updates (e.g., via real-time data links).","According to an embodiment, various aspects of the management components  may be add-ons or plug-ins that operate according to specifications of a framework environment. For example, a commercially available framework environment marketed as the OCEAN\u00ae framework environment (Schlumberger Limited, Houston, Tex.) allows for seamless integration of add-ons (or plug-ins) into a PETREL\u00ae framework workflow. The OCEAN\u00ae framework environment leverages .NET\u00ae tools (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash.) and offers stable, user-friendly interfaces for efficient development. According to an embodiment, various components may be implemented as add-ons (or plug-ins) that conform to and operate according to specifications of a framework environment (e.g., according to application programming interface (API) specifications, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["170","180","190","195","175","170","180"]},"The model simulation layer  may provide domain objects , act as a data source , provide for rendering  and provide for various user interfaces . Rendering  may provide a graphical environment in which applications can display their data while the user interfaces  may provide a common look and feel for all application user interface components.","In the example of , the domain objects  can include entity objects, property objects and optionally other objects. Entity objects may be used to geometrically represent wells, surfaces, reservoirs, etc., while property objects may be used to provide property values as well as data versions and display parameters. For example, an entity object may represent a well where a property object provides log information as well as version information and display information (e.g., to display the well as part of a model).","In the example of , data may be stored in one or more data sources (or data stores, generally physical data storage devices), which may be at the same or different physical sites and accessible via one or more networks. The model simulation layer  may be configured to model projects. As such, a particular project may be stored where stored project information may include inputs, models, results and cases. Thus, upon completion of a modeling session, a user may store a project. At a later time, the project can be accessed and restored using the model simulation layer , which can recreate instances of the relevant domain objects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","220","230","230","232","234","236"]},"As an example of implementing the method , consider a scenario where the box counting block  performs a block counting process on data of a base case, where the base case represents an optimal or near optimal case, and outputs one or more metrics that characterize the base case (e.g., a fractal dimension value and a regression coefficient value). Given such a base case, a user may desire the ability to generate results via simulation that are characteristically as close as possible to the base case. Accordingly, a simulator may be implemented to generate a number of simulation cases, for example, to be provided to the box counting block  per the provision block . The box counting block  may then perform a block counting process on each one of the simulation cases and output metrics (e.g., one or more parameter values) that characterize each of the simulation cases.","As shown in the example of , given box counting based metrics for the base case and the simulation cases, a comparison block  can perform a comparison based on these metrics. Such a comparison may include ranking each of the simulation cases based on its respective characteristic \u201ccloseness\u201d to the base case. For example, given two metrics that characterize each case, the metrics may be plotted on a 2D plot and the simulation cases may be ranked based on Euclidean distance from the base case. Such an approach may apply to a single metric or to more than two metrics, as dimensionality does not impede a \u201ccloseness' comparison. Further, according to an embodiment, weighting may be implemented to weight one or more metrics with respect to other metrics. For example, a regression coefficient may be of lesser meaning or significance than fractal dimension, accordingly an equation may be employed that provides a single metric as a function of fractal dimension multiplied by a first weight and regression coefficient multiplied by a second weight where the second weight is less than the first weight. In turn, metrics may be compared along a single dimension (e.g., plotted along a line).","The method  of  may proceed to a selection block  that selects a best simulation case based on output of the comparison block  or, alternatively or additionally, the method  may proceed to a feedback block  where output from the comparison block  serves as feedback to the provision block  to provide one or more additional simulation cases. For example, the feedback block  may provide or adjust one or more simulation parameters for generation of additional simulation cases). Accordingly, the method  may operate in an iterative manner to achieve an optimal result. For example, the comparison block  may include an error limit that once a difference between a base case metric (or metrics) and a simulation case metric (or metrics) falls below that limit, the method  terminates in the selection block .","As to visual inspection to validate results, if the data lends itself to such inspection, the method  may include a render block that renders information to a display, for example, at a level of the box counting block , the comparison block , the feedback block  or the selection block . Upon rendering, a graphic or other control may be available to a user to interact with the method, for example, to allow the method to proceed, to terminate, to repeat one or more blocks, etc. For example, if none of the simulation cases appear close to the base case, a user may simply terminate the method and perform additional simulations using simulation parameter values based on experience, help instruction, input from others, etc. After such simulations, the method may be reinitiated.","The method  is shown in  in association with various computer-readable media (CRM) blocks , , , , and . Such blocks generally may include instructions suitable for execution by one or more processors (or cores) to instruct a computing device or system to perform one or more actions. While various blocks are shown, a single medium may be configured with instructions to allow for, at least in part, performance of various actions of the method .","According to an embodiment, a method can include providing spatial data for a base case of a subsurface geologic formation; providing spatial data for a simulation case of the subsurface geologic formation; performing box counting for the spatial data for the base case; performing box counting for the spatial data for the simulation case; based on the box counting for the spatial data for the base case, determining a fractal dimension for the base case; based on the box counting for the spatial data for the simulation case, determining a fractal dimension for the simulation case; comparing the simulation case to the base case based at least in part on the fractal dimensions; and, based on the comparing, adjusting one or more simulation parameters to generate spatial data for an additional simulation case of the subsurface geologic formation. In such a method, the providing spatial data for a base case can optionally include providing seismic data for the subsurface geologic formation.","According to an embodiment, a method can include determining a fractal dimension for a base case and determining a fractal dimension for a simulation case and determining a regression coefficient corresponding to a relationship between a characteristic of a box counting shape and a number of the shapes occupied by a spatial data feature. As to a characteristic of a box counting shape, this may be a size dimension, an area dimension or other dimension related to how the shape covers or occupies one or more dimensions in the spatial domain of the data.","According to an embodiment, spatial data for a base case and spatial data for a simulation case may be one-dimensional spatial data, spatial data for at least a base case may be multi-dimensional spatial data, or dimensionality of a box counting shape may differ from dimensionality of spatial data of a base case.","According to an embodiment, a method can include generation of an optimal case as a seismic section, an image representing a positive or a negative result, an image, or a properties map on a 2D data case, a seismic volume or a 3D properties volume in a 3D data case, etc. Such a generation process may generate an optimized case (e.g., a seismic interpreted section or a user drawn map) that can be used to extract optimal case parameters (e.g., a fractal dimension value) when running a box counting process.","According to an embodiment, a box counting process can produce a cross plot and a fractal dimension value. Further, a regression coefficient may be calculated. Such a process can be carried out in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions to generate a box counting cross plot, a fractal dimension value and a regression coefficient for data.","As mentioned, cases may be provided for comparison to an optimal case. Such cases may be simulation cases, processed data cases, different measured data cases, etc. For example, processed data cases may be based on the same actual data of the optimal case but with filtering applied, a different transform applied, etc.; whereas, for different measured data cases, data may be provided that was acquired at a different time, by a different person, using different equipment, etc. Accordingly, a comparison need not necessarily involve simulation cases (e.g., the block  of the method  may provide cases other than simulation cases). Some examples of techniques for case generation or case variation include seismic processing techniques, image enhancement techniques, and property modeling techniques.","According to an embodiment, different cases can be analyzed via box counting where resulting parameter values can be compared with one or more values for an optimal case. Feedback may be possible based on a comparison, for example, to adjust control variables for one or more additional simulations, enhancements, data acquisitions, etc., in an effort to reduce the difference in parameter values. For example, where data acquisition is involved, an instruction may be communicated to a field engineer or to field equipment that instructs the engineer or equipment to acquire additional data (or replacement data). Such a process may include one or more parameter values (e.g., equipment settings) in an effort to increase reliability or accuracy of the data to be acquired.","According to an embodiment, a method can include generation of an optimal case, running a box counting process for the optimal case and storing parameter values, running a box counting process using initialized random values of variables for an additional case and storing parameter values for the additional case, and providing information as to the difference between the parameter values for the optimal case and the additional case. Such a method may be repeated until the difference is acceptable (e.g., based on a predetermined error limit, a failure to reduce error upon a subsequent iteration or iterations, etc.).","In an embodiment, a method can include box counting and fractal analysis as tools to synthesize complex information of a 2D image (e.g., seismic cross section, map) or a 3D properties volume (e.g., seismic volume, properties volume) into a number of parameters, data or both parameters and data. Such parameters and data may be relatively simple to calculate and optionally visualize and thereby provide for synthesizing complex information into less complex information that may be more easily understood (e.g., via visual or other inspection). As examples, parameters can include a box counting cross plot (e.g., resulting from 1D, 2D and 3D box counting), a fractal dimension value (e.g., resulting from 1D, 2D and 3D box counting), a regression coefficient as a value of fit between data of a cross plot and a linear regression (e.g., resulting from 1D, 2D and 3D box counting).","Such a synthesis, from a complex spatial distribution to relatively simple parameters, allows one to resolve, for example, the problem of optimizing the parameters of an image enhancement process by using some simple parameters as quality control for this process instead of using a full image visual comparison.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","345","300","310","320","330","310","320","340","345"]},"In the example of , the GUI  renders a base case and three simulation cases A, B and C. For each case, two metrics are presented along with a visual representation of associated data. In this particular example, the metrics are fractal dimension Dand regression coefficient R. Upon visual inspection, a user may deem simulation case A as the best of the simulation cases (i.e., closest to the base case). Such an interpretation may be confirmed or identified as being of increased confidence based on a comparison of the metrics, particularly the fractal dimension values (e.g., Dfor Case A is 1.364 and closest to Dfor the base case, which is 1.236).","In the example of , the GUI  further includes a graphic control menu  that allows for user interaction, for example, to view parameters and optionally simulate more cases like a particular case (e.g., such as simulation case A). For example, a user may select the best of the simulation cases and then initiate further simulation of cases based on the best (e.g., \u201csimulate more like this\u201d). Such an approach may use one or more values of the best simulation case as a seed value that can be used to generate values for additional simulations (e.g., via a process that randomly generates values about a seed value).","The method  is shown in  in association with various computer-readable media (CRM) blocks , , , and .

Such an approach can be beneficial if the fractal properties are of particular interest, for example, associated with a property or a feature (e.g., a subsurface formation such as a fault, a resource, etc.).","The GUI  illustrates a truncated fit range between a lower size limit Sand an upper size limit S.

As indicated in the lower representations, a fractal dimension for vertical and horizontal directions have been determined as well as a ratio. According to an embodiment, a ratio or ratios or other metric that relies on directional fractal dimensions may indicate anisotropy or isotropy of data. As an example, a user may inspect 2D images such as those presented by the GUI  in conjunction with values, metrics, etc., to decide on subsequent action for an analysis or, more generally, for a workflow. As mentioned, subsequent action may include data acquisition, data enhancement, simulation, etc.","For the example GUI  of , 2D images for data sets were sliced into seven 1D lines equally distributed in a horizontal direction and in a vertical direction (e.g., directional lines). A box counting process to provide a fractal dimension was performed for each of the 1D lines for each image. Next, resulting fractal dimensions for the vertical lines were added and resulting fractal dimensions for the horizontal lines were added. Next, the sum for the vertical lines was divided by the number of vertical lines to provide an average fractal dimension for the vertical direction and the sum for the horizontal lines was divided by the number of horizontal lines to provide an average fractal dimension for the horizontal direction. As an example of a metric (e.g., indicative of isotropy), the average dimension for the horizontal direction was divided by the average dimension for the vertical direction. This metric is a ratio that may be an indicator of isotropy or anisotropy. For example, if this ratio is close to unity, then the data tends to be isotropic. Where the two directions are orthogonal, as in the example of , a ratio that deviates from unity may indicate that the data tends to be anisotropic. As shown in the example of , the features in the image on the right are more isotropic (D\/D=1.01) than the features in the image on the left (D\/D=1.31), which tends to be more anisotropic.","According to an embodiment, a prominent direction for anisotropic data may be indicated by comparing magnitudes of box counting dimensions for various directions. For example, the image on the left appears to have more horizontal features than vertical features and the fractal dimension for the horizontal lines exceeds the fractal dimension for the vertical lines. Such fractal values, or metrics based thereon, may be provided as input to a process, for example, to reduce number of iterations, reduce process time, etc. (e.g., where a single direction provides for acceptable comparison, use of that single direction may act to optimize a process). According to an embodiment, a method may perform box counting for a number of directions (e.g., angles selected from 0 degrees to 179 degrees) and then compare fractal dimensions for the directions to determine a prominent direction. Once determined, a prominent direction may be relied on to characterize data or to perform one or more additional actions (e.g., adjustment of one or more variables for generation of test cases, etc.).","The method  and the GUI  are shown in  in association with various computer-readable media (CRM) blocks , ,  and .

As an example, ant tracking can be used to increase accuracy while reducing subjective manual fault interpretation burdens when seeking to understand trends of fault surfaces and fluid flow properties across fault systems for reservoir characterization.","In the example of , a process for ant tracking may include a data enhancement block  to enhance data (e.g., via edge detection, noise reduction, etc.), a generation block  to generate an ant track cube (e.g., based on ant number, etc.), and an extraction block  to extract ant tracked features (e.g., via post-track filtering, etc.). Accordingly, an ant tracking process can include various parameters that require judicious selection to produce an acceptable result. According to an embodiment, the method  can assist with parameter selection and optionally reduce manual intervention whether for selecting parameters or for visually analyzing results.","In the example of , the base case may be a data set to which variations of ant tracking are applied. Further, providing a base case may also provide a base case parameter value or values for use in selecting an optimal variation of the ant tracking variations. For example, providing a base case may include providing a data set that has been analyzed using a subjective process (e.g., an expert analysis) and thereafter an objective process such as box counting to determine a parameter value or values that characterize the subjective process. In selecting an optimal variation, one or more parameter values may be determined for each of the variations, based at least in part on box counting, and these values may be compared to each other, to a base case value or values or a combination thereof (e.g., to each other and a base case).","According to an embodiment, the method  is shown in  in association with various computer-readable media (CRM) blocks , , , , and .

As to measured data, such data may be raw or processed data from measurements performed in a lab, in the field, etc. As to subjective analysis data or subjective process data, such data may be data resulting from a subjective analysis of other data, for example, via a visual analysis where manual interaction may be involved to enhance, identify, or extract features within the data. A subjective analysis may be considered an expert analysis, for example, when performed by a person with years of experience. According to an embodiment, various processes may be tailored based on results that stem, at least in part, from subjective, expert analyses.","A synthetic seismogram represents forward modeling of a seismic response of geologic model based at least in part on variations in actual physical properties of a geologic formation. A synthetic seismogram may be used, for example, to tie changes in rock properties in a borehole and seismic reflection data acquired via the borehole. A synthetic seismogram can also be used to test possible interpretation models seismic data or to model response of a predicted geology (e.g., optionally to aid planning of a survey). A synthetic seismogram process can optionally include wavelet extraction from seismic data where wavelet extraction involves trying various combinations of extraction parameters.

Such blocks generally include instructions suitable for execution by one or more processors (or cores) to instruct a computing device or system to perform one or more actions. While various blocks are shown, a single medium may be configured with instructions to allow for, at least in part, performance of various actions of the method .","According to an embodiment, one or more computer-readable media can include processor-executable instructions to instruct a computing system to: receive a parameter value for a base case; perform box counting on generated test cases to determine a parameter value for each of the test cases; select an optimal test case based on a comparison of the parameter values of the test cases and the parameter value of the base case; decide whether a difference between the parameter value of the selected optimal test case and the parameter value of the base case exceeds an error limit; adjust one or more generation parameters if the difference exceeds the error limit; and generate additional test cases based on one or more adjusted generation parameters.

Further, such instructions may include instructions to instruct a computing system to continue a workflow process if the difference does not exceed the error limit. According to an embodiment, a workflow process may optionally be a process associated with the geologic environment  of  (e.g., sensing, drilling, injecting, extracting, modeling, simulating, etc.).","According to an embodiment, box counting can be carried out in one or more dimensions (e.g., 1D or higher dimensionality) and optionally various directions. An image or a volume of a property may be used as input to a box counting process, for example, where the image or the volume is sliced in several 1D lines (horizontal, vertical or maximum and minimum continuity). A process can optionally include averaging fractal dimensions, where fractal dimensions for maximum continuity and minimum continuity directions may be calculated. An analysis can optionally include calculating a ratio of maximum and minimum continuity values.","According to an embodiment, a parameter for characterizing data may be lacunarity, which is a measure of how a fractal fills space. As a parameter, lacunarity can classify fractals and textures which, while sharing the same fractal dimension, appear visually different. In general, dense fractals have a low lacunarity and, as the coarseness of the fractal increases, so does the lacunarity (e.g., more and larger gaps give a higher lacunarity). Lacunarity of a data set can be calculated using, for example, a gliding box counting process. A gliding or sliding box counting process may be a point, pixel, voxel, etc., centered process that generates one or more histograms for determination of lacunarity (e.g., as a ratio of expectation values). In some instances, a linear relationship may exist between fractal dimension and lacunarity, for example: D=A\u2212B\u03bb, where \u03bb is lacunarity (see, e.g., Borys, P. \u201cOn the relation between lacunarity and fractal dimension\u201d, Acta Physica Polonica B, Vol. 40 (2009), which is incorporated by reference herein). According to an embodiment, such an equation, and optionally a regression coefficient thereof, may characterize data and be used for purposes of comparing cases.","According to an embodiment, various techniques can include a box counting process. As an example, consider creating an optimal case that represents an object with perfect set parameters and that is to be produced by a simulation process of a modeling application. In this example, the optimal case may be created manually (e.g., it may be a visual and manual interpretation of a seismic cross section). The optimal case may be considered an expert interpretation and stored in the form of a 2D image, available as an input pane for subsequent processing. As another example, a base case may be considered a training image for facies modeling.","Given an optimal case, a goal may be to create data as close as possible to the optimal case. The created data may be considered object data, where such objects and associated data are created using features of software such as the PETREL\u00ae software. An example of such object data is an ant tracking volume, which may be deemed similar to the optimal case when faults, as data features, align for the optimal case and the ant tracking volume. In this example, the optimal case may be provided via a visual and manual process, accordingly, similarity or alignment between optimal case data and object data does not necessarily mean same data type but rather same geological object as represented in the optimal case data and the created object data.","As mentioned, another example can include facies (e.g., represented by a facies property). In such an example, the optimal case may be represented by a 2D image data; noting that the objects created for a comparison and optimization are properties and not necessarily images per se (e.g., such as data acquired using a conventional 2D image acquisition device). However, they are models for geological objects, for instance channels, and are comparable using box counting techniques described herein. Further, process variables available in a modeling application to create such objects may be used to full capacity to attain a high degree of variability (e.g., generation of many test cases).","According to an embodiment, given a base case and a comparison case (e.g., a simulation case or other case for comparison), a box counting process can be applied to determine one or more parameter values that characterize the cases. In general, box counting may be implemented using a grid or using any of a variety of shapes; shapes need not form a grid or tessellate (e.g., align boundary-to-boundary) and shapes may overlap. As described, as dimension of a shape decreases and number of shapes applied to data increases, a double logarithmic plot of number of occupied shapes (e.g., occupied according to one or more criteria) versus the size of the shapes (e.g., a characteristic dimension of a shape) provides a downward slope that can be fit with a line (e.g., a regression line) to provide a fractal dimension D, which is a unique parameter describing the data (e.g., according to the one or more criteria used to define occupation of a shape).","According to an embodiment, a box counting process can add objectivity to a subjective process, which can expedite arrival at a best case match to an optimal case. In general, due to the ability of describing an object in its complexity and geometrical shape, a box counting process is not biased by human imprecision.","According to an embodiment, one or more computer-readable media may include computer-executable instructions to instruct a computing system to output information for controlling a process.
