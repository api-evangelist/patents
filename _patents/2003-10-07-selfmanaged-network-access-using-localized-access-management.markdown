title: Self-managed network access using localized access management
abstract: The invention provides a method and system for locally tracking network usage and enforcing usage plans at a client device. In an embodiment of the invention, a unique physical key, or token, is installed at a client device of one or more networks. The key comprises a usage application and one or more access parameters designated the conditions and/or limits of a particular network usage plan. Upon initial connection to the network, the usage application grants or denies access to the network based on an analysis of the current values of the access parameters. Therefore, network usage tracking and enforcement is made simple and automatic without requiring any back-end servers on the network while still providing ultimate flexibility in changing billing plans for any number of users at any time.

The contents of these three provisionals are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser.

Field of Invention","The present invention relates to wireless networking, and more particularly, to a method and system for enabling self-managed network access using localized access management.","2. Description of Related Art","A Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is generally implemented to provide local connectivity between a wired network and a mobile computing device. In a typical wireless network, all of the computing devices within the network broadcast their information to one another using radio frequency (RF) communications. WLANs are based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standard, which designates a wireless-Ethernet specification using a variety of modulation techniques at frequencies generally in the 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) and 5 GHz license-free frequency bands.","The IEEE 802.11 standard, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, enables wireless communications with throughput rates up to 54 Mbps. There are 802.11 compatible PC cards that operate in peer-to-peer mode, but 802.11 usually incorporates at least one access point, or edge device. Most access points have an integrated Ethernet controller to connect to an existing wired-Ethernet network. An 802.11 wireless transceiver connects users via the access point to the rest of the LAN. The majority of 802.11 wireless transceivers available are in Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) card form, particularly for laptop, palmtop, and other portable computers, however 802.11 transceivers can be implemented through an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) slot or Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slot in a desktop computer, a Universal Serial Bus (USB), or can be fully integrated within a handheld device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","110","115","120","125"]},"\u201cHot-spots\u201d as 802.11 networks are known in the public space, allow users portable, high-speed access to networks. The number of hot-spots available to consumers is rapidly increasing. Each network is \u201c802.11 compatible\u201d and typically offers its users a variety of connection plans. For example, some connections plans allow unlimited usage, some charge users according to a fixed or variable, e.g., peak verses off-peak, rate, while others may limit a user to a predetermined number of connections. Generally, there is no limit to the number and diversity of billing schemes that so called \u201chot-spot\u201d operators offer their customer base.","Typically, such usage-based plans require that the customer select a particular usage plan and pay for that plan before being able to freely use the network to the limits afforded by that usage plan. Moreover, authentication information is passed onto a remote server, which accounts for and tracks the user's usage of the network at each time a connection is made to a hot-spot. This is generally burdensome and involves considerable non-revenue producing administrative traffic and hence possibly causes delays to users of the network. As all users are usually tracked from a central site, the infrastructure required to support large numbers of users can be daunting. Furthermore, setting up and modifying particular usage plan parameters for a large number of individuals is often not an easy or efficient task.","Network operators generally prefer to respond to a market as conditions dictate. For example, a usage-based plan that had previously been sold for \u201c10 connections per month at $24.95\u201d might be offered the next day for \u201c15 connections per month at $19.95.\u201d Implementing plan changes in a centralized network billing system is a complex process. For instance, the billing system must not only account for the current usage\/billing plans implemented, but must also account for all previous plans that users still have in effect.","Equally important are the needs of enterprise information technology (IT) administrators who prefer to provide different access schemes to specific classes of users on the enterprise network. For example, it might be highly desirable to allow a finance clerk who works a day shift, e.g., 9 AM to 5 PM, Mondays through Friday, to have access to a finance network only during the normal working hours. Attempts to use the network at any other time would be restricted. Microsoft\u00ae Windows provides for authentication classes, but is generally limited to a YES\/NO basis. For instance, users are entered into a database or directory of users that Windows implements when it authenticates a user, typically a RADIUS (Remote Access Dial-In User Service) server. Typically users are given account names and passwords to identify themselves and placed into workgroups. Individual users can be granted access in a PASS\/DENY basis for individual machines or groups of machines. Likewise, groups can be granted permission to individual machines on the network. The permissions are always PASS\/DENY, ALLOW\/RESTRICT, etc. However, in Windows it is difficult to tie other parameters to a user's permission such as PASS or ALLOW to a FINANCE SERVER during normal working hours, but DENY or RESTRICT on nights and weekends. The tie-in of PASS\/DENY along with TIME-OF-DAY is difficult to accomplish. In other words, providing access to individual users and groups of machines based on, for example, the period of the workweek is a daunting, if not impossible, task via Windows.","Of further difficulty for the host of a public 802.11 network is properly facilitating access to foreign customers, i.e., those customers who are foreign to the local network. At the Dallas Fort Worth airport, for instance, a Wayport\u00ae network is installed to provide travelers with wireless Internet access. Until recently, only Wayport customers could access this network e.g., a T-Mobile customer could not connect unless the user registered to become also a Wayport customer. Boingo offers a service whereby users can access a Wayport network without necessarily being a customer of Wayport.","Boingo employs a \u2018sniffer\u2019 program that listens to the beacon frames and looks for a match in its database of known network configurations. When a match is found, the Boingo software will automatically make the appropriate configuration changes for that network and allow the user to connect. Once a connection is attempted, the user appears to the network as a Boingo customer and the user's credentials are passed onto an authentication server for the network. On recognition of the user's name at the authentication server, access is then granted or denied. If the Boingo customer is not really a customer of the present network, the authentication server forwards the user's credentials to a Boingo authentication server, which performs the necessary authentication service and if valid, passes a \u2018grant\u2019 command back to the original network authentication server. One disadvantage with this approach is that the Wayport user may be on a different billing plan than the Boingo customer who is using the same network for the same usage plan. This becomes difficult to manage as the number of users and networks grow.","The present invention overcomes these and other deficiencies of the related art by providing a method and system to make network usage tracking and enforcement simple and automatic without requiring any back-end servers and alleviating the need to handle large numbers of network parameters and to track usage while still providing ultimate flexibility in changing billing plans for any number of users at any time.","In an embodiment of the invention, a method for managing network access of a device, which is a capable of communicating with one or more networks, comprises the steps of: storing one or more network access parameters in a secure token local to the device and determining if any of the network access parameters have been met or exceeded. In an embodiment of this invention, any access point is enabled to analyze the parameters stored in the secure user token and grants access based on that stored information. The access point, or edge device, can make a logical decision based on the parameters stored in the token without having to further check with a network-based or remote server. A network access parameter can be a maximum number of connections to the network, time of day, period of time, day in week, date, range of dates, maximum period of time spent connected to said network, device address, subnet ID, or LAN ID. If any of the network access parameters have been met or exceeded, access to the network is denied. If none of the network access parameters have been met or exceeded, access to the network is granted. In a related embodiment of the invention, upon determination that an access parameter has been met or exceeded, a user is presented with the option of purchasing additional usage by a limited connection to a remote server on the network. In another related embodiment, the network access parameters of multiple networks are stored within the secure token.","In another embodiment of the invention, a physical token comprises: a communications interface for communicating data to and from the physical token and a storage including at least one access parameter associated with a first network. Then at least one access parameter is part of a first usage plan for the first network. A usage application is provided in the storage for tracking and enforcing usage of the first network according to the first usage plan. An adapter is provided for connecting the physical token to a device capable of communicating with the first network. The storage may further include at least one access parameter associated with a second network and\/or authentication information for authenticating the device with the first or second networks.","One advantage of the invention is that it provides at each computing client device a tamper-resistant physical token that holds credentials such as authentication, billing, and usage parameters for multiple networks, thereby providing usage enforcement at the client and roaming capabilities without having to contact a central server or manually change network configurations at the client device. The credentials are stored in the secure, tamper-resistant physical token in such as way as to prevent modification by the user. An essential element is that the user has no access or capability to otherwise modify the network parameters stored in the client device by the network and thus the network edge device can trust the information it receives from the client device.","Another advantage of the invention is that it provides enormous benefits to the network administrator as it allows the operator to define the limits by which any particular user can access the network, then download those parameters securely into a physical token, and not have to monitor the users access thereafter with complete assurance that the user will not be able to exceed those limits.","Another advantage of the invention is that it enables the efficient implementation of complex network access rules for various users without requiring a burdensome infrastructure or complex software to be installed, maintained, and managed on the network.","The foregoing, and other features and advantages of the invention, will be apparent from the following, more particular description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, the accompanying drawings, and the claims.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention and their advantages may be understood by referring to , wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements, and are described in the context of a 802.11 network. Nevertheless, the present invention is applicable to other computing networks including various wired and\/or wireless based communication networks in general.","The present invention provides, inter alia, a secure, local edge method and system of tracking and enforcing a user's network usage and allowing the user's device to automatically provide feedback to the user as to the user's usage without requiring network access or a connection to a remote server. As the following describes in enabling detail, the invention is generally realized via a combination of software routines and physical keys in the form of easy-to-use adapters that are installed into client computing devices via, for instance, an available USB port. These physical keys are secure, tamper-resistant tokens capable of tracking and enforcing network usage in view of pre-defined conditions and\/or limits. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the physical keys also facilitate the authentication of the client computing devices on the network and provide secure data communication across the network using, for example, authentication parameters such as one or more cryptographic keys, which are pre-stored in secure storage within the physical keys. For example, an authentication and secure data communications system and method is implemented as described in commonly assigned and corresponding U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 10\/679,371, entitled \u201cLocalized Network Authentication and Security Using Tamper-Resistant and Keys,\u201d and Ser. No. 10\/679,268, entitled \u201cShared Network Access Using Different Access Keys,\u201d filed concurrently herewith, the disclosures of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. In an alternative embodiment, other types of cryptographic authentication and\/or data security techniques may be implemented such as, but not limited to a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In yet another embodiment, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is implemented in place of any authentication or data security system and method facilitated by the physical keys.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","220","210","220","215","220","210","210","200","220","200"]},"Each computing device  is provided with a unique client key  that is installed into an available USB port (not shown) of the computing device . It is important to note that installation of the client keys A-N into USB ports is exemplary only. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that the client keys A-N can be alternatively implemented through any available connection configuration such as, but not limited to an expansion card installed via a PCI or ISA slot; a physical token connected via a serial, parallel, or other type of communications port; an Ethernet card; or a wireless smart card.","Referring to , a functional block diagram of a client key  is illustrated according to an embodiment of the invention. The heart of each client key  is an embedded tamper-resistant token  such as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) or the like that is unique to each key . Each token  is unique in that it stores a unique serial number installed at the time of manufacture to provide positive identification of each physical key . The token  features an integrated circuit or processing means, the identification of which is apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, comprising a USB interface , a cryptographic processor  if necessary for security purposes, an applications platform , and a nonvolatile secure storage . The cryptographic processor  can generate, for example, Data Encryption Standard (DES) or 3DES cryptographic keys or implement PKI functionality by generating Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) public\/private key pairs. In another embodiment of the invention, all cryptographic processes are implemented by a central processor, such as an Intel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae 4 outside the key  without the need for or presence of the cryptographic processor . In yet another embodiment of the invention, a dedicated cryptographic co-processor is employed on an expansion card. This might be done to remove the encryption overhead from the central processor.","As will be described in further detail, the applications platform  executes a usage tracking and enforcing software routine (herein referred to as the \u201cusage application\u201d), which controls access to and tracks usage of the network . The usage application can be preinstalled into the client key  during initialization of the key or downloaded to the applications platform  at subsequent times thereafter.","In order to provide the instructions necessary to implement data communications with the client key , the drivers associated with a standard wireless NIC are supplemented with an Intermediate Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) driver. The NDIS Intermediate driver encrypts\/decrypts communications to and from an access point while ensuring delivery of standard 802.11 functionality as well as compatibility with 802.11 certified products. The NDIS Driver enables the transferring of data to\/from the SIM . The usage application executing on platform  interacts with the driver to send and receive communications in for example, a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) format, between the NIC and the access point . In an embodiment of the invention, once a computing device receives an IP address upon successful authentication, the usage application is automatically activated. Likewise, the usage application is automatically deactivated once the user disconnects from the network .","A particular useful feature of the present invention is that a client key  may be initialized for multiple 802.11 networks for which the holder of the key has been granted access. In other words, one client key  allows the user to access multiple 802.11 networks. For example, the secure storage  of the client key stores a set of parameters for each network or optionally for individual access points. An exemplary illustration of this concept is depicted in , wherein the secure storage  of a client key  holds a set of appropriate network parameters for three individual networks A, B, and C accessible to the computing device . In an embodiment of the invention, a set of network parameters comprises one or more access point identifiers or basic service set identifiers (BSSID) corresponding to the access points associated with the network , pertinent authentication and security data such as cryptographic keys in order to authenticate the computing device and\/or provide secure communications as appropriate, and particular access and tracking data. The access and tracking data comprises access information established by a network operator or administrator, and tracking information detailing network connection history. The access information generally comprises data associated with the limitations and conditions of the particular network usage plan established. For example, it might be desirable for network access to be conditioned on variables such as, but not limited to the time of day, day(s) of the week, days in a month, night versus day or peak time versus non-peak time, workday versus weekend, hours of use, number of connections, machine-specific access (such as access to a Billing Server, Accounting Server, etc.), subnet identification, local access network (LAN) identification, internet protocol address(es). The variables are exemplary only and merely touch on the numerous possible conditions that might be pertinent to network administration.","The access and tracking data is stored, for instance, in a single data file herein referred to as a \u201cNetwork Usage Feature Set (NUFS).\u201d  illustrates an exemplary format of a NUFS established for a particular network where access is established for a billing plan that allows for ten (10) connections per month at a cost of $24.95. Particularly, this illustrated NUFS comprises three (3) columns, two of which specify the initial and current access information. The initial access information details, inter alia, the limits and conditions of the usage plan as set by an administrator or the like. For example, only ten (10) connections are permitted per month in the present NUFS. The current access information tracks particular variables such as the number of connections counted in the current billing period, e.g., seven (7), which are interpreted by the usage application as described below. In the example illustrated, each individual row details a particular item or condition such as the number of permitted connections, e.g., \u201c10\u201d; the applicable time period, e.g., \u201c30 days\u201d; the start of the time period, e.g., \u201cfirst connection,\u201d i.e., the time that the first connection has been established; and optionally the price, e.g., \u201c$24.95\u201d. A NUFS identifier is given, e.g., \u201cAC-1075\u201d, to identify each particular NUFS. Each NUFS is installed into the secure storage  at the time the client key  is initialized for a particular network or installed and\/or updated at a later time through a secure communication from a remote server. For example, consider the scenario where a network provider displays the available usage plans to a user via a website. Once a user selects a desirable plan and payment is tendered, the appropriate NUFS is downloaded to the secure storage  of the user's client key .","In an embodiment of the invention, each accessible network A, B, and C has a NUFS associated with it. In another embodiment of the invention, only a portion of the accessible networks have an associated NUFS. To assist the usage application in distinguishing those accessible networks that have an associated NUFS from those that don't and to identify the access state of each network, an additional access state file is provided, an example of which is illustrated in . As illustrated, this file distinguishes between three possible access states possible for a network: restriction-free access; active restrictions according to a corresponding NUFS; and limited access, e.g., only hyper-text transport protocol (HTTP) requests to a billing system are permitted. These access states are exemplary only and other access states that a network administrator deems necessary may be implemented. Moreover, only one access state can be implemented for individual network at any particular time. As the example indicates, the access state of network A is in the active restrictions state and accordingly a corresponding NUFS exists; the access of network B is free access, for instance, network B may be a company intranet for which the user is the company CEO and unlimited access to the network is necessitate; and the access state of network C is expired. In an embodiment of the invention, the default access state is unrestricted access, i.e., the user's client key  will not interfere with network access once the user is properly authenticated. At a later time, however, a network administrator can download a NUFS to the client key  that is recognized by the usage application in order to restrict use of the corresponding network in accordance with the downloaded NUFS parameters\/conditions.","It is important to note that the illustrated data storage format of the NUFS and access state file is exemplary only and that other formats may be employed, the identification and implementation of which are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. The important concept here is that network access is based on any number of conditions, which are securely stored in the client key  itself.","In a related embodiment of the invention, the access point  maintains accurate time by receiving periodic updates from a reliable time source and communicates such to the usage application. For instance, a reliable time source can take the form of secure network clock set up by an administrator or an external time source that broadcasts accurate time via the Internet or a radiofrequency (RF) channel. Having the access point  track time as opposed to keeping time internally in the computing device  itself is preferable as it prevents or at least discourages an interloper from tampering with the time source to gain access during a time period otherwise not accessible. Moreover, it allows the usage application to learn the precise date and time within reasonable tolerances in order to maintain accurate usage tracking. In an embodiment of the invention, the time transmitted from the access point  to the computing device  is encrypted using one or more cryptographic keys stored in the client key .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","200","510","210","515","520","246","525","530"]},"Examination of a NUFS is illustrated with particularity by the example presented in , which depicts an exemplary NUFS . The NUFS  specifies current access parameters corresponding to a particular network. For instance, assume that prior to the present connection, six previous connections have been made and an expiration time has been set for one month after a start time of \u201c08.15.2002\u201d. Upon the present connection, the total number of connections is incremented from six (6) to seven (7), a number that is below the authorized limit and therefore not a problem. The next parameter, time limit, was established as one (1) month beyond the first connection. In order to ascertain the correct time per the embodiment described above, the client key  instructs the NIC driver to request the date and time from the access point . In a preferred embodiment, the request is encrypted with an appropriate cryptographic key stored within the secure storage  prior to transmission to the access point , which upon receipt decrypts this request with the corresponding decrypting key and returns a TCP\/IP packet containing the date and time encrypted with the appropriate encryption key. This packet is decrypted by the NIC driver and then passed to the usage application. The usage application now compares the current date, e.g., assume a current date of \u201c08.5.2002\u201d, against the time limit of \u201c08.15.2002\u201d. As this latter date has not passed, this access limit has not been met. As there are no further parameters to check in the NUFS , the user is allowed unrestricted access to the network  for the present connection. In an embodiment of the invention, the NUFS is rechecked periodically to prevent long connections from exceeding any of the access time constraints.","Consider another NUFS having an access parameter that has been exceeded. Referring now to , NUFS  allows the user unrestricted access for a time period of seven (7) days beginning with the first connection, which has been established, for example, on \u201c08.15.2002\u201d. Assuming that the current time returned from the access point during the present connection is that of the above example, e.g. \u201c09.5.2002\u201d, the usage application determines that this is beyond the seven-day limit established by the NUFS .","On determination that a NUFS access limit has been met, the usage application optionally displays (step ) a pop-up message notifying the user that the usage account on that network has expired. The usage application then instructs (step ) the NIC driver to send an encrypted TCP\/IP packet to the access point  informing it that all further TCP\/IP traffic from the user must be restricted to web based HTTP requests, e.g., via port , and that no user packets are allowed past the access point except for HTTP requests and those will be redirected to the network billing website. Optionally, the user may be directed (step ) the user to an internal reauthorization website for purchasing additional usage on the network. If the user purchases additional usage, a new NUFS is downloaded to the client key  and steps  and  are repeated on the new NUFS. In another embodiment of the invention, an optional parameter may be attached in the NUFS that instructs the usage application to \u2018kill\u2019 the client key, e.g., the authentication parameters stored within are deleted, thereby prevent a user to reconnect to the network, when the NUFS is exhausted.","It is important to note that any criteria for managing user network access can be implemented in this manner. Since network access is almost always determined a priori, these conditions can be stored in the user's client key , thereby enabling access control thereafter not by an online back-end authentication server, but automatically by the user's own software embedded into the client key . This is possible because the user cannot modify the network access parameters and restrictions that have been pre-stored in the client key . In essence, the present invention achieves a \u2018fire-and-forget\u2019 method of managing access. In other words, once given access, there is no need to further monitor or account for the user's access at a centralized server or the like because (i) the client key  limits the user's network access as provided without further intervention and preferably (ii) the monies for the network access have already been collected in advance.","Consider the situation where the client key  is lost or stolen, or the network operator wishes to discontinue a user's network access for whatever reason.","In an embodiment of the invention, each client key  requires a personal identification number (PIN) to unlock it before each connection attempt or each time the key is inserted into the computing device . Therefore, if the client key  is lost or stolen, it is of little use to the person who has recovered the client key  (assuming the new owner does not have knowledge of the PIN used to unlock the key). As a safety measure, if the user enters the PIN incorrectly three or some other specified number of times, for instance, the client key  is rendered permanently useless.","Referring to , a method  is illustrated for disabling or killing a client key  according to an embodiment of the invention. Particularly, upon determination that network access is to be discontinued for a particular user on a network, the network administrator obtains (step ) the serial number of the user's client key . This serial number is then flagged (step ) by, for instance, adding it to a \u201cwatch list.\u201d The network administrator can further specify (step ) whether the client key is to be either (a) temporarily disabled or (b) permanently killed. The watch list is then periodically uploaded (step ) to all access points  on the network. Upon receipt of the new or updated watch list, the access point  periodically checks (step ) the serial numbers of the client keys  of computing devices  currently connected and also those subsequently connected at a later time. For example, the access point  may keep and periodically check a \u201cConnected Users Table,\u201d which specifies the serial numbers of all the client keys  associated with computing devices  currently connected to the network .","If a serial number match is found between the watch list and the connected users table, the access point initiates (step ) the specified action for that user, e.g., disable or kill the NUFS. For example, the access point  sends an encrypted packet to the user containing the necessary command and control data to disable the user's access. The NIC driver decrypts the packet and recognizes that it is to either disable\/kill the authentication parameters, e.g., network cryptographic keys, for this particular network. The NIC driver communicates with the client key  to take appropriate action. Optionally, a pop-up message is displayed to the user indicating that his access has either been temporarily suspended or his network access revoked. The access point  immediately terminates further communications with the user and erases the serial number of that user in the connected user's table, upon which the user is forced to re-authenticate with the network . Accordingly, one of two conditions prevails. For example, if the user's rights were terminated, e.g., the network authentication parameters were erased, the user simply cannot connect nor has any means for encrypting\/decrypting packets to\/from the access point . If the user's rights were simply suspended, the NUFS status flag will have been changed to \u201cexpired\u201d and the user will see that the only network access he has is via HTTP requests to the network administrator or network billing system.","The previous examples focused principally on hot-spot networks where users access is measured either in the number of connections, the number of day's worth of access, or other usage based criteria. Just as easily and in a different context, the usage application can manage user access to the network by a range of IP addresses, subnets, or even a single IP address. All of this can be implemented in addition to access time restrictions and the like. The flexibility of this management scheme becomes readily apparent from the following description.","In an enterprise, users are typically provided an account ID and password that form the principal identifiers used to grant access to the user on the network. The network administrator can specify access by individual or group, but generally this becomes very complex as the number of users becomes large and the number of restrictions put in place. Of even greater importance and thus difficulty is the fact that network administration under Windows, for example, doesn't authenticate the user, only the user's login name and password. It is not unexpected that the same user can be logged in from more than one machine on the same network. If certificates are used to further restrict a user's ability to connect, the certificates must be different on each machine used by the user.","In the case of certificates that are used for authentication, each connection attempt (or login) by a user must follow a verification of the user's certificate. To validate the certificate, the user's certificate must not only be validated, but the entity that issued the certificate must be checked and then the entity who certified the previous entity, etc. until the root certificate has been verified. This methodology is required for two reasons: first to make sure that the system knows who the user is and second to make sure that the credentials are valid. After this certificate verification takes place, then where the user is allowed to go on the network is managed by yet another process.","IT systems tend to centralize these functions to make them easier to manage. Centralized management is a noble goal, but forces all network communications to go through one or more intermediates with high network traffic and concentration before a user can actually get to a desired location.","In the present methodology, the identity of the user and his network permissions are established by the network administrator at the time the users rights are provided. These rights are then installed into the user's secure, tamper-resistant physical token along with the usage application. Thereafter, all access management is negotiated between the local access point and the user's client key. No centralized server is used nor needed. Management is thereafter by exception. In other words, should a user's network permission need to be changed, the users' client key serial number is placed on a watch list within each access point and the users' permissions are changed on the next access.","The network administrator can establish a Class of Service (COS) for a user or group of users. Referring to , two different COS are embodied in respective NUFSs, which are similar to those discussed previously for hot-spot networks. Particularly,  depicts a NUFS  wherein the user is granted unrestricted access both for the IP address and time of access. NUFS  as depicted in  allows the user send TCP\/IP packets to a restricted range of IP addresses between 10.0.2.1 and 10.0.2.15. Any packets whose IP address is outside that range will be dropped at the access point. Further, any access to the network outside of the time range (normal working hours) is not allowed.","This type of methodology provides an unlimited number of restriction possibilities. Only two are shown here, e.g., IP range and date\/time. These options can be expanded to include lists of specific machines and any number of other parameters.","The sequence of access management is virtually identical to that shown in the commercial (hot-spot) example previously explained with one important difference. Particularly, it is important in the enterprise that once access rights are provided to a user, they not be provided indefinitely. To support this, a special field, e.g., \u201cRelease Time,\u201d can be provided in the NUFS that lets the usage application know when the user's credentials expire. For example, unless otherwise provided by the network administrator, NUFS  and NUFS  expire on Sep. 5, 2002 at 11:50 A.M. This provides a fail-safe method of access management for each individual user. The \u2018Release Time\u2019 value is optional and can be set to any value as necessary by the network administrator. On a very tightly controlled network, this can be set to daily or even hourly whereas on other networks that don't require a high-level of security beyond that provided by the client key  itself, this release time could be set to 30 days for example.","On expiration, the usage application will have already been provided an IP address, but has determined that its' network permission has been expired. The access point however, allows the user to connect to the IP address of the machine on the network that manages user client key  credentials where the user's NUFS will automatically be updated or the user's client key  will be terminated as necessary. For example, upon determining the NUFS has expired, the usage application sends a command to the NIC driver to in turn send an NUFS update request to the access point . The access point  then sends an IP packet to the administration server containing the user's client key  serial number. If the client key  serial number is still allowed to access the network, the timeout period is extended as set by the network administrator. The administration server returns a new NUFS in an encrypted IP packet, which is decrypted and installed at the computing device . If the user's permissions were to be terminated, the administration server at that time can return a packet that results in deletion of the NUFS for the network.","In a related embodiment of the invention, the usage application can generate a report listing one of more of the values of any of the usage variables mentioned above for communication to a Billing Server on the network.","Other embodiments and uses of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein.
