The government has certain rights in the invention.","Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to systems for performing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).","Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique used in condensed matter physics and chemistry to study vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in molecular systems. In a Raman spectroscopic experiment, an approximately monochromatic beam of light of a particular wavelength range passes through a sample of molecules and a spectrum of scattered light is emitted. The spectrum of wavelengths emitted from the molecule is called a \u201cRaman spectrum\u201d and the emitted light is called \u201cRaman scattered light.\u201d A Raman spectrum can reveal electronic, vibrational, and rotational energies levels of a molecule. Different molecules produce different Raman spectrums that can be used like a fingerprint to identify molecules and even determine the structure of molecules.","The Raman scattered light generated by a compound (or ion) adsorbed on or within a few nanometers of a structured metal surface can be 10-10times greater than the Raman scattered light generated by the same compound in solution or in the gas phase. This process of analyzing a compound is called surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (\u201cSERS\u201d). In recent years, SERS has emerged as a routine and powerful tool for investigating molecular structures and characterizing interfacial and thin-film systems, and even enables single-molecule detection. Engineers, physicists, and chemists continue to seek improvements in systems and methods for performing SERS.","However, most SERS systems only enhance the electro-magnetic field at certain hot spots. They have substantial enhancement factors at those hot spots, but most Raman measurements see the integrated effects over certain area. That makes those systems based on hot spots less effective.","Reference is made now in detail to specific embodiments, which illustrates the best mode presently contemplated by the inventors for practicing the invention. Alternative embodiments are also briefly described as applicable.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems for performing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The systems include a waveguide configured with an array of features to support guided-mode resonance for certain wavelengths of Raman-excitation light which increases the intensity of the electromagnetic field associated with the Raman-excitation light. In particular, wavelengths of the Raman-excitation light can be selected to generate a spectrum of Raman scattered light associated with particular analyte molecules, and the waveguide and array of features can be configured to provide guided-mode resonance for the Raman-excitation light. Portions of the outer surfaces of the array of features are coated with a Raman-active material that when exposed to the Raman-excitation light cause analyte molecules located on, or in close proximity to, the Raman-active material to enhance the intensity of the Raman-scattered light.","The term \u201clight\u201d as used to describe the operation of system embodiments of the present invention is not intended to be limited to electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths that lie only within the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, but is intended to also include electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths outside the visible portion, such as the infrared and ultraviolet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and can be used to refer to both classical and quantum electromagnetic radiation.","Further, as used herein, the article \u2018a\u2019 is intended to have its ordinary meaning in the patent arts, namely \u2018one or more\u2019. For example, \u201ca fluid channel\u201d means one or more fluid channels and as such, \u201cthe fluid channel\u201d explicitly means \u201cthe fluid channel(s)\u201d herein. Also, any reference herein to \u2018top\u2019, \u2018bottom\u2019, \u2018upper\u2019, \u2018lower\u2019, \u2018up\u2019, \u2018down\u2019, \u2018front\u2019, \u2018back\u2019, \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 is not intended to be a limitation herein. Herein, the term \u2018about\u2019 when applied to a value generally means plus or minus 10% unless otherwise expressly specified. Moreover, examples herein are intended to be illustrative only and are presented for discussion purposes and not by way of limitation.","In accordance with the teachings herein, at least one fluid channel is embedded in the waveguide layer of a guided mode resonator (GMR). The chemical\/molecules flow through the channel(s) and they are located at the maximum of the electromagnetic field E. Eis enhanced by Q of the GMR, therefore the Raman enhancement will be Q. Q can be larger than 1 million easily and the electromagnetic field enhancement is not limited to hot spots. The enhancement factor Q=E\u00d7E. The guided mode resonator enhances the Raman signal. The Raman signal is enhanced by Qsubstantially almost uniformly across the entire apparatus, instead of just on the hot spots like most SERS systems. Each resonant mode has an optical field distribution, so the enhancement is not exactly uniform. But comparing with the SERS system with hot spots, the present system is very uniform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","106","108","104","102","110"]},"As is well-known, a GMR grating typically consists of a planar dielectric waveguide and a subwavelength periodic array of lines, protrusions or holes.","When the spatial period of the grating matches the propagating wavelength of a guided mode, strong resonant features are shown in the transmission and\/or reflection. An enhanced optical field also builds up within the waveguide layer and the space adjacent to the waveguide layer (some modes extend more to outside and some less depending on the design).","A cover layer (not shown) may optionally be formed on top of the grating layer . The cover layer is a protective layer and can be made of a material such as silicon dioxide but may additionally include an antireflective coating to prevent reflection at a top surface of the SERS system , a band-pass optical filter to select the wavelength of light reaching grating layer , or any other optical coating.","Grating layer \/waveguide layer  comprises a material having a refractive index that is higher than the refractive index of a fluid flowing through the fluid channel .

Other materials include, but are not limited to, Si, AlO, TiO, InP, GaAs, InGaAsP, etc. In this connection, it will be noted that the fluid, which is discussed in greater detail below, typically has a refractive index of about 1.33 if the analyte is in water or about 1.5 if the analyte is in an organic solvent or about 1 if the analyte is in a gas.","Grating layer  has a pattern of features  that creates a resonance that strongly couples incident light (see ) into the fluid channel  only if the wavelength \u03bb and direction of incident light satisfy specific conditions. In particular, with the wavelength of an alignment beam being known and fixed, grating layer  can be patterned so that resonant coupling only occurs if the incident alignment beam has (or is close to) a specific incident direction. The specific design of grating layer  will depend on the wavelength \u03bb and incident direction of light to be detected and may be produced using GMR filter design techniques that are known in the art.

Guided-mode resonance enhances, or increases, the intensity of the associated electromagnetic field. For example, when the wavelength of Raman-excitation light is resonant with an array of features, the electromagnetic field associated with the Raman-excitation light builds or is enhanced by guided-mode resonance within the waveguide. As a result, Raman-excitation light can be emitted or coupled out through the features and waveguide to interact with analyte molecules and cause emission of Raman scattered light from the analyte molecules located in the fluid channel .

As a result, the intensity of the electro-magnetic field associated with the Raman-excitation light increases, and the Raman-excitation light is output from the features . The wavelengths selected for the Raman-excitation light cause the analyte located near the features  and in the waveguide layer  to emit a Raman spectrum of Raman scattered light over a range of wavelengths denoted by \u03bb.","The intensity of the Raman scattered light may also be enhanced as a result of two mechanisms associated with the Raman-active material. The first mechanism is an enhanced electromagnetic field produced at the surface of the Raman-active nanoparticles . As a result, conduction electrons in the metal surfaces of the nanoparticles  are excited into an extended surface excited electronic state called a \u201csurface plasmon polariton\u201d or \u201clocalized surface plasmon\u201d. Analytes adsorbed on or in close proximity to the nanoparticles  experience a relatively strong electromagnetic field. Molecular vibrational modes directed normal to the nanoparticle  surfaces are most strongly enhanced. The intensity of the surface plasmon polariton resonance depends on many factors, including the wavelengths of the Raman excitation light. The second mode of enhancement, charge transfer, may occur as a result of the formation of a charge-transfer complex between the surfaces of the nanoparticles  and the analyte absorbed to the analyte particle surfaces. The electronic transitions of many charge transfer complexes are typically in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.","Turning the incident angle of the Raman excitation light enables tuning the resonance. There are other ways to tune the resonance as well, such as by mechanical deformation of the grating, changing the geometry of the grating by applying E field on PZT material or by heating, changing the refractive index by electrical field (carrier injection or liquid crystal) or temperature.","The advantages of the Raman-active systems disclosed herein include compactness, uniform signal enhancement, and an integrated fluid channel with the features (either in close proximity or as the features themselves).","In the foregoing description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details. While the invention has been disclosed with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications and variations therefrom.
