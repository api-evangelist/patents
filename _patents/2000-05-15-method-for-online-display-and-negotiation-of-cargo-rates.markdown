title: Method for online display and negotiation of cargo rates
abstract: Freight forwarders and carriers post published rate and discount information for land, sea and air bearing cargo vessels to allow customers the opportunity to evaluate competitive prices, preferably in one consolidated location (e.g., a web site). A customer navigates to the site to obtain published or discounted rate information offered by a freight forwarder or carrier. The customer may accept a posted rate, in which case the site operator notifies the freight forwarder or carrier. Alternatively, customers, freight forwarders and carriers may negotiate rates for particular lanes of interest using an online interactive auction block.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 09\/335,451, filed Jun. 17, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,064,981.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates generally to the transportation of cargo by land, sea or air. More particularly, the invention relates to an online auction method and system whereby users of online systems, namely, customers, freight forwarders and carriers, may negotiate cargo rates with each other in an online, anonymous manner. In addition, the invention relates to an online system at which freight forwarders and carriers may post published rate and discount information for land, sea and air bearing cargo vessels to allow customers the opportunity to evaluate competitive prices, preferably in one consolidated location (e.g., a web site).","2. Description of the Related Art","The World Wide Web is the Internet's multimedia information retrieval system. In the web environment, client machines effect transactions to web servers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is a known application protocol providing users access to files (e.g., text, graphics, images, sound, video, etc.) using a standard page description language known as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML provides basic document formatting and allows the developer to specify \u201clinks\u201d to other servers and files. In the Internet paradigm, a network path to a server is identified by a so-called Uniform Resource Locator (URL) having a special syntax for defining a network connection. Use of an HTML-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer) at a client machine involves specification of a link via the URL. In response, the client makes a request to the server identified in the link and, in return, receives a document or other object formatted according to HTML. A collection of documents supported on a web server is sometimes referred to as a web site.","One of the technical advantages of the World Wide Web is the ease with which information may be posted and retrieved by users. Any computer user may navigate to a web site of interest and obtain relevant information hosted by the site. Thus, in the freight industry, many freight forwarders and carriers now have web sites that include posted rate information for the specific carrier. A customer (namely, an entity that desires to ship given cargo by land, sea or air) may navigate to the freight forwarder's or the carrier's web site using a conventional web browser and obtain useful shipping and rate information. While this approach is advantageous, a user cannot obtain competitive rate information without having to visit multiple third party sites and manually comparing the information located during such searching. Moreover, most sites will not even provide rate information to a user without the user first identifying itself (perhaps in a secure manner) to the carrier. Further, even if customers do spend the time searching across multiple sites to obtain competitive rate information, they are still limited to accepting the posted shipping lanes and\/or rates.","It would be highly desirable to provide an improved online business method wherein customers can obtain cargo rates anonymously from one or more freight forwarders and\/or carriers, and negotiate shipping routes and pricing with freight forwarders and carriers. The present invention solves these problems.","According to the present invention, freight forwarders and carriers post published rate and discount information for land, sea and air bearing cargo vessels to allow customers the opportunity to evaluate competitive prices, preferably in one consolidated location (e.g., a web site). A customer navigates to the site to obtain published or discounted rate information offered by a freight forwarder or carrier. The customer may accept a posted rate, in which case the site operator notifies the freight forwarder or carrier.","According to another feature of the invention, the web site offers an auction block at which anonymous (or identified) buyers and sellers may post and accept bids for shipping giving cargo loads over given shipping lanes. Thus, for example, using the auction block, an anonymous buyer (i.e., a customer) may make a bid that may be accepted by a seller (a freight forwarder or carrier). Alternatively, an anonymous or known seller (a forwarder or carrier) may make a bid, e.g., because the entity has additional unused capacity over a given route at a given time, which may then be accepted by a buyer (e.g., an anonymous customer). After a given bid is accepted, the site notifies each of the parties, e.g., by e-mail, of the outcome (e.g., acceptance) of a given negotiation for a posted bid. Preferably, the site earns a fee for each seller bid that is accepted by a given buyer. Likewise, the site may earn a fee for each buyer bid that is accepted by a given seller.","The foregoing has outlined some of the more pertinent objects and features of the present invention. These objects should be construed to be merely illustrative of some of the more prominent features and applications of the invention. Many other beneficial results can be attained by applying the disclosed invention in a different manner or modifying the invention as will be described. Accordingly, other objects and a fuller understanding of the invention may be had by referring to the following Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment.","A representative system in which the present invention is implemented is illustrated in  plurality of Internet client machines  are connectable to a computer network Internet Service Provider (ISP)  via a network such as a dialup telephone network. As is well known, the dialup telephone network usually has a given, limited number of connections -. ISP  interfaces the client machines  to the remainder of the network , which includes a plurality of web content server machines . Network  typically includes other servers (not shown) for control of domain name resolution, routing and other control functions. A client machine typically includes a suite of known Internet tools, including a Web browser, to access the servers of the network and thus obtain certain services. These services include one-to-one messaging (e-mail), one-to-many messaging (bulletin board), on-line chat, file transfer and browsing. Various known Internet protocols are used for these services. Thus, for example, browsing is effected using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which provides users access to multimedia files using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The collection of servers that use HTTP comprise the World Wide Web, which is the Internet's multimedia information retrieval system.","As will be seen, a given server in the computer network operates a web site at which a plurality of freight forwarders\/carriers may publish rates in a centralized location. Customers, namely, users of client machines, may browse the site to obtain rate data and\/or to participate in online cargo lane auctions as will be seen. A given client machine and the server may communicate over the public Internet, an intranet, or any other computer network. If desired, given communications may take place over a secure connection. Thus, for example, a client may communicate with the server using a network security protocol, such as Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or the IETE's Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.","A representative client is a personal computer, notebook computer, Internet appliance or pervasive computing device (e.g., a PDA or palm computer) that is x86-, PowerPC\u00ae- or RISC-based. The client includes an operating system such as Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Windows CE or PalmOS. As noted above, the client includes a suite of Internet tools including a Web browser, such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer, that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and support for application plug-ins or helper applications. A representative web server is an IBM Netfinity server comprising a RISC-based processor , a UNIX-based operating system  and a web server program . The server may include an application programming interface  (API) that provides extensions to enable application developers to extend and\/or customize the core functionality thereof through software programs including plug-ins, CGI programs, servlets, and the like.","The present invention is preferably implemented as a computer program operative at a web server. Although the invention will be described in the context of a single web server, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the described functionality may be implemented across multiple servers. Moreover, the web site may be mirrored at additional servers in the network and, if desired, one or more management servers or other computer resources may be used to facilitate various billing, accounting and administrative functions as a \u201cback end\u201d to the underlying site.","The computer program at the web site includes appropriate display routines for generating a set of display screens that together comprise a user interface for the site.  are representative display screens, although the particular screen layouts should not be taken to limit the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3. A","FIG. 4. A","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","32","34","36","38"]},"Generalizing, according to the invention, a \u201cbuyer\u201d is any entity or entities desiring to move cargo from one location to another, while a \u201cseller\u201d is any entity or entities engaged in the transport, and\/or arrangement for transport, of cargo from one location to another by whatever means. Given cargo is shipped in containers or, more generically, units. Thus, a representative seller is a carrier, common carrier, freight forwarder, or the like, that ships cargo containers over a given shipping lane defined between an origination point and a destination point. Moreover, a given seller or buyer may be, for example, a person, an organization, an entity, a computer, a machine, a resource, a device, a process, or a program. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the activities of buyers and sellers in accordance with this invention may be under programmatic control and, thus, partially or fully automated.","As will be described further below, a given buyer and a given seller may use the present invention and\/or the tools described below to reach an understanding regarding a given shipment. Thus, as will be seen, a given buyer may negotiate with a given seller (or vice versa) online to secure a cargo shipping commitment. As used herein, a \u201ccommitment\u201d may be conditional, unconditional, provisional, or the like, as the parties or the site provider may agree. Thus, the present invention is not limited to any particular contractual understanding that may be created between buyer and seller.","Activation of the first link  navigates the user to a registration form as illustrated in FIG. . This form is preferably implemented as a CGI script in a known manner. Preferably, the screen is used to identify a given freight forwarder or ocean carrier to the site by name, address, email, phone number, and other such information. If the company is already registered with the online service, the system automatically populates the information in the display screen. If the entity enters Yes in the Customer field , the entity has the right to act as a customer and, therefore, may participate anonymously in online cargo rate auctions, as will be described below. When the screen is accessed, the entity's last sign-on is also identified. If desired, the display screen may be restricted unless a given user has entered an appropriate account number and\/or other validator.","Activation of the second link  in the home page navigates the user to a published rate page as illustrated in FIG. . This page may also be reached from the registration page or, of course, from any other page of interest (including a third party site). According to the present invention, freight forwarders and carriers post published rate and discount information for land, sea and air bearing cargo vessels. This information allows customers the opportunity to evaluate competitive prices in one consolidated location instead of having to navigate to individual company web sites. Moreover, use of the site does not require the prospective customer to submit a personal request for quote to a given freight forwarder or carrier. As seen in , preferably the information is made available in a point-to-point format so that customers can view and accept the suggested rates in an online manner.","Alternatively, and as will be seen, users can post anonymous buyer bids for review and acceptance by freight forwarders and carriers, or freight forwarders and carriers can post anonymous seller bids for review and acceptance by customers.","In the illustrative embodiment, sea port-to-port rates are selected by activating the image link . Land point-to-point rates are selected by activating the image link . Air port-to-port rates are selected by activating the image link . In this example, the sea ports link  has been selected. This opens up (or otherwise populates) a pair of listboxes  and . Listbox  includes a set of \u201cfrom\u201d locations while listbox  includes a set of \u201cto\u201d location. Using a keyboard or mouse, the user of the client machine selects a shipping lane, which is defined by a given \u201cfrom\u201d location in listbox  to a given \u201cto\u201d location in listbox . The resulting selection is set forth in the display fields  and . After clicking the OK button , the site displays the published rate table  and discount fares available for the selected shipping lane.","As can be seen, this table identifies two carriers that service this shipping lane, in this case Sea Land and Evergreen. While the actual information displayed may be quite variable, in the preferred embodiment the table displays a number of fields: the identity of the carrier , the type of load  (\u201cFCL\u201d or full container load), the size of the container , the price , any published discount , the scheduled ship date , the date at which the rate expires , the time at which the rate expires on the expiration date , the date by which the customer must have the freight to port , and the time by which the customer must have the freight to port on such date . Of course, the above data fields are merely illustrative, and one may add other fields, such as whether a given container is refrigerated or dry, an estimated arrival time of the container, a tracking number for the container, carrier\/forwarder classification information (to facilitate buyer review and selection), or the like.","To accept a given rate quote, the user highlights a given row in the table and takes a given action (e.g., entry of the return key or selection of an Accept button, etc.). This action navigates the user to the display of , which is a representative user screen by which a user may accept a carrier's published rate for the given selected shipping lane.","As illustrated in , the information in the selected row of the published rate table is used to populate this interface screen. The screen also includes a set of fields  and  that identify the shipping lane. The user may accept the rate by entering a customer number in the field , entering a number of containers desired in the field , and then selecting an Accept link . Upon acceptance, the server may send a confirmation e-mail both to the customer and the carrier. In particular, the server preferably includes a database that associates a given confirmation number with the identified carrier, shipping lane and rate. Preferably, the carrier is charged a given fee for this service.","In addition to allowing customers to view particular lanes of interest and associated trade quotes given by the freight forwarders and carriers, the site also provides an online interactive auction block. As noted above, customers may post buyer bids that may be accepted by given carriers. Likewise, carriers may post seller bids that may be accepted by given customers.  is a representative display screen used to navigate to the auction block. A link  navigates to the display of , wherein a customer can create an anonymous bid. A link  navigates to the display of , which is the buyer bids auction block. A link  navigates to the display of , wherein a freight forwarder or carrier can create an anonymous bid. A link  navigates to the display of , which is the seller bids auction block.","As illustrated in , the customer creates a buyer bid by selecting a shipping lane. This is preferably accomplished using a set of drop-down listboxes  and . The figure illustrates these boxes in a collapsed form as a result of the user selecting the New York to Manila shipping lane. The user may then enter given bid information in the fields, which include: a sail on\/by field , a desired payment field , a container type field , and a field  identifying the number of containers. The customer posts the bid, preferably anonymously, by selecting the Post button . Of course, as noted above, other data fields may be implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["42","44","46","112","114","116","118","120","122","124","126","128","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["132","134","136"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["138","140","142","144","146","148","150","152","154","156","158","160","162","160","163"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["164","166","10","12","168","170","172"]},"The present invention provides numerous advantages over the prior art. Customers that desire to ship cargo or freight may obtain rate information and discounts available from a plurality of different carriers or freight forwarders. There is no need for a customer to expose its identity to obtain a given rate quote. Further, a customer may bid on a given shipping lane of interest in an anonymous manner, and this bid may be accepted by a carrier or freight forwarder that has excess capacity for the lane. In a like manner, carriers may post bids for servicing a given shipping lane that may then be accepted, in whole or in part, by a given customer. Once accepted, the server confirms the agreement by e-mail and issues appropriate confirmation agreements electronically. Preferably, the server charges a given fee per bid accepted, although any convenient fee structure may be implemented.","As noted above, the inventive mechanism is preferably implemented within at least one server. Thus, the invention does not require any modifications to conventional client machine hardware or software. Although not meant to be limiting, the above-described functionality is preferably implemented as standalone native code or, alternatively, as a Java servlet. Generalizing, the above-described functionality is implemented in software executable in a processor, namely, as a set of instructions (program code) in a code module resident in the random access memory of the computer. Until required by the computer, the set of instructions may be stored in another computer memory, for example, in a hard disk drive, or in a removable memory such as an optical disk (for eventual use in a CD ROM) or floppy disk (for eventual use in a floppy disk drive), or downloaded via the Internet or other computer network.","In addition, although the various methods described are conveniently implemented in a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by software, one of ordinary skill in the art would also recognize that such methods may be carried out in hardware, in firmware, or in more specialized apparatus constructed to perform the required method steps.","Further, as used herein, a Web \u201cclient\u201d should be broadly construed to mean any computer or component thereof directly or indirectly connected or connectable in any known or later-developed manner to a computer network, such as the Internet.
