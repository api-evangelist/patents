title: Streaming digital video between video devices using a cable television system
abstract: Systems and methods are presented that permit an individual to share digital video between video devices using a cable television system. A first video device streams digital video to a cable headend, which transcodes it and stitches it with other video content, such as a menuing system. The headend then transmits the digital video to a second video device, such as a set top box, for display. The data stream may be controlled using a standard set top box remote control, and the system may be used without purchasing additional hardware or software, or configuring a wireless local area network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/393,262, filed Oct. 14, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates to sharing digital video between electronic devices, and more particularly to using a television system to establish a private, bidirectional data channel to stream personalized digital video for the enjoyment of subscribers.","Digital video forms an integral part of modern life. Private digital video devices allow us to record our life experiences for later review and enjoyment. Professional digital video, in the form of movies and television, allows us to see life through the eyes of others, and to benefit from their wisdom and their follies. As social creatures, we often wish to share these experiences with others, and we relish the opportunity to invite others into our homes for viewing sessions.","Digital media may be downloaded for viewing using a video player, or viewed on web sites such as YouTube using a web browser that supports streaming media. Digital media also may be recorded using video devices ranging from smartphones, to professional and amateur video cameras, to webcams on personal computers. There are many different and incompatible methods and locations for storing this media. As a result, there are many different and incompatible methods for later viewing: on a phone display, on a television screen, on a computer display (using one of several incompatible viewers). As a result, people who wish to later view this digital video must learn many different display and control interfaces, and educate themselves as to the intricacies of the different media formats. It would be simpler to view all digital media using a single video device, as the viewer would only have to learn how to use that single device.","It is known in the art to share video between computers and televisions, although methods for doing so are cumbersome or expensive. Some computers, including laptops, have video outputs that may be connected directly to a television video input using special cables. Setting up such systems is often difficult, as the process entails several steps of varying technical skill: analyzing the computer and the television to determine which kind of cable or cables are required; connecting the components properly; directing the computer to transmit video to the television, often through a non-intuitive sequence or combination of keystrokes or by running a custom application; tuning the television to the appropriate channel; adjusting the video resolution, size and position of the viewable area, brightness and color balance, and so on. Many of these steps are beyond the capabilities of the average person, and even if they are performed correctly, the video quality is often poor, and control of the television display must be performed awkwardly from the computer. Furthermore, for cable television subscribers, this arrangement often bypasses a cable set top box that controls ordinary cable television reception. Thus, a subscriber must learn how to change back and forth between ordinary cable television and the direct connection to the computer having the digital video.","One solution to this problem has been the use of an intermediate computer that interfaces to both the personal computer and the television. Commercial embodiments of this solution include the Apple TV\u00ae digital media extender from Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. However, this solution requires the user to purchase an additional computer and learn how to configure it, which some individuals may be unwilling or unable to do. Also, this solution requires the user to set up a wireless local network on the premises to allow the intermediate computer to connect to the personal computer, which a non-skilled person may find difficult. A different solution, in which the television itself has wireless networking and the personal computer connections with the television wirelessly, suffers from the same problem. Yet another solution is to convert the personal computer into a cable set top box, or \u201cmedia center,\u201d using purchased or downloaded software. An advantage of using this approach is that other, more general applications found on the computer may be used on the television, such as web browsers, email clients and so on. Examples of this solution are the MythTV home entertainment application developed by Mr. Isaac Richards, and the Boxee system, from Boxee, Inc. However, these solutions do not solve the problem of avoiding complex and unfamiliar user interfaces, as they typically have custom menus and require the use of a keyboard and mouse to control the web browser, email client, and other added features that appear on the television. These solutions may also require the user to set up a wireless local area network, although some do permit direct cable connections from a set top box to the personal computer (with the aforementioned disadvantages).","In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, systems and methods are presented that overcome these difficulties by using existing cable television infrastructure to share digital video on smartphones, personal computers, and other devices with a set top box. These systems and methods do not require connecting a computer to a television with a cable, purchasing additional computers and configuring them, or setting up a local, wireless data connection on the premises. Furthermore, these systems are controlled using a standard set top box remote control, permitting cable subscribers to use a standard cable system menu, without being forced to use a keyboard and mouse to control the image displayed on the television or to learn a new menuing interface.","In a first embodiment there is provided a method of streaming digital video between a first video device and a second video device. The digital video may include audio data, moving image data, still image data, or any combination of these, and may be encoded according to an MPEG specification. The first video device, which may be a personal computer or a smartphone for example, is connected to a public data network, such as the Internet. The second video device may be a television or a TV set top box, and is connected to a cable television system having a cable network and a cable headend. The cable headend is also connected to the public data network. The second video device may be controlled by a video device controller, such as a remote control.","The method includes establishing a first bidirectional data channel from the first video device to the cable headend and establishing a second bidirectional data channel over the cable network from the second video device to the cable headend. Doing so permits bidirectional data communication between the first video device and the second video device through the cable headend. Once the data communication has been established, the method further includes receiving a first data stream that includes the digital video at the cable headend from the first video device using the first data channel. Next, the method includes forming a second data stream that includes a second video that is based on the received digital video. The second video may be the received digital video, or it may comprise a transcoding of the received digital video into a format that is decodable by the second video device. Furthermore, the second video may include a plurality of video frames, each video frame having a frame of the digital video stitched together with another image, such as a navigation button, an advertisement, information associated with the first video device, information associated with the digital video. The method further includes transmitting the second data stream from the cable headend to the second video device using the second data channel. The data stream is controlled by sending commands from the video device controller to the first video device over the first and second data channels. Finally, the second video may be displayed on a television.","In some related embodiments, the first and second video devices are located within the premises of an individual. In such cases, it may be the case that no bidirectional data channel between the first and second video devices exists entirely within the premises. In other related embodiments, establishing the first data channel includes receiving, from the first video device, a first request to establish the first data channel, the first request having request parameters that include a unique identifier; and authorizing the establishment of the first data channel based on the request parameters. The first request may be received over either the public data network or over the cable network. The unique identifier may be a media access control (MAC) address that is uniquely associated with the first video device. And establishing the second data channel may include receiving, from the second video device, a second request to establish the second data channel, the second request having request parameters that include the unique identifier; identifying the first video device using the received unique identifier; and associating the second video device with the identified first video device.","These methods may be implemented using the systems described below, or similar systems. Further, the methods may be implemented in computer hardware or software, or a combination of these. Computer software may be provided as a computer program product having program code stored thereon.","Definitions. As used in this description and the accompanying claims, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated, unless the context otherwise requires:","Digital video refers to encoded digital data pertaining to a plurality of images, sounds, or both images and sounds. The plurality of images may include moving images, different images presented sequentially with a perceptible delay, or repetitions of a still image. The data may be encoded using any encoding format known in the art, especially a format according to an MPEG specification.","A video device refers to any electronic device capable of capturing, encoding, or displaying digital video, including without limitation smartphones, personal computers, video cameras, television set top boxes, and smart televisions.","A cable network is a network of physical cables that is used for distributing electrical or optical signals, including digital video. For example, a television system uses a network of coaxial or optical fiber cables to distribute television signals to subscribers.","Cable television system refers to a television system that delivers television signals to viewers using a cable network, be it electrical, optical, or a combination of these. While specific reference is made in various places to components of an electrical cable television system for ease of explanation, the corresponding components in a fiber optic television system are expressly contemplated.","A bidirectional data channel is a data channel that sends digital video from a first video device to a second video device in a first direction, and commands for controlling the first video device from the second video device to the first video device in the opposite direction. In embodiments of the invention, the second video device does not share video with the first video device, so the channel in the first direction may use a much higher data rate than the channel in the opposite direction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","100","110","120","110","130","130","140","150","150","160","170","170","172","174","176","172","174","176","172","174","172","176"]},"As described in more detail below, cable television headend  performs any necessary reformatting and transcoding of the digital video stream to allow it to be viewed optimally on television . Such reformatting may include resizing the video, altering the video's resolution, mixing in other video such as advertisements, and other reformatting as is known in the art. Transcoding may include converting the digital video from a source format to a format that is decodable by the set top box .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","200","100","200","110","200","174","176","100"]},"In , the connection  to the public data network  may be accomplished using wires or cables, or it may be wireless. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, individual  is a cable television subscriber and cable television headend  provides Internet access. In this embodiment, connection , which is used to stream the digital video upstream, uses the same cables as connections , , which are used to stream appropriately encoded television signals to set top box  from the cable television headend . In this way, no additional cables are required to connect laptop  to set top box  or television .","However, it should be emphasized that, while the connection between laptop  and public data network  and the connection between headend  and set top box  may travel over the same physical cables, they comprise separate logical networks. For example, a cable television provider typically transmits data between headend  and premises  using signals having a frequency spectrum, and allocates different frequency windows to each connection. Frequencies belonging to the first connection may be selected using a signal filter in a cable modem. Thus, the laptop  does not have access to the television signals transmitted to set top box , and likewise set top box  does not have access to digital data on frequencies selected by the cable modem.","The arrangement of  is advantageous, because the set top box  integrates into the cable television system directly, so it is not necessary for subscriber  to separately purchase a second device (such as a second set top box) to share the digital video between devices. This arrangement may be used when there is no bidirectional data channel that connects the laptop  and the set top box , such as a wireless LAN, contained entirely within the premises.","Details of these embodiments now follow.  is a block diagram showing the functional components of the embodiment of . Cable television headend  and personal computer  are shown in greater detail. In accordance with the embodiment shown in , the subscriber obtains internet access through cable television headend  so connection  is omitted for clarity. However, other embodiments are contemplated in which the subscriber obtains internet access through other means, such as the cellular network as shown in , so the embodiment shown in  should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. Further, while reference will be made to personal computer , it will be understood that other video devices may be employed, such as the smartphone  shown in , provided that they have installed on them the appropriate hardware or software applications as now described. In addition, while the various components are described as software, it is contemplated that particularly computationally expensive operations such as video and audio capture or video encoding may be performed in hardware.","Referring to , the functions of personal computer  are explained in more detail. Personal computer  includes a video application . This video application  may be, by way of illustration: a web browser that displays web pages having embedded videos in Java, Flash, HTML 5, or other web video format; a proprietary video disc player application such as the CyberLink PowerDVD player; an application that plays digital video from a file or a URL, such as the Microsoft Windows Media Player or the Apple QuickTime Player; screen capture software, such as that found in remote desktop applications like Windows Terminal Server, VNC Server from RealVNC Limited, or any of several applications from Citrix Systems, Inc.; or any other application that provides digital video and may be controlled programmatically through an application programming interface . For concreteness, and not by way of limitation, video application  will be treated as a web browser having open a web page having embedded digital video .","Personal computer  also includes video capture software  and audio capture software . Capture software ,  may be embodied in a single software package, or they may be separate, and perform video and audio capture according to techniques known in the art. Although both video and audio capture are shown in , audio capture may be omitted in various contemplated embodiments. For example, if video application  does not provide any audio, then cable television headend  will not receive any audio from personal computer . In such cases, headend  may optionally mix audio into the video to provide a more enjoyable subscriber experience. Such audio may be selectable by the subscriber from an audio library using a remote control, or it may be of the television operator's choosing. Also, in some embodiments video capture and audio capture are performed using hardware instead of software.","Captured video (and audio, if present) are sent to encoder , which encodes the video and audio into encoded digital video data according to an encoding format known in the art, such as MPEG. Encoder  presents the encoded digital video to streamer . Streamer  streams the encoded digital video to cable television headend  over a bidirectional data channel using techniques known in the art. In such a configuration, streamer  acts as a server, and headend  acts as a video client that requests the digital video after a connection with the second video device has been established.","Control software  is provided to control and monitor streamer , and to provide feedback to a user of personal computer . Control software  is executed by the user to launch the streaming components, and communicates with streamer  using a local network (TCP) connection. Control software , upon launch, establishes a service connection with headend , and obtains a list of authorized IP addresses that are permitted to access the streaming video data. When a client attempts to connect to the streamer  and request streaming video, streamer  requests authorization from control software . Control software determines whether the IP address is authorized, and responds to streamer  so that streamer  may accept or deny the connection as appropriate. Control software  may also direct streamer  to terminate execution at the request of a subscriber.","Conversely, streamer  may provide status updates to control software , such as whether streamer  is awaiting a connection with the headend , that such a connection has been established or torn down, or that streamer  is currently streaming digital video. Control software  may display these status updates on a display of personal computer . Encoder , streamer , and control software  may be provided by the cable television system operator as a single downloadable software application for the convenience of a subscriber.","The functions of cable television headend  are now explained in greater detail. Headend  includes several computing modules connected by a local area network . These modules include a cable network interface  for communicating with the cable network . Interface  may include, for example, a cable modem termination system (CMTS) that provides high speed data services, such as Internet access and digital video streaming, to subscribers. Interface , when employed to provide the Internet access required by web browser , forwards requests to a public network interface , such as a network router, that acts as a gateway to public data network . Other hardware and software used in this process is omitted for clarity, but can include various modules that provide data security such as encryption, virus detection and removal, and so on. Thus, for example, requests for digital video  from browser  are passed through the cable network , cable network interface , local area network , and public network interface  on their way to the public data network . This data path is comparable to data path  of .","In addition to these data components, cable television headend  also includes transcoders  and stitchers . As is known in the art, transcoders convert data encoded in one format into a different format. In this connection, digital video that is not displayable using cable set top box  is transcoded into the appropriate format. In one embodiment, to reduce latency between the video application and display of its content on the television , encoder  may encode captured video and audio data using a simple encoding scheme. Such simple encoding schemes may be desired in some embodiments if personal computer  is not computationally powerful. In an alternate embodiment, digital video  may be directly downloaded from the public data network  via the public network interface . In this embodiment, the digital video  is saved at the headend for later streaming playback, but its format may be different from what set top box  supports. In either case, transcoders  re-encode the data into an appropriate format that is decodable by set top box . One or more transcoders may be employed to accommodate the demand of many subscribers.","Stitchers  take the transcoded content, along with other audiovisual content such as interactive menus, advertisements, and the like, and stitch them together to make a final television signal for display on television . Stitchers  may also contain other logic, for example logic that determines what other content should be stitched together with the transcoded digital video, logic for processing control messages from a remote control  (such as menu item selection or movement commands, start\/stop stream commands, and the like), and logic to perform other functions. As with the transcoders, several stitchers  may be employed within cable television headend  to meet subscriber demand. Cable network interface , public networking interface , transcoders , and stitchers  may be hardware, software, or a combination of these.","It should be appreciated that cable television headend  may be part of a cable television system comprising several such headends, each headend serving a different cable network in a different geographic area. Further, multiple cable television systems may be grouped together under the administrative control of a single multiple system operator (MSO), as is known in the art. In such larger systems, each headend may or may not include the functional units shown in . For example, transcoders  and stitchers  servicing headend  may be located at a different headend of the MSO, or at a data center remote from the headend . These remote transcoders and stitchers may be connected to headend  using a private data network of the MSO (not shown). The low latency added by such a physical arrangement of components, coupled with the ease of administration gained by placing multiple pieces of equipment having similar functions in the same physical location, provides advantages over prior art systems.","The processes for establishing data channels between the personal computer  and the set top box , and for streaming digital video over those channels, are now described. These data channels are bidirectional. In a first direction, the personal computer  streams digital video to cable television headend , which forwards the video (after transcoding and stitching) to set top box  for eventual display. In the opposite direction, set top box  receives keystrokes from a remote control. These keystrokes may include commands to establish the channel, tear down the channel, and to start and stop playback of video, or select a different digital video source. In some more generalized embodiments, keystrokes are sent from the remote control to control the personal computer  in ways unrelated to streaming the digital video. For example, the remote control may be used to select a computer shut down function, or to launch an application such as an email client that will then display on the television connected to set top box . Other ways in which a remote control may fully utilize the bidirectional data channel between the set top box  and personal computer  in accordance with these embodiments may be envisioned by persons having skill in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["410","420","340","330","332","374","376","430","440","172","172","172"]},"In order to establish a bidirectional connection between the personal computer  and the set top box , two bidirectional data channels must be set up: one between the personal computer  and the cable television headend , and one between the headend  and the set top box . However, there is no pre-established association between a subscriber's set top box and her personal computer. Rendezvous servers  are provided at the headend to make this association, and to permit these two video devices to \u2018find each other\u2019, and to ensure authentication of the subscriber and authorization of the connection based on subscription and service parameters. Rendezvous may be facilitated using the fact that both video devices are associated with the subscriber. Rendezvous servers  accept offers to stream digital video and requests for the streamed digital video, and pair these offers and requests based on a unique subscriber identifier. The number of servers  used by any given headend may be determined by demand. In an alternate embodiment, a multiple system operator may house such rendezvous servers  at a data center or other location away from the cable headend that services the subscriber participating in these processes, and may share servers between headends depending on relative demand. Such an arrangement provides advantages when the MSO services several time zones, where demand for rendezvous services peaks and ebbs in different time zones at the same local time in each time zone.","In general, the cable television provider may wish to provide television signals to the subscriber at all times in order to avoid \u201cdead air.\u201d Practically speaking, this means that the connection between the headend  and the set top box  should be made only after a digital video stream is already available; in other words, after the connection between the headend  and the personal computer  has already been established and is pending on a rendezvous server . Other embodiments are contemplated; for example, if the connection between the set top box  and the headend  is made first, headend  may give the subscriber a \u201cWaiting\u201d screen, advertisements, or otherwise fill the \u201cdead air\u201d with meaningful television signals of the television operator's choosing.","Streaming application  provides two functions. First, it communicates with rendezvous servers  on behalf of the set top box  to establish one of the two bidirectional data channels. Second, it receives commands from a remote control  (shown in ) via the set top box , and forwards them to the first video device. In some embodiments, the streaming application  runs on a computer processor located at the headend. In other embodiments, the processor may be located elsewhere, such as another headend, or an MSO data center in close proximity to the rendezvous servers .","To begin the process, control software  connects to encoder\/streamer  and verifies that these modules are functioning correctly. Next, control software  requests authorization to establish a first data channel to stream video data by sending a request to a rendezvous server . This request includes parameters that identify the subscriber. Rendezvous server  determines whether to permit the establishment of the data channel based on the subscriber identification, and may include, in some embodiments, determining whether the subscriber has paid for this feature. If authorization is granted, the rendezvous server  transmits service information to control software . This service information includes, among other data, a list of authorized IP addresses belonging to transcoders  that are employed by the cable television operator. Control software  stores this service information, and notifies the rendezvous server  that it stands ready to stream digital video.","Next, the subscriber uses remote control  to direct the set top box  to tune to a special channel. The headend receives a channel designation for the special channel, and instructs stitcher , which is responsible for providing the final, stitched video to the set top box, to launch streaming application . Application , under the assumption that a streaming peer has already been established, immediately requests that peer's information from rendezvous server . This second request to establish a data channel includes parameters that uniquely identify the subscriber, similar to the first request to establish a data channel. Thus, for example, the application  may request a web page URL using an HTTP GET request that includes this information.","If the subscriber is not authorized to receive this service, an error message may be returned by rendezvous server , allowing the set top box  to send an error message to the television. Otherwise, server  returns a detailed response to this request. As several personal computers, smartphones, or other video devices may be providing streaming digital video and have established connections, rendezvous server  returns peer information pertaining to one or more peers that are available for viewing selection by identifying the video devices using the unique identifier and associating the set top box with these devices. The peer information may include, for example, a list of connected set top boxes at the subscriber premises, a list of disconnected set top boxes that are available to stream video, a list of set top boxes that are not available to stream video, and other useful information, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, media access control (MAC) addresses, timestamps, and the like. Typically, this information is returned in an XML format, but other formats known in the art may be used. Application  may use the returned information to display a menu of choices to the subscriber on set top box . Once a selection of which digital video to view, application  requests the digital video from rendezvous server .","Now that both bidirectional data channels have been established, rendezvous server  announces the completed connection to control software  on the first video device. The announcement includes an address of a transcoder . Control software  then instructs encoder\/streamer  to connect begin encoding and streaming the digital video as a server. At the same time, control software contacts the transcoder  from the announcement, instructing it to request the streamed digital video from the encoder\/streamer  as a client. Transcoder  requests the video stream from encoder\/streamer , which, as noted above, requests authorization to stream from control software .","The video data stream itself includes the digital video, as well as other data. As is known in the art, header information may be added to the digital video data, such as real time streaming protocol (RTSP) headers, transmission control protocol (TCP) or user datagram protocol (UDP) headers, internet protocol (IP) headers, Ethernet frame headers, and so on. The digital video data is encoded using an encoding format known in the art, or in the case of live capture, unformatted data may be streamed.","As transcoder  receives the video stream, it transcodes it into a format that is decodable by the set top box . Next, this transcoded video stream is passed to stitcher , which performs stitching, scaling, and other video manipulation. Stitcher  forms a second video stream for display, by optionally stitching the digital video with another image, such as context help information, one or more navigation buttons, a menuing interface, an advertisement, information associated with the first video device, or information associated with the digital video. This stitched digital video is then passed as a second data stream from the headend to the set top box , and from there to the television.","A subscriber can control the video stream from the remote control , and need not return to the personal computer  or other first video device to do so, because the data channels are bidirectional. In particular, the subscriber may use the remote control  to send keystroke commands to the streaming application , as shown. In this case, the streaming application  receives the keystrokes and determines what interactive feature the subscriber wishes to access. If the feature is relevant to the streaming of digital video, application  forwards this information to stitcher . For example, if the subscriber clicks a \u201cstop\u201d or \u201cdisconnect\u201d button in the set top graphical interface, presses a channel up or channel down key, or navigates away from the special channel, the stitcher will be notified that new television signals are required. In this case, the stitcher will notify the encoder\/streamer  that a change to the stream (i.e., a tear down) is required. If necessary, the encoder\/streamer  will notify control software  of the change.","However, in some embodiments, the subscriber may perform other actions using the remote control. It is contemplated that a subscriber may use a graphical user interface, provided by stitcher  or streaming application  to set top box , to alter other stream parameters. These other parameters include, for example: audio and video encoding parameters, a video resolution, a new file name or URL to stream, and the like. Control software may then present these changes to the video application  using an application programming interface (API). The use of such APIs is known in the art for this purpose. It is contemplated that any parameter that may be altered using an API of a video application  may be accessed and changed using a set top box remote control.","Further, in some additional embodiments, the remote control  may be used to control other aspects of the function of the first video device. For instance, if the first video device is obtaining the digital video from a web site, the remote control  may be used to cause the first video device to navigate to a new URL to obtain new digital video. Or, the remote control  can be used to send real-time text message data to the first video device. This embodiment is particularly useful in the environment of  to request that the individual  use smartphone  to film a different interesting scene, or to provide feedback on the quality of the streamed video, for example. In alternate embodiments, such as that of , the remote control  may be used to control a personal computer  in other ways, such as launching and using an email client or other software application, directing the computer to shut down, or performing some other useful action. A person skilled in the art may envision other useful applications of the control channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["150","510","110","200","520","172","530","540","550","174"]},"It should be noted that this logic flow diagram is used herein to demonstrate various aspects of the invention, and should not be construed to limit the present invention to any particular logic flow or logic implementation.
