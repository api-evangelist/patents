No. 61\/902,970, filed Nov. 12, 2013, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The invention was made with the United States Government assistance under Contract No. W909MY-11-C-0074 awarded by the Department of the Army and Contract No. N00014-07-C-0292 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates to remote sensing and more particularly to phase resolved shearography for remote sensing.","2. Background Information","The prior art discloses various means for detecting buried objects, for instance, non-phase resolved (NPR) shearography and laser doppler vibrometry. Non-phase resolved shearography is unable to resolve the phase of an acousto-seismic signal and requires the use of high power laser sources. This limitation means that (a) inversion methods cannot be applied to the output to identify scattering sources or targets of interest in the acousto-seismic signal, and (b) this type of system is impractical for aircraft and other fast moving platforms that require large area coverage rates.","There is a need, however, to remotely measure the full phase and amplitude information of small scale acousto-seismic vibrations in order to detect the presence of buried objects (e.g. mines, tunnels etc.) or for other purposes. This remote sensing information may need to be collected with a large area coverage rate and at a safe standoff distance.","In shearography, a target surface, part or area being observed is illuminated by an expanding laser beam, and two time sequential images are captured of the target surface, part or area with an image-shearing camera. The first image is taken of the surface, and the second image is taken of the same surface a short time thereafter during deformation or loading of the surface. The two images taken are processed together to produce a third image (a shearogram) showing a fringe pattern that depicts the gradient of the displacement of the surface due to some loading of the surface between the first and second images.","More particularly, shearography is an optical measuring technique using coherent light for the interferometric observation of the surfaces typically under non-destructive thermal or mechanical loading to distinguish between structural information and anomalies of the surfaces or parts due to loading such as thermal or mechanical loading. The two images are each laterally displaced images taken of the surface of the part being observed and the two images are coherently superposed. The lateral displacement is called the shear of the images. The superposition of the two images is called a shearogram, which is an interferogram of an object wave with the sheared surface wave as a reference wave.","The absolute difference of two shearograms recorded at different physical loading conditions of the target surface, part or area is an interference fringe pattern which is directly correlated to the difference in the deformation state of the target area between taking the two images thereof. In contrast to holographic interferometry, the fringe pattern indicates the slope of deformation rather than the deformation itself. Defects inside the target part will affect the local surface deformation induced by the loading and result in a disturbance of the loading fringes that are detected.","The resultant difference images always exhibit a very noisy structure. This is due to what are called speckles. Speckles are statistical interference patterns which occur after reflection of a coherent wave off a rough surface, giving the image a grainy structure. Regarding shearography, the speckles are the carrier of information, coding the wave field and surface state information respectively and giving rise to interference fringe patterns. However, the grainy nature of the speckles is conserved and significantly decreases contrast and signal to noise ratio of the difference images.","The difference images typically exhibit strong noise and low contrast that require further image processing. This further image processing can be either image improvement or image evaluation. The goal is to remove speckle noise and to increase fringe contrast in order to improve the visibility of the fringes.","U.S. Pat. No. 8,717,577 (incorporated in full herein by reference) provides a method of collecting shearography data for a subject target from a moving platform, such as an aircraft, surface craft, handheld device or moving vehicle. In short, said patent provides a process in which, during movement of the moving platform, two onboard laser transmitters and an onboard optical receiver are operated in a manner that they appear to be stationary. To capture the pair of images (specklegrams) required for shearography, the first laser transmitter transmits a first laser pulse toward the ground while positioned at an angle with respect to the ground. The resulting first ground image is captured by the optical receiver. A very short time thereafter, a second laser transmitter transmits a second laser pulse toward the ground at the same angle. This occurs because the position of the second laser transmitter has been adjusted according to the speed of the moving platform so that during the time between the first and second laser pulse transmissions, the second laser transmitter has moved a distance by the motion of the aircraft or other moving platform so that the second laser transmitter is at the same position during the second laser transmission that the first laser transmitter was during the first laser transmission.","The present method addresses the above-noted need and provides improvements which may be used in conjunction with the method of the above-noted U.S. Pat. No. 8,717,577. The present system and method may also be used in a variety of other contexts, as noted further below.","In one aspect, the invention may provide a method comprising the steps of reflecting sequentially off of a target surface first, second and third laser beams so that the first laser beam is reflected off of the target surface when the target surface is under a first load to produce a first reflected laser beam image; the second laser beam is reflected off of the target surface when the target surface is under a second load which is different from the first load to produce a second reflected laser beam image; and the third laser beam is reflected off of the target surface when the target surface is under a third load which is different from each of the first and second loads to produce a third reflected laser beam image; phase stepping the first, second and third reflected laser beam images with a shearing interferometer to respective phases \u03b8, \u03b8and \u03b8of a laser beam wavelength; collecting with shearography equipment first, second and third specklegrams of the target surface based respectively on the first, second and third reflected laser beam images; and comparing the first, second and third specklegrams to one another to produce a first shearogram to ascertain surface changes of the target surface.","In another aspect, the invention may provide a method comprising the steps of reflecting sequentially off of a target surface first, second, third and fourth laser beams to respectively produce first, second, third and fourth reflected laser beam images; phase stepping the first, second, third and fourth reflected laser beam images with a shearing interferometer to respective phases \u03b8, \u03b8, \u03b8and \u03b8of a laser beam wavelength, wherein cos \u03b8=cos \u03b8and cos \u03b8=cos \u03b8; collecting with shearography equipment first, second, third and fourth specklegrams of the target surface based respectively on the first, second, third and fourth reflected laser beam images; and comparing the first, second, third and fourth specklegrams to one another to produce a shearogram to ascertain surface changes of the target surface; wherein the shearogram is based on a phase resolved shearogram equation Shearexpressed as a ratio of differences of specklegrams:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"Shear","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["PR","_"],"mo":"\u2062"},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"1"}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"4"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}],"mo":"-"}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"3"}}],"mo":"-"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"In another aspect, the invention may provide a method comprising the steps of reflecting sequentially off of a target surface first, second, third and fourth laser beams to respectively produce first, second, third and fourth reflected laser beam images; phase stepping the first, second, third and fourth reflected laser beam images with a shearing interferometer to respective phases \u03b8, \u03b8, \u03b8and \u03b8of a laser beam wavelength; collecting with shearography equipment first, second, third and fourth specklegrams of the target surface based respectively on the first, second, third and fourth reflected laser beam images; comparing the first, second and third specklegrams to one another to produce a first shearogram to ascertain surface changes of the target surface; and comparing the fourth specklegram and at least two of the first, second and third specklegrams to one another to produce a second shearogram to ascertain surface changes of the target surface.","Similar numbers refer to similar parts throughout the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","4","6","8","10","12","1","6","6","8","6","6","6","6","2","6"]},"Although a Michelson interferometer is suitable for the present process, a variety of shearing interferometers may be used, such that the interferometer is configured to collect multiple shearographic images with controlled phase differences between the arms of the interferometer.

Device  may be an onboard excitation device A mounted on moving platform  or may be a separate excitation device B which is separate from or not on moving platform . Device A may be, for instance, a sound driver or acoustic source or speaker capable of producing or emitting sound waves , for example, a relatively high power, low frequency sound wave which is directed from moving platform \/apparatus  toward the ground or other target surface  to vibrate (deform or load) the ground or other target . Separate device B may be, for example, a seismic thumper which may be in the form of a thumper truck, which may also be known as a vibroseis truck or vibe truck. A seismic thumper may impact or be directed toward the ground or other target to likewise vibrate (deform or load) the ground or other target , as illustrated by waves or vibrations . The use of shearagraphy equipment  allows for the discernment of underground anomalies  such as underground ordnance or landmines (including improvised explosive devices or IED) or other subsurface or underground objects or structures such as rooms, tunnels, pipes and so forth.","In the basic operation of shearography apparatus , one of the one or more laser transmitters  transmits, emits or shoots a laser beam (Arrow B) which impacts a target surface or target area  and is reflected from area  as a reflected laser beam image (Arrow C) back to apparatus  into beam splitter , onto mirrors  and  and into camera , which captures the reflected image in two copies which are laterally displaced (sheared image copies) and combined to form a specklegram. The reflected laser beam images and specklegrams are collected and stored or saved in a memory of CPU , which includes a computer program of the shearography system which is configured to process the specklegrams to produce a shearogram from which can be discerned surface changes of target surface  and corresponding subsurface structures or movements. The computer program run by CPU  is configured to calculate the various relevant equations discussed below in order to effect the methods discussed herein.","One shearography method  is shown in . As shown in block , the method may include reflecting sequentially off of a target surface (such as 15) at least three laser beams when the target surface is respectively under different loads (and different surface states) to produce respective reflected laser beam images. This method may then include the steps of phase stepping the reflected laser beam images with a shearing interferometer (block ), collecting specklegrams of the target surface based respectively on the reflected laser beam images (block ), and comparing the specklegrams to one another to create or produce a shearogram to ascertain surface changes of the target surface (block ). The shearing interferometer of shearography equipment  is configured with stepping mirror  or another phase shifting or phase stepping optical element to phase shift or phase step the reflected laser beams images. Typically, three or four laser beam emissions or shots are used to respectively produce three or four reflected laser beam images, which in turn are used to respectively produce three or four specklegrams. It is noted that for a given set of the laser beams (e.g., three or four) used to derive a given specklegram, the laser beam wavelength of each laser beam is the same for that given set. A set of three specklegrams may be processed or compared to one another to produce a given shearogram or a set of four specklegrams may be processed or compared to one another to produce a given shearogram. This process may be repeated as many times as desired to produce as many shearograms as desired over time.","Thus, for instance, a first shearogram may provide information indicative of surface changes (such as surface relief changes) of the target surface at a given time (when a given\/first set of laser beams used to create a specklegram are reflected off of the target surface); a second shearogram may provide information indicative of surface changes of the target surface at a subsequent given time (when a given\/second subsequent set of laser beams used to create a specklegram are reflected off of the target surface); a third shearogram may provide information indicative of surface changes of the target surface at a subsequent given time (when a given\/third subsequent set of laser beams used to create a specklegram are reflected off of the target surface); and so forth. The first, second, third etc shearograms thus provide surface change information at time intervals so that the observer of the shearograms can discern surface changes of the target surface over time, which may even occur in a movie format in essentially real time. Various aspects of the method or methods at issue are discussed in greater detail hereafter.","When onboard excitation device A is a sound driver, device A is operated to insonify target area , thereby deforming or loading target . Separate device B may also be used. In either case, the target surface  is deformed or loaded. It is noted that other sources (e.g., ambient excitations) of deformation or vibration may also be used to deform or load the target surface, wherein such sources are not controlled by the user or investigator. Thus, for instance, any natural source of vibration may be used as an excitation providing a given load on the target surface. While surface  is thus deformed or loaded with a first load, one of laser transmitters  transmits or shoots a first laser beam (Arrow B) onto target area  such that the first laser beam is reflected (Arrow C) and sheared and phase stepped\/shifted via the shearing interferometer to produce an image which is captured by camera  and saved or stored. Very shortly (typically a few milliseconds) after producing the first load and after the first transmission of the laser beam, device A or B (or another source) may be operated to similarly deform or load target  with a second load which is different from the first load. While surface  is thus deformed or loaded with the second load, one of laser transmitters  likewise transmits or shoots a second laser beam (Arrow B) onto target area  so that the second laser beam is likewise reflected (Arrow C) and sheared and phase stepped via the interferometer to produce an image which is captured by camera  and saved or stored. This process of loading target area  with different loads and transmitting laser beams onto target area  may occur multiple times at very brief time intervals (again, typically a few milliseconds between a given pair of loads and a given pair of laser shots). Thus, for instance, shortly after producing the second load and after the second laser beam transmission, device  (or another source) may load target  with a third load which is different from the first and second loads, so that while surface  is loaded with the third load, one of laser transmitters  transmits onto target area  a third laser beam which is reflected and sheared and phase stepped via the interferometer to produce a third image captured by camera  and saved or stored; and shortly after producing the third load and after the third laser beam transmission, device  (or another source) may load target  with a fourth load which is different from the first, second and third loads, so that while surface  is loaded with the fourth load, one of laser transmitters  transmits onto target area  a fourth laser beam which is reflected and sheared and phase stepped via the interferometer to produce a fourth image captured by camera  and saved or stored. This process may continue although three or four laser shots and captured images are typically sufficient to produce a given shearogram with the desired information as to a certain target area of a given size. Nonetheless, this process may continue with respect to a larger target area in order to produce as many shearograms as needed to obtain the desired information. As noted or suggested above, the time between a given pair of laser shots and between a given pair of loads may be very short. The time between laser beam shots may be less than \u00bd the wavelength of an acoustic excitation or sound wave. While this may vary, in many cases, three, four or five laser beam shots may occur within five or ten milliseconds.","This system and method are set up in a manner which allows for obtaining shearograms without using unloaded specklegrams. Rather, the shearography equipment may be used to produce a plurality of laser emissions to the ground or other target surface while that surface is loaded by an excitation device (controlled or uncontrolled) such that all of the specklegrams may be loaded specklegrams. The present method is discussed in greater detail further below after additional background information on shearography is discussed to provide additional context for the invention.","Shearography Equations","The Sheared Specklegram Equation is shown in Table 1.

For instance, the shot noise being much less than the speckle noise generally means that the laser speckle is the major source of noise in the imagery. One skilled in the art can determine this readily by examining the imagery and applying standard statistical computations. With respect to the laser interpulse time being much less than speckle decorrelation time, the laser interpulse time needs to be short enough for at least three laser shots, and preferably four laser shots, to be acquired in less than the speckle decorrelation time. Thus, a laser interpulse time less than \u2153 or \u00bc the speckle decorrelation time is typically adequate. Shorter interpulse times are acceptable but not required.","It is noted that the terms \u201cdecorrelation time,\u201d \u201ccorrelation time,\u201d and \u201ccoherence time\u201d may be used interchangeably. The correlation time \u03c4is the time over which two samples, separated by some time t, of a laser beam which is perfectly coherent appear to lose coherence. When t<\u03c4, the samples are coherent (highly correlated) with each other. The coherence losses are due to fluctuations in the media through which the laser beams pass, such as turbulence or aerosol scattering in air. The coherence time can be many seconds long in well-controlled laboratory or medical-imaging conditions. In airborne buried-object-detection applications of the present method (i.e., when platform  is an aircraft using equipment  to detect underground objects), a coherence time of five milliseconds is typical. As the time t between laser samples increases beyond \u03c4, coherence decreases gradually, so that shearographic processing can still work, but with decreasing signal-to-noise as time t further increases above \u03c4.","As to the signal spatial wavelengths being much greater than the speckle sizes, this depends on the high-level requirements (probability of detection, probability of recognition, etc.) for the mission for which the system is being designed. Typical detection requirements would sample the surface at a minimum spatial frequency corresponding to Nyquist sampling of the wavelengths of interest. Finer sampling would yield more accurate estimates of surface vibration or motion of the target. Thus, the system designer would trade accuracy for area coverage, since the number of pixels per second that can be collected is usually a constraint. Regarding the signal spatial wavelengths being much greater than the shear distance, this is not a hard and fast rule. The ideal distance depends on how the target surface is vibrating. If it is vibrating locally, for example sand over a resonating cavity, the ideal shear distance is less than the diameter of the cavity. For travelling sinusoidal surface waves, the ideal shear distance is one-half of the wavelength. In both cases, shorter shear distances can be used. For longer shear distances, information can still be extracted, though some information may be aliased from high spatial frequencies into lower spatial frequencies. A system designer skilled in the art would determine how much aliasing is tolerable, and choose the shear distances

significance of this result is that the usual phase-stepped shearography equation (see Table 4) yields a phase which is a sum of the signal and the speckle phases. This random phase dominates the noise in shearogram images, and adds significant processing burden to signal-recovery process. It will be understood that our process and algorithm has eliminated or essentially eliminated the random speckle phase. This not only greatly reduces the processing burden, but it also greatly improves the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the recovered signal.","b.

minimum number of specklegrams needed to do phase-resolved processing is three. Shearin Table 13, for instance, only uses three specklegrams (s1), (s2) and (s3) to produce a shearogram. These three specklegrams have phase mirror positions of 0, +2\u03c0\/3, and +4\u03c0\/3 radians, respectively (or are otherwise phase stepped to those phases). Shearin Table 13 uses four specklegrams with respective mirror positions of 0, +2\u03c0\/3, +4\u03c0\/3, and 0 radians. Shearwill have much less speckle noise than Shear, especially for very small surface-motion amplitudes. Either algorithm will output a signal proportional to the ground surface motion or target surface motion, with a sample-rate-dependent relative phase lag of up to \u03c0 radians.","Basics of Sheared Specklegram Images","Before providing additional details concerning the present method, we now broaden the discussion of basic concepts of shearography. Each specklegram or specklegram image represents a combination of two images which pass through separate arms of a shearing interferometer before being combined and recorded on a focal plane. A shearing interferometer operates by using a beam-splitter or other optical element to make copies of an incoming light field. An optical shearing device, such as a tilted mirror, shear plate or other element known in the art, shifts the copies relative to each other such that a pixel representing location (x,y) in one copy appears at a point (x+\u0394x, y+\u0394) in another copy. These two light fields are identical, other than the location shift. The relatively-shifted copies of the light field are optically recombined and recorded on a focal plane, creating an image called a sheared speckle gram. Because the illumination is coherent, and the surface being illuminated is microscopically rough, the reflected light field has intensities and phases containing random fluctuations from point to point, so that the recorded image contains intensity fluctuations called speckles. Speckles are random from point to point in an image, with an intensity which is influenced both by the deterministic geometry of the area under investigation, and by statistical fluctuations. The statistical fluctuations have a time dependence which is characterized by a correlation time scale \u03c4. The correlation time \u03c4is determined by the imaging conditions, and can be several seconds long.

so that sets of specklegrams known to be at the same loading condition can be acquired. For example, if the surface loading varies periodically with a period T, then acquiring specklegrams with phases \u03b8, \u03b8, and \u03b8, at time T, T+T, and T+2T, respectively would yield specklegrams for Load A, and acquiring specklegrams with phases \u03b8, \u03b8, and \u03b8, at time T, T+T, and T+2T, respectively would yield specklegrams for Load B.","The requirement that the controlled phases in the shearography system be synchronized with the loading conditions, and that at least two groups of three specklegrams be used to construct a shearogram, is a significant limiter of performance for very dynamic conditions in which the investigator cannot control or predict the loading phases of the area being investigated. Examples include imaging in situations in which dwell times are limited by hazardous conditions (as in a combat situation), or in which the excitation causing the loading is transient and not controlled by the investigator. One alternative is to not use phase stepping, and to construct shearograms by differencing specklegrams acquired under loading conditions with all of the interferometer phases \u03b8, \u03b8, etc held constant, that is, with no phase stepping at all. It is well known in the art that the resulting differences of specklegrams (sj)-(si) will yield very noisy estimates of the differences between loading conditions, typically requiring many repeated measurements to achieve high sensitivity, again limiting the performance of the measurement system for dynamic or uncontrolled phenomena.","Present System and Method to Separate Signal and Speckle Phase Dynamically","The system\/method presented here allows operation of a shearing interferometer with phase stepping in a novel manner which allows for dynamic operation. Computing a highly sensitive estimate of the signal phase requires only four images, and exploits uncontrolled loading conditions, accessing a wider range of phenomena. The mathematical underpinnings are based on Equation (6) above, with the trigonometric functions expanded as follows:\n\ncos [\u03c6()+\u03c6()+\u03b8]=cos [\u03c6()+\u03b8] cos \u03c6()\u2212sin [\u03c6()+\u03b8] sin \u03c6()\u2003\u2003(13)\n\nUnlike the current art, the controlled phase \u03b8is varied for every image as the load changes with time, the load also varying for each image.

Moreover, the phase steps between the laser beams and specklegrams s1, s2, s3, s4 do not need to all be equal.

This may alternately be stated that phase \u03b8and phase \u03b8define therebetween a first phase step or phase difference; and at least one of: (a) phase \u03b8and phase \u03b8define therebetween a phase step or phase difference which is different from the first phase step or phase difference; and (b) phase \u03b8and phase \u03b8define therebetween a phase step or phase difference different from the first phase step or phase difference.","The phase-resolved processing may be applied continuously and may be applied in an overlapping manner, for example computing Shearfor a first set of four shots with phases 0, +2\u03c0\/3, +4\u03c0\/3 and 0 radians, then for a second set of four shots with phases +2\u03c0\/3, +4\u03c0\/3, 0 and +2\u03c0\/3 radians, then for a third set of four shots with phases +4\u03c0\/3, 0, +2\u03c0\/3 and +4\u03c0\/3 radians, then for a fourth set of four shots with phases 0, +2\u03c0\/3, +4\u03c0\/3 and 0 radians, etc., yielding a continuous movie of the surface motion. The first set of four shots may also be expressed, for example, as phase \u03b8=0, phase \u03b8=+2\u03c0\/3, phase \u03b8=+4\u03c0\/3 and phase \u03b8=0 radians; the second set of four shots may be expressed as phase \u03b8=+2\u03c0\/3, phase \u03b8=+4\u03c0\/3, phase \u03b8=0 and phase \u03b8=+2\u03c0\/3 radians; the third set of four shots may be expressed as phase \u03b8=+4\u03c0\/3, phase \u03b8=0, phase \u03b8=+2\u03c0\/3 and phase \u03b8=+4\u03c0\/3 radians; and the fourth set of four shots may be expressed as phase \u03b8=0, phase \u03b8=+2\u03c0\/3, phase \u03b8=+4\u03c0\/3 and phase \u03b8=0 radians. In this example, it is noted that the second set of four shots overlaps the first set of four shots; that the third set of four shots overlaps each of the first and second sets; and that the fourth set of four shots overlaps each of the first, second and third sets. More particularly, the first three shots of the second set with phases +2\u03c0\/3 radians, +4\u03c0\/3 radians and 0 radians are the same as the last three shots of the first set so that the second set overlaps the first set with an overlap of three common shots; the first three shots of the third set with phases +4\u03c0\/3, 0 and +2\u03c0\/3 radians are the same as the last three shots of the second set so that the third set overlaps the second set with an overlap of three common shots; the first two shots of the third set with phases +4\u03c0\/3 and 0 radians are the same as the last two shots of the first set so that the third set overlaps the first set with an overlap of two common shots; the first three shots of the fourth set with phases 0, +2\u03c0\/3, +4\u03c0\/3 radians are the same as the last three shots of the third set so that the fourth set overlaps the third set with an overlap of three common shots; the first two shots of the fourth set with phases 0 and +2\u03c0\/3 radians are the same as the last two shots of the second set so that the fourth set overlaps the second set with an overlap of two common shots; and the first shot of the fourth set with phase 0 radians is the same as the last shot of the first set so that the fourth set overlaps the first set with an overlap of one common shot. Of course, a fifth set of four shots in this pattern would similarly overlap the second, third and fourth sets while not overlapping the first set. Such a fifth set of four shots may be expressed as phase \u03b8=+2\u03c0\/3, phase \u03b8=+4\u03c0\/3, phase \u03b8=0 and phase \u03b8=+2\u03c0\/3 radians.

More particularly, where the three laser shots (shots 1, 2 and 3) are part of a longer sequence, for example, of laser shots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . . , the same rules apply except that the specklegrams are derived from three laser shots each. For instance, a first specklegram may be derived from or based on laser shots 1, 2 and 3; a second specklegram may be derived from or based on laser shots 2, 3 and 4; a third specklegram may be derived from or based on laser shots 3, 4 and 5; a fourth specklegram may be derived from or based on laser shots 4, 5 and 6; a fifth specklegram may be derived from or based on laser shots 5, 6 and 7, and so on. This processing of specklegrams may create a movie of the moving target surface. On the other hand, where only three laser shots are used, the first laser shot can be acquired at any convenient relative phase, and the rules for selecting the phase are (cos \u03b8=cos \u03b8), (sin \u03b8\u2260sin \u03b8). Like Equation (19), Equation (20) can be employed generally for any time-varying load, and is not confined to the peak-straddling load condition.","As noted, the method uses at least three (and preferably four) interferometric images or specklegrams with a controlled phase difference between images. With the use of a pulsed laser, the term \u201cshot\u201d for each image may be used. The data do not have to be collected in \u201cbursts\u201d of three or four shots\u2014many images can be collected over an extended time and processed to yield a movie of the target surface motions, as noted above. Because the phase-resolved method captures both the magnitude and the sign of the surface motion, the speeds and propagation directions of the vibrations can be determined. Further, the data collection can be asynchronous with the surface motions\u2014there is no need to time the laser pulses to match the phases of the target surface motions. The ability to image microscopic vibrations which are not under the control of the operator as said vibrations propagate across a surface is a distinctive capability, allowing for fast collection of surface vibrations arising from a variety of causes.","A continuous-wave laser is also usable, if the power collected over a short camera-exposure time is high enough to provide enough photoelectrons per pixel. Here, \u201cshort exposure time\u201d means a time much less than the minimum of: (a) the surface-vibration periods of interest, or (b) the scintillation correlation time of the medium through which the laser is passing (typically several milliseconds for air).","Tests","An experimental verification of phase resolved shearography using a circular membrane or drumhead target was conducted. The membrane target was assembled from a 12\u2033 by 18\u2033 plate (thinned to 0.02\u2033 over two 3\u2033 diameter regions) and a micrometer. The micrometer could be adjusted to push against one of the thinned regions of the plate producing variable amounts of surface distortion. Two tests were conducted using this target, a large amplitude test (in which the membrane was distorted by an amplitude large enough to generate multiple ring pairs within the shearogram) and a small amplitude test (in which the membrane was distorted by a smaller amplitude, generating only a single ring pair within the shearogram). For each of these tests, a phase resolved (PR) shearogram and a non-phase resolved (NPR) shearogram were generated. Each test consisted of collecting a series of four specklegram images of the front of the plate as the distortion was adjusted from zero to some maximum displacement amplitude in four equal steps. The large amplitude test indicated that the PR shearography method produced shearograms with positive and negative fringe values, resolving both the magnitude and sign of the slope changes. The small amplitude test provided similar results, illustrating that even at low amplitudes, the PR shearography was able to resolve the magnitude and the sign of the slope changes. The tests emphasize superior performance of PR versus NPR shearography for resolving positive versus negative surface-slope changes. The PR shearography also proved to have a much improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), for example, a 9\u00d7SNR improvement. Further, cross sections of PR and NPR shearograms were compared in a large amplitude test, and were likewise compared in a small amplitude test. In both cases, the fringe contrast was significantly larger for PR shearograms than for NPR shearograms. With PR shearography, the fringes are clearer and easier to resolve at all amplitudes, phase unwrapping is unambiguous, and the SNR is about nine times higher than in NPR shearography.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that while the present method is useful for remote detection of buried\/underground objects or structures, it may also be used in a variety of other situations. For instance, other uses include non-contact sensing of acousto-seismic vibrations for other applications including investigation of properties to the transmitting medium. Since the technique is sensitive to extremely small surface amplitude changes, there are likely many other applications, including the real-time measurement of small surface changes as might be helpful in the development of oxidation layers or biofilms, which may be represented by target surface . Although the method was discussed primarily with respect to using shearography apparatus  while moving relative to the target on a moving platform, shearography apparatus  may also be used while stationary, and for instance, may be so used to detect leaking underground pipes or the digging or building of a tunnel or underground room.","The present shearography may be used to ascertain or identify various subsurface structures, including the underground structures previously noted as well as any subsurface structure beneath a given target surface. The present shearography system and process may be used in the medical field, for instance, including non-contact monitoring of respiration, non-contact cardiograms and non-contact ultrasound imaging. There may be many other uses\u2014any phenomenon (such as sound) which can convey information from inside a body to make a physical change in the surface might be exploited. In such cases, target surface  may, for instance, represent a skin surface of a person (or animal) undergoing the respective shearography procedure, which would thus allow via shearograms for the determining or ascertaining subsurface structures or movement within a human body (or animal).","As noted further above, the prior art phase stepped shearography required that for a given set of specklegrams used to produce a shearogram, the loading conditions must be constant for the specklegrams in that given set. In contrast, the present method(s) allows a shearogram to be produced from a set of specklegrams for which the loads are different.","In addition, while prior art phase stepped shearography required that two shearograms be produced and compared to one another to discern surface changes, the present shearography allows for ascertaining surface changes of a target surface with a single shearogram. Additional shearograms in the present method may thus be used to show additional surface changes over time which allow for the creation of a movie of the surface changes which may be an essentially real time movie of those surface changes, and thus an essentially real time movie of subsurface structures or subsurface movements below the target surface. The method(s) herein vastly reduces or eliminates the \u201cunwrapping\u201d processing required in prior art shearography.","In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clearness, and understanding.
