{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 11\/763,588, filed Jun. 15, 2007, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/814,047, filed Jun. 16, 2006, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to telecommunications services. More particularly, the present invention relates to capabilities that enhance substantially a key element of Unified Messaging (UM) and Unified Communications (UC) initiatives\u2014i.e., Mobile Subscriber (MS) Location Awareness (LA).","2. Background of the Invention","As the \u2018wireless revolution\u2019 continues to march forward the importance to a MS, for example a user of a Wireless Device (WD) such as a cellular telephone or a BlackBerry that is serviced by a Wireless Carrier (WC), of their WD grows substantially.","For example, under UM and UC schemes or environments, among other things, the storage, management, presentation, etc. of multiple messaging paradigms or models (including, inter alia, voice, Short Message Service [SMS], Multimedia Message Service [MMS], Internet Protocol [IP] Multimedia Subsystem [IMS], Instant Messenger [IM], Electronic Mail [E-Mail], facsimile transmission [FAX], etc.) are dynamically adapted to match or otherwise meet the unique requirements, needs, etc. of a MS\u2032 particular circumstances and are subsequently exposed or offered to a MS\u2032 WD through mechanisms such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), etc.","A key element in the determination of a MS\u2032 particular circumstances' (as referenced above) is knowledge of the current physical location of a MS\u2032 WD\u2014i.e., MS LA.","MS LA-based service offerings are of particular interest to, for example, individuals who are \u2018on call\u2019 for business reasons (e.g., technical support, etc.) or for personal reasons (e.g., a medical condition such as organ transplantation, pregnancy, etc.), first responders, individuals within a large corporate environment, etc.","The present invention extends key elements of wireless technology to augment MS LA-based offerings and addresses various of the (not insubstantial) challenges that are associated with same thereby incrementally enhancing the value, usefulness, etc. of the presence awareness, place shifting, etc. components of UM and UC schemes or environments.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a service that augments a key element of UM and UC initiatives\u2014i.e., MS LA\u2014to enhance substantially the value, usefulness, etc. of the presence awareness, place shifting, etc. components of such initiatives.","In an embodiment of the invention a Service Provider (SP) (1) receives a location update from a WC indicative of the current physical location of a MS's WD, (2) completes one or more processing steps on the received location update using, possibly inter alia, information that was previously supplied by the MS, and (3) updates one or more elements within a repository with the results of the processing steps.","In another embodiment of the invention a SP (1) receives a location inquiry from a requestor, (2) processes the received inquiry, and (3) dispatches one or more response messages, containing current location information, to the requestor. The location inquiry and the response messages may transit any number of channels including, possibly inter alia, SMS, MMS, IMS, IM, E-Mail, a Web-based facility, etc.","In another embodiment of the invention a SP (1) receives a contact inquiry from a requestor, (2) processes the received inquiry, and (3) dispatches one or more response messages, containing current contact information, to the requestor. The contact inquiry and the response messages may transit any number of channels including, possibly inter alia, SMS, MMS, IMS, IM, E-Mail, a Web-based facility, etc.","In still another embodiment, there is provided a method for providing contact information for a mobile subscriber. Registration information is received from a mobile subscriber including information about predetermined locations frequented by the mobile subscriber and contact information is further received corresponding to at least some of said predetermined locations. A wireless carrier providing service to the mobile subscriber provides an indication of a current location of a wireless device belonging to the mobile subscriber.","A query for contact information for the mobile subscriber is received and then, based, at least in part, on the indication of the current location of the wireless device belonging to the mobile subscriber, one of the predetermined locations frequented by the mobile subscriber is identified as a present location of the mobile subscriber. The contact information corresponding to the present location of the mobile subscriber, if any, is then selected, and a message, in response to the query, is generated and sent, then message including the contact information corresponding to the present location of the mobile subscriber.","These and other features of the embodiments of the present invention along with their attendant advantages will be more fully appreciated upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the associated drawings.","The present invention may leverage the capabilities of a centrally-located, full-featured MICV facility. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901 entitled \u201cINTERMEDIARY NETWORK SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING MESSAGE EXCHANGE BETWEEN WIRELESS NETWORKS,\u201d and its associated continuations, for a description of a MICV, a summary of various of the services\/functions\/etc. that are performed by a MICV, and a discussion of the numerous advantages that arise from same.","As illustrated by  and reference numeral  a MICV  is disposed between, possibly inter alia, multiple WCs (WC\u2192WC) on one side and multiple SPs (SP\u2192SP) on the other side and thus \u2018bridges\u2019 all of the connected entities. A MICV  thus, as one simple example, may offer various routing, formatting, delivery, value-add, etc. capabilities that provide, possibly inter alia:","1) A WC, WC\u2192WC (and by extension all of the MSs [MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS] that are serviced by a WC [WC\u2192WC]), with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of SPs (SP\u2192SP), and","2) A SP (SP\u2192SP) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of WCs (WC \u2192WC and, by extension, to all of the MSs [MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS, MS\u2192MS] that are serviced by a WC [WC\u2192WC]).","Generally speaking a MICV may have varying degrees of visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to the (MS\u2190\u2192MS, MS\u2190\u2192SP, etc.) messaging traffic:","1) A WC may elect to route just their out-of-network messaging traffic to a MICV. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to just the portion of the WC's messaging traffic that was directed to the MICV by the WC.","2) A WC may elect to route all of their messaging traffic to a MICV. The MICV may, possibly among other things, subsequently return to the WC that portion of the messaging traffic that belongs to (i.e., that is destined for a MS of) the WC. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to all of the WC's messaging traffic.","While the discussion below will include a MICV it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other arrangements are equally applicable and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In the discussion below the present invention is described and illustrated as being offered by a SP. A SP may, for example, be realized as a third-party service bureau, an element of a WC or a landline carrier, an element of a MICV, multiple third-party entities working together, etc.","In the discussion below reference is made to messages that are sent, for example, between a MS and a SP. As set forth below, a given \u2018message\u2019 sent between a MS and a SP may actually comprise a series of steps in which the message is received, forwarded and routed between different entities, including possibly inter alia a MS, a WC, a MICV, and a SP. Thus, unless otherwise indicated, it will be understood that reference to a particular message generally includes that particular message as conveyed at any stage between an origination source, such as for example a MS, and an end receiver, such as for example a SP. As such, reference to a particular message generally includes a series of related communications between, for example, a MS and a WC; a WC and a MICV; a MICV and a SP; etc. The series of related communications may, in general, contain substantially the same information, or information may be added or subtracted in different communications that nevertheless may be generally referred to as a same message. To aid in clarity, a particular message, whether undergoing changes or not, is referred to by different reference numbers at different stages between a source and an endpoint of the message.","To better understand the particulars of the present invention consider for a moment a simple hypothetical example\u2014SP SPoffers a service that has been enhanced or augmented as provided through the instant invention and Mary, a MS, uses SP's service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"MS  WD . For example, Mary's WD such as a cellular telephone, BlackBerry, PalmPilot, etc.","MS  Personal Computer (PC) . For example, one of Mary's home, work, etc. PCs.","WC . The provider of service for Mary's WD .","MICV . As noted above the use of a MICV , although not required, provides significant advantages.","SP  Web Server (WS) . A publicly-available World Wide Web (WWW) site that is optionally provided by SP.","SP  Billing Interface (BI) . A single, consolidated interface that SP may use to easily reach, inter alia, one or more external entities such as a credit card or debit card clearinghouse, a carrier billing system, a service bureau that provides access to multiple carrier billing systems, etc.","SP  AS . Facilities that provide key elements of the instant invention (which will be described below).","It is important to note or observe that in :","1) The MS  WD  and MS  PC  entities are illustrated as being adjacent or otherwise near each other. In actual practice the entities may, for example, be physically located anywhere.","2) The messages are shown traversing a MICV .","3) The SP  may employ a Short Code (SC) or a regular Telephone Number (TN) as its source address (and to which it would ask users of its service to direct any messages). While the abbreviated length of a SC (e.g., five digits for a SC administered by Neustar under the Common Short Code [CSC] program) incrementally enhances the experience of a MS  (e.g., the MS  need remember and enter only a few digits as the destination address of a message) it also, by definition, constrains the universe of available SCs thereby causing each individual SC to be a limited or scarce resource and raising a number of SC\/CSC management, etc. issues. A description of a common (i.e., universal) short code environment may be found in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/742,764 entitled \u201cUNIVERSAL SHORT CODE ADMINISTRATION FACILITY,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as Mary (our MS ) completes a registration process with SP. For example:","A) Mary  uses one of her PCs  to visit a WS  that is offered by SP to, possibly among other things, complete a service registration process (\u2192).","B) SP's  WS  interacts with SP's  AS  to, possibly among other things, commit some or all of the information that Mary  provided to a data repository (e.g., a database), optionally complete a billing transaction, etc. ().","C) As appropriate and as required a BI  completes a billing transaction (\u2192).","D) SP's  WS  responds appropriately (e.g., with the presentation of a confirmation message, etc.) (\u2192).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention. As just one example, the registration process may be completed through any combination of one or more channels including, inter alia, the indicated WWW facility, wireless messaging (SMS, MMS, IMS, etc.), E-Mail messages, IM exchanges, conventional mail, telephone, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) facilities, etc.","During the registration process that was described above a range of information may be captured from a MS including, inter alia:","1) Identifying Information (e.g., general information about Mary). For example, possibly among other things, a unique identifier and a password, optionally a pseudonym or handle, name, address, age, etc.","2) Billing Information. Different service billing models may be offered by SPincluding, possibly inter alia, free (e.g., possibly advertising-based), a fixed one-time charge, a recurring (monthly, etc.) fixed charge, a recurring (monthly, etc.) variable charge, a per-use charge, etc. Different payment mechanisms may be supported by SPincluding, possibly among other things, credit or debit card information, authorization to place a charge on a MS's phone bill, etc.","3) Locations (e.g., the various physical locations [home, work, schools, stores, etc.] that Mary frequents and which Mary wishes to explicitly identify). For example, possibly among other things, a brief description, the full physical address, etc.","4) Contacts (e.g., all of the different ways that Mary may be contacted [telephone, E-Mail, IM, etc.] and which Mary wishes to make available). For example, possibly inter alia, wireline telephone numbers (e.g., home, work, etc.), wireless telephone numbers (e.g., personal, work, etc.), E-Mail addresses (e.g., personal, work, etc.), IM handles (e.g., personal, work, etc.), Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, for example a personal Web site), etc.","5) Associations (e.g., the mapping or association between a location and a contact along with the relative prioritization [1st, 2, etc.] of same).","The specific pieces of information that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other pieces of information are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","As noted above the information that Mary provided during the registration process may be preserved in a data repository (e.g., a database) and may optionally be organized as a MS Profile. For purposes of illustration a portion of an exemplary MS Profile data model is presented in  (and reference numeral ) and selected contents of same are presented in  (and reference numeral ).","The content of Mary's profile may optionally be augmented by SP. For example, for each of the identified locations an internal or external data source may be queried to determine the latitude (\u03c6 or Phi) and longitude (\u03bb or Lambda) of the location from the physical address of the location.","As noted above, a SP's BI may optionally complete a billing transaction. The billing transaction may take any number of forms and may involve different external entities (e.g., a WC's billing system, a carrier billing system service bureau, a credit or debit card clearinghouse, etc.). The billing transaction may include, inter alia:","1) The appearance of a line item charge on the bill or statement that a MS receives from her WC. Exemplary mechanics and logistics associated with this approach are described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/837,695 entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BILLING AUGMENTATION.\u201d Other ways of completing or performing line item billing are easily implemented by those skilled in the art.","2) The charging of a credit card or the debiting of a debit card.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP registers, coordinates, etc. with WC  to, possibly among other things, receive from WC  Location Based Services (LBS)-based, Global Positioning System (GPS)-based, etc. location updates regarding or concerning Mary's  WD  (\u2192).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges (including, inter alia, a WC  optionally explicitly confirming with a MS  their desire\/acceptance before beginning to provide MS  WD  location information to a SP , updates to various of the information in a MS Profile in a SP's  repository, etc.) are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP dispatches to Mary  one or more confirmation E-Mail messages (\u2192).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges (including, inter alia, other types or forms of confirmation messages) are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP's  AS  dispatches one or more confirmation SMS, MMS, IMS, etc. messages to Mary's  WD  and Mary  replies or responds to the message(s). In the instant example the messages are shown traversing a MICV . The SP  may employ a SC or a regular TN as its source address (and to which it would ask a MS  to direct any reply messages).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","The Set , Set , Set , and Set  exchanges that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","The information that was described above may be subsequently managed (e.g., existing information may be edited or removed, new information may be added, etc.) through any combination of one or more channels including, inter alia, a SP's WWW facility, wireless messaging (SMS, MMS, IMS, etc.), E-Mail messages, IM exchanges, conventional mail, telephone, IVR facilities, etc.","To continue with our hypothetical example . . . After completing the registration process Mary goes about her normal activities\u2014e.g., she drives to work, she attends meetings, she works in her office, she goes to lunch, she drives home, she attends functions at her children's schools, she goes shopping, she attends sporting events, she travels on business, etc. As Mary moves about her WC provides updates to SPcontaining information about the physical location of Mary's WD.","The WC-supplied location updates may consist of any combination of, for example, real-time, periodic, batched, etc. updates and may be conveyed through any combination of, for example, SMS\/MMS\/IMS\/etc. messages, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents, custom Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), etc. For purposes of illustration an exemplary XML document might contain, possibly inter alia:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<MSLocationUpdate>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<MSTN>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<703-555-9876>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/MSTN>"]},{"entry":[{},"<MSLatitude>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\u03c6>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/MSLatitude>"]},{"entry":[{},"<MSLongitude>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\u03bb>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\/MSLongitude>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/MSLocationUpdate>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"After a SP receives a location update from a WC it may complete one or more processing steps.

Through such a registration process a SP may optionally associate an identifier\/password to a third-party and may optionally require that a third-party supply those credentials each time that they submit a contact inquiry.","If SPwere to require such third-party registration then SPmay optionally allow Mary to, possibly inter alia:","1) Explicitly identify those third parties to whom Mary wishes to grant inquiry access. Any other (i.e., unidentified) third-party inquirer might receive, for example, a \u2018Not Authorized\u2019 response message.","2) Dynamically change the content, etc. of a response message based on the identity of an inquirer\u2014e.g., if Mary's husband were inquiring then the TN of Mary's WD might always be returned; if one of Mary's friends were inquiring then Mary's work E-Mail address might be returned; etc. Additionally, specific information about Mary\u2014e.g., her vCard, her personal or professional Web site URL, etc.\u2014may also be conditionally included in a response message based on the identity of an inquirer.","Such processing and response message behavior may be directed through a body of flexible, extensible, dynamically configurable, and easily managed rule sets.","A SP may optionally provide any number of value-add additions to the core functionality that was described above. Such additions may carry an incremental (one-time, recurring, etc.) fee or charge. For example, a SP may offer:","1) Alerts. For example, Mary may indicate that she would like (e.g., for tracking purposes) that an alert to, or an indication of, each incoming contact inquiry be directed to a specified destination (e.g., TN, E-Mail address, IM address, etc.).","2) Diversion. For example, Mary may indicate that in addition to contact inquiries that actual (SMS\/MMS\/IMS, etc.) messages should also be subject to similar rule-based diversion or re-direction. Under such a message diversion scheme a MICV may, as just one example, \u2018intercept\u2019 incoming messages and appropriately re-direct them (based on, possibly inter alia, flexible, extensible, dynamically configurable, and easily managed routing, etc. rules; additional interactions with an SP; etc.).","3) Directories. For example, in a corporate setting an on-line directory of all employees (with real-time indicators for the current locations and\/or the current contact vehicles for each employee) may be offered through, among other channels, a Web-based facility. Such a directories may be augmented or enhanced by, possibly among other means, tying into existing corporate (employee, telephone, etc.) directories. Such directories may facilitate, for example, intelligent searches\u2014\u2018Who is the most senior employee with skills\/knowledge X, Y, and Z who is currently in building  of the corporate office campus?\u2019","A SP may optionally provide a first responder, legal intercept, etc. capability through which any of the exchanges or interactions that were described above may be monitored, transparently altered or modified, etc.","The confirmation, response, etc. message(s) that were described above may include any number of textual, visual, etc. information elements.
