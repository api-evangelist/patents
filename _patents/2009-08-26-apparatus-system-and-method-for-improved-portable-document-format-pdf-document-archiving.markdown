title: Apparatus, system, and method for improved portable document format (“PDF”) document archiving
abstract: An apparatus, system, and method are disclosed for improved Portable Document Format (“PDF”) document archiving. The method includes scanning a source PDF document for a shared resource. The source PDF document includes a plurality of records. The shared resource includes a common resource referenced by way of a resource pointer associated with a record of the source PDF document. The method includes copying the shared resource to a resource group associated with the source PDF document. The method also includes short-circuiting a link between content for the shared resource and the resource pointer in each record that points to the shared resource. The method includes extracting a record from the source PDF document. The extracted record is void of content for the shared resource in response to the short-circuited link. Thus, records may be stored in a standalone format without excessive storage space requirements.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to archiving and more particularly relates to improved Portable Document Format (\u201cPDF\u201d) document archiving.","2. Description of the Related Art","Records and statements are often stored electronically using Portable Document Format (\u201cPDF\u201d). Often, many individual statements or records are combined into a single PDF document as a report. When archiving PDF reports containing multiple records, these records may need to be stored as individual PDF documents in order to satisfy performance or functional requirements. For example, placing legal holds on a subset of records or placing one or more records into a work flow process is simplified by working with individually stored records instead of the report that includes many records.","However, when extracting a portion of a larger PDF documents and storing the portion as a standalone PDF document using the PDF Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d), the PDF shared resources are duplicated in every extracted portion, thereby increasing storage requirements. Some solutions accept this increased storage requirement as is or do not extract the records at all and instead simply archive the entire report as a single entity. However, when an individual record is required to view or print, the entire report has to be retrieved in order to extract the requested report, thereby requiring more computing resources and decreasing performance.","From the foregoing discussion, it should be apparent that a need exists for an apparatus, system, and method for improved Portable Document Format (\u201cPDF\u201d) archiving. Beneficially, such an apparatus, system, and method would enable individual record extraction while minimizing required storage space.","The present invention has been developed in response to the present state of the art, and in particular, in response to the problems and needs in the art that have not yet been fully solved by currently available PDF archiving tools. Accordingly, the present invention has been developed to provide an apparatus, system, and method for improved PDF archiving that overcome many or all of the above-discussed shortcomings in the art.","One embodiment of the method for improved Portable Document Format (\u201cPDF\u201d) archiving includes scanning a source PDF document for a shared resource, copying the shared resource, short-circuiting a link, and extracting a record. The method includes scanning a source PDF document for a shared resource. The source PDF document includes a plurality of records. The shared resource includes a common resource referenced by way of a resource pointer associated with a record of the source PDF document.","The method includes copying the shared resource to a resource group associated with the source PDF document. The method also includes short-circuiting a link between content for the shared resource and the resource pointer in each record that points to the shared resource. The method includes extracting a record from the source PDF document. The extracted record is void of content for the shared resource in response to the short-circuited link.","In one embodiment, extracting a record from the source PDF document further comprises extracting a record using a PDF Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d). In one embodiment, short-circuiting a link further comprises modifying the resource pointer to point to the copied shared resource in the resource group. In a further embodiment, modifying the resource pointer includes setting the resource pointer to a resource identifier assigned by a PDF Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) that stores the shared resource in the resource group.","In one embodiment, short-circuiting a link between content for the shared resource and the resource pointer further includes removing content for the shared resource from the source PDF document. In certain embodiments, the method further includes indexing index data in the source PDF document and storing the index data in a searchable repository","In one embodiment, the resource group includes a PDF document. In certain embodiments, scanning a source PDF document for a shared resource further includes directing a PDF API to signal each shared resource of the source PDF document that matches a predetermined criteria. In one embodiment, the method includes receiving configuration information that defines a set of shared resources from among the shared resources of the source PDF document.","An apparatus and computer program product are also provided for improved PDF document archiving each providing a plurality of components, modules, and operations to functionally execute the necessary steps described above in relation to the method.","Reference throughout this specification to features, advantages, or similar language does not imply that all of the features and advantages that may be realized with the present invention should be or are in any single embodiment of the invention. Rather, language referring to the features and advantages is understood to mean that a specific feature, advantage, or characteristic described in connection with an embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, discussion of the features and advantages, and similar language, throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, refer to the same embodiment.","Furthermore, the described features, advantages, and characteristics of the invention may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize that the invention may be practiced without one or more of the specific features or advantages of a particular embodiment. In other instances, additional features and advantages may be recognized in certain embodiments that may not be present in all embodiments of the invention.","These features and advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","Many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.","Indeed, a module of executable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network. Where a module or portions of a module are implemented in software, the software portions are stored on one or more computer readable mediums.","Any combination of one or more computer readable medium(s) may be utilized. The computer readable medium may be a computer readable signal medium or a computer readable storage medium. A computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing.","More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer readable storage medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document, a computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","A computer readable signal medium may include a propagated data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein, for example, in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, electromagnetic, optical, or any suitable combination thereof. A computer readable signal medium may be any computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage medium and that can communicate, propagate, or transport a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. Program code embodied on a computer readable medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc. or any suitable combination of the foregoing.","Computer program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment,\u201d \u201can embodiment,\u201d or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment,\u201d \u201cin an embodiment,\u201d and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment.","Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics of the invention may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of programming, software modules, user selections, network transactions, database queries, database structures, hardware modules, hardware circuits, hardware chips, etc., to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention may be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, and so forth. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Aspects of the present invention are described below with reference to schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams of methods, apparatuses, systems, and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function\/act specified in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of apparatuses, systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the schematic flowchart diagrams and\/or schematic block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s).","It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the Figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. Other steps and methods may be conceived that are equivalent in function, logic, or effect to one or more blocks, or portions thereof, of the illustrated figures.","Although various arrow types and line types may be employed in the flowchart and\/or block diagrams, they are understood not to limit the scope of the corresponding embodiments. Indeed, some arrows or other connectors may be used to indicate only the logical flow of the depicted embodiment. For instance, an arrow may indicate a waiting or monitoring period of unspecified duration between enumerated steps of the depicted embodiment. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and\/or flowchart diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and\/or flowchart diagrams, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"The electronic device  may include a processor or CPU . The CPU  may be operably coupled to one or more memory devices . The memory devices  may include a non-volatile storage device  such as a hard disk drive or CD ROM drive, a read-only memory (ROM) , and a random access volatile memory (RAM) .","The computer in general may also include one or more input devices  for receiving inputs from a user or from another device. The input devices  may include a keyboard, pointing device, touch screen, or other similar human input devices. Similarly, one or more output devices  may be provided within or may be accessible from the computer. The output devices  may include a display, speakers, or the like.

The ports may allow for connections with other resources or peripherals, such as printers, digital cameras, scanners, and the like.","The computer also includes a power management unit in communication with one or more sensors. The power management unit automatically adjusts the power level to one or more subsystems of the computer. Of course, the subsystems may be defined in various manners. In the depicted embodiment, the CPU , ROM , and RAM  may comprise a processing subsystem. Non-volatile storage  such as disk drives, CD-ROM drives, DVD drives, and the like may comprise another subsystem. The input devices  and output devices  may also comprise separate subsystems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","206","200","208","210","212","214","218","214","216","200","200"],"i":["a","c ","a","c"]},"The source PDF document  is a report, collection, or aggregation of records  in PDF format. As used herein, a record  is an individual document comprising a collection of fields of data represented as at least a portion of a PDF document. The records , also referred to as statements, may include various forms of archived documents such as customer bank statements, monthly utility statements, credit card statements, and the like. The records , while combined in the source PDF document , may require individual access. The records , while independent of one another, may share common characteristics or objects such as images, fonts, and the like. A common object may be represented in the PDF document as a shared resource .","As used herein, a shared resource  is a resource or object in a PDF document that is common to, or shared among a plurality of records of the PDF document. The shared resource , also known as an indirect object, is represented in the PDF document as a CosObj, or general object in a PDF file. Examples of shared resources  include images, custom fonts, logos on the same location of each page, and the like. Shared resources  may help to reduce the size of a PDF document. For example, if a certain logo appears in multiple places in the document, the logo may be represented by a shared resource . Thus, a single image of the logo is saved instead of multiple images for each place the logo appears. Places within the PDF document that would have included a copy of the image may include a pointer to the shared resource  instead.","The shared resource  is referenced by way of one or more resource pointers associated with the records  of the source PDF document . As used herein, a resource pointer links a location in a PDF document and a shared resource  and\/or content of the shared resource . In one embodiment, a resource pointer is a pointer in the source PDF document  to the shared resource  embedded within the source PDF document . In another embodiment, a resource pointer is a pointer inside the shared resource  to the content for that shared resource  as described below.","Specifically, the resource pointer may be a pointer or indicator in each record  that points to the shared resource . In one embodiment, the resource pointer is a shared resource dictionary that includes information associated with the shared resource . Each shared resource  may include a dictionary defining the shared resource . The dictionary describes certain aspects about the object, such as width and height for an image. Each shared resource  also includes associated content in the form of a stream data. The stream data follows the dictionary. For example, a shared resource  that is a logo image would have binary data representing the logo as the stream data.","The server  may be an electronic device such as a computer workstation, a computer system, an appliance, an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d), a Personal Digital Assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d), a server, a server blade center, a server farm, a router, a switch, or the like. Furthermore, the server  may comprise a software application running on one or more electronic devices similar to those described above. In one embodiment, the server  comprises an electronic device similar to the electronic device  depicted in .","The server  includes the enhanced PDF archiving tool . The enhanced PDF archiving tool  resides on the server  and may be implemented on memory of the server . The enhanced PDF archiving tool  extracts individual records  from the source PDF document  while minimizing storage space requirements. Furthermore, the enhanced PDF archiving tool  uses a standard PDF Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) to extract individual records .","The PDF API recognizes a link between a shared resource  and portions, such as records, of a PDF document that have a pointer to the shared resource . Therefore, the PDF API duplicates shared resources  including content of the shared resources  whenever a portion of a PDF document that has pointers to the shared resources  is extracted. Such copying behavior is standard for the PDF API and is not programmatically alterable through calls in the PDF API. For example, if a record has a resource pointer to a shared resource  and the record  is extracted to a standalone PDF file through the PDF API, the shared resource  is duplicated to the standalone PDF file . If a second record that also includes a resource pointer to the shared resource  is extracted to a second standalone PDF file, the PDF shared resource  is also duplicated into the second PDF file . Therefore, the shared resources  are duplicated for each extracted record , thus increasing storage requirements.","The enhanced PDF archiving tool  first copies shared resources  from the source PDF document  and then stores them into a resource group . The enhanced PDF archiving tool  may modify the dictionary associated with the shared resource  in the source PDF document  to point to the copied shared resource  in the resource group . The enhanced PDF archiving tool  may also clear the content for the shared resource from the source PDF document . As a result, the enhanced PDF archiving tool short-circuits or breaks the link between content of the shared resource  and a record  in the source PDF document .","The enhanced PDF archiving tool  extracts the record  and stores the extracted record  in the repository . Furthermore, the shared resources  are not duplicated along with the extracted record . In addition, the extracted record  references the copied shared resource  in the resource group . As a result, storage space is minimized. Beneficially, the PDF API may still be used, eliminating the need to write custom computer code for PDF document extraction. Furthermore, because the extracted records  have already been individually saved, they may be quickly referenced with less overhead than if the records  had to be extracted on demand.","The repository , as mentioned above, stores the resource group . The repository  may be implemented with a storage device such as a disk drive as is known in the art. The resource group  includes a copied shared resource  copied from the source PDF document  with the enhanced PDF archiving tool . The resource group  may be embodied as a PDF document or other file compatible with the PDF API.","The repository  also stores extracted records  extracted from the source PDF document  as described above.

However, the shared resource , being free of the content  (lacking the content ), has its resource pointer  modified to point to the copied shared resource  and associated copied content . Therefore, if a PDF API extracts a record and the PDF API follows the PDF protocol limitation of duplicating the shared resource , the PDF API duplicates the shared resource  along with the extracted record, however, the content  of the shared resource  is missing.

As described above, each record  may represent a single document or statement that may need to be later viewed, printed or held for legal reasons. The shared resource  is a common resource referenced by way of a resource pointer  associated with a record  of the source PDF document .","In one embodiment, the resource pointer  is a pointer in a record  to the dictionary of the shared resource . In another embodiment, the resource pointer  is the dictionary of the shared resource  or the CosObj representing the shared resource . In a further embodiment, the resource pointer is a combination of a pointer in a record  to the dictionary of the shared resource  and the dictionary itself. One of ordinary skill in the art realizes the various ways that a shared resource  is linked with a record  in the source PDF document .","In one embodiment, the scanning module  scans a source PDF document  for a shared resource  through a PDF API. The PDF API, in one embodiment, enumerates the indirect objects of the PDF source document to locate shared resources  that match predetermined criteria as is described in greater detail below.","The copying module  copies the shared resource  to a resource group  associated with the source PDF document . In one embodiment, the resource group  is an additional PDF document. In certain embodiments, the copying module  copies the shared resource  to the resource group  PDF by appending the CosObj representing the shared resource  to the resource group  PDF document. In one embodiment, the PDF API assigns a resource identifier to the appended CosObj in the resource group  PDF. Copying the shared resource , in one embodiment, includes copying the content  for the shared resource  to the resource group .","The short-circuiting module  short-circuits a link between content  for the shared resource  and the resource pointer  in each record  that points to the shared resource . As described in greater detail below, the short-circuiting module  may short-circuit the link by modifying the resource pointer  associated with the shared resource  in the source PDF document . The short-circuiting module  may also remove the content  associated with the shared resource .","The extraction module  extracts a record  from the source PDF document . Because the link between the shared resource  and the record  has been broken, the extracted record  is void of content  for the shared resource . The PDF API may still copy the PDF object representing the shared resource  from the source PDF document , but the PDF object will be free of content  from the shared resource  as described in greater detail below.","In one embodiment, the extraction module  extracts a record  from the source PDF document  using a PDF API. The extraction module  may extract records  based on a predetermined identifier that indicates the location in the source PDF document  where a new record  begins. For example, in a source PDF document  of bank statements, the extraction module  may search for text indicating the first page of a particular bank statement. The extraction module  may use this location along with the location of the first page of the next bank statement to extract the particular bank statement using the PDF API.

The direction module  may use enumeration methods of the PDF API as is known in the art to receive a signal that a shared resource  meets the predetermined criteria. For example, the direction module  may direct the PDF API to return a reference to a shared resource  that is an image.","The modification module  modifies the resource pointer  to point to the copied shared resource  in the resource group . In one embodiment, the modification module  modifies the resource pointer  by setting the resource pointer  to the resource identifier assigned by the PDF API that stores the copied shared resource  in the resource group . The resource identifier may be a unique identifier, and in some embodiments, a new identifier used to identify the copied shared resource  in the resource group .

The removal module  then removes  content  for the shared resource  from the source PDF document  by clearing the stream in the object for the shared resource .","Because the dictionary of the shared resource  includes a new key-value pair referencing the copied shared resource  and the copied content  in the resource group  instead of content  for the shared resource  embedded in the source PDF document , and because the content  has been removed from the shared resource , the link that causes the PDF API to copy content  for the shared resource  along with an extracted record  is broken.","Next, the indexing module  indexes  index data in the source PDF document  and the storage module  stores  the index data in the repository . The extraction module then  extracts  a record  from the source PDF document . The extracted record  does not include content  for the shared resource . The extraction module  may use the index data to determine the location in the source PDF document  of each record  to extract. Then, the storage module  stores  the extracted record . Then the method  ends .","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics.
