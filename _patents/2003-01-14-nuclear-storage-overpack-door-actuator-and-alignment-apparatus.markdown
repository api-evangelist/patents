{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The invention was conceived and made in the course of or under a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to a ball screw actuator for moving a door panel. More particularly, the invention relates to a ball screw door panel actuator and guide. Most particularly the invention relates to a ball screw actuator and alignment assembly.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Spent nuclear fuel is contained in a steel cylinder, referred to as a canister. Canisters are loaded into a concrete vessel, known as storage overpack or overpack for long term storage. The overpack is a bottom loaded storage container made of reinforced concrete and steel plates. The upper portion of the storage overpack is a 13-foot diameter cylindrical reinforced concrete vessel with a 74-inch diameter inner steel cylindrical liner. The vessel is supported on a stack of circular steel plates. The door is a horizontally oriented steel plate located below the mid-plane of the stack of plates. The stack of plates comprising the storage overpack door and doorframe provides the structural support for the loaded canister inside the storage overpack. It also provides shielding from radiation emitted from the canister. The interface between the sliding door and doorframe is steel-on-steel and requires an externally mounted actuator to effect opening and closing of the door through an approximately 100-inch travel distance.","The inventor was confronted with a number of challenges including the size and weight of the sliding door, and the limited space available for the actuator to operate. A hydraulic piston actuator was considered but could not be used because of space limitations. The piston stroke length would double the space required to open the door. Also, a portable door actuator was required that did not use local facilities such as stanchion posts or building walls for anchoring.","The invention is a ball screw actuator connectable to a horizontally disposed door panel. The ball screw actuator is used for moving the door panel horizontally. The ball screw actuator includes a rigid frame having parallel rails. A ball screw is attached to the rigid frame parallel to the rails. A ball nut rotating means is in drive contact with a ball nut movable along the ball screw. A carriage is moveable along the rails. The ball nut rotating device is fixedly attached to the carriage. Pivoting attachment means is provided for attaching the door panel to the carriage.","Other features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in, or apparent from, the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention.","Reference is made to  which shows an external wall  of a nuclear storage overpack. The nuclear storage overpack is a steel reinforce cylindrical vessel weighing in the order of 200 tons. The storage overpack is used for the long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive nuclear waste materials. A canister is loaded into the storage overpack from the bottom by way of horizontally oriented overpack door panel . A typical door panel  is a 10-foot long by 6.5-foot wide rectangular steel plate weighing in the order of 15,000 pounds. Radiation shield  is shown attached to the door panel in FIG. . Other ancillary attachments to door panel  not related to the invention are not shown. A door panel and ancillary attachments are referred to as a door panel assembly. An actuator for moving door panel  is attached to the door panel  via shoulder bolt  and threaded bore . Only a portion of doorframe  is shown. An actual doorframe  includes 4-inch thick steel plates above, below and on either side of the door panel . Threaded bore  is shown for anchoring an actuator front frame  to the 200-ton storage overpack by way of overpack doorframe .","Reference is made to both FIG.  and  rigid actuator frame is shown. The actuator frame includes a first end shown as front frame . A part of front frame  is frame foot  having frame foot face . Frame attachment bolt and washer  are positioned to mate with threaded bore  for attaching the front frame  to the doorframe . Rails  are attached to frame foot  at frame foot face . The parallel rails  are long enough to support the entire length of the door panel  in the open position, removed from overpack . In this example, the rails are about 14 feet long and are spaced 32 inches apart, braced by several rail spacer plates . Rails  extend to actuator frame second end including tail plate  braced by gusset . Front frame , spaced parallel rails , rail spacer plates , tail plate  and gusset  are assembled into a rigid actuator frame. The frame is anchored at the first end by attachment to the 200-ton storage overpack and at the second end by counter weight , weighing over 0.5 ton. The counter weight  provides additional weight to the tail plate  to prevent the frame from lifting off the cement floor  during operation. Anchoring the frame at both ends ensures that the rails remain flat on the surface of level concrete floor  during operation.","One end of an axially extending ball screw  is attached to front frame  by pin  and the other end is attached to tail plate  by pin . Nut  holds ball screw  in tension to assist in maintaining it straight and parallel to rails .","Ball nut  is mounted on threaded ball screw  and driven by ball nut rotating means . Ball nut rotating means  is a worm gear reducer powered by reversible drive electric motor  including electric motor control (not shown). The ball nut rotating means , and electric motor  are attached to carriage , with partial support of vertical support plate . The assembly of ball nut , ball nut rotating means , electric motor , carriage  and vertical support plate  are moveable along the length of ball screw  from actuator frame  to tail plate .","The alignment of carriage  along rails  is facilitated by a multiplicity of cam followers  mounted on the rails . The cam followers  cooperate with the actuator to guide the carriage  and maintain the straight alignment of the carriage with parallel rails  and parallel with ball screw .","Rail guide bracket  is attached to the under side of carriage  as shown in FIG. . Rail guide bracket  prevents lateral movement of the carriage and further prevents deviation of carriage  in any lateral direction. Rail guide bracket  is spaced from rail inner surface  by an amount to allow only minimal deviation from true parallel in the travel of the carriage along the rails. The clearance between each rail guide bracket  and the rail inner surface  is 0.04-inch maximum, typically 0.01-inch. Rail guide bracket  permits movement of the carriage  parallel with rails  and thereby with ball screw  to avoid binding of the ball nut  on the ball screw .","Attention is drawn to , showing the attachment of the actuator apparatus to door panel . Rail  is joined to doorframe  by way of frame foot . In , the door panel  is in the closed position, fully inserted in the doorframe . Support pad  and radiation shield  are two of a number of means for preventing radiation leakage from the overpack. The door panel  is supported by support pad . Support pad  is also the support contact between the door and the actuator. A plurality of cam followers  is attached to the rail . The plurality may number 50 to 100 cam followers per rail, e.g. 61 cam followers per rail. Cam follower  is a roller bearing with an integral threaded shaft. A cam follower  is attached to the rail by integral shaft . Integral shaft  is mounted in the horizontal plane with the axis of rotation perpendicular to rail . A roller bearing  is mounted to turn on integral shaft . Integral shaft  is the axis of rotation for roller bearing . A load on the circumferential surface  of the roller bearing is movable perpendicular to the axis of rotation, i.e. parallel to the rails.","As seen in , one end of each integral shaft  has threads  so that it can be mounted in a tapped hole  (shown in ) in rails . The threaded shaft  is mounted perpendicular to rail  in the tapped hole . The tolerance in alignment of the integral shaft from a true position is 0.010 inch, preferably 0.005 inch or less, with respect to three orthogonal datum surfaces of the actuator frame. Three datum surfaces used are the rail bottom surface , the frame foot face  that interfaces with the overpack and the inner surfaces  of the rails that interface with the carriage via rail guide bracket . The three datum surfaces were selected because they are related to the function of the actuator frame relative to the overpack and because they facilitated alignment during fabrication. The tapped holes are staggered on either side of the rail. Also, the bearing circumferential surface  holds the support pad  above the rail. Therefore support pad  comes in contact with cam followers and does not come into contact with the rail head surface  as it moves along the rail.","Link plate  and door panel attachment plate  are attached to carriage . Door panel attachment plate  includes slots  through which pass threaded door panel shoulder bolts . Shoulder bolt  and washer mate with door threaded bore  in door panel . Shoulder bolt  and washer are used to attach the door panel  to carriage . Washer is designed to ensure that a slight clearance exists between attachment plate  and the head of the shoulder bolt . Some lateral repositioning between the actuator and door panel is accommodated by slot  in attachment plate . The gap provided by shoulder bolt washer together with lateral space provided in slot  ensures any bending moment on the shoulder bolt  is quickly resolved and any lateral load, which would risk failure of the shoulder bolt  during operation, does not persist.","Carriage  is drawn along ball screw  supported on rails . Door panel  is drawn along with the carriage . The alignment of the carriage with rails  and ball screw  maintains the lateral alignment of the door panel  relative to doorframe . The resulting opening and closing the door panel  is effected without ancillary equipment to realign or reposition the door panel.","The function of the actuator frame is to counter lateral forces developed during open and closing. Lateral forces are those forces that are not parallel to the center of rotation of ball nut , i.e. the longitudinal axis of ball screw . The frame includes a pair of rails that support the door panel while open and during opening and closing. The ball screw is positioned with high precision parallel to the pair of rails. The parallel orientation of ball screw with the rails prevents any tendency toward lateral movement of the door panel. The first end or front end of the frame includes a front bracket that is attachable to a doorframe that is part of the 200-ton storage overpack vessel. The second or terminal end referred to as the tailstock of the frame is attached to a removable counter weight. This counter weight resists lifting force or bending force during rotating of the threaded screw and tension on the door panel during opening. The actuator frame is constructed of ASTM A516 (Fineline\u2122) carbon steel.","ASTM A516 Fineline\u2122 carbon steel is resistant to base metal lamellar tearing. Base metal lamellar tearing can occur in rolled carbon steel plate having a relatively high sulfur content when sulfur deposits along the base metal rolling planes and precipitates out during the rolling process. Lamellar tearing occurs in the through thickness direction resulting in a terrace-like fracture in the base metal parallel to the wrought surface. The actuator frame, carriage and attachment are ASTM A516 Grade 70 carbon steel made according to the Bethlehem-Lukens Fineline\u2122 process. This process was developed to produce low-sulfur content steel in order to eliminate base metal lamellar tearing.","The ball nut rotating means, referred to as the actuator, is mounted on the carriage. The carriage is the member through which the drive forces are transmitted from the electric motor and drive nut rotating means to the door panel. The carriage incorporates two L-shaped rail guide brackets attached at the under side to react the torque and bending moment developed during operation and to prevent the carriage from deviating much from its linear path along the rails.","Attention is drawn to FIG. . The carriage  is connected to the door panel attachment plate  by link plate . Link plate  provides for transmitting the pushing and pulling forces from the door actuator assembly including electric motor  to the sliding door panel . Link plate  is attached to door panel attachment plate  with pivoting attachment means . Pivoting attachment means  is preferably a shear pin to allow pivoting needed to accommodate positional misalignments of the sliding door panel relative to the carriage and the doorframe front support plate  of storage overpack . The pin is oriented perpendicular to the rails  and fixes link plate  and attachment plate  in a generally horizontal plane. This orientation allows pivoting of the door panel attachment plate to accommodate small misalignments between the door panel and carriage and between the door panel and doorframe.","An instrumented shear pin, shown in  as pivoting attachment means , attaches the actuator to the carriage. The instrumented shear pin is sized for the 16,500 pound load with a 2.2 safety factor. A scale meter measures and indicates load during operation. A control circuit monitors the scale meter to shut off the motor should a preselected load be exceeded. The shear pin and scale meter shut-off circuit are an integral interlock and a redundant safety feature to provide overload protection.","The door panel attachment plate  is attached to the door panel  by two 1-8UNC (1 inch diameter, 8 threads per inch, Unified Thread Series Coarse) tapped bores, shown as bore , and shoulder bolts, shown as bolt , to allow for motion during door panel movement.","Two 3.75-inch alloy steel frame attachment bolts, shown as bolt and washer , attach the frame foot  to the doorframe front support plate . The frame attachment bolts secure the door assembly to the frame foot .","The actuator was a Duff-Norton, 25-ton screw actuator and ball screw. A 5-horsepower electric motor and motor control were coupled to the ball screw actuator to operate the actuator. A motor shaft extension  provides for manual operation of the actuator in the event of electric power failure.","The actuator size was determined by the length\/column strength of the ball screw required to accommodate the 100-inch travel length. The screw diameter corresponding with a 100+ inch screw was 3 inches. This defined the minimum actuator size for this service, i.e. 25-ton. The maximum capacity of the actuator when coupled with the 5 horsepower motor is 44,000 pounds. However, the actuator frame would have to be blocked and secured to prevent the frame from deflection in order to accommodate this load. In a typical configuration, the frame is designed for a load of 16,500 pounds. The life expectancy of the ball screw and drive nut is 28,000 cycles, assuming no misalignment or side thrust loads and reasonable maintenance and lubrication. The time required to open or to close the door with a 5 horsepower (1750 rpm) motor and the actuator\/reducer assembly disclosed is 21.7 inches\/minute or about 5 minutes.","A limit switch (not shown) was included to stop actuator travel. The limit switch operates by way of the actuator worm gear rotation that turns an integral screw. Two micro switches are provided, one for forward stopping the other for backward stopping, are activated by the position of two adjustable limit switch nuts which travel laterally when the internal screw is rotated.","Threaded ball screw length determined the actuator size and strength of the screw required effecting the 100-inch travel with the design load. The maximum unsupported or unguided length for the ball screw required is about 60 inches. To accommodate the 100-inch travel distance, the ball screw had to be supported or guided to prevent buckling. This was accomplished by mounting the drive nut on the carriage. The carriage assembly is guided between the fixed frame rails. Lateral movement, i.e. side thrust loading, is controlled by limiting the clearance between the L-brackets on the underside of the carriage assembly and the inside of the frame rails. Side thrust loading, eccentric loading, and screw buckling are reduced or entirely prevented by mounting the actuator on the carriage assembly.","Inventor was challenged to find a reliable way of ensuring the ball nut center axis was positioned concentric with the screw axis over the entire travel distance while under load. Any misalignments greater than the basic pitch-type clearances between the ball nut and screw are significant in this unique application, moving the horizontally sliding door of a nuclear storage overpack. Significant misalignments would bind the screw. Less significant misalignments would shorten the life of a ball screw assembly due to increased screw and ball nut wear. Other forces affecting ball nut to ball screw alignment are the reaction forces associated with opening and closing the door.","The invention provides three performance requirements. First, the load on the ball screw must be kept as parallel to the ball screw axis as possible. Second, door panel load must be applied along the same axis as the ball screw. Third, side thrust loads and moments on the ball nut and screw should be minimized and preferably avoided. Due to space limitations, the door panel load could not be applied along the same axis as the screw. Also, to accommodate the door as it moves out from under the overpack, the screw had to be mounted about 8 inches above the centerplane of the door and about 11 inches above the carriage to frame reaction plane. An under door mount was considered but found to be impossible due to the limited space available to accommodate the screw and actuator housing below the door panel. This offset between the screw centerline and the door panel centerplane applies a reaction moment that misaligns the drive nut relative to the screw. This misaligning reaction moment was countered by the carriage assembly to ensure the actuator would operate at design load.","The inventive alignment and actuator system provides or opening and closing the 15,000 pound sliding door of a storage overpack. The door actuator includes an electrically powered ball screw actuator mounted horizontally in a portable frame. The actuator assembly does not require any external mounting facilities such as a stanchion post to anchor the assembly in order to counter loads developed during operation. The integral actuator frame accommodates operational loads. A door actuator test unit has been successfully tested with over 170 opening and closing cycles on a prototype door and frame assembly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Table of Elements in the Drawing"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["10","storage overpack wall"]},{"entry":["12","overpack door panel"]},{"entry":["13","support pad"]},{"entry":["14","door threaded bore"]},{"entry":["16","doorframe"]},{"entry":["18","doorframe threaded bore"]},{"entry":["20","actuator front frame"]},{"entry":["22","frame foot"]},{"entry":["23","frame foot face"]},{"entry":["24","frame attachment bolt and washer"]},{"entry":["28","front pin"]},{"entry":["30","rails"]},{"entry":["32","cam followers"]},{"entry":["33","integral shaft"]},{"entry":["34","threads"]},{"entry":["35","tapped hole"]},{"entry":["36","roller bearing"]},{"entry":["37","bearing circumferential surface"]},{"entry":["38","rail spacer plate"]},{"entry":["40","tail plate"]},{"entry":["42","gusset"]},{"entry":["44","counter weight"]},{"entry":["46","nut"]},{"entry":["48","end pin"]},{"entry":["50","ball screw"]},{"entry":["60","ball nut"]},{"entry":["62","ball nut rotating means"]},{"entry":["64","reversible drive electric motor"]},{"entry":["66","motor shaft extension"]},{"entry":["70","carriage"]},{"entry":["72","vertical support plate"]},{"entry":["75","rail guide bracket"]},{"entry":["76","link plate"]},{"entry":["77","pivoting attachment means"]},{"entry":["78","door panel attachment plate"]},{"entry":["79","shoulder bolt"]},{"entry":[{"sup":"\u2002"},"washer"]},{"entry":["80","slot"]},{"entry":["85","rail inner surfaces"]},{"entry":["87","rail bottom surfaces"]},{"entry":["90","cement floor"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The foregoing discussion discloses and describes embodiments of the present invention by way of example.
