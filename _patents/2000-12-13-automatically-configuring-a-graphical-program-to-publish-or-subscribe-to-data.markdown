{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of graphical programming, and more particularly to a system and method for configuring a graphical program to publish data or subscribe to data, e.g., for exchanging data with a data target or data source external to the graphical program.","Traditionally, high level text-based programming languages have been used by programmers in writing application programs. Many different high level programming languages exist, including BASIC, C, Java, FORTRAN, Pascal, COBOL, ADA, APL, etc. Programs written in these high level languages are translated to the machine language level by translators known as compilers or interpreters. The high level programming languages in this level, as well as the assembly language level, are referred to herein as text-based programming environments.","Increasingly, computers are required to be used and programmed by those who are not highly trained in computer programming techniques. When traditional text-based programming environments are used, the user's programming skills and ability to interact with the computer system often become a limiting factor in the achievement of optimal utilization of the computer system.","There are numerous subtle complexities which a user must master before he can efficiently program a computer system in a text-based environment. The task of programming a computer system to model or implement a process often is further complicated by the fact that a sequence of mathematical formulas, mathematical steps or other procedures customarily used to conceptually model a process often does not closely correspond to the traditional text-based programming techniques used to program a computer system to model such a process. In other words, the requirement that a user program in a text-based programming environment places a level of abstraction between the user's conceptualization of the solution and the implementation of a method that accomplishes this solution in a computer program. Thus, a user often must substantially master different skills in order to both conceptualize a problem or process and then to program a computer to implement a solution to the problem or process. Since a user often is not fully proficient in techniques for programming a computer system in a text-based environment to implement his solution, the efficiency with which the computer system can be utilized often is reduced.","Examples of fields in which computer systems are employed to interact with physical systems are the fields of instrumentation, process control, industrial automation, and simulation. Computer measurement and control of devices such as instruments or industrial automation hardware has become increasingly desirable in view of the increasing complexity and variety of instruments and devices available for use. However, due to the wide variety of possible testing and control situations and environments, and also the wide array of instruments or devices available, it is often necessary for a user to develop a custom program to control a desired system.","As discussed above, computer programs used to control such systems traditionally had to be written in text-based programming languages such as, for example, assembly language, C, FORTRAN, BASIC, etc. Traditional users of these systems, however, often were not highly trained in programming techniques and, in addition, text-based programming languages were not sufficiently intuitive to allow users to use these languages without training. Therefore, implementation of such systems frequently required the involvement of a programmer to write software for control and analysis of instrumentation or industrial automation data. Thus, development and maintenance of the software elements in these systems often proved to be difficult.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,901,221; 4,914,568; 5,291,587; 5,301,301; and 5,301,336; among others, to Kodosky et al disclose a graphical system and method for modeling a process, i.e., a graphical programming environment which enables a user to easily and intuitively model a process. The graphical programming environment disclosed in Kodosky et al can be considered a higher and more intuitive way in which to interact with a computer. A graphically based programming environment can be represented at a level above text-based high level programming languages such as C, Basic, Java, etc. The method disclosed in Kodosky et al allows a user to construct a diagram using a block diagram editor, such that the diagram created graphically displays a procedure or method for accomplishing a certain result, such as manipulating one or more input variables and\/or producing one or more output variables. In response to the user constructing a diagram or graphical program using the block diagram editor, data structures may be automatically constructed which characterize an execution procedure which corresponds to the displayed procedure. The graphical program may be compiled or interpreted by a computer. Therefore, a user can create a computer program solely by using a graphically based programming environment. This graphically based programming environment may be used for creating virtual instrumentation systems, industrial automation systems, modeling processes, and simulation, as well as for any type of general programming.","Therefore, Kodosky et al teaches a graphical programming environment wherein a user places or manipulates icons in a block diagram using a block diagram editor to create a graphical \u201cprogram.\u201d A graphical program for measuring, controlling, or modeling devices, such as instruments, processes or industrial automation hardware, may be referred to as a virtual instrument (VI). In creating a virtual instrument, a user may create a front panel or user interface panel. The front panel may include various user interface elements or front panel objects, such as controls or indicators, that represent or display the respective input and output that will be used by the graphical program or VI, and may include other icons which represent devices being controlled. The front panel may be comprised in a single window of user interface elements, or may comprise a plurality of individual windows each having a user interface element, wherein the individual windows may optionally be tiled together. When the controls and indicators are created in the front panel, corresponding icons or terminals may be automatically created in the block diagram by the block diagram editor. Alternatively, the user can place terminal icons in the block diagram which may cause the display of corresponding front panel objects in the front panel, either at edit time or later at run time. As another example, the front panel objects may be embedded in the block diagram.","During creation of the graphical program, the user may select various function nodes or icons that accomplish his desired result and connect the function nodes together. For example, the function nodes may be connected in one or more of a data flow, control flow, and\/or execution flow format. The function nodes may be connected between the terminals of the respective controls and indicators. Thus the user may create or assemble a graphical program, referred to as a block diagram, graphically representing the desired process. The assembled graphical program may then be compiled or interpreted to produce machine language that accomplishes the desired method or process as shown in the block diagram.","A user may input data to a virtual instrument using front panel controls. This input data may propagate through the data flow block diagram or graphical program and appear as changes on the output indicators. In an instrumentation application, the front panel can be analogized to the front panel of an instrument. In an industrial automation application the front panel can be analogized to the MMI (Man Machine Interface) of a device. The user may adjust the controls on the front panel to affect the input and view the output on the respective indicators. Alternatively, the front panel may be used merely to view the input and output, or just the output, and the input may not be interactively manipulable by the user during program execution.","Thus, graphical programming has become a powerful tool available to programmers. Graphical programming environments such as the National Instruments LabVIEW product have become very popular. Tools such as LabVIEW have greatly increased the productivity of programmers, and increasing numbers of programmers are using graphical programming environments to develop their software applications. In particular, graphical programming tools are being used for test and measurement, data acquisition, process control, man machine interface (MMI), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) applications, simulation, and machine vision applications, among others.","Computer programs, including graphical programs, are often required to exchange data with a data source or data target external to the program. In various applications, a program may write or provide data of any of various types to any of various types of data targets. Also, in various applications, a program may receive data of any of various types from any of various types of data sources. For example, data may be received from a data source such as a file or from a server, such as an FTP or HTTP server. The data may comprise static data, such as pre-stored data in a file, or live data, such as data streamed in real time by a server. The data may also originate from another program or process running on the host computer system or a remote computer system. For example, a program for processing live weather data may utilize data received from a remote computer system that senses weather-related variables, such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc., and transduces these variables into data that the program can use.","As well known in the art, exchanging data with data sources or data targets external to a program is often difficult to implement. For example, consider the program described above for processing weather data, wherein a client computer system that executes a client program is connected over a TCP\/IP network to a server computer that generates the data. In order for the client program to receive the data from the server computer, the TCP protocol would typically be used, which may involve several steps, such as:\n\n","This list only provides an overview of the complexity involved in receiving the data. Thus, this scenario illustrates several details that many graphical program developers would not have the necessary skill to deal with or would prefer not to deal with. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a system and method to simplify the task of implementing data exchange for a graphical program.","Ideally, such a system and method would be independent of the type of data source or data target. For example, in the prior art, receiving data from a file would typically require the developer to code a different set of steps than if data were received from a remote server, as described in the above example. For example, the developer may need to program the steps of opening the file, reading data from the file, closing the file, etc. It would be desirable, for example, for a method of configuring a graphical program to receive waveform data from a local file to be the same or substantially the same as a method of configuring the graphical program to receive live waveform data generated by a remote application.","It would also be desirable for the system and method to be independent of the platform on which the program runs. Different computing platforms support different mechanisms for data exchange. For example, a Windows program may use DDE or ActiveX\/COM, whereas programs running on other platforms use different mechanisms. In typical cases, graphical program developers would prefer to not concern themselves with platform-specific issues.","In many applications, data received from a data source or provided to a data target may be associated with a graphical user interface (GUI) element. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) enable users to interact with computer programs in an intuitive manner, utilizing various types of GUI elements. Different graphical programming environments may enable developers to include any of various types of GUI elements in a graphical program's graphical user interface or front panel. For example,  (prior art) illustrate several GUI elements, including GUI elements that may be used in instrumentation or measurement applications.  (prior art) illustrates an exemplary front panel for a measurement graphical program for computing the averaged power spectrum of a simulated input signal. For example, the front panel includes a knob GUI element for adjusting the frequency of the simulated signal and a chart GUI element for displaying a chart of the power spectrum.  (prior art) illustrates additional examples of GUI elements useful for instrumentation or measurement applications, e.g., a thermometer, an LED, a meter, a waveform chart, a tank, etc. Other types of GUI elements that may be included in a graphical user interface or front panel include text boxes, check boxes, etc.","GUI elements may be configured to indicate data to the user, e.g., by displaying the data on a display screen. For example, the Power Spectrum chart on the user interface panel of  displays a chart of the averaged power spectrum computed by the graphical program. GUI elements may also be configured to provide user input to a graphical program. For example, when the value of the Frequency knob on the user interface panel of  changes, e.g., due to a user interactively turning the knob, the graphical program may detect this change in value, e.g., by intercepting an event triggered when the value changes, and may respond by changing the signal that is generated in accordance with the new frequency value.","As described above, in many cases, it may be desirable for data indicated by a GUI element to originate from a data source outside of the graphical program, such as a file, server, or other data source. For example, in the weather application referred to above, the live weather data may be received from the remote computer system and displayed in various GUI elements, e.g., to indicate the temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc. Also, in many cases, it may be desirable for data associated with a GUI element to be provided to a data target outside of the graphical program. For example, a graphical program to control a system located in a remote laboratory may have a graphical user interface panel including various GUI elements such as knobs, buttons, etc. When a user changes the values associated with the GUI elements, it may be desirable for the graphical program to send the values to a program running on a computer system in the remote laboratory which is operable to send control signals to the system, based on the received GUI element values.","Therefore, it would also be desirable to provide a system and method to simplify data exchange for a graphical program, wherein the data is associated with a GUI element. For example, it would be desirable to provide a method for easily enabling a GUI element to subscribe to data from a data source or publish data to a data target.","In the prior art, in configuring a GUI element of a graphical program, a developer typically first includes the GUI element in the graphical program's user interface and then configures the GUI element with the desired behavior, e.g., by programming the GUI element to interface with a data source or data target. According to this methodology, the developer is required to first select an appropriate GUI element for the data source or data target, which, to a certain extent, places the focus of the program development process on the GUI element itself. To enable a more natural development process, it would be desirable to provide a method that allows the developer to specify the data source or data target of interest, and in response, a GUI element appropriate for that data source or target would be automatically included in the program's user interface and automatically configured to subscribe to data from or publish data to the data source or data target, respectively.","As described above, the task of configuring a program to exchange data with a data source or target can be difficult and time-consuming, and some users may not possess the necessary knowledge required, especially those users who are not highly trained in programming techniques. Thus, it would be highly beneficial to enable the user to perform this task without requiring the user to specify or write any source code. For example, it may be desirable to provide one or more user interface dialog boxes or windows with which the user can interact in order to configure the graphical program to exchange data with data sources and\/or data targets.","In various embodiments, the present invention comprises a system and various methods for simplifying or automating the task of configuring a graphical program to exchange data with a data source and\/or data target. In response to receiving user input (e.g., input received from a developer of the graphical program) specifying a data source, the graphical program may be automatically, i.e., programmatically, configured to receive data from the data source during program execution. The functionality of receiving the data from the data source is also referred to herein as \u201csubscribing\u201d to data from the data source. Similarly, in response to receiving user input specifying a data target, the graphical program may be automatically, i.e., programmatically, configured to provide or write data to the data target during program execution. The functionality of writing the data to the data target is also referred to herein as \u201cpublishing\u201d data to the data target.","The data source or data target may be any of various types. For example, the data source or data target may be a file, a server (or resource associated with a server), etc., and may be located on the host computer system of the graphical program or on a remote computer system. In the preferred embodiment, the data source or data target is specified by a uniform resource locator (URL).","The data source or data target user input information may be received in any of various ways. Typically, this information is received during development or editing of the graphical program. For example, a graphical programming environment may provide an editor or window for including various nodes or block diagram elements in a block diagram and connecting the nodes (block diagram elements) such that they visually indicate functionality of the graphical program. The nodes and other elements (e.g., user interface terminals) displayed on the block diagram are referred to herein as graphical \u201csource code\u201d.","In various embodiments, the user input specifying the data source or data target may be received as user input to the block diagram. In one embodiment, the data source or target information may not be initially associated with any particular node or element of the block diagram. For example, the developer may drag and drop an icon representing the data source or target, such as a URL icon or file icon, onto the block diagram window, or the developer may paste data source or target information stored on the clipboard, e.g., a URL, into the block diagram.","In another embodiment, the developer specifying the data source or target information may comprise associating the data source or target information with a particular block diagram element. For example, the developer may drag and drop a URL icon onto a specific node or node terminal. Also, the developer may invoke a configuration command from the context of a particular block diagram element, e.g., by right-clicking on a block diagram node in order to display a user interface dialog for configuring a data connection for the node to a data source or data target.","In response to receiving the URL or other information, the method may operate to present the developer with a user interface, e.g., a user interface dialog, for providing further information. A URL by itself may not designate the referenced resource as either a data source or target. Thus, the dialog may enable the developer to specify whether to treat the referenced resource as a data source or a data target. Also, in one embodiment the resource may be treated as both a data source and a data target, as described below. For example, in one embodiment, the user interface dialog enables the developer to select one of a \u201cPublish\u201d, \u201cSubscribe\u201d, or \u201cPublish and Subscribe\u201d option.","Once the necessary information regarding the data source or target has been received, the graphical program may be automatically, i.e., programmatically, configured to subscribe to data from the specified data source or publish data to the specified data target. In various embodiments, the automatic configuration of the graphical program may be performed in any of various ways. For example, in one embodiment, the method may automatically, i.e., programmatically, generate a portion of graphical source code and include the source code portion in the block diagram, wherein the source code portion is operable to either receive data from the specified data source or write data to the specified data target.","If the developer associated the data source or data target information with a particular block diagram node or terminal, then the generated source code portion may be automatically connected to that particular node or terminal. For example, as described above, nodes of a block diagram may be connected or wired together in a data flow, control flow and\/or execution flow representation. Thus, if a data source was specified, then the generated source code portion may include a node with an output terminal operable to output data received from the data source, and this output terminal may be automatically wired to an input terminal of an existing node, i.e., to an input terminal of the node with which the developer associated the data source information. Similarly, if a data target was specified, then the generated source code portion may include a node with an input terminal operable to receive the data to be written to the data target, and this input terminal may be automatically wired to an output terminal of the existing node.","If the developer did not associate the data source or data target information with a particular block diagram node or terminal, then the generated source code portion may be automatically included in the block diagram, but may not be connected to other elements of the block diagram. The developer may then manually connect the generated source code portion to other elements of the block diagram as desired. Alternatively, the method may prompt the developer to specify a node and\/or node terminal to connect the source code portion to. For example, the developer may click on the desired node or node terminal to connect to, or the developer may be presented with a selectable list of the possible connection points from which to choose.","In other embodiments, the graphical program may be configured to interface with the data source or target in ways other than generating and placing source code in the block diagram. For example, the functionality of receiving the data from the data source or writing the data to the data target may not be explicitly displayed on the block diagram. For example, the method may store information regarding the data connection to the data source or data target in a data structure associated with the specific block diagram element which receives data from the data source or provides data to the data target. When the graphical program is compiled, for example, the compiler may use this connection information to enable the graphical program to interface with the data source or target, such that the associated block diagram element receives data from the data source or writes data to the data target during program execution. The developer may view or change the data connection information at edit time, for example, by right-clicking on the block diagram element to display a user interface dialog box.","In many applications, the data received from a data source or provided to a data target may be associated with a graphical user interface (GUI) element in the graphical program. As described above, a graphical program may include a graphical user interface or front panel which displays various GUI elements, such as controls to provide user input to the graphical program and\/or indicators to display output from the graphical program. One embodiment of the invention comprises a system and method for enabling a graphical program to receive and display data from a data source in a GUI element or to write data associated with a GUI element to a data target.","When the developer specifies a data source or data target as described above, the developer may associate the data source or target information with a GUI element. For example, many graphical programming environments include a user interface editor or window for designing a graphical user interface. The developer may interact with the user interface editor window to specify the data source or target. For example, the developer may drag and drop an icon representing the data source, such as a URL icon or file icon, onto the window, or the developer may paste in data source information, e.g., a URL, from the clipboard. The developer may also invoke a user interface dialog for specifying the data source or target, similarly as described above. For example, the developer may right-click on a GUI element to display a popup menu for invoking the user interface dialog.","The user input specifying the data source or target to associate with a GUI element may also be received from the context of the graphical program's block diagram. In various embodiments, a graphical program's block diagram may include block diagram elements, e.g., nodes or terminals, representing or corresponding to GUI elements. Thus, the developer may specify one of these block diagram elements, similarly as described above.","If the developer associates a GUI element with a data source, then the method may automatically configure the graphical program to receive data from the data source and display the data in the GUI element during program execution. Similarly, if the developer associates a GUI element with a data target, then the method may automatically configure the graphical program to provide or write data associated with the GUI element, such as user input data or data programmatically associated with the GUI element, to the data target during program execution.","In the above description, the developer associates a data source or target with an existing GUI element. In another embodiment, the method may be operable to automatically create an appropriate GUI element and include the GUI element in the graphical program's GUI. For example, when the developer specifies the data source or target information, he may also specify that the data source or target should be associated with a new GUI element. As described below, the method may automatically determine an appropriate GUI element to include in the GUI. Alternatively, the method may prompt for user input specifying a desired GUI element to include in the GUI.","If a data source is specified, the method may operate to automatically determine a GUI element operable to display (or otherwise indicate) data received from the data source and may automatically include the GUI element in the program's graphical user interface (GUI) and automatically configure the graphical program to receive data from the specified data source during execution of the program and display the data in the GUI element. If a data target is specified, the method may operate to automatically determine a GUI element for inclusion in the graphical program's GUI and automatically configure the graphical program to write data associated with the GUI element to the specified data target during execution of the program.","Automatically including the GUI element in the GUI of the graphical program may comprise including a block diagram element corresponding to the GUI, e.g., a node, in the block diagram of the graphical program. Similarly as described above, a graphical source code portion that implements receiving data from the data source or writing data to the data target may be programmatically generated, and this source code portion may be connected to the GUI block diagram element. Also, as described above, the GUI block diagram element may be configured to interface with the data source or target without explicitly showing source code for this functionality on the block diagram, e.g., such that the developer can invoke a configuration dialog to view or edit the configuration information for the GUI block diagram element.","A GUI element automatically included in the GUI in response to the data source\/target information may be an element of any of various types, e.g., depending on which GUI elements are supported by a particular graphical programming environment. For example, various graphical programming environments may support GUI elements such as graphs, text boxes, check boxes, knobs, etc., among various other types of GUI elements.","Any of various techniques may be used in determining an appropriate GUI element for subscribing to data received from a data source. If the data source is a server (or is located on a server), the method may automatically connect to the server and receive data from the server. The appropriate GUI element to include in the program's GUI may then be determined based on the data received. Any of various types of data may be associated with a data source, such as strings, scalars, Booleans, waveforms, etc.","As well known in the art, the beginning portion of a URL specifies an access protocol. For example, the URL \u201chttp:\/\/www.ni.com\/map.htm\u201d specifies the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) as an access protocol. In one embodiment, a data source\/target may be accessed using a protocol that supports self-describing data. One example of such a protocol, the DataSocket Transport Protocol (DSTP) is discussed below. The DSTP protocol is used when interfacing with a type of server described herein, referred to as a DataSocket server. As an example, the data source URL may be a URL such as \u201cdstp:\/\/dsserver.ni.com\/wave\u201d, and data received from this data source (i.e., received from the DataSocket server when accessing this data source) may be two-dimensional waveform data. For example, the data may comprise live waveform data that is generated in real time. Since the data is received in a self-describing format, the method may determine that an appropriate GUI element for displaying the data would be a chart GUI element.","In some cases, more than one GUI element may be operable to display the data received from a data source. Thus, in one embodiment, the method may present the developer with a list of items or icons corresponding to the possible GUI elements, and the developer may select which one to use. Alternatively, the method may select one of the GUI elements to use, without receiving user input. For example, the selection of default GUI elements to use for various types of data may be user-configurable.","In some cases it may not be possible to determine an appropriate GUI element by examining data received from the data source. For example, the access protocol used may not support self-describing data. In this case, it may be possible to determine an appropriate GUI element based on other information. For example, if the URL specifies a file name, the GUI element may be determined based on the file extension. For example, if the URL specifies a file such as \u201cftp:\/\/ftp.ni.com\/wavel.wav\u201d then the method may determine that the data is waveform data, based on the \u201c.wav\u201d file extension. Thus, a chart GUI element may be used to display this waveform data.","If it is not possible to automatically determine an appropriate GUI element, then the method may prompt for user input. For example, the method may display a user interface dialog or window enabling the developer to easily select which GUI element to associate with the specified data source.","In one embodiment, once a GUI element has been determined and included in the program's graphical user interface, the developer may be allowed to easily change the GUI element to a new type of GUI element. For example, if a first GUI element was automatically determined and included in the GUI, the developer may override this choice by changing the first GUI element to a new type of GUI element, e.g., by right-clicking on the first GUI element or on a block diagram node corresponding to the first GUI element and selecting a popup menu item to change the type.","In one embodiment, the decision of which GUI element to include in the program's GUI may be deferred until the program is executed, or the GUI element may be changed to a new type during program execution. For example, it may not be possible to connect to a data source during program development. Also, the type of data associated with the data source could change from development time to runtime. Thus, in these cases it may be desirable to examine the data at runtime and select an appropriate GUI element dynamically.","As described above, in addition to displaying data from a data source in a GUI element, the developer may also want to publish data from a GUI element to a data target. If a data target is specified, the method may prompt for user input in order to determine an appropriate GUI element to include in the graphical user interface. Also, it may be possible to automatically select a GUI element, e.g., based on a file extension of the data target, if applicable, or based on information in a URL referencing the data target. For example, the method may be operable to maintain or access data on which types of GUI elements were used in the past in connection with which types of data targets.","Once the graphical program has been automatically configured to interface with a data source or target as described above, the graphical program may be executed. During program execution, the graphical program is operable to automatically, i.e., programmatically, determine and use an appropriate protocol for interfacing with the data source\/target, such as HTTP, FTP, DSTP, SNMP, etc.","If the developer configured the graphical program to subscribe to data from a data source, then the program may connect to or open the data source, using an appropriate protocol or access method, and receive data from the data source. This data may then be provided to the block diagram element with which the developer associated the data source. The data may then be processed according to the functionality of this block diagram element. If the developer associated the data source with a GUI element then the data may be provided to the GUI element for display. The GUI element may display or indicate the data in various ways, e.g., depending on the type of data and\/or the GUI element type. As an example, live data generated in real time may be received and displayed.","If the developer configured the graphical program to publish data to a data target, then the program may connect to or open the data target, using an appropriate protocol or access method, and send or write data from the block diagram element with which the developer associated the data target. If the developer associated a GUI element with the data target then data associated with the GUI element may be written to the data target. For example, data may be associated with the GUI element programmatically. In other words, the program may operate to generate data during program execution and provide the data to the GUI element, such as for display. In the prior art GUI of , for example, the program includes source code to programmatically specify power spectrum data for the Power Spectrum chart to display. Thus, the developer could easily configure the Power Spectrum chart to publish the power spectrum data to a data target, e.g., to provide the data to a remote application or write the data to a file.","In other cases, GUI element data to be published to a data target may be received as user input. In the prior art GUI of , for example, a data value for the Frequency knob GUI element is received as user input. Thus, the developer could easily configure the knob to publish the input frequency value received from the user to a data target, e.g., to control a remote system operable to receive the frequency value from this data target or to allow a remote user to view the input data being provided to the program.","In one embodiment, the developer may configure a GUI element to both publish and subscribe to data. For example, the developer could configure a knob GUI control, such as the Frequency knob shown in the GUI of , to publish and subscribe to data. For example, consider a situation in which two control programs execute at different locations, wherein both control programs monitor a remote system and control the opening and closing of a valve in the remote system. A knob GUI control for each program may display a value indicating a setting for the remote system valve. If a user of one of the control programs, i.e., the \u201cfirst\u201d control program, turns the knob, then the first control program may send a control message to the remote system, causing the remote system to adjust the valve setting accordingly. The first control program may also publish the new knob setting value to a data target\/source, such as a server, to which the knob GUI control of the first control program is configured to publish and subscribe. The other control program, i.e., the \u201csecond\u201d control program, may also subscribe and publish to this data source\/target, so that the change in the knob setting is automatically reflected on the GUI of the second control program. Since both control programs publish and subscribe to the data source\/target, a change in the GUI knob control setting that originates from the second control program will similarly be automatically reflected on the GUI of the first control program.","The scenario described above is one example of exchanging \u201clive\u201d data between different applications. In this case, data may be exchanged only periodically, e.g., when a user turns a knob GUI control on one of the control programs. In other cases, live data may be exchanged continuously. Other examples of live data exchange include: a reader application that subscribes to live multimedia data, e.g., audio data, generated by a writer application; two chat programs that exchange live text data with one another; etc. Also, as measurement and automation applications have become increasingly distributed and software-oriented, live data exchange has become especially important in these applications, e.g., in order to send acquired or generated signals across a network.","In various embodiments, the live data exchange may be implemented in any of various ways. In one embodiment, a server program or process may act as an intermediate between a writer program that writes live data and a reader program that subscribes to the live data. In one embodiment, multiple reader programs may receive and display data generated by a writer program, by interfacing with the server. For example, multiple users may execute a reader program to view live weather data. In the prior art, creating these types of applications is typically a complicated task, but one embodiment of the present invention enables data exchange between a writer program and multiple reader programs executing in different locations to occur without the developer having to specify or write any source code to accomplish the data exchange.","In one embodiment, a graphical program configured as described above with a data connection to a data source or target may utilize a separate layer or component for interfacing with the data source or target. One embodiment of such a layer, referred to as \u201cDataSocket\u201d, is described. DataSocket provides a single, unified, end-user application programming interface (API) for connecting to data from a number of sources, such as local files, files on FTP or Web servers, and data items on OPC Servers. A DataSocket application specifies the data location by using a familiar networking standard, the URL. Just as a Web browser uses a URL to connect to a Web page, a DataSocket application uses a URL to connect to data. In addition, the DataSocket Transfer Protocol connects a DataSocket application to live data by specifying a connection to a DataSocket Server. The DataSocket Server manages most of the networking tasks for the developer.","With conventional technologies such as TCP\/IP, the developer would have to write code to convert data to an unstructured stream of bytes in the broadcasting application, as well as code to parse the stream of bytes back into its original form in subscribing applications. DataSocket, however, transfers data in a self-describing format that can represent data in an unlimited number of formats, including strings, scalars, Booleans, and waveforms. The DataSocket read and write operations transparently convert data to and from the underlying byte streams, eliminating the need to write complicated parsing code. DataSocket uses the DataSocket Transport Protocol (DSTP), referred to above, to send data to and receive data from a DataSocket server.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.","Incorporation by Reference","The following patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety as though fully and completely set forth herein:","U.S. patent application Ser.

Either or both of the writer or reader programs may be graphical programs developed according to various embodiments of the methods described below. The computer system  may act as an intermediate server between the writer program and the reader program. For example, the intermediate server  may execute a server program (or process) with which the writer program and the reader program interface in order to exchange data. One embodiment of such a server program, referred to herein as a \u201cDataSocket server,\u201d is described below.","Such an intermediate server program may not necessarily execute on a separate computer system from the writer and reader programs. For example, the computer system  may execute the writer program which may interface with a server program also executing on the computer system . In this case, a reader program may interface with the server program executing on the computer system  in order to receive the data generated by the writer program. For example, the reader program may execute on the computer system , e.g., as shown in , or may execute on the same computer system . Alternatively, the writer program may execute on the computer system , and the server and reader programs may execute on the computer system .","The reader program may be a graphical program configured to subscribe to a data target to which the writer program writes data. In other words, the data target for the writer program may be a data source for the reader program. As described below, one embodiment of the present invention enables the program developer to easily associate a data source with a graphical program, by automatically configuring the graphical program to interface with the data source, without the developer having to specify or write any source code. In one embodiment, the data source may be associated with a graphical user interface (GUI) element of the reader program, such that the GUI element indicates data received from the data source, e.g., by displaying the data in various ways.","The writer program may be a graphical program configured to publish data to a data source from which the reader program receives data. In other words, the data source for the reader program may be a data target for the writer program. As described below, one embodiment of the present invention enables the developer to easily associate a data target with a graphical program, by automatically configuring the graphical program to interface with the data target, without the developer having to specify or write any source code. In one embodiment, the data target may be associated with a GUI element of the writer program, such that the graphical program is operable to publish data associated with the GUI element to the data target.","It is noted that either of the writer or reader programs may not be graphical programs, or may not be graphical programs developed or configured according to the methods described herein. Thus, one or both of a writer program and reader program may implement one embodiment of the present invention, and each of the writer program and reader program may interface with various applications or programs which can publish or subscribe to data over a network but which do not utilize the present invention.","For example, the writer program may be a text-based program, such as a program developed using a text-based language such as Java, C, Basic, etc. Also, the writer program may be a graphical program, but may include user-specified graphical source code to implement writing the data to the data target, rather than having been automatically configured to write the data to the data target with no user-created source code required.","In a case where the writer program is a graphical program that has a graphical user interface with a GUI element that displays the data that needs to be written to the data target, it may be beneficial to enable the developer to easily configure the GUI element to publish the data to the data target, e.g., as a very easy way to write the data to the data target. However, the writer program may not have a graphical user interface or may not display the data in a GUI element. For example, the reader program may receive data from a writer program executing on an embedded device that acquires real-time data from a physical system. Thus, the developer may also configure the data to be written to the data target from various function nodes or other elements of the graphical program's block diagram.","Similarly, the reader program may not be a graphical program and\/or may include user-specified source code to implement receiving the data from the data source, rather than having been automatically configured to subscribe to the data source with no user-created source code required.","In a case where the reader program is a graphical program that has a graphical user interface with a GUI element that needs to display the data from the data source, it may be beneficial to enable the developer to easily configure the GUI element to subscribe to the data from the data source, e.g., as a very easy way to obtain and display the data. However, the reader program may not include a graphical user interface or may not display the data received from the data source to the user. Thus, the developer may also configure various function nodes or other elements of the graphical program's block diagram to subscribe to the data source.","To illustrate one example of a writer and reader program, consider a writer program executing on a computer system in a laboratory, wherein the writer program is operable to continuously acquire signal data from a hardware unit under test. The writer program may publish the acquired signal data to a data target, such as a server.","In one case, the writer program may be a graphical program having a graphical user interface panel that includes a GUI element for displaying the signal data, such as a chart GUI element operable to display the signal data as a two-dimensional waveform. In this case, the developer of the writer program may easily configure the writer program to publish the signal data to the data target by simply associating the data target with the chart GUI element, according to one embodiment of the present invention. For example, as described below, the developer may simply invoke a user interface dialog box and specify a URL referencing the desired data target for the chart GUI element. In response, the writer program may be automatically, i.e., programmatically, configured to provide the signal data from the chart GUI element to the data target during execution of the writer program. Thus, the developer of the writer program may not need to specify or write any source code to accomplish the publication of the signal data to the data target.","In other cases, the writer program may publish the signal data to the data target in other ways. For example, the developer of the writer program may manually create source code to accomplish the publication of the signal data. Also, in other cases, the writer program may not have a GUI element that displays the signal data or may not even have a graphical user interface.","In this example, a reader program may be operable to subscribe to the data target, e.g., the server, to which the writer program publishes the signal data. In other words, the data target for the writer program is a data source for the reader program.","In one case, the reader program may be a graphical program having a graphical user interface panel that includes a GUI element for displaying the signal data acquired from the data source\/target, such as a chart GUI element operable to display the signal data as a two-dimensional waveform. For example, a user may execute the reader program in a remote computer system outside of the laboratory, in order to remotely monitor the hardware unit under test.","The developer of the reader program may easily configure the reader program to subscribe to and display the signal data by simply specifying the desired data source, according to one embodiment of the present invention. For example, the developer may provide a URL referencing the data source, e.g., by typing the URL or pasting the URL into a user interface editor window or block diagram editor window. In response, the development environment may be operable to determine that a chart GUI element is an appropriate GUI element to display data received from the specified data source, as described below. The development environment may then automatically include the chart GUI element in the program's graphical user interface. In another embodiment, the developer may first include the chart GUI element in the program's GUI manually and may then specify a data source for the GUI element.","The GUI element which is included (either automatically or manually) in the program's GUI may then be automatically, i.e., programmatically, configured to receive the signal data from the data source during execution of the reader program and display the signal data. Thus, the developer of the reader program may not need to specify or write any source code to accomplish the acquisition and display of the signal data.","In other cases, the reader program may acquire the signal data from the data source in other ways. For example, the developer of the reader program may manually create source code to acquire the signal data. Also, in other cases, the reader program may not have a GUI element that displays the signal data or may not even have a graphical user interface. For example, the reader program may acquire the signal data and log the data to a file, without displaying it.","It is noted that various embodiments of the present invention do not use a writer and reader program together such as described above. A writer and reader program may be used together, for example, when \u201clive\u201d data needs to be exchanged between two applications. However, some programs may need to receive data from or write data to a data source\/target not associated with another program, such as a file, or other type of data source\/target, such as a hardware device. For example, in one embodiment, a graphical program may be automatically configured (i.e., with no explicit source code required) to receive data from a file and display the data. Another program may include a GUI element to automatically (i.e., with no explicit source code required) write data associated with the GUI element to a file. In these types of cases a writer or reader program executing on the host computer system  may be configured to write data to or read data from a data target or source located either on the host computer system  or on another computer system connected via a network, such as computer system .

For example, this information may be received by a graphical programming environment application during the editing of a graphical program.","In step , in response to the user input, the graphical program may be automatically, i.e., programmatically, configured to interface with the specified data source or data target. If a data source was specified, then the graphical program may be configured to receive data from the data source during program execution. The functionality of receiving the data from the data source is also referred to herein as \u201csubscribing\u201d to data from the data source. Similarly, if a data target was specified, then the graphical program may be configured to provide or write data to the data target. The functionality of writing the data to the data target is also referred to herein as \u201cpublishing\u201d data to the data target.","The data source or data target may be any of various types. For example, the data source or data target may be a file, a server (or resource associated with a server), etc., and may be located on the host computer system of the graphical program or on a remote computer system. In the preferred embodiment, the data source or data target is specified by a uniform resource locator (URL).","The data source or data target user input information may be received in any of various ways. For example, a graphical programming environment may provide an editor or window for including various nodes or other elements in a block diagram and connecting the nodes and other block diagram elements such that they visually indicate functionality of the graphical program. The interconnected nodes and other elements displayed on the block diagram are referred to herein as graphical \u201csource code\u201d.","In various embodiments, the user input specifying the data source or data target may be received as user input to the block diagram. In one embodiment, the data source or target information may not be initially associated with any particular element of the block diagram. For example, the graphical program developer may drag and drop an icon representing the data source or target, such as a URL icon or file icon, onto the block diagram window, or the developer may paste data source or target information stored on the clipboard, e.g., a URL, into the block diagram. Alternatively, the developer may type in the URL into a text box on a block diagram window or user interface editor window. Also, the developer may select a URL or a named data source or target using a \u201cbrowse\u201d method that enables selection from various known data sources or targets.","In another embodiment, the developer specifying the data source or target information may comprise associating the data source or target information with a particular block diagram element. For example, the developer may drag and drop a URL icon onto a specific node or node terminal. Also, the developer may invoke a configuration command from the context of a particular block diagram element, e.g., by right-clicking on a block diagram node or node terminal in order to display a user interface dialog for configuring a data connection for the node to a data source or data target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0144"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":"250"},"As described above, the data source or data target input may comprise a URL. A URL by itself may not designate the referenced resource as either a data source or target. Thus, the user interface dialog may enable the developer to specify whether to treat the referenced resource as a data source or data target, as shown in step . For example, the dialog box of  enables the developer to choose from \u201cPublish\u201d, \u201cSubscribe\u201d or \u201cPublish and Subscribe\u201d options. For example, to specify a data source, the developer would choose the \u201cSubscribe\u201d option for the data connection type, as shown in . To specify a data target, the developer would choose the \u201cPublish\u201d option for the data connection type, as shown in .","In some cases, it may be possible to automatically determine whether the developer wants to interface with a data source or target. For example, the developer may right-click on an input terminal of a block diagram node and invoke the dialog box from that context, in order to configure the terminal with input data. In this case, the graphical program would interface with a data source in order to obtain the input data. If, on the other hand, the developer right-clicked on an output terminal of a block diagram node, then the graphical program would interface with a data target in order to provide output data from the node to the data target.","As shown in step , the dialog box may enable the developer to specify a reference to the data source or target. For example, the dialog box of  also illustrates a text field labeled \u201cConnect To\u201d, in which the developer may type or paste a URL. In another embodiment, the dialog box may have been invoked in response to receiving a URL. For example, as noted above the developer may have drag-and-dropped or pasted URL information into the block diagram window. In this case, the \u201cConnect To\u201d field may be pre-populated with the specified URL.","In the preferred embodiment, various types of data sources or data targets may be specified. For example, the developer may specify a server, such as a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server, a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, an OLE for Process Control (OPC) server, a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server, or a type of server referred to herein as a DataSocket server (discussed below). The developer may also specify a file as the data source or data target.","In step , the developer may apply the information specified in the dialog box, e.g., by clicking on the \u201cChange\u201d button shown in .","Once the necessary information regarding the data source or target has been received, the graphical program may be automatically, i.e., programmatically, configured to subscribe to data from the specified data source or publish data to the specified data target. In various embodiments, the configuration of the graphical program may be performed in any of various ways. For example, in one embodiment, the method may automatically, i.e., programmatically, generate a portion of graphical source code and include the source code portion in the block diagram, wherein the source code portion is operable to either receive data from the specified data source or write data to the specified data target.","In one embodiment, the method may programmatically generate a single node that is operable to connect to the data source or target. One example of such a node is referred to as a DataSocket primitive node. The method may also generate and display a URL item, e.g., a text constant, that is connected to an input of the DataSocket node. This visually indicates to the developer the URL of the data source or data target being accessed. In this embodiment, the single DataSocket primitive node is the only graphical source code required to connect to a data source or data target. In another embodiment, the method may programmatically generate a plurality of nodes that are interconnected to comprise the source code portion.","If the developer associated the data source or data target information with a particular block diagram node or terminal, then the generated source code portion (e.g., one or more nodes) may be automatically connected to that particular node or terminal. For example, as described above, nodes of a block diagram may be connected or wired together in one or more of a data flow, control flow and\/or execution flow representation. Thus, if a data source was specified, then the generated source code portion may include a node with an output terminal operable to output data received from the data source, and this output terminal may be automatically wired to an input terminal of an existing node, i.e., to an input terminal of the node with which the developer associated the data source information. Similarly, if a data target was specified, then the generated source code portion may include a node with an input terminal operable to receive the data to be written to the data target, and this input terminal may be automatically wired to an output terminal of the existing node. If the developer associated the data source or target information with a graphical user interface element in the graphical program's user interface, then the source code portion may be automatically connected to a node or terminal in the block diagram that corresponds to the selected graphical user interface element.","If the developer did not associate the data source or data target information with a particular block diagram node or terminal, then the generated source code portion (e.g., one or more DataSocket or other nodes) may be automatically included in the block diagram, but may not be connected to other elements of the block diagram. For example, a DataSocket primitive node may be programmatically included in the block diagram and configured to connect to the specified URL, but may not be connected to other graphical source code already present in the block diagram. The developer may then connect the generated source code portion to other elements of the block diagram as desired. For example, the developer may connect the DataSocket node to other nodes in the block diagram. Alternatively, the method may prompt the developer to specify a node and\/or node terminal to connect the source code portion to. For example, the developer may click on the desired node or node terminal to connect to, or the developer may be presented with a selectable list of the possible connection points from which to choose.","In other embodiments, the graphical program may be configured to interface with the data source or target in ways other than generating and placing source code in the block diagram. For example, the functionality of receiving the data from the data source or writing the data to the data target may not be explicitly displayed on the block diagram. For example, the method may store information regarding the data connection to the data source or data target in a data structure associated with the specific block diagram element which receives data from the data source or provides data to the data target. When the graphical program is compiled, for example, the compiler may use this connection information to enable the graphical program to interface with the data source or target, such that the associated block diagram element receives data from the data source or writes data to the data target during program execution. The developer may view or change the data connection information at edit time, for example, by right-clicking on the block diagram element to display a user interface dialog box.","Once the graphical program has been automatically configured to interface with the data source or target, the graphical program may be executed. During program execution, the graphical program is operable to automatically, i.e., programmatically, determine and use an appropriate protocol for interfacing with the data source\/target, such as HTTP, FTP, SNMP, DSTP, etc.","If the developer configured the graphical program to subscribe to data from a data source, then the program may connect to or open the data source, using an appropriate protocol or access method, and receive data from the data source. This data may then be provided to the block diagram element with which the developer associated the data source. The data may then be processed according to the functionality of this block diagram element.","If the developer configured the graphical program to publish data to a data target, then the program may connect to or open the data target, using an appropriate protocol or access method, and send or write data from the block diagram element with which the developer associated the data target.","The above-described method may enable a developer to easily enable a graphical program to interface with various types of data sources and targets. By simply receiving user input specifying a URL, specifying whether the URL references a data source or data target, and\/or specifying a block diagram element, the method may automatically configure the graphical program. As described, the user may specify this information at a high level, e.g., using by using point-and-click or drag-and-drop techniques and\/or by interacting with various user interface dialogs. Thus, the graphical program may be programmatically configured to interface with the data source or data target, without the developer having to program this functionality, e.g., without having to specify or write any source code.","FIG. \u2014Automatic Configuration to Display Data in a GUI Element","In many applications, the data received from a data source or provided to a data target may be associated with a graphical user interface (GUI) element in the graphical program. As described above, a graphical program may include a graphical user interface or front panel which displays various GUI elements, such as controls to provide user input to the graphical program and\/or indicators to display output from the graphical program. One embodiment of the invention comprises a system and method for enabling a graphical program to receive and display data from a data source in a GUI element or to write data associated with a GUI element to a data target.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0160"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"In step , user input specifying a data source may be received. In various embodiments the data source information may be received in any of various ways. For example, many programming environments include a user interface editor or window for designing a graphical user interface. The developer may interact with the user interface editor window to specify the data source. For example, the developer may drag and drop an icon representing the data source, such as a URL icon or file icon, onto the window, or the developer may paste in data source information, e.g., a URL, from the clipboard. The developer may also invoke a user interface dialog for specifying the data source, similarly as described above. For example, as illustrated in , the developer may right-click on a GUI element to display a popup menu for invoking the user interface dialog.","The user input specifying the data source may also be received from the context of the graphical program's block diagram. In various embodiments, a graphical program's block diagram may include block diagram elements representing or corresponding to GUI elements. Thus, the developer may associate the data source information with a GUI block diagram element, e.g., by right-clicking on the GUI block diagram element to invoke a dialog box as described above.","In the above description, the developer associates the data source with an existing GUI element. In another embodiment, the GUI element may not yet exist, and the method may be operable to determine an appropriate GUI element to automatically include in the graphical program's GUI, wherein the GUI element is operable to display data received from the specified data source, as shown in step . For example, when the developer specifies the data source information, he may also specify that the data source should be associated with a new GUI element. As described below, the method may automatically determine an appropriate GUI element to include in the GUI. Alternatively, the method may prompt for user input specifying a desired GUI element to include in the GUI.","In various embodiments, any of various types of GUI elements may be available for inclusion in the graphical program's graphical user interface, e.g., depending on which GUI elements are supported by a particular graphical programming environment. For example, various graphical programming environments may support GUI elements such as graphs, text boxes, check boxes, knobs, etc., among various other types of GUI elements. The application development environment may also enable the use of custom GUI elements. For example, some application development environments enable the use of custom GUI elements packaged as ActiveX controls.","A GUI element may be operable to indicate data to the user in various ways. For example,  illustrates a chart GUI element operable to display a two-dimensional chart of data.  illustrates GUI elements that indicate data in other ways. For example,  illustrates a thermometer GUI element that indicates numeric data by adjusting the height of a red column, an LED GUI element that indicates Boolean data by displaying a light turned on or off, a meter GUI element that indicates numeric data by adjusting the position of a needle, etc. If a custom GUI element is used, such as an ActiveX control, the GUI element may define its own behavior for indicating data to the user. In addition to displaying data to the user, various GUI elements may also indicate data in other ways, e.g., by sending audio signals to a sound device. A GUI element may indicate discrete or continuous data. For example, in , the chart display may change continuously as new data is constantly received, while in , the LED light may change only occasionally, e.g., to indicate a Boolean change in the state of a variable that occurs only occasionally.","Any of various techniques may be used in determining an appropriate GUI element for subscribing to data received from a data source. If the data source is a server (or is located on a server), the method may automatically connect to the server and receive data from the server. The appropriate GUI element to include in the program's GUI may then be determined based on the data received. Any of various types of data may be associated with a data source, such as strings, scalars, Booleans, waveforms, etc.","As well known in the art, the beginning portion of a URL specifies an access protocol. For example, the URL \u201chttp:\/\/www.ni.com\/map.htm\u201d specifies the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) as an access protocol. In one embodiment, a data source\/target may be accessed using a protocol that supports self-describing data. One example of such a protocol, the DataSocket Transport Protocol (DSTP) is discussed below. The DSTP protocol is used when interfacing with a type of server described herein, referred to as a DataSocket server. As an example, the data source URL may be a URL such as \u201cdstp:\/\/dsserver.ni.com\/wave\u201d, and data received from this data source (i.e., received from the DataSocket server when accessing this data source) may be two-dimensional waveform data. For example, the data may comprise live waveform data that is generated in real time. Since the data is received in a self-describing format, the method may determine that an appropriate GUI element for displaying the data would be a chart GUI element.","In some cases, more than one GUI element may be operable to display the data received from a data source. Thus, in one embodiment, the method may present the developer with a list of items or icons corresponding to the possible GUI elements, and the developer may select which one to use. Alternatively, the method may select one of the GUI elements to use, without receiving user input. For example, the selection of default GUI elements to use for various types of data may be user-configurable.","In some cases it may not be possible to determine an appropriate GUI element by examining data received from the data source. For example, the access protocol used may not support self-describing data. In this case, it may be possible to determine an appropriate GUI element based on other information. For example, if the URL specifies a file name, the GUI element may be determined based on the file extension. For example, if the URL specifies a file such as \u201cftp:\/\/ftp.ni.com\/wave1.wav\u201d then the method may determine that the data is waveform data, based on the \u201c.wav\u201d file extension. Thus, a chart GUI element may be used to display this waveform data.","If it is not possible to automatically determine an appropriate GUI element, then the method may prompt for user input. For example, the method may display a user interface dialog or window enabling the developer to easily select which GUI element to associate with the specified data source.","In step , the GUI element determined for displaying the data may be automatically, i.e., programmatically included (displayed) in the program's graphical user interface. For example, the GUI element may be included or displayed on a graphical user interface panel or window associated with the program. In step , the graphical program may also be automatically, i.e., programmatically configured to receive data from the specified data source and display the data in the GUI element during program execution.","Automatically including (displaying) the GUI element in the GUI of the graphical program may comprise including a block diagram element corresponding to the GUI, e.g., a node (also referred to as a user interface terminal), in the block diagram of the graphical program. Similarly as described above, a graphical source code portion (e.g., one or more nodes, such as a single DataSocket node) that implements receiving data from the data source may be programmatically generated, and this source code portion may be connected to the GUI block diagram element. For example, a DataSocket node may be programmatically included in the block diagram, and this node may be programmatically connected to the GUI block diagram element in the block diagram. Also, as described above, the GUI block diagram element may be configured to interface with the data source without explicitly showing source code for this functionality on the block diagram, e.g., such that the developer can invoke a configuration dialog to view or edit the configuration information for the GUI block diagram element.","The implementation of configuring the graphical program in step  may depend on the particular graphical programming environment being used. In one embodiment, no source code is added to the graphical program in performing this configuration. For example, the method may store information regarding the data source connection in a data structure. When the graphical program is compiled (if applicable), for example, the compiler may use this connection information to enable the graphical program to dynamically connect to the data source and provide data received from the data source to the GUI element. For example, the graphical program may launch a separate thread to perform this task. In another embodiment, the method may automatically alter the graphical source code of the program in order to enable the GUI element to receive and display the data from the data source. For example, the method may automatically generate one or more nodes to connect to the data source, receive data from the data source, and pass the data to the GU element.","In one embodiment, performing step  may utilize a separate layer or component specialized for exchanging data with various types of data sources and targets. One such component, referred to as a \u201cDataSocket\u201d, is described in the above-incorporated patent application titled, \u201cDataSocket System and Method for Accessing Data Sources Using URLs\u201d. An overview of the DataSocket system is also given below.","In one embodiment, once a GUI element has been determined and included in the program's graphical user interface, the developer may be allowed to easily change the GUI element to a new type of GUI element. For example, if a first GUI element was automatically determined and included in the GUI, the developer may override this choice by changing the first GUI element to a new type of GUI element, e.g., by right-clicking on the first GUI element or on a block diagram node corresponding to the first GUI element and selecting a popup menu item to change the type.","In one embodiment, the decision of which GUI element to include in the program's GUI may be deferred until the program is executed, or the GUI element may be changed to a new type during program execution. For example, it may not be possible to connect to a data source during program development. Also, the type of data associated with the data source could change from development time to runtime. Thus, in these cases it may be desirable to examine the data at runtime and select an appropriate GUI element dynamically.","In step , the graphical program may be executed.","In step , the graphical user interface of the graphical program may be displayed, in response to execution of the program. For example, depending on a particular development environment, the graphical program may include source code for displaying the GUI, or the GUI may be automatically displayed when the program is executed.

As described above, the program may be operable to connect to the data source and pass data to the GUI element in various ways.","In step , the GUI element may indicate the data received in step , e.g., by displaying the data or by altering the way in which the GUI element is displayed. The GUI element may indicate the data in any of various ways. For example: a chart GUI element that receives a continuous stream of numeric data may display a scrolling chart of the data; a knob GUI element that receives a numeric value may alter the appearance of the knob to illustrate that the knob is currently set to the received value; an LED GUI element that receives a Boolean value may alter the appearance of the LED light to appear to be turned on or off; etc.","Depending on the type of data source, steps  and  may be performed multiple times, as indicated by the flowchart arrow from step  to step . For example, if the data source is a DataSocket server, the program may maintain a continuous network connection with the DataSocket server and may periodically or continuously receive new data from the DataSocket server and pass the new data to the GUI element for display. For other types of data sources, such as a file, steps  and  may only be performed once.","As noted above, in an alternative embodiment, instead of first specifying a data source, the developer may first include a GUI element in the program's GUI and may then configure the GUI element to subscribe to data from a data source, e.g., by invoking a user interface dialog for specifying a URL for a data source to which to subscribe, e.g., as shown in . Thus, in one embodiment, the developer may include the desired GUI element in the program's GUI manually instead of the GUI element being selected and included automatically as described above.

In the above example, the first computer program may adjust the remote system by sending a control signal requesting the remote system to open or close the valve controlled by the knob GUI control. Also, since the GUI control is configured to publish its data, the new value is published to the configured data target\/source to which the GUI control of the first control program is configured to publish and subscribe. For example, the new value may be published to a server as described above.","The other control program, i.e., the \u201csecond\u201d control program, may also subscribe and publish to this data source\/target. Thus, in step , the second control program may receive the new value published by the first control program, e.g., by interfacing with the server, and may update the value displayed by the GUI control of the second control program. In the example above, the knob GUI element of the second control program may thus be automatically turned to reflect the new setting specified by the user of the first control program.","DataSocket System","As discussed above, a program with a GUI element configured with a data connection to a data source or target may utilize a separate layer or component for interfacing with the data source or target. This section provides an overview of one embodiment of such a layer, referred to as \u201cDataSocket\u201d. For more information on the DataSocket system, please refer to the DataSocket documentation available from National Instruments Corp. or to the above-incorporated patent application titled, \u201cDataSocket System and Method for Accessing Data Sources Using URLs\u201d.","DataSocket provides a single, unified, end-user application programming interface (API) for connecting to data from a number of sources, such as local files, files on FTP or Web servers, and data items on OPC Servers. A DataSocket application specifies the data location by using a familiar networking standard, the URL. Just as a Web browser uses a URL to connect to a Web page, a DataSocket application uses a URL to connect to data. By using an industry-standard URL, the user can quickly and easily bring data into or share data from DataSocket applications. In addition, the DataSocket Transfer Protocol connects a DataSocket application to live data by specifying a connection to a DataSocket Server. The DataSocket Server manages most of the networking tasks for the user.","With the DataSocket Server, a lightweight, stand-alone component, programs using DataSocket can broadcast live data, such as measurement data, at high rates across a network such as the Internet to multiple remote clients concurrently. These client applications use DataSocket to subscribe to the live data. Because the DataSocket Server is a stand-alone component, it simplifies network (TCP\/IP) programming by automatically managing connections to clients and automatically converting data to and from the stream of bytes sent across the network. The user does not have to write the parsing code. The DataSocket Server can run on any computer on a network, which improves performance and provides security by isolating the Web connections from other applications.","Various DataSocket APIs are provided so that various types of programming environments may interface with a DataSocket Server for data exchange. For example, as shown in , a DataSocket node may be included in the block diagram of a graphical program.","With conventional technologies such as TCP\/IP, the developer would have to write code to convert data to an unstructured stream of bytes in the broadcasting application, as well as code to parse the stream of bytes back into its original form in subscribing applications. DataSocket, however, transfers data in a self-describing format that can represent data in an unlimited number of formats, including strings, scalars, Booleans, and waveforms. The DataSocket read and write operations transparently convert data to and from the underlying byte streams, eliminating the need to write complicated parsing code. DataSocket uses a protocol referred to as the DataSocket Transport Protocol (DSTP) to send data to and receive data from a DataSocket server.","With DataSocket the data source or target name is in the form of a URL. For example, in the URL, \u201cdstp:\/\/localhost\/wave\u201d, the \u201cdstp:\/\/\u201d indicates that the DataSocket application is connecting to a DataSocket Server using the DataSocket Transfer Protocol for live data. The \u201clocalhost\u201d indicates that the DataSocket Server is running on the local machine; if the DataSocket Server were running on another machine, the user would replace localhost with the machine name or IP address. The \u201cwave\u201d is the data item name on the server. This is an arbitrary name which identifies the location of the data on the DataSocket Server. A single DataSocket Server can handle numerous data items.","FIG. \u2014DataSocket Server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0232","num":"0243"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},"Using the DataSocket server, the writer supplying the data is not required to handle the administrative details of sending data to many different clients, and hence can run more efficiently. The DataSocket server, which can be located on a different machine, assumes the task of redistributing the information. The user can configure the maximum number of data items and maximum number of connections allowed to the server. The user can also configure multiple write connections to a data item at the same time, if desired.","FIG. \u2014DataSocket Transfer Protocol","A brief description of the DataSocket Transfer Protocol as used in one embodiment follows:","Message Formats:","Messages may be made up of packets of bytes comprising the following parts.\n\n","Messages are sent as a block of values stored in the \u201ccluster\u201d format described above. The first element is the op code, subsequent elements are parameters, if necessary, for the specific op code.\n\n","kCWDSConnect,","kCWDSDisconnect,","kCWDSSetVersion,","kCWDSLogon,","kCWDSSubscribe,","kCWDSUnsubscribe,","kCWDSSetValue,","kCWDSGetValue,","MessageSequences:","Message Sequences:","Sequences:","With the exception of the greeting messages, the client, or server never waits for a reply. Either the client or server can cancel the session at any time by sending the appropriate \u201cdisconnect\u201d message.","Protocol Functions:","Functions:","Getting, setting, and subscribing to values of items stored in a database maintained by a server.","Name of the Port:","nati-dstp","DataSocket handles all tasks of converting data and data attributes from their native application format (strings, arrays, Booleans, etc.) into a TCP\/IP suitable format, referred to as the Flex Data format, and converting back from the Flex Data format on the client end. Because the DSTP network communication only requires TCP\/IP support, the DataSocket can be used to share information through many different types of networks, including the Internet. The DataSocket can be used to share information between machines located on opposite sides of the world using local Internet service providers. Of course, DataSocket and the DataSocket server can be used on a local Windows network or in a single stand-alone computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0030","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIGS. 29A\u201329B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0249","num":"0271"},"figref":["FIGS. 29A\u201329B","FIGS. 29A\u201329B","FIGS. 29A\u201329B"]},"As shown in step  the DataSocket may receive a request to connect to the specified URL. For example, the developer may have created a program with a GUI element configured to connect to a data source or target specified by the URL. When the program begins execution, the program may attempt to connect to the data source or target, e.g., by requesting the DataSocket to connect to the URL.","In step  the DataSocket partitions the URL into an AccessMethod, Host, and Path. The AccessMethod of the URL preferably comprises the first portion of the IRL, e.g., http, ftp, file, dstp, etc. Other AccessMethods are also contemplated. The \u201cHost\u201d portion specifies the host computer where the data is located, and the \u201cPath\u201d specifies the path where the data is located on the host computer.","If the AccessMethod is either http or ftp as determined in step , then in step  the DataSocket connects to the http or ftp server using conventional technology, e.g., using conventional Internet technology.","After step , in step  the DataSocket determines the file type. The DataSocket determines the file type for http based on the mime type. The DataSocket may also determine the file type based on the URL path suffix and\/or the stream contents. After step , operation proceeds to step .","If the access method is \u201cfile\u201d as determined in step , then in step  the DataSocket opens the file using the system's file library. In step  the DataSocket determines the file type based on the file suffix, the file contents, or parameters contained within the URL. After step , operation advances to step .","After the DataSocket has determined the file type in either of steps  or , in step  the DataSocket determines if it has built-in support for the type. If the DataSocket has built-in support for the file type as determined in step , then in step  the built-in adapter comprised in the DataSocket converts the data from the file or stream into a Flex Data object, also referred to as a FlexDataObject.","In step  the DataSocket converts the data into a form more usable by a typical prograrnming language or application. Examples of data converted by the DataSocket include WAV files, tabbed text files, DSD files, and text. For example, if the data is retrieved from a spreadsheet, the DataSocket converts the tab delimited spreadsheet data into a 2D array of numbers, without any tabs or ASCII strings. This 2D array of numbers is not required to be parsed by the containing application. Also, in general, a number of engineering formats exist for storing vectors or arrays. The DataSocket preferably operates to convert data of these various formats into arrays of data or numbers for direct use by the application. After step , operation proceeds to step .","In step  the Flex Data object value in the DataSocket is set. This means that the data which was converted into the more usable form in step , such as a 2d array, is now stored in memory managed by an object that is accessible by the client program. The client application may get a copy value from the Flex Data object by calling a method on the Flex Data object named \u201cGetValue\u201d. This method preferably returns a copy of the value stored in a VARIANT, a structure defined by Microsoft as part of its ActiveX standard for component software. The Value of attributes can be gotten by calling a method named GetAttribute, or set by calling a method called SetAttribute. A VARIANT structure is used for attributes as well. The VARIANT structure can hold simple data types like numbers or Boolean values and data types that require additional memory for storage such as strings and arrays.","In step  the DataSocket notifies the container or application using the DataSocket that it has received a value from the data source, preferably through a new data event. Operation then completes.","If the DataSocket does not include built-in support for the file type as determined in step , then in step  the DataSocket determines if a DataSocket file adapter is registered for that file type. A DataSocket file adapter is created by a user and registered with the DataSocket. The DataSocket file adapter is used to read or write files using custom-defined formats. If a DataSocket file adapter is not registered for that type, then in step  the DataSocket notifies the container or application that the value cannot be retrieved, and operation completes.","If a DataSocket file adapter is registered for that file type as determined in step , then in step  the DataSocket creates the file adapter component or client. In step  the DataSocket calls or invokes the file adapter's Connect method. In step  the file adapter reads data from the file identified by the URL. In step  the file adapter constructs a Flex Data object with values and attributes extracted from the file.","After steps \u2013 have been performed, in step  Flex Data object value in the DataSocket is set, and in step  the DataSocket notifies the container or application that it has received a value from the URL, and operation completes.","If the access method is \u201cdstp\u201d as determined in step , then in step  the DataSocket attempts to make a connection to the DataSocket server identified by the URL using the host name or Internet address encoded in the URL according to standard URL syntax. As described above, the access mode \u201cdstp\u201d directs the DataSocket to connect to the DataSocket server identified in the URL. If the connection is established in step , then in step  the DataSocket sends a command indicating a request to subscribe to a specific tag or item, or to write the value of a specific tag maintained by the DataSocket server. The DataSocket preferably sends this command over TCP\/IP. If the specific tag does not exist on the server, then the server may create the tag and give it an initial value, or may report back an error indicating that that the requested tag does not exist. This is a configuration option on the DataSocket server. Reporting errors is preferably done by sending commands over the TCP\/IP connection. Commands are preferably sequences of bytes sent over a TCP\/IP connection.","After step , as updates are received in step , the DataSocket sets the value in the DataSocket's Flex Data object and notifies the container or application using the DataSocket. Thus, each time update notifications are received from the server, the Flex Data object is set and the container or application is notified of each update. Step  is continually performed as data is received until the container instructs the DataSocket to disconnect from the data source to which it is connected.","If the access method is not \u201cdstp\u201d as determined in step , and is not either http, ftp, or file as determined in steps  and , then in step  the DataSocket derives or constructs the name of an extension or plug-in from the access method that was specified in the URL. For example, if the access method is \u201copc\u201d then the name of the extension or plug-in could be \u201cDataSocketPlugInopc\u201d.","In step  the DataSocket determines if a DataSocket extension or plug-in with that name is registered. Thus, if the access method is not one of the pre-defined types, e.g., http, ftp, file, or dstp, in steps  and  the DataSocket attempts to intelligently determine the proper extension or plug-in from the access method that was specified in the URL.","If no DataSocket plug-in is registered with the derived name, then the DataSocket notifies the application or container that the value cannot be retrieved, and operation completes.","If a DataSocket plug-in is registered for the determined extension name as determined in step , then steps \u2013 are performed.","In step  the DataSocket creates an extension component based on the registered DataSocket extension. In other words, the DataSocket instantiates a component from the registered DataSocket extension.","In step  the DataSocket calls the extension component's Connect method. In step  the extension or plug-in connects to the data source determined by the path and parameters in the URL. In step , when the data source has a value, the extension stores the value in a Flex Data object and operation then advances to . As discussed above, in steps  and  the DataSocket's Flex Data object value is set and the DataSocket notifies the container that it has received a value from the data source, and operation then completes.","Although the embodiments above have been described in considerable detail, numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated.
