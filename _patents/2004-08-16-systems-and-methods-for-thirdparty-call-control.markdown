{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to telecommunications networks and, more particularly, to systems and methods for the transmission of voice and data information over a communications network, including the routing, interconnection, and third-party control of such information.","In the past, telephone calls and the voice data associated with such calls were transmitted over conventional plain old telephone systems. More recently, Voice-over-IP (VOIP) technology has emerged as a popular and cost effective alternative for transmitting and receiving voice data. VOIP technology has created an opportunity for telecommunications providers to combine both voice and data services through one medium. This convergence has resulted in the possibility of using separate networks for transmitting and controlling communications (i.e., one network to provide a communications path and another different network to initiate and control a communications session).","The ability to initiate a communications session independent of the endpoints connected to the transmission channels is generally referred to as third-party call control. An example of third-party call control is a click-to-dial capability that allows a user to initiate voice communications from a computer.","Providing session control independently of the endpoints involved in transmitting call information provides applications engineers with a host of new service options. For example, in addition to click-to-dial services, third-party call control typically supports flexible conference control services, such as network-initiated streaming content services, and the ability to provide a general set of application programming interfaces (APIs) accessible to third-party application developers.","Modern multimedia networks allow for the separation of the signaling from media transport and for the separation of applications from the signaling and media aspects of a communications session. Third-party application servers can create, delete, and modify the attributes of parties participating in a call.","Third-party call control interfaces, however, such as Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA), Java Telephony Application Programming Interface (JTAPI), and Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) were created during a time period when central network entities were assumed to be intelligent software controlled computer systems and the network endpoints (e.g., telephones) were relatively simple devices.","As the cost of relatively powerful digital processing devices has decreased and the ability to provide high bandwidth data connections has improved, intelligent multifunctional endpoints have emerged. Although these endpoints have sophisticated autonomous features, they often have difficulty interacting with 3PCC services within the network. Further complicating this problem from the network standpoint is the presence of both simple and intelligent endpoints connected to the same network, each of which may require different commands to effectively and efficiently execute third-party call control.","Accordingly, what is needed is a communications network with the ability to discriminate between simple and intelligent endpoints to provide third-party call control services that are appropriate for each endpoint type.","In view of the foregoing, it would therefore be desirable to provide systems and methods that allow intelligent endpoints to effectively interact with networks having third-party call control features.","It would also be desirable to provide systems and methods that allow networks that provide third-party call control features to effectively interact with both intelligent and simple endpoints.","It would therefore be further desirable to provide systems and methods that allow a communications network to provide third-party call control features that discriminate between simple and intelligent endpoints and provide third-party call control features that are appropriate for each endpoint type.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide systems and methods that allow intelligent endpoints to effectively interact with networks having third-party call control features.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide systems and methods that allow networks that provide third-party call control features to effectively interact with both intelligent and simple endpoints.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide systems and methods that allow a communications network that provides third-party call control features to discriminate between simple and intelligent endpoints and to provide third-party call control features that are appropriate for each endpoint type.","These and other objects of the invention are provided in accordance with the principles of the present invention by providing third-party call control to simple and intelligent endpoints. The present invention may include a call controller for initiating third-party call control requests. The invention may also include an endpoint control manager for determining whether a remote endpoint is a simple endpoint or intelligent endpoint. The invention may further include an intelligent device manager for coordinating third-party call control requests from the call controller for endpoints determined to be intelligent by the endpoint control manager, and a simple device manager for coordinating third-party call control requests from the call controller for endpoints determined to be simple by the endpoint control manager.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","114","102","104","106","108","110","114","112"]},"In operation, controller , which may be any suitable request-processing device such as a computer or server, may communicate with endpoints  and  to request, initiate, control, and monitor voice and\/or data communications between the endpoints via network . For example, controller  may transmit session initiation requests to endpoints  and  (which may be any smart or simple electronic communications device such as a hard wired phone, a wireless phone, PDA, personal or network computer, etc.) via link  (generally within or part of network ) to schedule or request a communications session.","Such requests may be conveyed, at least in part, over network , which includes a network switching system preferably having known soft switching capabilities. Network  may also interface with various other external public or private networks such as the Internet, an intranet, a wireless network, or other communications network. Once a session request has been accepted by the endpoints, session setup and connection information, such as interconnection details, may be transferred to endpoints  and  via setup link  (also generally within or part of network ). The session requests may include polling of the endpoints  and  to determine if they are smart or simple endpoint types so the appropriate third-party call control commands or protocols are used. In some embodiments, links  and  may be integrated into a single communications path if desired (not shown).","Interconnection information may include information necessary to identify, initiate, and monitor a connection between user endpoints over a particular communications link  that will be used to transmit voice and\/or data information. It will be appreciated that link  may include or be comprised of conventional voice communications links such as traditional hardwired or wireless communications links that are intended to carry voice or multimedia information to and from the user endpoints, whereas links  and  may be separate from link  (and one another) and are preferably data links suitable to perform the scheduling and control tasks mentioned above. However, in alternate embodiments links , , and  may be substantially the same type of communication link.","System  may be used to allow third parties to initiate, monitor, and release calls between two other parties. For example, system  may be used in \u201cclick-to-dial\u201d applications wherein an external party, such as a customer logged onto a computer, may initiate voice communications between the customer and a sales representative of an e-commerce site from the customer's computer.","This may be accomplished, for example, by the customer clicking on a telephone link on a web page that causes controller  to setup and initiate a call between the customer's simple phone (e.g., endpoint ) and the sales representative's smart phone (e.g., endpoint ) via links  and . This task typically would include controller  scanning, polling, or otherwise determining (such as through a device identification, a database, or previously acquired information) the capabilities of each endpoint and subsequently scheduling and initiating the call using the appropriate techniques or commands known in the art based on the respective capabilities of each endpoint. Controller  may monitor the call in progress and provide the option to implement additional appropriate third-party call control features while the call is in progress.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","202","102","210","232","214","208","108","208","220","222","224","226","228","230"]},"It will be understood that although the elements within network  are depicted within close proximity of one another, these resources may be distributed remotely from one another throughout network  as needed by particular network configurations or as deemed appropriate by network engineers. There is no specific need to concentrate these resources in one particular area.","In , third-party call control may be initiated by call control server  issuing a third-party feature request over link  to endpoint control manager . Such requests may include commands that make a call from endpoint  to  over link , answer a call at endpoint , or release a call in progress at endpoint , etc.","After receiving the third-party feature request from server , endpoint control manager  may determine the endpoint type (smart, simple, or having certain specific capabilities, etc.) by polling endpoints  and  using one or both of device managers  and\/or . This determination may include any suitable method for ascertaining the capability of the endpoint such as polling, scanning, cross-referencing a database of device information, etc.","If the endpoint type is capable of receiving third-party call control feature requests of a particular type (e.g., make a call) then the request may be passed to the appropriate device manager, in this case intelligent device manager , for processing and execution. The appropriate command is then transmitted along link  to feature control engine  for execution by intelligent endpoint .","If, however, endpoint control manager  determines that the endpoint is a simple endpoint type, or cannot otherwise execute the issued third-party call control command, then endpoint control manager  may control the features through the feature control engine  that is associated with routing and control engine  and simple device manager .","Using the system described above, substantially similar features and functionality can be provided in the most appropriate way to both simple and intelligent communication devices. The determination of the capabilities of each device can be pre-configured in a database or dynamically determined at call time through a capability exchange protocol such as by polling or any other suitable method. The dynamic selection of an intelligent or simple control point for third-party call control allows the present invention to provide both efficient and effective control of endpoint communication devices with varying capabilities.","While a call is in progress, monitoring component  may monitor the calls and call states of endpoints  and  to determine the state of each endpoint and what call features may be possible or appropriate at any given time. Monitoring component  may periodically issue reports back to server  to provide the status of various endpoints connected to the network.","In some embodiments, call monitoring may be accomplished using device managers  and . In the embodiment shown in , however, monitoring tasks are preferably consolidated into a central point (i.e., monitoring component ) irrespective of where the third-party call control feature controller resides (e.g., managers  and ). One advantage of this type of arrangement is that message flow from the endpoints to the switching system is eliminated, which reduces the load on the switching system in network , thereby significantly improving system throughput and performance.","Server  may track the progress of calls and feature requests by correlating call and feature requests with certain system events or other indicia such as with feature request identification numbers (which may be unique for each feature request). Similarly, the signaling used for each call may also carry a unique identification number or other indicia to facilitate system management. In some embodiments, correlation of system features may involve using matching request call identification numbers. Moreover, when a call request requires the generation of a new call, the call identifier may be matched to the request identifier or may be derived from the request identifier, such that the call identifier is understood by monitor . For example, the call identifier may use the request identifier plus a fixed length random number selected by feature control engine .","Some of the steps involved in a third-party call control communication method according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention are illustrated in flow chart  shown in  and are described below.","At step , third-party call control may be initiated by call control server  issuing a third-party feature request to endpoint control manager . At step , after receiving the third-party feature request from server , endpoint control manager  may determine the endpoint type by polling endpoints  and  using the appropriate device managers ( or ).","At step  if the endpoint type is capable of receiving third-party call control feature requests of a particular type, the request may be passed to the appropriate device manager, in this case intelligent device manager , for processing. At step , feature control engine  may execute the request.","If, however, at step  it is determined that the endpoint is a simple endpoint type, then at step , endpoint control manager  may send third-party control feature requests through feature control engine . At step , feature control engine  along with routing and control engine  and simple device manager  may execute and coordinate the third-party control feature requests.","At step , with a call in progress, monitoring component  may monitor the calls and call states of endpoints  and\/or  to determine the state of each endpoint and what call features may be possible or appropriate at any given time. It will be appreciated that these steps are not intended to be comprehensive or necessarily performed in the order shown.","Thus, systems and methods for improved third-party call control for intelligent and simple endpoints are provided. Moreover, it will be understood that the foregoing is only illustrative of the principles of the invention and that various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, such embodiments will be recognized as within the scope of the present invention.","Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other than the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of illustration rather than of limitation and that the present invention is limited only by the claims that follow."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numbers refer to like parts throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
