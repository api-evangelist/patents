No. 60\/409,781 having a filing date of Sep. 11, 2002.","The present invention relates to hydroxyalkyl starch derivates, particularly hydroxyalkyl starch derivatives obtainable by a process in which hydroxyalkyl starch is reacted with a primary or secondary amino group of a linker compound. According to an especially preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to hydroxyalkyl starch derivatives obtainable by a process according to which hydroxyalkyl starch is reacted with a primary or secondary amino group of a linker compound and the resulting reaction product is reacted with a polypeptide, preferably with a glycoprotein and especially preferably with erythropoietin, via at least one other reactive group of the linker compound. A hydroxyalkyl starch which is especially preferred is hydroxyethyl starch. According to the present invention, the hydroxyalkyl starch and preferably the hydroxylethyl starch is reacted with the linker compound at its reducing end which is not oxidized prior to said reaction.","Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is a derivative of naturally occurring amylopectin and is degraded by alpha-amylase in the body. HES is a substituted derivative of the carbohydrate polymer amylopectin, which is present in corn starch at a concentration of up to 95% by weight. HES exhibits advantageous biological properties and is used as a blood volume replacement agent and in hemodilution therapy in the clinics (Sommermeyer et al., 1987, Krankenhauspharmazie, 8(8), 271-278; and Weidler et al., 1991, Arzneim.-Forschung\/Drug Res., 41, 494-498).","Amylopectin consists of glucose moieties, wherein in the main chain alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds are present and at the branching sites alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds are found. The physical-chemical properties of this molecule are mainly determined by the type of glycosidic bonds. Due to the nicked alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond, helical structures with about six glucose-monomers per turn are produced. The physico-chemical as well as the biochemical properties of the polymer can be modified via substitution. The introduction of a hydroxyethyl group can be achieved via alkaline hydroxyethylation. By adapting the reaction conditions it is possible to exploit the different reactivity of the respective hydroxy group in the unsubstituted glucose monomer with respect to a hydroxyethylation. Owing to this fact, the skilled person is able to influence the substitution pattern to a limited extent.","Some ways of producing a hydroxyethyl starch derivative are described in the art.","DE 26 16 086 discloses the conjugation of hemoglobin to hydroxyethyl starch wherein, in a first step, a cross-linking agent, e.g. bromocyane, is bound to hydroxyethyl starch and subsequently hemoglobin is linked to the intermediate product.","One important field in which HES is used is the stabilisation of polypeptides which are applied, e.g., to the circulatory system in order to obtain a particular physiological effect. One specific example of these polypeptides is erythropoietin, an acid glycoprotein of approximately 34,000 kD which is essential in regulating the level of red blood cells in the circulation.","A well-known problem with the application of polypeptides and enzymes is that these proteins often exhibit an unsatisfactory stability. Especially erythropoietin has a relatively short plasma half live (Spivak and Hogans, 1989, Blood 73, 90; McMahon et al., 1990, Blood 76, 1718). This means that therapeutic plasma levels are rapidly lost and repeated intravenous administrations must be carried out. Furthermore, in certain circumstances an immune response against the peptides is observed.","It is generally accepted that the stability of polypeptides can be improved and the immune response against these polypeptides is reduced when the polypeptides are coupled to polymeric molecules. WO 94\/28024 discloses that physiologically active polypeptides modified with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) exhibit reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity and circulate in the bloodstream considerably longer than unconjugated proteins, i.e. have a longer clearance rate. However, PEG-drug conjugates exhibit several disadvantages, e.g. they do not exhibit a natural structure which can be recognized by elements of in vivo degradation pathways. Therefore, apart from PEG-conjugates, other conjugates and protein polymerates have been produced. A plurality of methods for the cross-linking of different proteins and macromolecules such as polymerase have been described in the literature (see e.g. Wong, Chemistry of protein conjugation and cross-liking, 1993, CRCS, Inc.).","The HES-drug conjugates disclosed in the art suffer from the disadvantage that HES is not conjugated site-specifically to the drug. Consequently, the conjugation results in a very heterogenous product having many components that may be inactive due to the destruction of the 3-dimensional structure during the conjugation step. Therefore, there is a need for further improved HES-polypeptides conjugates with improved stability and\/or bioactivity.","One method of producing these conjugates uses, as starting material, an oxidized form of HES which is reacted with a crosslinking compound wherein the resulting product is reacted with a polypeptide or further modified and subsequently reacted with a polypeptide. It is a major disadvantage of this method that in a first step, the original HES has to be selectively oxidized, generally at its reducing end, by oxidizing the terminal aldehyde group and\/or hemiacetale group to a lactone, thus rendering the overall process more difficult and expensive.","WO 02\/08079 A2 discloses compounds comprising a conjugate of an active agent and a hydroxyalkyl starch wherein active agent and hydroxyalykl starch are either linked directly or via a linker compound. As far as the direct linkage is concerned, the reaction of active agent and hydroxyalkyl starch is carried out in an aqueous medium which comprises at least 10 wt.-% of water. No examples are given which are directed to a hydroxyalkyl starch derivative which is produced by reacting hydroxyalkyl starch at its reducing end with a crosslinking compound comprising the structure unit \u2014NH\u2014 in an aqueous medium. All examples are directed to hydroxyalkyl starch which is oxidized prior to a further reaction, the specific teaching of WO 02\/08079 A2 thus having the aformentioned disadvantages.","Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of producing a hydroxyalkyl starch derivative which allows for reacting hydroxyalkyl starch at its reducing end with a suitable compound wherein the reducing end of the starch is not oxidized prior to the reaction.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of producing a hydroxyalkyl starch derivative which allows for reacting hydroxyalkyl starch at its reducing end with a suitable compound wherein the reducing end of the starch is not oxidized prior to the reaction, said method being further characterized in that the reaction product of the reaction of hydroxyalkyl starch at its reducing end with a suitable compound is further reacted with at least one further compound.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a method as described above wherein the at least one further compound is a polypeptide, preferably a protein, more preferably erythropoietin.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a hydroxyalkyl starch derivative which is obtainable by a method as described above which comprises reacting hydroxyalkyl starch at its reducing end with a suitable compound wherein the reducing end of the starch is not oxidized prior to the reaction.","Therefore, the present invention relates to a method of producing a hydroxyalkyl starch derivative comprising reacting hydroxyalkyl starch (HAS) of formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"23.20mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US07815893-20101019-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"sub":["1","2 ","3 "]},"In the context of the present invention, the term \u201chydroxyalkyl starch\u201d (HAS) refers to a starch derivative which has been substituted by at least one hydroxyalkyl group.

According to a preferred embodiment, the at least one hydroxyalkyl group comprised HAS contains one hydroxy group.","The expression \u201chydroxyalkyl starch\u201d also includes derivatives wherein the alkyl group is mono- or polysubstituted. In this context, it is preferred that the alkyl group is substituted with a halogen, especially fluorine, or with an aryl group, provided that the HAS remains soluble in water. Furthermore, the terminal hydroxy group a of hydroxyalkyl group may be esterified or etherified.","Furthermore, instead of alkyl, also linear or branched substituted or unsubstituted alkene groups may be used.","Hydroxyalkyl starch is an ether derivative of starch. Besides of said ether derivatives, also other starch derivatives can be used in the context of the present invention. For example, derivatives are useful which comprise esterified hydroxy groups. These derivatives may be e.g. derivatives of unsubstituted mono- or dicarboxylic acids with 2-12 carbon atoms or of substituted derivatives thereof. Especially useful are derivatives of unsubstituted monocarboxylic acids with 2-6 carbon atoms, especially derivatives of acetic acid. In this context, acetyl starch, butyl starch and propyl starch are preferred.","Furthermore, derivatives of unsubstituted dicarboxylic acids with 2-6 carbon atoms are preferred.","In the case of derivatives of dicarboxylic acids, it is useful that the second carboxy group of the dicarboxylic acid is also esterified. Furthermore, derivatives of monoalkyl esters of dicarboxylic acids are also suitable in the context of the present invention.","For the substituted mono- or dicarboxylic acids, the substitute groups may be preferably the same as mentioned above for substituted alkyl residues.","Techniques for the esterification of starch are known in the art (see e.g. Klemm D. et al, Comprehensive Cellulose Chemistry Vol. 2, 1998, Whiley-VCH, Weinheim, N.Y., especially chapter 4.4, Esterification of Cellulose (ISBN 3-527-29489-9).","Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is most preferred for all embodiments of the present invention.","Therefore, the present invention also relates to a method as described above wherein the hydroxyalkyl starch is hydroxyethyl starch.","HES is mainly characterized by the molecular weight distribution and the degree of substitution. There are two possibilities of describing the substitution degree:\n\n","HES solutions are present as polydisperse compositions, wherein each molecule differs from the other with respect to the polymerisation degree, the number and pattern of branching sites, and the substitution pattern. HES is therefore a mixture of compounds with different molecular weight. Consequently, a particular HES solution is determined by average molecular weight with the help of statistical means. In this context, Mis calculated as the arithmetic mean depending on the number of molecules. Alternatively, M, the weight mean, represents a unit which depends on the mass of the HES.","In the context of the present invention, hydroxyethyl starch may have a mean molecular weight (weight mean) of from 1 to 300 kDa, wherein a mean molecular weight of from 5 to 100 kDa is more preferred. Hydroxyethyl starch can further exhibit a molar degree of substitution of from 0.1 to 0.8 and a ratio between C:Csubstitution in the range of from 2 to 20 with respect to the hydroxyethyl groups.","As far as the residues R, Rand Raccording to formula (I) are concerned there are no specific limitations given that compound (I) remains capable of being reacted with a compound according to formula (II).

Chemical or enzymatic methods for the removal of sialic acids are known in the art (Chaplin and Kennedy (eds.), 1996, Carbohydrate Analysis: a practical approach, especially Chapter 5 Montreuill, Glycoproteins, pages 175-177; IRL Press Practical approach series (ISBN 0-947946-44-3)).","Therefore, the present invention also relates to a method as described above wherein the reaction product of compound (I) and compound (II) is reacted with the polypeptide via an oxidized carbohydrate moiety comprised in the polypeptide.","According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the functional group of the polypeptide is the thio group.

Moreover, it is possible to introduce a thio group into the polyeptide according to a suitbale method. Among others, chemical methods may be mentioned. If a disulfide bridge is present in the polypeptide, it is possible to reduce the \u2014S\u2014S\u2014 structure to get a thio group. It is also possible to transform an amino group present in the polypeptide into a SH group by reaction the polypeptide via the amino group with a compound which has at least two different functional groups, one of which is capable of being reacted with the amino group and the other is an SH group or a precursor of an SH group. This modification of an amino group may be regarded as an example where the protein is first reacted with a compound (L) which has at least two different functional groups, one of which is capable of being reacted with the amino group and the other is an SH group, and the resulting reaction product is then reacted with, e.g., a HAS derivative comprising HAS and a compound (D), said derivative comprising a functional group being capable of reacting with the SH group. It is also possible to introduce an SH group by mutation of the polypeptide such as by introducing a cystein or a suitable SH functional amino acid into the polypeptide or such as removing a cystein from the polypeptide so as to disable another cystein in the polypeptide to form a disulfide bridge.","In the context of this embodiment, it is particularly preferred to react the polypeptide with a reaction product which results from the reaction of the reaction product of compounds (I) and (II) with a crosslinking compound.","Therefore, the present invention also relates to a method as described above wherein the reaction product of compound (I) and compound (II) is reacted with a crosslinking compound and the resulting reaction product is further is reacted with the polypeptide via an oxidized carbohydrate moiety and\/or a thio group comprised in the polypeptide.","As an especially preferred polypeptide, erythropoietin (EPO) is used.","Therefore, the present invention also relates to a method as described above wherein the polypeptide is erythropoietin.","The EPO can be of any human (see e.g. Inoue, Wada, Takeuchi, 1994, An improved method for the purification of human erythropoietin with high in vivo activity from the urine of anemic patients, Biol.

This is mainly due to the fact that this hydroxyalkyl starch derivative is less or even not recognized by the removal systems of the liver and kidney and therefore persists in the circulatory system for a longer period of time. Furthermore, since the HAS is attached site-specifically, the risk of destroying the in-vivo biological activity of EPO by conjugation of HAS to EPO is minimized.","The HAS-EPO conjugate of the invention may exhibit essentially the same in-vitro biological activity as recombinant native EPO, since the in-vitro biological activity only measures binding affinity to the EPO receptor. Methods for determining the in-vitro biological activity are known in the art.","Furthermore, the HAS-EPO exhibits a greater in-vivo activity than the EPO used as a starting material for conjugation (unconjugated EPO). Methods for determining the in vivo biological activity are known in the art.","The HAS-EPO conjugate may exhibit an in vivo activity of from 110% to 300%, preferably from 110% to 200%, more preferably from 110% to 180% or from 110 to 150%, most preferably from 110% to 140%, if the in-vivo activity of the unconjugated EPO is set as 100%.","Compared to the highly sialylated EPO of Amgen (see EP 428 267 B1), the HAS-EPO exhibits preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 85% or at least 95%, at least 150%, at least 200% or at least 300% of the in vivo activity of the highly sialylated EPO if the in-vivo activity of highly sialylated EPO is set as 100%. Most preferably, it exhibits at least 95% of the in vivo activity of the highly sialylated EPO.","The high in-vivo biological activity of the HAS-EPO conjugate of the invention mainly results from the fact that the HAS-EPO conjugate remains longer in the circulation than the unconjugated EPO because it is less recognized by the removal systems of the liver and because renal clearance is reduced due to the higher molecular weight. Methods for the determination of the in-vivo half life time of EPO in the circulation are known in the art (Sytkowski, Lunn, Davis, Feldman, Siekman, 1998, Human erythropoietin dimers with markedly enhanced in vivo activity, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95(3), 11848).","Consequently, it is a great advantage of the present invention that a HAS-EPO conjugate is provided which may be administered less frequently than the EPO preparations commercially available at present While standard EPO preparations have to be administered at least every 3 days, the HAS-EPO conjugate of the invention is preferable administered twice a week, more preferably once a week.","Furthermore, the method of the invention has the advantage that an effective EPO derivative can be produced at reduced costs since the method does not comprise extensive and time consuming purification steps resulting in low final yield, e.g. it is not necessary to purify away under-sialylated EPO forms which are known to exhibit low or no in-vivo biological activity.","Furthermore, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising, in a therapeutically effective amount, the HAS-polypeptide conjugate, preferably the HAS-EPO conjugate, more preferably the HES-EPO conjugate of the present invention.

Based on carbohydrate structural analysis the modifications introduced did not affect the structural integrity of the core oligosaccharide chains since MALDI\/TOF-MS of the mild acid treated HES-modified glycans revealed intact neutral N-acetyllactosamine-type chains which were indistinguishable from those observed in unmodified EPO product. The results obtained indicate that at least 3 modified HES-residues are attached per EPO molecule in the case of the EPO preparation which was subjected to modification without prior partial sialic acid removal. An EPO variant lacking about 50% of the sialic acid residues of the former protein showed a similar apparent high molecular weight mobility in SDS-PAGE (60-110 KDa vs 40 KDa for the BRP EPO standard). The HES modified EPO is stable under standard ion-exchange chromatography conditions at room temperature at pH 3-10.","The EPO-bioassay in the normocythaemic mouse system indicates that the HES-modified EPO has 2.5-3.0 fold higher specific activity (IU\/mg) in this assay when compared to the International BRP EPO reference standard based on protein determination using the UV absorption value from the European Pharmacopeia and an RP-HPLC EPO protein determination method calibrated against the BRP EPO standard preparation","(a) Liberation of N-Linked Oligosaccharides by Digestion with N-Glycosidase","Samples were incubated with 25 units (according to manufacturer's specification, Roche Diagnostics, Germany) of recombinant PNGase F over night at 37\u00b0 C. Complete digestion was monitored by the specific mobility shift of the protein in SDS-PAGE. The released N-glycans were separated from the polypeptide by addition of 3 volumes of cold 100% ethanol and incubation at \u221220\u00b0 C. for at least 2 hours (Schroeter S et al., 1999). The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. at 13000 rpm. The pellet was then subjected to two additional washes with 500 \u03bcl of ice-cold 75% ethanol. The oligosaccharides in the pooled supernatants were dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Speed Vac concentrator, Savant Instruments Inc., USA). The glycan samples were desalted using Hypercarb cartridges (25 mg or 100 mg of HyperCarb) as follows prior to use: the columns were washed with 3\u00d7500 \u03bcl of 80% acetonitrile (v\/v) in 0.1% TFA followed by washes with 3\u00d7500 \u03bcl of water. The samples were diluted with water to a final volume of 300 \u03bcl-600 \u03bcl before loading onto the cartridge which then was rigorously washed with water. Oligosaccharides were eluted with 1.2 ml (25 mg cartridges; 1.8 ml in the case of 100 mg cartridges) 25% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v\/v). The eluted oligosaccharides were neutralized with 2 M NHOH and were dried in a Speed Vac concentrator. In some cases desalting of N-glycosidase released oligosaccharides was performed by adsorption of the digestion mixture from samples <100 \u03bcg of total (glyco)protein onto 100 mg Hypercarb cartridges.","(b) Analysis of Oligosaccharides by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption\/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass-Spectrometry (MALDI\/TOF\/TOF-MS)","A Bruker ULITRAFLEX time-of-flight (TOF\/TOF) instrument was used: native desialylated oligosaccharides were analyzed using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as UV-absorbing material in the positive as well as in the negative ion mode using the reflectron in both cases. For MS-MS analyses, selected parent ions were subjected to laser induced dissociation (LID) and the resulting fragment ions separated by the second TOF stage (LIFT) of the instrument Sample solutions of 1 \u03bcl and an approximate concentration of 1-10 pmol\u00b7\u03bclwere mixed with equal amounts of the respective matrix. This mixture was spotted onto a stainless steel target and dried at room temperature before analysis.","EPO was expressed from recombinant CHO cells as described (Mueller P P et al., 1999, Dorner A J et al., 1984) and the preparations were characterized according to methods described in the Eur. Phar. (42002:1316). The final product had a sialic acid content of 12 nMol (+\/\u2212 1.5 nMol) per nMol of protein. The structures of N-linked oligosaccharides were determined by HPAEC-PAD and by MALDI\/TOF-MS as described. (Nimtz et al., 1999, Grabenhorst, 1999). The EPO preparations that were obtained contained di-, tri- and tetrasialylated oligosaccharides (2-12%, 15-28% and 60-80%, respectively, sulphated and pentasialylated chains were present in small amounts). The overall glycosylation characteristics of EPO preparations were similar to that of the international BRP EPO standard preparation.","The isoelectric focusing pattern of the recombinant EPO was comparable to that of the international BRP Reference EPO standard preparation showing the corresponding isoforms. 25% of the EPO protein lacked O-glycosylation at Serof the polypeptide chain.","EPO GT-1 protein (2.84 mg\/ml) was heated to 80\u00b0 C. in 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and then 100 \u03bcl of 1 N HSOwas added per 1 ml of the EPO solution; incubation was continued for 5 min, 10 min and 60 min, respectively, yielding EPO preparations of different degree of sialylation. Quantitation of oligosaccharides with 0-4 sialic acids was performed after liberation of oligosaccharides with polypeptide N-glycosidase and isolation of N-linked chains was performed by desalting using Hypercarb cartridges (25 mg HyperSep Hypercarb; ThermoHypersil-Keystone, UK). EPO preparations were neutralized by addition of 1 N NaOH and were frozen in liquid Nand were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further use.","To 10 mg of untreated or mild acid treated EPO dissolved in 3.5 ml of 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.0 was added 1.5 ml of 0.1 M Na-acetate buffer pH 5.5 and the mixture was cooled to 0\u00b0 C. in an ice-bath; 500 \u03bcl of 10 mM Na-periodate was added and the reaction mixture was kept in the dark for 60 min at 0\u00b0 C. Then 10 \u03bcl of glycerol was added and incubation was continued for further 10 min in the dark. The partially oxidized EPO forms were separated from reagents by desalting using VIVASPIN concentrators (10,000 MWCO, PES Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany) according to manufacturer's recommendation at 3000 rpm in a laboratory centrifuge equipped with a fixed angle rotor. After freezing in liquid nitrogen the EPO preparations were stored in a final volume of 4 ml at \u221220\u00b0 C.","100 \u03bcg aliquots of the partially oxidized EPO preparation were subjected to N-glycosidase treatment and oligosaccharides were isolated using Hypercarb cartridges as described. Oligosaccharides were desialylated by mild acid treatment and were analyzed by HPAEC-PAD and their retention times were compared to those of authentic standard oligosaccharides as described (Nimtz et al., 1990 and 1993).","5 mg of EPO-GT-1 was incubated in 5 ml of 0.1 M Tris\/HCl buffer pH 8.1 in the presence of 30 mM dithioerythreitol (DTT) at 37\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes; removal of DTT was achieved by using a Vivaspin concentrator at 4\u00b0 C., 4 cycles of buffer exchange. The final reduced EPO preparation was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. in 50 mM Na-acetate buffer pH 5.5.","Quantitative determination of EPO protein was performed by measuring UV absorption at 280 nm according to the Eur. Phar. (European Pharmacopeia 4, Monography January 2002: 1316: erythropoietin concentrated solution) in a cuvette with 1 cm path length. In addition, EPO was quantitated by applying a RP-HPLC method using a RP-C4 column (Vydac Protein C4, Cat.# 214TP5410, Grace Vydac, Ca, US); the HPLC method was calibrated using the erythropoietin BRP 1 reference standard (European Pharmacopeia, Conseil de l'Europe B.P. 907-F67029, Strasbourg Cedex 1).","4.485 mg of completely desialylated EPO was incubated in 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 6.8 in the presence of 16 \u03bcl catalase (6214 units\/200 ml) and 80 \u03bcl of galactose oxidase (2250 units\/ml from Dactyliuni dendiroides (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany); incubation at 37\u00b0 C. was over night; 2 times 20 \u03bcl of galactose oxidase was added after 4 hours and after 8 hours after starting of the incubation.","Purification of EPO Front Incubations of Periodate- or Galactose-Oxidase-Oxidized EPO Protein Preparations with Activated HES","Purification of EPO samples (removal of unreacted HES derivatives) was carried out at room temperature. The EPO incubation mixtures (approximately 5 mg of EPO protein) were diluted 1:10 with buffer A (20 mM N-morpholine propane sulfonic acid [MOPS\/NaOH] in HO bidest, pH 8.0) and were applied to a column containing 3 ml Q-Sepharose HP (Pharmacia Code no. 17-1014-03, Lot no. 220211) equilibrated with 10 column volumes (CV) of buffer A by using a flow rate of 0.5 ml\/min. The column was washed with 6-8 CV of buffer A (flow rate=0.8 ml\/min) and elution was performed by using buffer B (20 mM morpholine ethane sulfonic acid [MES\/NaOH], 0.5 M NaCl in HO bidest, pH 6.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml\/min. EPO was detected by UV absorption at 280 nm and eluted in about 6 ml. The column was regenerated by using 3 CV of buffer C (20 mM MES, 1.5 M NaCl in HO adjusted to pH 6.5) and was re-equilibrated by using 10 CV of buffer A (flow rate 0.7 ml\/min).","Buffer exchange of EPO eluates obtained from the Q-Sepharose step was performed using Vivaspin concentrators and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with each 3 centrifugation cycles per sample; samples were adjusted to 2 ml with PBS and were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C.","Only <25% of the partially desialylated and subsequently mild periodate oxidized EPO forms that were subjected to HES-modification were obtained from the Q-Sepharose eluate since under the conditions employed the basic EPO forms did not bind Q-Sepharose and were found in the flow-through together with nonreacted HES derivatives.","Purified native and desialylated oligosaccharides were analyzed by high-pH anion-exchange (HPAE) chromatography using a Dionex BioLC system (Dionex, USA) equipped with a CarboPac PA1 column (0.4\u00d725 cm) in combination with a pulsed amperometric detector (PAD) (Schr\u00f6ter et al., 1999; Nimtz et al., 1999). Detector potentials (E) and pulse durations M were: E1: +50 mV, T1: 480 ms; E2: +500 mV, T2: 120 ms; E3: \u2212500 mV, T3: 60 ms, and the output range was 500-1500 nA. The oligosaccharides were then injected onto the CarboPac PA1 column which was equilibrated with 100% solvent A. For desialylated oligosaccharides elution (flow rate: 1 ml\u00b7min) was performed by applying a linear gradient (0-20%) of solvent B over a period of 40 min followed by a linear increase from 20-100% solvent B over 5 min. Solvent A was 0.2 M NaOH in bidistilled HO, solvent B consisted of 0.6 M NaOAc in solvent A. For native oligosaccharides the column was equilibrated with 100% solvent C (0.1 M NaOH in bidistilled HO) and elution (flow rate: 1 ml\u00b7min) was performed by applying a linear gradient (0-35%) of solvent D over a period of 48 min followed by a linear increase from 35-100% solvent D over 10 min. Solvent D consisted of 0.6 M NaAc in solvent C.","Monosaccharides were analyzed as the corresponding methyl glycosides after methanolysis, N-reacetylation and trimethylsilylation by GC\/MS [Chaplin, M. F. (1982) A rapid and sensitive method for the analysis of carbohydrate. 123, 336-341]. The analyses were performed on a Finnigan GCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT corp., San Jose, Calif.) running in the positive ion-E1-mode equipped with a 30 m DB5 capillary column. Temperature program: 2 min isotherm at 80\u00b0 C., then 10 degrees minto 300\u00b0 C.","Monosaccharides were identified by their retention time and characteristic fragmentation pattern. The uncorrected results of electronic peak integration were used for quantification. Monosaccharides yielding more than one peak due to anomericity and\/or the presence of furanoid and pyranoid forms were quantified by adding all major peaks. 0.5 \u03bcg of myo-inositol was used as an internal standard compound.","EPO-GT-1 preparations subjected to mild acid treatment for 5, 10 or 60 mL were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after liberation of N-linked oligosaccharides by incubation with N-glycosidase as shown in . N-linked oligosaccharides were subjected to HPAEC-PAD oligosaccharide mapping (). The untreated EPO-GT-1 contained >90% of N-linked oligosaccharides with 3 or 4 sialic acid residues whereas after 5 min. of incubation in the presence of mild acid <40% of carbohydrate chains had 3 or 4 sialic acid residues. HPAEC-PAD of the desialylated N-glycans revealed that the ratio of neutral oligosaccharides that were detected for the untreated EPO-GT-1 and remained stable in the preparations subjected to acid treatment for 5, 10 or 60 min. MALDI\/TOF-MS of the desialylated glycans revealed that <90% of the proximal fucose was present after mild acid treatment of the protein.","SDS-PAGE mobility of mild periodate treated EPO forms that were previously subjected to a 5 and 10 minute treatment with acid or were not treated are compared in . The conditions used for periodate oxidation of sialic acids did not change the SDS-PAGE pattern of EPO preparations (compare ). Oxidation of sialic acids resulted in a shift of oligosaccharides in HPAEC-PAD analysis to earlier elution times (compare ).","(aa) Time Course of HES Modification of EPO-GT-1-A with Hydroxylamine-Modified HES Derivative X, Produced According to Example 2.4","400 \u03bcg of hydroxylamine-modified HES derivative X was added to 20 \u03bcg of EPO-GT-1-A (mild periodate oxidized EPO, not acid hydrolyzed prior to mild periodate oxidation) in 20 \u03bcL of 0.5 M NaOAc buffer pH 5.5 and the reaction was stopped after 30 min, 2, 4, and 17 hours, respectively, by freezing samples in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further analysis.","SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and the samples were heated to 90\u00b0 C. and applied onto SDS-gels. As shown in , increasing incubation times resulted in an increased shift towards higher molecular weight of the protein. After 17 hours of incubation in the presence of the hydroxylamine-modified HES derivative X a diffuse Coomassie stained protein band was detected migrating in an area between 60 and 11 KDa, based on the position of molecular weight standards (see left part of ). Upon treatment with N-glycosidase most of the protein was shifted towards the position of de--glycosylated EPO (see , right gel; arrow A indicates migration position of N-glycosidase, arrow B indicates migration position of de-N-glycosylated EPO; the diffuse protein band visible in the region between the 28 KDa and 36 KDa molecular weight standards presumably represents EPO-forms which are modified by HES and the O-glycosylation site of the molecule. In view of the specificity of N-glycosidase we conclude from this result that in fact HES-modification occurs at the periodate oxidized sialic acid residues of glycans of the EPO protein.","(bb) Characterization of HES-EPO Conjugates","HES-EPO conjugates I (originating from EPO-GT-1 after mild periodate oxidation, i.e. from EPO-GT-1-A), II (resulting from EPO-GT-1 subjected to 5 min acid hydrolysis and Mild periodate oxidation), m (resulting from EPO-GT-1 subjected to 10 min acid hydrolysis and mild periodate oxidation) were synthesized as described before. A control incubation (K) was included containing unmodified EPO-GT-1 under the same buffer conditions to which an equivalent amount of unmodified HES was added. The incubation mixtures were subjected to further purification for subsequent biochemical analysis of the HES-EPO derivatives.","Incubations HES-EPO conjugates I, II and III as well as the control incubation K were subjected to a Q-Sepharose purification step as described under \u201cMaterial and Methods\u201d (Example 7.8) in order to remove the excess of nonreacted HES-reagent which was expected in flow through of the ion-exchange column. Due to the high amounts of basic EPO forms contained in previously acid treated samples II and III we expected considerable amounts of modified EPO product from these incubations in the flow through. As is shown in , almost all of the EPO material from samples I was retained by Q-Sepharose column whereas only approximately 20-30% of the samples III and II was recovered in the fraction eluting with high salt concentration. All of the protein material from the incubations with HES derivative X, both in the flow-through and the fractions eluting with high salt, had apparent higher molecular weight in SDS-PAGE when compared to the control EPO.","In order to characterize in more detail the HES-modified EPO sample A and K (see ) were compared to periodate oxidized form EPO-GT-1-A. The samples were subjected to N-glycosidase treatment and as is depicted in and the release of N-glycans resulted in the two low molecular weight bands at the position of the O-glycosylated and nonglycosylated EPO forms of the standard EPO preparation. In the case of sample A a further band migrating at the position of the 28 KDa mw standard was detected suggesting HES-modification at the O-glycan of this EPO variant (cf. Example 7.11(c)(aa)). This band (and also the heavily HES-modified high mw form of N-glycosylated EPO, see and ) disappeared after subjecting the samples to mild hydrolysis which is in agreement with the view that HES modification was achieved at the periodate oxidised sialic acid residues of erythropoietin.","Aliquots of the N-glycosidase incubation mixtures were hydrolyzed using conditions enabling the complete removal of sialic acids residues (and also the sialic acid linked HES derivative) from oligosaccharides; after neutralization, the mixtures were then absorbed onto small Hypercarb columns for their desalting. The columns were washed rigorously with water followed by elution of bound neutral oligosaccharides with 40% acetonitile in HO containing 0.1% of trifuloacetic acid. The resulting oligosaccharides were subjected to MALDI\/TOF-MS. The spectra of the desialylated oligosaccharide fractions from sample A, EPO-GT-1-A and sample K showed identical masses for complex type oligosaccharides at m\/z=1810 Da (diantennary), 2175=triantennary, 2540=tetraantennary, 2906=tetraantennary plus 1 N-acetyllactosamine repeat and 3271=tetraantennary plus 2 N-acetyllactosamine repeats; small signals corresponding to lack of fucose (\u2212146) and galactose (minus 162) were detected which are attributable to the acid hydrolysis conditions applied for sialic acid removal (see MALDI\u2014Figures 15, 16 and 17).","In a parallel experiment the N-glycosidase digestion mixture was absorbed onto 1 ml RP-C18 cartridge (without prior acid hydrolysis of oligosaccharides) and elution was performed with 5% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% TFA; under these conditions the EPO protein was completely retained onto the RP-material and oligosaccharides were washed off from the column with 5% acetonitrile in HO containing 0.1% TFA. The de-N-glycosylated EPO protein was eluted with 70% acetonitrile in HO containing 0.1% TFA. The oligosaccharide fractions from the RP-C18 step of N-glycosidase-treated sample A, EPO GT-1-A and sample K were neutralized and subjected to desalting using Hypercarb cartridges as described before. The isolated oligosaccharides were subjected to HPAEC-PAD mapping before (see ) and after mild acid treatment under conditions which enabled quantitative removal of sialic acids from glycans (see ).","The HPAEC-PAD profile for the native material obtained from the HES-modified sample A showed only neglectable signals for oligosaccharides whereas EPO GT-1-A-derived oligosaccharides exhibited the same glycan profile as the one shown in  (sample named EPO-GT-1 after mild periodate treatment). The elution profile of oligosaccharides obtained from the control EPO sample (K) yielded the expected pattern (compare profile in ). For comparison, the native oligosaccharide profile of the international BRP-EPO standard is included for comparison and as reference standard.","After mild acid hydrolysis, all oligosaccharide preparations showed an identical elution profile of neutral oligosaccharide structures (see ) with the expected qualitative and quantitative compositon of di-, tri- and tetraantennary complex-type carbohydrate chains as described in the methods section for the EPO preparation which was used as a starting material in the present study. This result demonstrates that the HES-modification of the EPO sample results in a covalent linkage of the HES derivative which is detached from the EPO-protein by N-glycosidase and is acid-labile since it is removed from the N-glycans using mild acid treatment conditions known to desialylate carbohydrates (see ).","(cc) Monosaccharide Compositional Analysis of HES-EPO and HES-EPO N-Glycans by GC-MS","In order to further confirm HES-modification of EPO at the N-glycans of the molecule, EPO samples were digested with N-glycosidase and the EPO protein was adsorbed onto RP-C18 cartridges whereas oligosaccharide material was washed off as described above. As shown in Table 2, glucose and hydroxyethylated glucose derivatives were detected only in the EPO protein which was subjected to HES-modification at cysteine residues and in oligosaccharide fractions of EPO sample A2.","The EPO-bioassay in the normocythaemic mouse system indicates was performed according to the procedures described in the European Pharmacopeia; the laboratory that carried out the EPO assay was using the International BRP EPO reference standard preparation. For the HES-modified EPO A2 preparation a mean value for the specific activity of 294,600 units per mg EPO of protein was determined indicating an approximately 3-fold higher specific activity when compared to the International BRP EPO reference standard preparation that was included in the samples sent for activity assays.","The results of the study are summarized in Table
