No. 61\/535,589, filed Sep. 16, 2011.","The Renal Outer Medullary Potassium (ROMK) channel (Kir1.1) (see e.g., Ho, K., et al., -, Nature, 1993, 362(6415): p. 31-8.1, 2; and Shuck, M. E., et al., -, J Biol Chem, 1994, 269(39): p. 24261-70) is a member of the inward rectifier family of potassium channels expressed in two regions of the kidney: thick ascending loop of Henle (TALH) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) (see Hebert, S. C., et al., , Physiol Rev, 2005, 85(1): p. 319-713). At the TALH, ROMK participates in potassium recycling across the luminal membrane which is critical for the function of the Na\/K\/2Clco-transporter, the rate-determining step for salt reuptake in this part of the nephron. At the CCD, ROMK provides a pathway for potassium secretion that is tightly coupled to sodium uptake through the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (see Reinalter, S. C., et al., -, Acta Physiol Scand, 2004, 181(4): p. 513-21; and Wang, W., , Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens, 2004, 13(5): p. 549-55). Selective inhibitors of the ROMK channel (also referred to herein as inhibitors of ROMK or ROMK inhibitors) are predicted to represent novel diuretics for the treatment of hypertension and other conditions where treatment with a diuretic would be beneficial with potentially reduced liabilities (i.e., hypo- or hyperkalemia, new onset of diabetes, dyslipidemia) over the currently used clinical agents (see Lifton, R. P., A. G. Gharavi, and D. S. Geller, , Cell, 2001, 104(4): p. 545-56). Human genetics (Ji, W., et al., , Nat Genet, 2008, 40(5): p. 592-9; and Tobin, M. D., et al., , Hypertension, 2008, 51(6): p. 1658-64) and genetic ablation of ROMK in rodents (see Lorenz, J. N., et al., , J Biol Chem, 2002, 277(40): p. 37871-80 and Lu, M., et al., () () , J Biol Chem, 2002, 277(40): p. 37881-7) support these expectations. To our knowledge, the first small molecule selective inhibitors of ROMK were reported from work done at Vanderbilt University as described in Lewis, L. M., et al., --7.1, Mol Pharmacol, 2009, 76 (5): p. 1094-1103.","One object of the present invention is to provide compounds of Formula

hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. Commonly used abbreviations for alkyl groups are used throughout the specification. For example the term \u201cCalkyl\u201d (or \u201cC-Calkyl\u201d), means linear or branched chain alkyl groups, including all isomers, having the specified number of carbon atoms and includes all of the hexyl and pentyl isomers as well as n-, iso-, sec- and tert-butyl (butyl, s-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl; Bu=butyl), n- and i-propyl (Pr=propyl), ethyl (Et) and methyl (Me).","\u201cCycloalkyl\u201d is a cyclized alkyl ring having the indicated number of carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The cycloalkyl ring may be substituted on any available carbon which results in the creation of a stable structure, including the ring carbon which serves as the point of attachment to the rest of the molecule.","In some instances the number of substituents which may be optionally present on a moiety is specified, for example but not limited to, 1 to 3 of \u2014F (fluoro). For example, an alkyl group that can be optionally substituted with 1-3 of \u2014F includes, but is not limited to, \u2014CH, \u2014CHF, \u2014CHF, \u2014CF, \u2014CHCH, \u2014CH\u2014CHF, \u2014CH\u2014CHF, \u2014CHF\u2014CHF, \u2014CHCF, \u2014CHF\u2014CHF, \u2014(CH)CH, \u2014CH(CF)\u2014CH, \u2014(CH)\u2014CF, \u2014(CH)CH(CF)CH, and \u2014(CH)\u2014CF, as appropriate for the defined number of carbon atoms for the given alkyl group.","Halo or halogen refers to \u2014F (fluoro), \u2014Cl (chloro), \u2014Br (bromo) and \u2014I (iodo). In one embodiment, halogens are \u2014F and \u2014Cl.","The term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d, alone or in combination, means six-membered aromatic rings containing one to four nitrogen atoms; benzofused six-membered aromatic rings containing one to three nitrogen atoms; five-membered aromatic rings containing one oxygen, one nitrogen or one sulfur atom; benzofused five-membered aromatic rings containing one oxygen, one nitrogen or one sulfur atom; five-membered aromatic rings containing two heteroatoms independently selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur and benzofused derivatives of such rings; five-membered aromatic rings containing three nitrogen atoms and benzofused derivatives thereof; a tetrazolyl ring; a thiazinyl ring; or coumarinyl. Examples of such ring systems are furanyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, indolyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, imidazolyl, triazinyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, benzothienyl, quinazolinyl and quinoxalinyl.","Unless expressly depicted or described otherwise, variables depicted in a structural formula with a \u201cfloating\u201d bond, such as each of substituents R, R, Rand R, are permitted on any available carbon atom in the ring to which each is attached.","The image \u201c\u201d, when present in a ring, represents a single, double or aromatic bond.","The present invention encompasses all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I. Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of Formula I can all independently of one another have (R) configuration or (S) configuration. When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the structural Formulas of the invention, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the Formula. Similarly, when a compound name is recited without a chiral designation for a chiral carbon, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence individual enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced by the name. The production of specific stereoisomers or mixtures thereof may be identified in the Examples where such stereoisomers or mixtures were obtained, but this in no way limits the inclusion of all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof from being within the scope of this invention.","The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for example mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, in all ratios. Thus, enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis\/trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture by customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of Formula I or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Where compounds of this invention are capable of tautomerization, all individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are included in the scope of this invention. The present invention includes all such isomers, as well as salts, solvates (including hydrates) and solvated salts of such racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers and tautomers and mixtures thereof.","Reference to the compounds of this invention as those of a specific formula or embodiment, e.g., Formula I or any other generic structural formula or specific compound described or claimed herein, is intended to encompass the specific compound or compounds falling within the scope of the formula or embodiment, including salts thereof, particularly pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates of such compounds and solvated salt forms thereof, where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.","In the compounds of Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (H) and deuterium (H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and\/or intermediates.","When the compounds of Formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups the invention also includes the corresponding physiologically or toxicologically acceptable salts, in particular the pharmaceutically utilizable salts. Thus, the compounds of Formula I which contain acidic groups can be used according to the invention, for example, as alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or as ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include but are not limited to sodium salts, potassium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as, for example, ethylamine, ethanolamine, triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of Formula I which contain one or more basic groups, i.e. groups which can be protonated, can be used according to the invention in the form of their acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids as, for example but not limited to, salts with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acids, oxalic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, sulfaminic acid, phenylpropionic acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, isonicotinic acid, citric acid, adipic acid, etc. If the compounds of Formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule the invention also includes, in addition to the salt forms mentioned, inner salts or betaines (zwitterions). Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula I by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula I which, owing to low physiological compatibility, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of physiologically (i.e., pharmaceutically) acceptable salts.","Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may exist in amorphous form and\/or one or more crystalline forms, and as such all amorphous and crystalline forms and mixtures thereof of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water (i.e., a hydrate) or common organic solvents. Such solvates and hydrates, particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates, of the instant compounds are likewise encompassed within the scope of this invention, along with un-solvated and anhydrous forms.","Any pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug modification of a compound of this invention which results in conversion in vivo to a compound within the scope of this invention is also within the scope of this invention. For example, esters can optionally be made by esterification of an available carboxylic acid group or by formation of an ester on an available hydroxy group in a compound. Similarly, labile amides can be made. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters or amides of the compounds of this invention may be prepared to act as pro-drugs which can be hydrolyzed back to an acid (or \u2014COOdepending on the pH of the fluid or tissue where conversion takes place) or hydroxy form particularly in vivo and as such are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug modifications include, but are not limited to, \u2014Calkyl esters and \u2014Calkyl substituted with phenyl esters.","Accordingly, the compounds within the generic structural formulas, embodiments and specific compounds described and claimed herein encompass salts, all possible stereoisomers and tautomers, physical forms (e.g., amorphous and crystalline forms), solvate and hydrate forms thereof and any combination of these forms, as well as the salts thereof, pro-drug forms thereof, and salts of pro-drug forms thereof, where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.","The compounds of Formula I according to the invention are inhibitors of ROMK, and are therefore useful as diuretic and\/or natriuretic agents. ROMK inhibitors help to increase urination and increase urine volume and also to prevent or reduce reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. Therefore, the compounds are useful for treatment or prophylaxis of disorders that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium from the body. Accordingly, an object of the instant invention is to provide a method for inhibiting ROMK comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a ROMK-inhibitory effective amount to a patient in need thereof. The inhibition of ROMK by the compounds of Formula I can be examined, for example, in any of the activity assays described below. Another object is to provide a method for causing diuresis, natriuresis or both, comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need thereof.","Due to their activity as diuretics and natriuretic agents, this invention further provides the use of compounds of Formula I in methods for treatment of, prevention of or reduction of risk for developing medical conditions that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium, such as but not limited to one or more of hypertension, heart failure (both acute and chronic, also known as congestive heart failure) and\/or other conditions resulting from excessive salt and water retention. Compounds of Formula I are useful for treating both primary (essential) and secondary hypertension. Hypertensive conditions include, but are not limited to, systolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, diastolic hypertension, isolated diastolic hypertension, renovascular hypertension, endocrine disorder hypertension (including hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma), malignant hypertension, resistant hypertension, hypertension in obesity\/diabetes\/metabolic syndrome, hypertension in heart failure, hypertension in pregnancy, and accelerated hypertension, and prehypertension associated with any of these conditions. It further includes the use of the compounds of Formula I in methods for treatment of, prevention of or reduction of risk for developing one or more disorders such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), cardiovascular disease, diabetes, endothelial dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, stable and unstable angina pectoris, thromboses, restenosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac insufficiency, pulmonary hypertonia, atherosclerosis, hepatic cirrhosis, ascitis, pre-eclampsia, cerebral edema, nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome, acute and chronic kidney insufficiency, hypercalcemia, Dent's disease, Meniere's disease, edetamous states, and other conditions for which a diuretic would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. The compounds of the invention can be administered to a patient having, or at risk of having, one or more conditions for which a diuretic would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit such as those described herein.","In general, compounds that are ROMK inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which, when tested, have an ICof 5 \u03bcM or less, preferably 1 \u03bcM or less, and more preferably 0.25 \u03bcM or less, in at least one of the following assays: 1) the RbEfflux Assay, 2) the Thallium Flux Assay, 3) the Electrophysiology Assay. These assays are described in more detail further below.","The dosage amount of the compound to be administered depends on the individual case and is, as is customary, to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus, it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated, and also on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used, on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic, or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of Formula I. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the compound will be administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient, including a course of therapy lasting days, months, years or the life of the patient.","In general, a daily dose of approximately 0.001 to 100 mg\/kg, preferably 0.001 to 30 mg\/kg, in particular 0.001 to 10 mg\/kg (in each case mg per kg of bodyweight) is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose is preferably administered in a single dose or, in particular when larger amounts are administered, can be divided into several, for example two, three or four individual doses, and may be, for example but not limited to, 0.1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1 mg, 1.25 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, etc., on a daily basis. In some cases, depending on the individual response, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose. Furthermore, the compound may be formulated for immediate or modified release such as extended or controlled release.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes animals, preferably mammals and especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prophylaxis or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for developing said disease or medical condition or developing long-term complications from a disease or medical condition.","The term therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. A prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment of hypertension, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention or reduction of risk of myocardial infarction or prevention and reduction of risk for complications related to hypertension.","In the methods of treatment of this invention, the ROMK inhibitors may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as, for example, orally, parenterally, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred, particularly solid oral dosage units such as pills, tablets or capsules.","Accordingly, this invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. For oral use, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as pills, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, mannitol, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.","Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other customary additives, for example, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, dispersants, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants.","Oral immediate-release and time-controlled release dosage forms may be employed, as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms.

LC-MS (IE, m\/z): 409 [M+1].","Several assays may be used to measure functional inhibition of the ROMK channel by compounds of the instant invention. One primary assay that can be used is a functional Rbefflux assay that measures the ability of ROMK to permeate Rb, in the absence or presence of test compound. Under control conditions, cells loaded with Rb and incubated in Rb-free medium display a time-dependent efflux of the isotope, the rate of which depends on number of functional channels. When cells are incubated in the presence of a channel inhibitor, efflux of Rb is prevented in a concentration-dependent manner, and ICvalues of inhibition by compounds can be accurately determined. This assay has been established with cell lines expressing either human, rat or dog ROMK channels, and can operate in 96- or 384-well format. Importantly, the human, rat, and dog Rb efflux assays can be carried out in the presence of up to 100% serum allowing, therefore, an accurate estimation of the effect of protein binding on the inhibitory activity of compounds of interest. Another ROMK functional assay makes use of the ability of thallium to permeate through open ROMK channels and increase the fluorescence of a dye previously loaded into the cells. Under control conditions, cells loaded with dye and exposed to thallium-containing medium display a time-dependent increase in fluorescence, the rate of which depends on number of functional channels. When cells are incubated in the presence of a channel inhibitor, the increase in fluorescence is attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner, and ICvalues of inhibition by compounds can be accurately determined. This assay has been established with cell lines expressing either human, or rat ROMK channels, and operates in 384-well format. Another assay for evaluation of the compounds of the instant invention and for evaluation of mechanism of action of compounds of Formula I relies on the measurement of the electrical current that is generated as potassium permeates through the channel. For these electrophysiological experiments, three different platforms, IonWorks, QPatch, or manual patch clamp, are used, depending on the experimental protocol under consideration. IonWorks operates in a 384-well format and allows accurate determination of ICvalues for inhibitors. Examples of compounds of the present invention (listed above) all had potencies of at least 1 \u03bcM or lower in one or more of the three assays described herein.","The following Thallium Flux Assay and\/or the Rb Efflux Assay were performed on the final product compounds in the Examples.","Cell Culture Conditions\u2014","HEK293 cells stably expressing hROMK (hK1.1) were grown at 37\u00b0 C. in a 10% COhumidified incubator in complete growth media: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids, Penicillin\/Streptomycin\/Glutamine, G418 and FBS.
