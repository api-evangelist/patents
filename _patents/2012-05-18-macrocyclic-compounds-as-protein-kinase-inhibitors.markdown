The compounds may also be useful as inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and may optionally also be useful as inhibitors of a PIM family kinase (e.g. PIM-3 and, especially PIM-1). The compounds are of potential utility in the treatment of diseases such as cancer. The invention also relates to the use of such compounds as medicaments, to the use of such compounds for in vitro, in situ and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells (or associated pathological conditions), to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to synthetic routes for their production.","The malfunctioning of protein kinases (PKs) is the hallmark of numerous diseases. A large share of the oncogenes and proto-oncogenes involved in human cancers code for PKs. The enhanced activities of PKs are also implicated in many non-malignant diseases, such as benign prostate hyperplasia, familial adenomatosis, polyposis, neuro-fibromatosis, psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis. PKs are also implicated in inflammatory conditions and in the multiplication of viruses and parasites. PKs may also play a major role in the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative disorders.","For a general reference to PKs malfunctioning or disregulation see, for instance, 1999, 3, 459-465.","Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of lipid and serine\/threonine kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (PI) on the 3\u2032-OH of the inositol ring to produce phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphoinositol-3,4-diphosphate (PIP) and phosphoinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP), which act as recruitment sites for various intracellular signalling proteins, which in turn form signalling complexes to relay extracellular signals to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. These 3\u2032-phosphoinositide subtypes function as second messengers in intra-cellular signal transduction pathways (see e.g. Trends Biochem. Sci 22 87, 267-72 (1997) by Vanhaesebroeck et al.; Chem. Rev. 101 (8), 2365-80 (2001) by Leslie et al (2001); Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Boil. 17, 615-75 (2001) by Katso et al; and Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 59 (5), 761-79 (2002) by Toker et al).","Multiple PI3K isoforms categorized by their catalytic subunits, their regulation by corresponding regulatory subunits, expression patterns and signalling specific funtions (p110\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b3) perform this enzymatic reaction (Exp. Cell. Res. 25 (1). 239-54 (1999) by Vanhaesebroeck and Katso et al., 2001, above).","The closely related isoforms p110\u03b1 and \u03b2 are ubiquitously expressed, while \u03b4 and \u03b3 are more specifically expressed in the haematopoietic cell system, smooth muscle cells, myocytes and endothelial cells (see e.g. Trends Biochem. Sci. 22 (7), 267-72 (1997) by Vanhaesebroeck et al). Their expression might also be regulated in an inducible manner depending on the cellular, tissue type and stimuli as well as disease context. Inductibility of protein expression includes synthesis of protein as well as protein stabilization that is in part regulated by association with regulatory subunits.","Eight mammalian PI3Ks have been identified so far, including four class I PI3Ks. Class Ia includes PI3K\u03b1, PI3K\u03b2 and PI3K\u03b4. All of the class Ia enzymes are heterodimeric complexes comprising a catalytic subunit (p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2 or p110\u03b4) associated with an SH2 domain containing p85 adapter subunit. Class Ia PI3Ks are activated through tyrosine kinase signalling and are involved in cell proliferation and survival. PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b2 have also been implicated in tumorigenesis in a variety of human cancers. Thus, pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b2 are useful for treating various types of cancer.","The potential role of PI3K over-signaling in the development of lymphoid malignancies was initially identified in an experiment by Borlado et al. (Borlado L R, Redondo C, Alvarez B, et al. Increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity induces a lymphoproliferative disorder and contributes to tumor generation in vivo., FASEB J 2000; 14(7):895-903). In that study, a mouse model with PI3K over-signaling developed infiltrating lymphoproliferative disorders as well as autoimmune disease. The PI3K pathway plays an important role in the development of B-cell malignancies, mainly through activation of the p110\u03b4 subunit. Inhibition of p110\u03b4 could have a role in the management of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), plasma cell myeloma (PCM) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). (for a review, see Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 January; 21(1):15-22. CAL-101: a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase p110-delta inhibitor for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies., Castillo J J, Furman M, Winer E S).","PI3K\u03b3, the only member of the Class Ib PI3Ks, consists of a catalytic subunit p110\u03b3, which is associated with a p110 regulatory subunit. PI3K\u03b3 is regulated by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) via association with \u03b2\u03b3 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. PI3K\u03b3 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells and cardiomyocytes and is involved in inflammation and mast cell function. Thus, pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K\u03b3 are useful for treating a variety of inflammatory diseases, allergies and cardiovascular diseases.","These observations show that deregulation of phosphoinositol-3-kinase and the upstream and downstream components of this signalling pathway is one of the most common deregulations associated with human cancers and proliferative diseases (see e.g. Parsons et al., Nature 436:792 (2005); Hennessey et al., Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 4: 988-1004 (2005).","The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) also known as FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein 1 (FRAP1) is a protein which in humans is encoded by the FRAP1 gene. mTOR is a serine\/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, protein synthesis, and transcription. The inhibition of mTORs are believed to be useful for treating various diseases\/conditions, such as cancer (for example, as described in Easton et al. (2006). \u201cmTOR and cancer therapy\u201d. 25 (48): 6436-46).","The listing or discussion of an apparently prior-published document in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge.","For the treatment of cancer, targeted therapies are becoming more important. That is, therapy that has the effect of interfering with specific target molecules that are linked to tumor growth and\/or carcinogenesis. Such therapy may be more effective than current treatments (e.g. chemotherapy) and less harmful to normal cells (e.g. because chemotherapy has the potential to kill normal cells as well as cancerous cells). This, and also the fact that targeted therapies may be selective (i.e. it may inhibit a certain targeted molecule more selectively as compared to other molecular targets, e.g. as described hereinafter), may have the benefit of reducing side effects and may also have the benefit that certain specific cancers can be treated (also selectively). The latter may in turn also reduce side effects.","PIM-1 is the protooncogene activated by murine leucemia virus (Provirus Integration site for Moloney murine leucemia virus\u2014MoMuLV) that induces T-cell lymphoma [Cuypers, H. T., et. al. 1984, 37, 141-150].","The expression of the protooncogene produces a non-transmembrane serine\/threonine kinase of 313 residues, including a kinase domain consisting of 253 amino acid residues. Two isoforms are known through alternative initiation (p44 and p33) [Saris, C. J. M. et al. 1991, 10, 655-664].","PIM-1, PIM-2 and PIM-3 phosphorylate protein substrates that are important in cancer neogenesis and progression. For example, PIM-1 phosphorylates inter alia p21, Bad, c-myb, Cdc 25A and eIF4B (see e.g. Quian, K. C. et al, 2005, 280(7), 6130-6137, and references cited therein).","Two PIM-1 homologs have been described [Baytel, D. 1998, 1442, 274-285; Feldman, J. et al. 1998, 273, 16535.16543]. PIM-2 and PIM-3 are respectively 58% and 69% identical to PIM-1 at the amino acid level. PIM-1 is mainly expressed in thymus, testis, and cells of the hematopoietic system [Mikkers, H.; Nawijn, M.; Allen, J.; Brouwers, C.; Verhoeven, E.; Jonkers, J.; Berns, 2004, 24, 6104; Bachmann, M.; Moroy, T. 2005, 37, 726-730. 6115]. PIM-1 expression is directly induced by STAT (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) transcription factors, and PIM-1 expression is induced by many cytokine signalling pathways such as interleukins (IL), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), \u03b1- and \u03b3-interferon, erythropoietin, and prolactin [Wang, Z et al. 2001, 2, 167-179].","PIM-1 has been implicated in lymphoma development. Induced expression of PIM-1 and the protooncogene c-myc synergise to increase the incidence of lymphomagenesis [Breuer, M. et al. Nature 1989, 340, 61-63; van Lohuizen M. et al. Cell, 1991, 65, 737-752]. PIM-1 functions in cytokine signalling pathways and has been shown to play a role in T cell development [Schmidt, T. et al. EMBO J. 1998, 17, 5349-5359; Jacobs, H. et al. JEM 1999, 190, 1059-1068]. Signalling through gp130, a subunit common to receptors of the IL-6 cytokine family, activates the transcription factor STAT3 and can lead to the proliferation of hematopioetic cells [Hirano, T. et al. Oncogene 2000, 19, 2548-2556]. A kinase-active PIM-1 appears to be essential for the gp130-mediated STAT3 proliferation signal. In cooperation with the c-myc PIM-1 can promote STAT3-mediated cell cycle progression and antiapoptosis [Shirogane, T. et sl., immunity, 1999, 11, 709-719]. PIM-1 also appears to be necessary for IL-3-stimulated growth in bone marrow-derived mast cells [Domen, J. et al., Blood, 1993, 82, 1445-1452] and survival of FDCP1 cells after IL-3 withdrawal [Lilly, M. et al., Oncogene, 1999, 18, 4022-4031].","Additionally, control of cell proliferation and survival by PIM-1 may be effected by means of its phosphorylation of the well-established cell cycle regulators cdc25 [Mochizuki, T. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1999, 274, 18659-18666] and\/or p21(Cip1\/WAF1) [Wang Z. et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 2002, 1593, 45-55] or phosphorylation of heterochromatin protein 1, a molecule involved in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation [Koike, N. et al, FEBS Lett. 2000, 467, 17-21].","Mice deficient for all three PIM genes showed an impaired response to hematopoietic growth factors and demonstrated that PIM proteins are required for efficient proliferation of peripheral T lymphocyes. In particular, it was shown that PIM function is required for efficient cell cycle induction of T cells in response to synergistic T-cell receptor and IL-2 signalling. A large number of interaction partners and substrates of PIM-1 have been identified, suggesting a pivotal role for PIM-1 in cell cycle control, proliferation, as well as in cell survival.","The oncogenic potential of this kinase has been first demonstrated in E \u03bc PIM-1 transgenic mice in which PIM-1 over-expression is targeted to the B-cell lineage which leads to formation of B-cell tumors [van Lohuizen, M. et al.; 1989, 56, 673-682. Subsequently PIM-1 has been reported to be over-expressed in a number of prostate cancers, erythroleukemias, and several other types of human leukemias [Roh, M. et al.; 2003, 63, 8079-8084; Valdman, A. et al; 2004, 60, 367-371;","For example, chromosomal translocation of PIM-1 leads to overexpression of PIM-1 in diffuse large cell lymphoma. [Akasaka, H. et al.; 2000, 60, 2335-2341]. Furthermore, a number of missense mutations in PIM-1 have been reported in lymphomas of the nervous system and AIDS-induced non-Hodgkins' lymphomas that probably affect PIM-1 kinase activity or stability [Pasqualucci, L. et al, 2001, 412, 341-346; Montesinos-Rongen, M. et al., 2004, 103, 1869-1875; Gaidano, G. et al., 2003, 102, 1833-184]. Thus, the strong linkage between reported overexpression data and the occurrence of PIM-1 mutations in cancer suggests a dominant role of PIM-1 in tumorigenesis.","Several other protein kinases have been described in the literature, in which the activity and\/or elevated activity of such protein kinases have been implicated in diseases such as cancer, in a similar manner to PIM-1, PIM-2 and PIM-3.","It has also been reported that PIM-1 has a role in pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), see the journal article by Paulin et al., \u201cSignal transducers and activators of transcription-3\/PIM-1 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of human pulmonary arterial hypertension\u201d.","There is a constant need to provide alternative and\/or more efficacious inhibitors of protein kinases, and particularly inhibitors of PIM-1, PIM-2 and\/or PIM-3. Such modulators are expected to offer alternative and\/or improved approaches for the management of medical conditions associated with activity and\/or elevated activity of PIM-1, PIM-2 and\/or PIM-3 protein kinases.","For the treatment of cancer, targeted therapies are becoming more important. That is, therapy that has the effect of interfering with specific target molecules that are linked to tumor growth and\/or carcinogenesis. Such therapy may be more effective than current treatments (e.g. chemotherapy) and less harmful to normal cells (e.g. because chemotherapy has the potential to kill normal cells as well as cancerous cells). This, and also the fact that targeted therapies may be selective (i.e. it may inhibit a certain targeted molecule more selectively as compared to other molecular targets, e.g. as described hereinafter), may have the benefit of reducing side effects and may also have the benefit that certain specific cancers can be treated (also selectively). The latter may in turn also reduce side effects.","Hence, it is a clear goal of current oncologists to develop targeted therapies (e.g. ones that are selective). In this respect, it should be pointed out that several different molecular targets may exist that are linked to certain diseases (e.g. cancer). However, one simply cannot predict if a therapy (e.g. a small molecule as a therapeutic) that interferes with or inhibits one target molecule could inhibit a different molecular target (be it one that will ultimately have the effect of treating the same disease or a different one).","International patent applications WO 2009\/055418, WO 2010\/108074, WO 2009\/040552, WO 2010\/112874 and WO 2011\/022439 (as well as journal article by Okseon Kim et al \u201cDesign and Synthesis of Imidazopyridine Analogues as Inhibitors of PI3K Signaling and Angiogenesis\u201d) all disclose various compounds for use as kinase inhibitors. However, none of these documents disclose macrocycles.","The listing or discussion of an apparently prior-published document in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge.","According to the invention, there is provided a compound of formula I,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0031"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"48.85mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09284334-20160315-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein:","ring A and ring B represent a fused bicyclic group of any one of the following formulae:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0034"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"120.14mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09284334-20160315-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein","in formula IA: Wis CH, CF or N;

For the avoidance of doubt, the term \u201cparenteral\u201d administration includes all forms of administration other than oral administration.","Prodrugs of compounds of the invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present on the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. The modifications typically are achieved by synthesising the parent compound with a prodrug substituent. Prodrugs include compounds of the invention wherein a hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group in a compound of the invention is bonded to any group that may be cleaved in vivo to regenerate the free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group, respectively.","Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, esters and carbamates of hydroxy functional groups, esters groups of carboxyl functional groups, N-acyl derivatives and N-Mannich bases. General information on prodrugs may be found e.g. in Bundegaard, H. \u201cDesign of Prodrugs\u201d p. 1-92, Elesevier, New York-Oxford (1985).","Compounds of the invention may contain double bonds and may thus exist as E (entgegen) and Z (zusammen) geometric isomers about each individual double bond. Positional isomers may also be embraced by the compounds of the invention. All such isomers (e.g. if a compound of the invention incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, the cis- and trans-forms, are embraced) and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention (e.g. single positional isomers and mixtures of positional isomers may be included within the scope of the invention).","Compounds of the invention may also exhibit tautomerism. All tautomeric forms (or tautomers) and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention. The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerisations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganisation of some of the bonding electrons.","Compounds of the invention may also contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may therefore exhibit optical and\/or diastereoisomerism. Diastereoisomers may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The various stereoisomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic or other mixture of the compounds using conventional, e.g. fractional crystallisation or HPLC, techniques. Alternatively the desired optical isomers may be made by reaction of the appropriate optically active starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisation or epimerisation (i.e. a \u2018chiral pool\u2019 method), by reaction of the appropriate starting material with a \u2018chiral auxiliary\u2019 which can subsequently be removed at a suitable stage, by derivatisation (i.e. a resolution, including a dynamic resolution), for example with a homochiral acid followed by separation of the diastereomeric derivatives by conventional means such as chromatography, or by reaction with an appropriate chiral reagent or chiral catalyst all under conditions known to the skilled person.","All stereoisomers (including but not limited to diastereoisomers, enantiomers and atropisomers) and mixtures thereof (e.g. racemic mixtures) are included within the scope of the invention.","In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.","The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.","The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature (or the most abundant one found in nature). All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified herein are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, I, and I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with H and C) are useful in compound and for substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (H) and carbon-14 (C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O, N, C and F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in e.g. the schemes and\/or Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Unless otherwise specified, Calkyl groups (where q is the upper limit of the range) defined herein may be straight-chain or, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of two or three, as appropriate) of carbon atoms, be branched-chain, and\/or cyclic (so forming a C-cycloalkyl group). Such cycloalkyl groups may be monocyclic or bicyclic and may further be bridged. Further, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of four) of carbon atoms, such groups may also be part cyclic. Such alkyl groups may also be saturated or, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of two) of carbon atoms, be unsaturated (forming, for example, a Calkenyl or a Calkynyl group).","Unless otherwise stated, the term Calkylene (where q is the upper limit of the range) defined herein may be straight-chain or, when there is a sufficient number of carbon atoms, be saturated or unsaturated (so forming, for example, an alkenylene or alkynylene linker group). However, such Calkylene groups are preferably not branched. Such \u201calkylene\u201d groups may be appropriate linker groups that are a part of the macrocyclic structure of formula I. For the avoidance of doubt, any optional substituents on the alkylene groups are not an integral part of the linking moiety, i.e. when \u201cY\u201d represents substituted alkylene, then the substituent(s) are not linked to \u201cX\u201d or \u201cZ\u201d, but are located on the alkylene moiety.","Ccycloalkyl groups (where q is the upper limit of the range) that may be specifically mentioned may be monocyclic or bicyclic alkyl groups, which cycloalkyl groups may further be bridged (so forming, for example, fused ring systems such as three fused cycloalkyl groups). Such cycloalkyl groups may be saturated or unsaturated containing one or more double or triple bonds (forming for example a cycloalkenyl or cycloalkynyl group). Substituents may be attached at any point on the cycloalkyl group. Further, where there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of four) such cycloalkyl groups may also be part cyclic. For the avoidance of doubt, optional substituents may also be other cyclic groups, which may be attached via a single carbon atom common to both rings, so forming a spiro-cycle.","The term \u201chalo\u201d, when used herein, includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.","Heterocycloalkyl groups that may be mentioned include non-aromatic monocyclic and bicyclic heterocycloalkyl groups in which at least one (e.g. one to four) of the atoms in the ring system is other than carbon (i.e. a heteroatom), and in which the total number of atoms in the ring system is from five to ten (between five and ten). Such heterocycloalkyl groups may also be bridged. Further, such heterocycloalkyl groups may be saturated or unsaturated containing one or more double and\/or triple bonds, forming for example a Cheterocycloalkenyl (where q is the upper limit of the range) or a Cheterocycloalkynyl group. Cheterocycloalkyl groups that may be mentioned include 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, 6-azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanyl, 6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]-octanyl, 8-azabicyclo-[3.2.1]octanyl, aziridinyl, azetidinyl, dihydropyranyl, dihydropyridyl, dihydropyrrolyl (including 2,5-dihydropyrrolyl), dioxolanyl (including 1,3-dioxolanyl), dioxanyl (including 1,3-dioxanyl and 1,4-dioxanyl), dithianyl (including 1,4-dithianyl), dithiolanyl (including 1,3-dithiolanyl), imidazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, morpholinyl, 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, 6-oxabicyclo-[3.2.1]octanyl, oxetanyl, oxiranyl, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, pyranyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyrrolidinonyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolinyl, quinuclidinyl, sulfolanyl, 3-sulfolenyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydropyridyl (such as 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridyl and 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridyl), thietanyl, thiiranyl, thiolanyl, thiomorpholinyl, trithianyl (including 1,3,5-trithianyl), tropanyl and the like. Substituents on heterocycloalkyl groups may, where appropriate, be located on any atom in the ring system including a heteroatom. The point of attachment of heterocycloalkyl groups may be via any atom in the ring system including (where appropriate) a heteroatom (such as a nitrogen atom), or an atom on any fused carbocyclic ring that may be present as part of the ring system. Heterocycloalkyl groups may also be in the N\u2014 or S\u2014 oxidised form (i.e. those heteroatoms may be substituted with one or two \u2550O substituents, as appropriate). As stated herein other carbon atoms of the heterocycloalkyl groups mentioned herein may also be substituted by one or more \u2550O substituents. For the avoidance of doubt, optional substituents may also be other cyclic groups, which may be attached via a single carbon atom common to both rings (so forming a spiro cycle).","The term \u201c-heterocycloalkylene-\u201d refers to a heterocycloalkyl group that is a part of a linker group. Each hyphen therefore represents the point of attachment to the moieties to which they are attached. For instance when Y represents -heterocycloalkylene-, then the hyphens represent the point of attachment to \u201cX\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d. The point of attachment may be via any appropriate atom (e.g. a nitrogen or carbon atom of that heterocycloalkyl moiety). Where it is indicated that such a moiety may be substituted, the optional substituents are not an integral part of the macrocycle, i.e. in the case where Y represents substituted -heterocycloalkylene-, then those substituents are not directly linked to \u201cX\u201d or \u201cZ\u201d.","For the avoidance of doubt, the term \u201cbicyclic\u201d (e.g. when employed in the context of heterocycloalkyl groups) refers to groups in which the second ring of a two-ring system is formed between two adjacent atoms of the first ring. The term \u201cbridged\u201d (e.g. when employed in the context of cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl groups) refers to monocyclic or bicyclic groups in which two non-adjacent atoms are linked by either an alkylene or heteroalkylene chain (as appropriate).","Aryl groups that may be mentioned include Caryl groups. Such groups may be monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic and have from 6 to 10 (between 6 and 10) ring carbon atoms, in which at least one ring is aromatic. Caryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl and the like, such as 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl. The point of attachment of aryl groups may be via any atom of the ring system. However, when aryl groups are bicyclic or tricyclic, they are linked to the rest of the molecule via an aromatic ring.

For the avoidance of doubt, optional substituents may also be other cyclic groups, which may be, when attached to a non-aromatic ring of an aryl group, attached via a single carbon atom common to both rings (so forming a spiro-cycle).","Unless otherwise specified, the term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d when used herein refers to an aromatic group containing one or more heteroatom(s) (e.g. one to four heteroatoms) preferably selected from N, O and S. Heteroaryl groups include those which have from 5 to 10 (between 5 and 10) members and may be monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic, provided that at least one of the rings is aromatic (so forming, for example, a mono-, bi-, or tricyclic heteroaromatic group).

Heteroaryl groups may also be in the N\u2014 or S\u2014 oxidised form.","The terms \u201c-arylene-\u201d and \u201c-heteroarylene-\u201d refer to aryl\/heteroaryl groups that are a part of a linker group. Each hyphen therefore represents the point of attachment to the moieties to which they are attached. For instance when Y represents \u201c-arylene-\u201d and \u201c-heteroarylene-\u201d, then the hyphens represent the point of attachment to \u201cX\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d. The point of attachment may be via any appropriate atom (e.g. a nitrogen or carbon atom of those moieties). Where it is indicated that those moieties may be substituted, the optional substituents are not an integral part of the macrocycle, i.e. in the case where Y represents substituted -arylene- or -heteroarylene-, then those substituents are not directly linked to \u201cX\u201d or \u201cZ\u201d.","It may be specifically stated that the heteroaryl group is monocyclic or bicyclic.

For the avoidance of doubt, in relation to the linker groups defined by Z, the first hyphen of the linking moiety is the point at which that moiety links to the requisite phenyl ring (bearing Rand Rgroups) and the last hyphen depicts the linking point to the Y group. Similarly, for the X linker group the first hyphen represents the point of attachment to the Y group and the last hyphen represents the point of attachment to ring A\/B.","For the avoidance of doubt, in cases in which the identity of two or more substituents in a compound of the invention may be the same, the actual identities of the respective substituents are not in any way interdependent. For example, in the situation in which there is more than one Qsubstituent present, then those Qsubstituents may be the same or different. Further, in the case where there are two Qsubstituents present, in which one represents \u2014ORand the other represents \u2014C(O)\u2014R, then those Rgroups are not to be regarded as being interdependent.","For the avoidance of doubt, in the instance where cyclic substituents (e.g. cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl groups) are present on groups (such as alkyl groups), then those cyclic substituents may be attached to the same carbon atom, so forming for example a spiro-cyclic group.","All individual features (e.g. preferred features) mentioned herein may be taken in isolation or in combination with any other feature (including preferred feature) mentioned herein (hence, preferred features may be taken in conjunction with other preferred features, or independently of them).","The skilled person will appreciate that compounds of the invention that are the subject of this invention include those that are stable.

Alternatively, such reactions may be performed in two steps, for example a condensation step (in the presence of e.g. a dehydrating agent such as trimethyl orthoformate or MgSOor molecular sieves, etc) followed by a reduction step (e.g. by reaction in the presence of a reducing agent such as a chemoselective one mentioned above or NaBH, AlH, or the like), for instance the conversion of \u2014NHto \u2014N(H)-isopropyl by condensation in the presence of acetone (HC\u2261C(O)\u2014CH) followed by reduction in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanaoborohydride (i.e. overall a reductive amination);","(v) formation of an amide or sulfonamide, for example by reaction of a sulfonyl chloride with an amine or by an amide coupling reaction, i.e. the formation of an amide from a carboxylic acid (or ester thereof), for example \u2014C(O)OH (or an ester thereof), may be converted to \u2014C(O)N(R)R(in which Rand Rare as hereinbefore defined, and may be linked together, e.g. as defined above), and which reaction may (e.g. for \u2014COOH) be performed in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent (e.g. 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole, N,N\u2032-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or the like) or, in the case of an ester (e.g. \u2014C(O)OCHor \u2014C(O)OCHCH), be performed in the presence of e.g. trimethylaluminium, or, alternatively the \u2014C(O)OH group may first be activated to the corresponding acyl halide (e.g \u2014C(O)Cl, by treatment with oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphorous oxychloride, or the like), and, in all cases, the relevant compound is reacted with a compound of formula HN(R)R(in which Rand Rare as hereinbefore defined), under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art (e.g. optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent, suitable base and\/or in an inert atmosphere);","(vi) conversion of a primary amide to a nitrile functional group, for example under dehydration reaction conditions, e.g. in the presence of POCl, or the like;","(vii) nucleophilic substitution (e.g. aromatic nucleophilic substitution) reactions, where any nucleophile replaces a leaving group, e.g. an amine may replace a \u2014S(O)CHleaving group;","(viii) transformation of a methoxy group to a hydroxy group, by reaction in the presence of an appropriate reagent, such as boron fluoride-dimethyl sulfide complex or BBr(e.g. in the presence of a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane);","(ix) haolgenation, alkylation, acylation or sulfonylation reactions, which may be performed in the presence of base and solvent (such as those described hereinbefore);","(x) specific deprotection steps, such as deprotection of an N-Boc protecting group by reaction in the presence of an acid, or, a hydroxy group protected as a silyl ether (e.g. a tert-butyl-dimethylsilyl protecting group) may be deprotected by reaction with a source of fluoride ions, e.g. by employing the reagent tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF);","(xi) aromatic nitration reactions (for instance which may be performed on compounds corresponding to compounds of formula X, but in which the \u2014NHgroup is replaced with a \u2014NOgroup; subsequent conversion of the nitro group may take place separately-see (xii) below); e.g. by reaction in the presence of nitric acid at low temperature, followed by addition of conc. HSO);","(xii) reductions of nitro groups to amino groups under standard conditions, e.g. iron-based reduction), which may be followed by an acylation reaction (see (ix) above) or a reductive amination (see (iv) above).","The substituents R, R, R, R, R, Z, X and Y (or substituents on the main core structure, including substituents on ring A\/B) in final compounds of the invention or relevant intermediates may be modified one or more times, after or during the processes described above by way of methods that are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of such methods include substitutions, reductions, oxidations, alkylations, acylations, hydrolyses, esterifications, etherifications, halogenations or nitrations. Such reactions may result in the formation of a symmetric or asymmetric final compound of the invention or intermediate. The precursor groups can be changed to a different such group, or to the groups defined in formula I, at any time during the reaction sequence.

The operative conditions are those widely known in the art and may comprise, for instance in the conversion of a carboxyester group into a carboxamide group, the reaction with ammonia or ammonium hydroxide in the presence of a suitable solvent such as a lower alcohol, dimethylformamide or a mixture thereof; preferably the reaction is carried out with ammonium hydroxide in a methanol\/dimethylformamide mixture, at a temperature ranging from about 50\u00b0 C. to about 100\u00b0 C. Analogous operative conditions apply in the preparation of N-substituted or N,N-disubstituted carboxamides wherein a suitable primary or secondary amine is used in place of ammonia or ammonium hydroxide. Likewise, carboxyester groups may be converted into carboxylic acid derivatives through basic or acidic hydrolysis conditions, widely known in the art. Further, amino derivatives of compounds of the invention may easily be converted into the corresponding carbamate, carboxamido or ureido derivatives.","Compounds of the invention may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques (e.g. recrystallisations).","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in the processes described above and hereinafter, the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by protecting groups.","The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction in the above-mentioned schemes.","Protecting groups may be removed in accordance with techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art and as described hereinafter.

W. Greene & P. G. M. Wutz, Wiley-Interscience (1999).","Medical and Pharmaceutical Uses","Compounds of the invention are indicated as pharmaceuticals. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention, for use as a pharmaceutical.","For the avoidance of doubt, although compounds of the invention may possess pharmacological activity as such, certain pharmaceutically-acceptable (e.g. \u201cprotected\u201d) derivatives of compounds of the invention may exist or be prepared which may not possess such activity, but may be administered parenterally or orally and thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention. Such compounds (which may possess some pharmacological activity, provided that such activity is appreciably lower than that of the \u201cactive\u201d compounds to which they are metabolised) may therefore be described as \u201cprodrugs\u201d of compounds of the invention.","A \u201cprodrug of a compound of the invention\u201d is as hereinbefore defined, including compounds that form a compound of the invention, in an experimentally-detectable amount, within a predetermined time (e.g. about 1 hour), following oral or parenteral administration. All prodrugs of the compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention.","Furthermore, certain compounds of the invention may possess no or minimal pharmacological activity as such, but may be administered parenterally or orally, and thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention that possess pharmacological activity as such. Such compounds (which also includes compounds that may possess some pharmacological activity, but that activity is appreciably lower than that of the \u201cactive\u201d compounds of the invention to which they are metabolised), may also be described as \u201cprodrugs\u201d.","Thus, the compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity, and\/or are metabolised in the body following oral or parenteral administration to form compounds which possess pharmacological activity.","Compounds of the invention may inhibit protein or lipid kinases, such as a PI3 kinase (especially a class I PI3K), or a PIM family kinase (e.g. PIM-1, PIM-2 and\/or PIM-3), for example as may be shown in the tests described below (for example, the test for PI3K\u03b1 and PIM inhibition described below) and\/or in tests known to the skilled person. The compounds of the invention may also inhibit mTOR. Thus, the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of those disorders in an individual in which the inhibition of such protein or lipid kinases (e.g. PI3K, particularly class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or a PIM family kinase, e.g. PIM-1, PIM-2 or PIM-3) is desired and\/or required (for instance compounds of the invention may inhibit PI3K, particularly class I PI3K and, optionally, may also inhibit either (or both of) mTOR and PIM). Hence, certain compounds of the invention may be \u201cdual\u201d (e.g. PI3K and mTOR; PI3K and PIM; or mTOR and PIM) inhibitors. Further, certain compounds of the invention may be \u201ctriple\u201d (e.g. PI3K, PIM and mTOR) inhibitors.","The term \u201cinhibit\u201d may refer to any measurable reduction and\/or prevention of catalytic kinase (e.g. PI3K, particularly class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or PIM) activity. The reduction and\/or prevention of kinase activity may be measured by comparing the kinase activity in a sample containing a compound of the invention and an equivalent sample of kinase (e.g. PI3K, particularly class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or PIM) in the absence of a compound of the invention, as would be apparent to those skilled in the art. The measurable change may be objective (e.g. measurable by some test or marker, for example in an in vitro or in vivo assay or test, such as one described hereinafter, or otherwise another suitable assay or test known to those skilled in the art) or subjective (e.g. the subject gives an indication of or feels an effect).","Compounds of the invention may be found to exhibit 50% inhibition of a protein or lipid kinase (e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or PIM) at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM or below (for example at a concentration of below 50 \u03bcM, or even below 10 \u03bcM, such as below 1 \u03bcM), when tested in an assay (or other test), for example as described hereinafter, or otherwise another suitable assay or test known to the skilled person.","Compounds of the invention are thus expected to be useful in the treatment of a disorder in which a protein or lipid kinase (e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or PIM) is known to play a role and which are characterised by or associated with an overall elevated activity of that kinase (due to, for example, increased amount of the kinase or increased catalytic activity of the kinase). Hence, compounds of the invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of a disease\/disorder arising from abnormal cell growth, function or behaviour associated with the protein or lipid kinase (e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or PIM). Such conditions\/disorders include cancer, immune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, viral infections, inflammation, metabolism\/endocrine function disorders and neurological disorders.","Compounds of the invention (alone or in combination with another active) may be shown to be active e.g. in the biochemical assays described herein, may be shown to have predictive activity based on e.g. the phosphorylation assay described herein, and\/or may reduce the rate of cell proliferation e.g. as may be shown in the cell proliferation assays described herein (for instance using cancer cell lines (e.g. known commercially available ones), such as those described herein or others that are known and publically available).","The disorders\/conditions that the compounds of the invention may be useful in treating hence includes cancer (such as lymphomas, solid tumours or a cancer as described hereinafter), obstructive airways diseases, allergic diseases, inflammatory diseases (such as asthma, allergy and Crohn's disease), immunosuppression (such as transplantation rejection and autoimmune diseases), disorders commonly connected with organ transplantation, AIDS-related diseases and other associated diseases. Other associated diseases that may be mentioned (particularly due to the key role of kinases in the regulation of cellular proliferation) include other cell proliferative disorders and\/or non-malignant diseases, such as benign prostate hyperplasia, familial adenomatosis, polyposis, neuro-fibromatosis, psoriasis, bone disorders, atherosclerosis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis. Other disease states that may be mentioned include cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, hepatomegaly, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, hormone-related diseases, immunodeficiency disorders, destructive bone disorders, infectious diseases, conditions associated with cell death, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, liver disease, pathologic immune conditions involving T cell activation, CNS disorders and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH).","As stated above, the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of cancer. More, specifically, the compounds of the invention may therefore be useful in the treatment of a variety of cancer including, but not limited to: carcinoma such as cancer of the bladder, breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung (including non-small cell cancer and small cell lung cancer), esophagus, gall-bladder, ovary, pancreas, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, skin, squamous cell carcinoma, testis, genitourinary tract, larynx, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, keratoacanthoma, epidermoid carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, bone, adenoma, adenocarcinoma, follicular carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, papilliary carcinoma, seminona, melanoma, sarcoma, bladder carcinoma, liver carcinoma and biliary passages, kidney carcinoma, myeloid disorders, lymphoid disorders, hairy cells, buccal cavity and pharynx (oral), lip, tongue, mouth, pharynx, small intestine, colon-rectum, large intestine, rectum, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin's and leukaemia; hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage, including leukemia, acute lymphocitic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell-lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma and Burkett's lymphoma; hematopoietic tumors of myeloid lineage, including acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome and promyelocytic leukemia; tumors of mesenchymal origin, including fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma; tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, including astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma and schwannomas; and other tumors, including melanoma, seminoma, teratocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, xeroderma pigmentosum, keratoxanthoma, thyroid follicular cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma.","Further, the protein or lipid kinases (e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or PIM) may also be implicated in the multiplication of viruses and parasites. They may also play a major role in the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, compounds of the invention may also be useful in the treatment of viral conditions, parasitic conditions, as well as neurodegenerative disorders.","Compounds of the invention are indicated both in the therapeutic and\/or prophylactic treatment of the above-mentioned conditions.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of treatment of a disease (e.g. cancer or another disease as mentioned herein) which is associated with the inhibition of protein or lipid kinase (e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or PIM) is desired and\/or required (for example, a method of treatment of a disease\/disorder arising from abnormal cell growth, function or behaviour associated with protein or lipid kinases, e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or PIM), which method comprises administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, as hereinbefore defined, to a patient suffering from, or susceptible to, such a condition.","\u201cPatients\u201d include mammalian (including human) patients.

or","(ii) packaged and presented together as separate components of a \u201ccombination pack\u201d for use in conjunction with each other in combination therapy.","Depending on the disorder, and the patient, to be treated, as well as the route of administration, compounds of the invention may be administered at varying therapeutically effective doses to a patient in need thereof. However, the dose administered to a mammal, particularly a human, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a therapeutic response in the mammal over a reasonable timeframe. One skilled in the art will recognize that the selection of the exact dose and composition and the most appropriate delivery regimen will also be influenced by inter alia the pharmacological properties of the formulation, the nature and severity of the condition being treated, and the physical condition and mental acuity of the recipient, as well as the potency of the specific compound, the age, condition, body weight, sex and response of the patient to be treated, and the stage\/severity of the disease.","Administration may be continuous or intermittent (e.g. by bolus injection). The dosage may also be determined by the timing and frequency of administration. In the case of oral or parenteral administration the dosage can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of the invention.","In any event, the medical practitioner, or other skilled person, will be able to determine routinely the actual dosage, which will be most suitable for an individual patient. The above-mentioned dosages are exemplary of the average case; there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.","Compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are effective inhibitors of protein or lipid kinases (e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, mTOR and\/or PIM). In an embodiment, compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are both PI3K (e.g. class I PI3K, such as PI3K\u03b1) inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors, i.e. they may exhibit dual kinase inhibition. In a further embodiment, compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are PIM inhibitors and are also either PI3K (e.g. class I PI3K, such as PI3K\u03b1) inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors, i.e. they may exhibit dual kinase inhibition. In a yet further embodiment, compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are PI3K (e.g. class I PI3K, such as PI3K\u03b1) inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors and PIM inhibitors, i.e. they may exhibit triple kinase inhibition.","Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be more efficacious than, be less toxic than, be longer acting than, be more potent than, produce fewer side effects than, be more easily absorbed than, and\/or have a better pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. higher oral bioavailability and\/or lower clearance) than, and\/or have other useful pharmacological, physical, or chemical properties over, compounds known in the prior art, whether for use in the above-stated indications or otherwise.","Pharmacokinetic data for a selection of the compounds of the invention are shown in Table 4. These data demonstrate that the macrocyclic compounds are stable under physiological conditions. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the activity that is observed for the compounds of the invention is associated with the compounds in their macrocyclic forms, as opposed to in ring-open forms.","As stated hereinbefore, compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they may exhibit triple (e.g. dual) kinase inhibitory activity (e.g. may act as inhibitors of combinations of PI3K (such PI3K\u03b1), mTOR and PIM (e.g. PI3K (such PI3K\u03b1) and mTOR). In this respect, advantageously, compounds of the invention may be considered as multi-targeted kinase inhibitors. Compounds of the invention that exhibit single selectivity for a kinase may have the additional benefit that they exhibit less side effects, whereas compounds of the invention that exhibit multiple kinase selectivity may have the additional benefit that they exhibit better potency and\/or efficacy.","To date, clinical development of PI3K and dual PI3K\/mTOR inhibitors have shown moderate activities, suggesting that either more potent\/efficacious inhibitors are required or that inhibition of multiple targets or even pathways might be required for effective treatments (see e.g. Bunney, Tom D., Katan, Matilda, Phosphoinositide signalling in cancer: beyond PI3K and PTEN, Nature Reviews Cancer (2010), 10(5), 342-352; Cleary, James M. and Shapiro, Geoffrey I., Development of phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathway inhibitors for advanced cancer, Current Oncology Report (2010), 12, 87-94; and van der Heijden, Michiel S, and Bernards, Ren\u00e9; Inhibition of the PI3K Pathway: Hope We Can Believe in? Clinical Cancer Research (2010), 16, 3094-3099).","Advantageously, the compounds of the invention may have the benefit that they inhibit multiple targets (or even multiple pathways). For instance, in addition to being inhibitors of PI3K, mTOR and PIM (e.g. PI3K (e.g PI3K\u03b1) and mTOR), they may also be effective inhibitors of other protein or lipid kinases (as may be demonstrated by known tests). In this respect, compounds of the invention may be considered to have an improved kinase inhibition cross-reactivity profile, e.g. by being selective against multiple kinases of therapeutic interest, for instance compared to compounds known in the prior art. They may have advantages in the clinic.","Compounds of the invention may combine dual PI3K\/mTOR activity (optionally together with PIM activity) with activity on other key kinases (indeed, combination products covering this spectrum of kinases are currently being evaluated as mentioned above), thereby allowing single-agent administration (or, potentially, combination products with reduced dosages) and providing the associated benefits, e.g. reducing the risk of drug-drug interactions, etc.","Compounds of the invention may be beneficial as they are medicaments with targeted therapy, i.e. which target a particular molecular entity by inferring or inhibiting it (e.g. in this case by inhibiting one or more protein or lipid kinases as hereinbefore described). Compounds of the invention may therefore also have the benefit that they have a new effect (for instance as compared to known compounds in the prior art), for instance, the new effect may be a particular mode of action or another effect resultant of the targeted therapy. Targeted therapies may be beneficial as they may have the desired effect (e.g. reduce cancer, by reducing tumor growth or carcinogenisis) but may also have the advantage of reducing side effects (e.g. by preventing the killing of normal cells, as may occur using e.g. chemotherapy).","Furthermore, compounds of the invention may selectively target particular protein or lipid kinases (e.g. the ones described herein) compared to other known protein or lipid kinases. Accordingly, compounds of the invention may have the advantage that certain, specific, cancers may be treated selectively, which selective treatment may also have the effect of reducing side effects.","Determination of PI3 and PIM kinase activity of compounds of the invention (such as those exemplified) is possible by a number of direct and indirect detection methods. Certain exemplary compounds described herein were prepared, characterized, and assayed for their PI3K\u03b1, PIM and mTOR enzymatic activities using the methods described herein. The compounds may also be tested in cell-based assays.","PI3K Activity Assay","The kinase activity was measured by using the commercial ADP Hunter\u2122 Plus assay available from DiscoveR(#33-016), which is a homogeneous assay to measure the accumulation of ADP, a universal product of kinase activity. The enzyme, PI3K (p110\u03b1\/p85\u03b1 was purchased from Cama Biosciences (#07CBS-0402A). The assay was done following the manufacturer recommendations with slight modifications: Mainly the kinase buffer was replace by 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.04% CHAPS, 2 mM TCEP and 0.01 mg\/ml BGG. The PI3K was assayed in a titration experiment to determine the optimal protein concentration for the inhibition assay. To calculate the ICof the ETP-compounds, serial 1:5 dilutions of the compounds were added to the enzyme at a fixed concentration (2.5 \u03bcg\/ml). The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor and 30 \u03bcM PIPsubstrate (P9763, Sigma) for 5 min and then ATP was added to a final 50 \u03bcM concentration. Reaction was carried out for 1 hour at 25\u00b0 C. Reagent A and B were sequentially added to the wells and plates were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. Fluorescence counts were read in a Victor instrument (Perkin Elmer) with the recommended settings (544 and 580 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively). Values were normalized against the control activity included for each enzyme (i.e., 100% PI3 kinase activity, without compound). These values were plotted against the inhibitor concentration and were fit to a sigmoid dose-response curve by using the Graphad software.","mTOR Assay","The enzymatic mTOR activity was measured using a LanthaScreen\u2122 kinase activity assay (Invitrogen). The enzyme was purchased from Invitrogen (PV4754), as well as the GFP-labeled substrate (4EBP1-GFP; PV4759) and the Tb-anti-p4EBP1(pThr46) antibody (PV4757). The assay was performed in 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 mM MnCl, 10 mM MgCl, 1 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM DTT and 0.01% Tween-20. The concentration of the assay components were the following: 0.24 nM mTOR kinase, 400 nM 4EBP1-GFP, 10 mM ATP and serial dilutions of the compound (inhibitor) to be evaluated. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, 20 mM EDTA was used to stop the reaction and terbium-labeled antibody (4 nM) added to detect phosphorylated product. The antibody associates with the phosphorylated product resulting in an increased TR-FRET value. The TR-FRET value (a dimensionless number) was calculated as the ratio of the acceptor signal (GFP, emission at 520 nm) to the donor signal (terbium, emission at 495 nm). Values were plotted against the inhibitor concentration and fitted to a sigmoid dose-response curve using GraphPad software.","PIM-1 Biochemical Assay","The biochemical assay to measure PIM-1 activity relies on the ADP Hunter assay kit (DiscoveRx Corp., Cat. #90-0077), that determines the amount of ADP as direct product of the kinase enzyme activity.","The enzyme has been expressed and purified in-house as a recombinant human protein with a C-terminal histidine tag. The protein is active and stable.","Assay conditions were as indicated by the kit manufacturers with the following adaptations for the kinase activity step:\n\n","Assays were performed in either 96 or 384-well plates. The final outcome of the coupled reactions provided by the kit is the release of the fluorescent product Resorufin and has been measured with a multilabel HTS counter VICTOR V (PerkinElmer) using an excitation filter at 544 nm and an emission filter at 580 nm.","Pharmacokinetic","Experiments were done using BALB-c female mice, 10 weeks old. Compounds were dissolved in selected vehicles at a concentration calculated in order to administer the dose selected in 0.1 mL. Animals were administered by i.v and oral route (by gavage), and sacrificed at different time points (n=3 at each time point). Time points were 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4 and 8 h for the i.v branch, and 0.08, 0.16, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 8 and 24 h for oral branch. Blood was collected and processed for plasma which was analyzed and quantified by means of tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data to a compartmental model using Winnonlin software for pharmacokinetic analysis.","Cellular Mode of Action","Cell Culture:","The cell lines are obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). U20S (human osteosarcoma) is cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). PC3 (human prostate carcinoma), MCF(human breast cardinoma), HCT116 (human colon carcinoma), 768-0 (human neuroblastoma), U251 (human glyoblastoma) are grown in RPMI. All media are supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) and antibiotics-antimycotics. Cells are maintained in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% COand passaged when confluent using trypsin\/EDTA.","Cytotoxicity Assessment","Cell viability in the presence of test compounds is measured by the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, commercially available from Promega Corp., Madison, Wis. This homogeneous assay method is based on the recombinant expression of Coleoptera luciferase (U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,024; U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,713; U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,670) and determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88; U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677). The CellTiterGlo\u00ae Assay was conducted in 96 making it amenable to automated highthroughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404).","The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells\/well in a 96-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing.","The homogeneous \u201cadd-mix-measure\u201d format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay generates a \u201cglow-type\u201d luminescent signal, produced by the luciferase reaction, which has a half-life generally greater than five hours, depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). The substrate, Beetle Luciferin, is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. The extended half-life eliminates the need to use reagent injectors and provides flexibility for continuous or batch mode processing of multiple plates. This cell proliferation assay can be used with various multiwell formats, e.g. 96 or 384 well format. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as relative light units (RLU), measured over time.","PI3K Cellular Activity (Elisa Assay)","Activity is measured as endogenous levels of phospho-Akt1 (Ser473) protein. Osteosarcoma U20S cells are plated in 96 Poly-D-Lysine coating tissue culture plates (18.000 cells\/well). After the treatment with serial dilutions of the compound during 3 h, the cells are fixed directly in the wells with 4% paraformaldehyde.","After fixing, individual wells go through the same series of steps used for a conventional immunoblot: including blocking with 5% BSA, incubation with 1\/1000 of primary antibody-AKT (Ser 74) in PBS containing 5% BSA at 4\u00b0 C. overnight (Cell Signalling), washing and incubation with second antibody HRP-anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at RT (Amersham). After the addition of SuperSignal ELISA Femto maximum sensitivity chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) the results are read using a luminescence plate reader (Victor).","PIM-1 Cellular Assay (BAD S112 Phosphorylation Inhibition Assay)","The efficacy of compounds of the invention in inhibiting BAD phosphorylation was measured by an In Cell ELISA.
