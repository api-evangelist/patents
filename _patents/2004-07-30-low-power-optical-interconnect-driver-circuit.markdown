{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application 60\/491,496 filed on Jul. 31, 2003, which is incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was partially made with U.S. Government support from the U.S. Navy under contracts #N00178-03-C-1024 and #N00178-04-C-1034. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates generally to optical interconnect driver circuits, and, more particularly to systems and methods for driving a light emitting semiconductor device.","In optical interconnect systems, when the interconnect channel density becomes many hundreds of interconnects and even greater per square inch, the thermal gradients and thermal dissipation in the interconnect elements themselves become a major issue. This undesirable trait costs the system even more energy to extract this thermal load from the interconnect component area, particularly when active cooling devices such as thermo-electric (Peltier) coolers are required.","The use of VCSELs for optical data links is well established in the art. The laser elements in these links are driven by a multitude of electronic devices at various power levels, data rates and duty cycles. Typically, these VCSEL systems are designed to switch or modulate within a linear region of lasing operation. This is accomplished by electrically biasing the laser element above the lasing threshold and into its linear mode of operation. For fastest modulation capability, e.g., in the multi-gigaHertz regime, the VCSELs are biased above the lasing threshold to take advantage of the fast stimulated-emission based response times.","The main contributors of power dissipation in a typical (biased) VCSEL based system are the constant current bias through the VCSEL, the magnitude of the signal current applied to the VCSEL element and the energy required for the supporting driving circuits.","Further, in optical interconnects, manufacture and alignment techniques may require accurate positioning of the interconnect components. This active positioning can be facilitated by active alignment techniques.","Lower power dissipation is almost always desirable. The need for lower power dissipation is even further accentuated in cryogenic application (such as, intra-Dewar environments). In a Dewar environment, traditional optical data links become prohibitive due to the undesired thermal load contributions to the cold side of the Dewar system.","Based on the above, there is a need to provide a circuit for driving a VCSEL based optical link while dissipating very low levels of thermal energy.","There is also a need to provide a low power driver circuit suitable for high density optical interconnects and thermally sensitive applications such as in cryogenic Dewars.","Furthermore, there is a need to provide a low power circuit and optical interconnect modulation scheme for driving Light Emitting Diode (LED) based optical interconnects.","There is also a need to provide a low power circuit and optical interconnect modulation scheme.","There is also a need to provide a low power circuit that provides for active alignment.","There is also a need to provide a low power electronic driver circuit and optical emitter.","The needs set forth above as well as further and other needs and advantages of the present invention are achieved by the embodiments of the invention described herein below.","A driver circuit for a light emitting semiconductor device is disclosed.","In one embodiment, the present invention is in the form of a driver circuit made up of an RC differentiator circuit. In that embodiment, the RC circuit differentiates a conventional digital waveform, providing short duration current pulses to a light emitting semiconductor device, such as, but not limited to, a VCSEL or other light emitter, or, more generally, to an electrical wire or waveguide, thereby emitting pulses which act to transfer the data or signal. In one embodiment, the driver circuit of this invention includes a capacitor connected between a source of voltage pulses and a terminal of the light emitting semiconductor device, and, a diode connected in parallel to the light emitting semiconductor device. The diode is located such that a direction of forward current flow of the diode being opposite to a forward current flow direction of the light emitting semiconductor device.","While the embodiments disclosed below are for the case of a VCSEL, the present invention is readily applied to other optical emitters such as, but not limited to, LEDs, to other light emitting semiconductor junction device and also to reducing the power transmitted down wires and electrical waveguides. In one embodiment of the invention the shape of the current pulse through the light emitting semiconductor device is determined by the resistivity of the light emitting semiconductor device and a capacitor forming an electrical RC differentiator circuit.","In one embodiment of the circuit of this invention, the light emitting semiconductor device is driven from a completely OFF condition (no bias used), through the non-linear region of operation to a point above the lasing threshold, but still providing a predictable photonic output. During circuit operation the only power dissipated is during the interval when the capacitor charges or discharges; there is substantially no DC current component (except for leakage currents and the like). The current through the light emitting semiconductor device is both time dependent and intermittent. The charging or discharging is a dynamic one-time event, regardless of the resting state of the input logic signal. Moreover, in many embodiments substantially low capacitance values can be used, which results in a low load burden on the driving input signal.","The driver circuit of the present invention can reduce the power dissipation substantially by using a pulsed driver scheme that passively reduces the duty cycle of the data stream.","In embodiments of the driver circuit of this invention, a light emitting semiconductor device (a VCSEL in one embodiment) can be modulated ON\/OFF in a controlled, pulsed duty cycle without the burden of the extra power requirement normally associated with the circuit elements controlling pulse width and bias requirements. This can allow for a comparatively low, overall power dissipation in an optical interconnect system.","For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects thereof, reference is made to the accompanying drawings and detailed description and its scope will be pointed out in the appended claims.","A driver circuit for a light emitting semiconductor device is disclosed hereinbelow.","An embodiment  of the driver circuit of this invention for driving a light emitting semiconductor device (a VCSEL in the embodiment shown) is shown in .","Referring to , the embodiment  of the driver circuit of this invention includes a capacitor  connected between a source of voltage pulses  and a terminal  of the light emitting semiconductor device  (a VCSEL  in the embodiment shown), the light emitting semiconductor device  being connected so that a forward current flow direction of the light emitting semiconductor device (indicated by the pointed portion of the symbol used to represent the light emitting semiconductor device ) is away from the terminal , and, a diode  connected in parallel to the light emitting semiconductor device . The diode  is connected so that a direction of forward current flow of the diode  is opposite to the forward current flow direction of the light emitting semiconductor device . In the embodiment shown, the diode  and the light emitting semiconductor device  are both connected to ground . It should be noted that an embodiment in which the light emitting semiconductor device  is connected so that a forward current flow direction of the light emitting semiconductor device  is toward the terminal  is also within the scope of this invention.","\u201cVoltage pulses\u201d (also referred as input signals or input voltage signals) as used herein refers to time dependent voltage signals such as, but not limited, digital signals, sinusoidal signals or other time varying voltage signals.","The embodiment  of the driver circuit of this invention is a RC differentiator circuit comprised of the capacitor  (Cx) and the internal resistive component of the light emitting semiconductor device  (VCSEL). (The light emitting semiconductor device  has an internal resistive component and represents the resistance in the charge leg of the RC circuit.) The RC circuit path allows for a charge current of limited time duration and magnitude to pass through the light emitting semiconductor device . The diode  (Dx, also referred to as a protective device) provides a circuit path for the discharge current of the capacitor  (Cx) and also functions to protect the light emitting semiconductor device  from any possible damaging reverse voltage transient.","The embodiment  of the driver circuit of this invention, shown in , includes a resistor  connected in series with the capacitor  (Cx) and\/or another resistor  connected in series with the light emitting semiconductor device , the diode  being connected in parallel with the series combination of other resistor  and the light emitting semiconductor device . Circuit functionality is unchanged but this embodiment can allow for additional tailoring of duration and magnitude of the pulse currents. In certain applications it may be desirable to tailor capacitor charge rates to allow a greater range of capacitor values and limit current\/voltage rise rates (thereby altering the pulse shape of the optical emission).","The embodiment  of the driver circuit of this invention shown in  includes two light emitting semiconductor devices ,  (VCSEL devices in the embodiment shown) wired in parallel and having opposite polarities (also referred to as one light emitting semiconductor device  and the other light emitting semiconductor device  are located, positioned or oriented such that a direction of forward current flow of the one light emitting semiconductor device  is opposite to the forward current flow direction of the other light emitting semiconductor device ) allowing one semiconductor device to emit radiation at the rising edge of the input signal and the other to emit radiation at the falling edge of the input signal. The capacitor  charges through one light emitting semiconductor device (VCSEL)  and discharges through the second light emitting semiconductor device (VCSEL) . In this embodiment, the second light emitting semiconductor device (VCSEL)  replaces the diode  in . This mode of operation can be used to provide an error check or error reduction in data integrity using a differential optical channel scheme. This embodiment can potentially enable lower optical power levels and overall lower power dissipation, using techniques such as synchronous detection or temporal filtering. Primary circuit functionality and benefits are substantially unchanged.","The embodiment  of the driver circuit of this invention shown in  includes another diode  connected in series with the light emitting semiconductor device . In one embodiment, the other diode  may enhance reverse recovery characteristics of the light emitting semiconductor device  (VCSEL) current path. If the light emitting semiconductor device  (VCSEL device) has a poor reverse recovery characteristic (for example, but not limited to, slow response to a reverse bias) the light emitting semiconductor device  (VCSEL) will be conducting for a time interval when switching from a forward biased mode to a reversed bias mode. For example, the additional diode can be selected for an improved reverse recovery characteristic, thus decreasing or limiting the reverse bias on-time current in the VCSEL branch of the circuit, therefore, decreasing the amount of overall thermal energy dissipated by the VCSEL. Primary circuit functionality is substantially unchanged.","The embodiment  of the driver circuit of this invention shown in  includes a full wave bridge rectifier . The full wave bridge rectifier  includes four diodes , , ,  and four terminals , , , . A first diode  and a second diode  are connected to an upper terminal . The first diode  is connected between the upper terminal  and one center terminal  and the second diode  is connected between the upper terminal  and another center terminal . The first  and second  diodes are connected such that the first  and second  diodes have opposite directions of forward current flow, as shown in . A third diode  is connected between one center terminal  and a lower terminal . A fourth diode  is connected between the other center terminal  and the lower terminal . The third diode  and the first diode  are connected such the third diode  and the first diode  have opposite directions of forward current flow. The fourth diode  and the second diode  are connected such that the fourth diode  and the second diode  have opposite directions of forward current flow. The light emitting semiconductor device  is connected between one center terminal  and the other center terminal . The light emitting semiconductor device (VCSEL in the embodiment shown)  is connected so that the forward current flow direction of the light emitting semiconductor device  enables current flow for any direction of current flow between the upper terminal  and lower terminal . This embodiment allows a single light emitting semiconductor device  to emit radiation at either input signal  transition edge. The rectifier bridge  steers both the capacitor  charge (the capacitor  is connected between the source  of voltage pulses and the upper terminal ) and discharge currents through the light emitting semiconductor device  (VCSEL) and can provide dual edge emission for a single data pulse. Such an effect can allow, for example, using techniques such as synchronous detection or temporal filtering to minimize data bit error rates in an optical interconnect link.","It should be noted that, as in , in the embodiment shown in , a resistor can be connected in series with the capacitor . Such an embodiment can allow for additional tailoring of duration and magnitude of the pulse currents.","The embodiment  of the driver circuit of this invention shown in  includes a series combination of a resistor  connected in series with a Zener diode , the series combination being connected in parallel with the capacitor . The Zener diode  is connected so that a voltage across the capacitor  reverse biases the Zener diode. This embodiment can allow for selective operation of the light emitting semiconductor device  (VCSEL) in a DC mode by allowing the input signal  amplitude to exceed the turn-on threshold of the Zener diode (Dz) . This can facilitate alignment, calibration, and testing of the light emitting semiconductor device  (VCSEL) and also can allow for the light emitting semiconductor device  (VCSEL) to be pulsed directly, substantially bypassing the capacitor . When the input voltage signal remains below the Zener diode voltage threshold the circuit again reverts to functioning as an RC differentiator.","Referring to , the embodiment  of the driver circuit of this invention includes a capacitor  connected between a source of voltage pulses  and a terminal  of the light emitting semiconductor device  (a VCSEL  in the embodiment shown), the light emitting semiconductor device  being connected so that a forward current flow direction (also referred to as a preferred direction) of the light emitting semiconductor device (indicated by the pointed portion of the symbol used to represent the light emitting semiconductor device ) is away from the terminal , and, a resistor  connected in parallel to the light emitting semiconductor device . It should be noted that embodiments in which another resistor is connected in series with the capacitor  or\/and another resistor is connected in series with the light emitting semiconductor device  (placing the series combination in parallel with the first resistor) are also within the scope of this invention.","In the embodiments presented herein above, the charge in the capacitor  is changed by charging or discharging through an RC circuit. A path for the flow of current is provided through the light emitting semiconductor device , either preferentially in one of the two directions of current flow produced by the change in the charge in the capacitor (as in , where the forward direction of current flow through the light emitting semiconductor device corresponds to charging the capacitor for one embodiment of voltage polarity) or for both directions of current flow produced by the change in the charge in the capacitor (as in ).","In the embodiments shown in  above, connecting the RC differentiator circuit comprised of the capacitor  and a resistance to the source  of voltage pulses provides means for changing charge in the capacitor . (In , the resistance is the internal resistive component of the light emitting semiconductor device  in parallel with the internal resistive component of the diode . In , the resistance is provided by resistors  in series with the parallel combination of the series combination, resistor  in series with the internal resistive component of the light emitting semiconductor device , and the internal resistive component of the diode . In , the resistance is provided by the internal resistive component of the light emitting semiconductor device  in parallel with the internal resistive component of the other light emitting semiconductor device . In , the resistance is provided by the parallel combination of the internal resistive component of the other diode  in series with the internal resistive component of the light emitting semiconductor device  and the internal resistive component of the diode . In , the resistance is provided by the combined resistance of the internal resistive component of the diodes , , ,  and the internal resistive component of the light emitting semiconductor device .) Means for providing a path for flow of current through the light emitting semiconductor device are provided by the connecting the light emitting semiconductor device (including the internal resistive component of the light emitting semiconductor device) to the capacitor as shown in .","Although various embodiments of this invention that include series resistors have been shown above, it should be noted that other embodiments including resistors in series with the capacitor, the light emitting semiconductor device, the protective devices (including those in the full wave rectifier), or the Zener diode are within the scope of this invention. A resistor in series with any component will not alter the primary circuit functionality and, therefore, the embodiment would be within the scope of this invention.","It should be noted that although in the embodiments of ,  and , a forward direction of current flow of the light emitting semiconductor device is shown, embodiments are possible in which the forward direction of current flow of the light emitting semiconductor device is opposite that shown.","Although the invention has been described with respect to various embodiments, it should be realized this invention is also capable of a wide variety of further and other embodiments within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
