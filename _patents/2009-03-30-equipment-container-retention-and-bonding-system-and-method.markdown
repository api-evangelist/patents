{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The Government of the United States of America has rights in this invention pursuant to contract no. N00019-03-G-0014\/0009, awarded by the United States Navy (USN).","Space is often limited for vehicle-mounted equipment boxes containing electronic equipment. To efficiently use the available space, the vehicle-mounted equipment boxes are frequently designed to fit within a small area with very little clearance between the equipment boxes being mounted and other equipment boxes in the surrounding space. The close proximity of equipment boxes makes it difficult to access and securely tighten fasteners to secure the equipment boxes. One way of mounting the equipment boxes in a small area with very little clearance is using dagger pins that are typically mounted in the bottom or least accessible portion of the equipment box mounting area.","The equipment boxes also typically require an electrical bonding path for grounding the equipment box. Frequently, the dagger pin has been used to provide the electrical bonding path for grounding the equipment box. However, while dagger pins are effective for securing equipment boxes in vehicles, dagger pins do not provide a reliable electrical bonding path due to interface tolerances necessary to permit equipment box alignment and installation on the dagger pins. Since both non-spring loaded mounting dagger pins and spring loaded mounting dagger pins rely on direct surface-to-surface physical contact between the dagger pin and contact plate to form the electrical bonding path, the resulting electrical bonding path is frequently intermittent even under non-vibration environment conditions. This results in an ineffective Electrical Magnetic Interference\/Electrical Magnetic Compatibility (EMI\/EMC) shielding of the equipment box, which can cause unstable operation of the electronics in the equipment box.","Further, the electrical resistance of the ground path provided by existing dagger pins is typically significantly greater than 2.5 milli-ohms, which is the desired upper limit. Vibrations that may be present during operation in a vehicle environment exacerbate the intermittent electrical bonding path problem.","Prior attempts to solve this problem have included using electrically conductive spring fingers, non-painted contact surfaces and bonding straps. The electrically conductive spring fingers are not effective because the electrically conductive spring fingers can lose resiliency and can break without warning, particularly under the vibration conditions present during operation in a vehicle, in addition, using electrically conductive spring fingers requires retrofit of existing electronics boxes with hard conductive pads positioned to interface with the electrically conductive spring fingers. Using non-painted contact surfaces is also not desirable because they cause the bare surfaces of the equipment box and bare portions of the mounting structure to be much less corrosion resistant and more subject to wear, and surface corrosion on these surfaces causes intermittent loss of bonding, especially under vibration and load conditions. Bonding straps also are not desirable because these add additional hardware and requires modification of the equipment boxes and the vehicle mounting structure, and add additional steps for the removal and installation of the equipment boxes, which is not desirable.","What is needed is a system and method for providing a reliable electrical bonding path for equipment boxes under non-vibratory and vibratory conditions to ensure proper operation of electronic equipment contained in vehicle-mounted equipment boxes without major modification to the equipment boxes or the vehicle mounting structure.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an equipment container electronics box retention and bonding system comprising a mounting tray, a dagger pin block assembly and at least one fastening mechanism positioned to engage the equipment container on the side directly opposite to the mounting dagger pin for securing the equipment container in the mounting tray. The dagger pin block assembly comprising a mounting dagger pin and a bonding member retained on a surface of the dagger pin block assembly through which the mounting dagger pin extends, and the bonding member is formed of a compressive electrically conductive material. The mounting tray including at least one electrically conductive pad with the dagger pin block assembly being secured to the mounting tray and in contact with the at least one electrically conductive pad. The equipment container electronics box including at least one contact surface located on an exterior surface of the equipment container, the contact surface being formed of an electrically conductive material and having an alignment hole in a central portion thereof. When the fastening mechanism secures the equipment container in the mounting tray, the mounting dagger pin of the dagger pin block assembly engages in the alignment hole in the at least one contact surface on the equipment container electronics box to form an EMI\/EMC bonding connection between the mounting tray and the equipment container having an electrical resistance of less than 2.5 milli-ohms under vibration conditions encountered during use of the system.","The system and method of the present invention is significantly better than existing electrical bonding methods because the created bonding path is reliably formed having an electrical resistance of less than 2.5 milli-ohms, which is a desired upper limit, without requiring any special provisions or modifications to existing equipment containers, vehicle mounting trays or mounting structures. Further, the electrical bonding connection does not require any tools or loose hardware, such as bonding straps.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the bonding member is retained on the surface of the dagger pin block assembly by captive hardware.

In another embodiment, the dagger pin block assembly further comprises a groove formed in the surface of the dagger pin block assembly that retainably engages at least a portion of the compressible bonding member, wherein the bonding member is retained on the surface of the dagger pin block assembly in a groove formed in the surface of the dagger pin block assembly that retainably engages at least a portion of the bonding member.","In other embodiments of the equipment container retention and bonding mounting system, the bonding member is retained on the surface of the dagger pin block assembly by a clamshell retaining mechanism that attaches to one or more surfaces of the dagger pin block assembly.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the bonding member is formed of at least one conductive metal such as, aluminum, silver, titanium, copper, brass, steel, steel plated with copper, tin or alloys thereof. The thickness of the bonding member is larger than the tolerance gap of the retention hardware.
