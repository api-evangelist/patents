U.S. Pat. No. 3,135,555, issued to MeCaskey, is directed to a safety guard for hydraulic hoists. As shown in , the body frame  of a dump truck body  is raised and lowered via two hydraulic rams . The rams  have a cylinder  and a rod  that is coupled at its free end  via bosses  to a cross rod  as shown in . A safety guard  is shown in  for embracing the rod  and locking the hydraulic ram in an extended condition. The guard  comprises a tube  split lengthwise to provide half sections  and  that are hingedly connected so as to open up for fitting around the rod  of an hydraulic ram. The two guard halves  and  are preferably connected along one meeting line () by a single piano hinge . At the other meeting line , two ears  and  are welded to the half sections  and . Each of the ears has a bore through which a locking means  such as a hook, pin, bolt or the like can be used to hold the ears together. In the embodiment shown in the figures, a bolt  extends through the bores and is secured by a nut .","In U.S. Pat. No. 3,157,435, issued to Sherven, a safety device is shown for use on dump trucks, trailers, and similar vehicles.  illustrate the. structural features of safety prop A. A flat baseplate , which is adapted for mounting on one of the cross members of the truck frame B, is equipped with a pair of laterally spaced upstanding apertured lugs ,  into which a hinge pin  is received and held in place by cotter pins . As shown in  and , the axis of hinge pin  is generally horizontal permitting safety prop A to rotate in a limited vertical plane with respect to frame B of truck C. Further included is hollow generally elongated cylindrical supporting member or barrel  having a solid lower end plate  from which extend longitudinally therefrom a pair of spaced apertured lugs ,  adapted to pivotally mount upon hinge pin  between lugs  and  of base plate .

The opposite end of the split cylindrical sleeve engages the boom .","While the above noted devices are beneficial to some degree, they each have limitations that do not make them suitable for use in supporting elevated antenna platforms such as those used by the U.S. Army.","Improperly designed mechanical structures can have catastrophic consequences when such structures fail. One such example involves the gusset plates on the Interstate 35 bridge in Minnesota. Old photos of the bridge show two gusset plates that were visibly bent as far back as 2003. That was four years before the bridge span collapsed into the Mississippi River. In that incident, 13 people were killed.","Another incident involves the Nov. 15, 1988 collapse of the 300 foot telescope in Green Bank, W. Va. It was discovered that the collapse was the result of the sudden failure of a gusset plate in the box girder which provided the main support for the antenna.","In the case of the AN\/TPQ-37(V)9 Radar Antenna, there has been one unfortunate accident in which the antenna fell during maintenance and a soldier was killed.
