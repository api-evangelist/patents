These follow-up actions may also depend on rules and policies defined in the database. For example, cancellation processor  may determine if a relisting should take place after an order cancellation. This decision may be based on the membership status of the seller, the reason for cancellation and also other user\/transaction attributes.","Another example of follow-up actions may be reward cancellation. Given that a reward may be issued when a transaction takes place, the reverse of reward may follow an order cancellation. Cancellation processor  may send a reward cancellation request  to reward module . Both cancellation process  and reward module  may determine how the reward should be reversed.","Yet another example of the follow-up actions may be a refund request . Cancellation processor  may determine how the refund should be executed based on rules and policies. For example, buyer  may qualify for full refund in the original form of payment instrument if buyer  is in certain membership statuses; otherwise, buyer  may receive refund in the form of credits.","After the execution of the cancellation, cancellation processor  may update networked databases to reflect the cancellation and associated changes. Finally, cancellation processor  may notify membership status evaluation module  of the change of parameters attributable to the membership status evaluation. Thus, membership status evaluation module  may then re-evaluate the membership status for buyer  and seller  involved in the transaction.","It is to be appreciated that the roles of the cancellation processor and the external module are inter-changeable. For example, the amount of fund, the instruments of the refund and how the refund should be executed may be determined either in cancellation processor  or payment sub module  or both.","Membership Statuses and Corresponding Prerequisites","As illustrated in , in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, six membership statuses are included, which are default membership status  and membership status A-E. Each membership status, other than a default membership status , may be associated with a corresponding prerequisite, preferably a set of non-conflicting conditions.","The universe of membership prerequisite condition  is preferably a collection of possible mutually exclusive conditions, more preferably all possible mutually exclusive conditions. A condition may be anything that a member may achieve. A list of exemplary conditions includes but is not limited to: membership registration, 5 lifetime purchases, 3 sales within the last 10 days, cancellation rate of 20% or less, and composition of 3 product reviews with a helpfulness rate of 90% or above.","Inside this universe, there are preferably 5 prerequisites, namely prerequisites A-E, each being associated to one membership status. More specifically, in accordance with an embodiment, prerequisite A is associated with membership status A, prerequisite B is associated with membership status B, prerequisite C is associated with membership status C, prerequisite D is associated with membership status D, and prerequisite E is associated with membership status E. If one member fulfills a specific prerequisite exclusively, said member may be assigned to the membership status associated with the prerequisite. For example, if a member fulfills the prerequisite A exclusively, it will be assigned the membership status A. If a member does not fulfill any of the membership prerequisite A through E, it may be assigned the default membership status . It is to be appreciated that there is no limit to the number of prerequisites, membership statuses and conditions in implementation,","For simple illustration of the relationship between prerequisites and conditions, the following exemplary conditions and prerequisites are defined. This embodiment of universe of conditions includes 9 mutually exclusive conditions defined numerically as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and five prerequisites A, B, C, D and E, as discussed above. The elements are showed as followed:","UNIVERSE OF CONDITIONS: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]","PREREQUISITE A: [1, 2, 4, 5]","PREREQUISITE B: [1, 2, 3, 6]","PREREQUISITE C: [1, 2, 3, 6, 8]","PREREQUISITE D: [9]","PREREQUISITE E: [1, 3, 4, 7]","If the prerequisite is a set of non-conflicting conditions, it is possible that a member fulfils multiple prerequisites if the union of the conditions of the said prerequisites are non-conflicting. For example, if a member fulfills non-conflicting conditions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], then this member may fulfill prerequisite A, B and E at the same time. Should this situation occur, it may be preferred to have a rule to correctly determine the membership status of the said member. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a priority system is introduced to ensure deterministic assignment of unique membership status to a member. More specifically, each membership status may contain a priority attribute to resolve the possible overlap of multiple prerequisites at the same time. For example, membership status A has a priority higher than those of membership statuses B and E while membership status B may have a priority higher than that of membership status E. If a member fulfills the conditions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], this member may be assigned the membership status A because membership status A has a priority higher than those of membership statuses B and E. If a prerequisite B is a subset of prerequisite C, prerequisite C may be more restrictive than prerequisite B. Should the described situation occurs, the member may not be assigned the membership status C unless the membership status C has a priority higher than that of the membership status B.","In an embodiment of the present invention, each membership with non-conflicting prerequisite may have a unique priority to ensure predictable membership status assignment. As a prerequisite is merely a set of conditions, a member's membership status may shift from one to another as the set of conditions the member fulfills changes. For example, member will change from membership status B to membership status C if the member fulfills the new condition A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0230","num":"0229"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},"According to , there may be infinite number of membership statuses, including a membership status A , a membership status B , a membership status C  and so on. There is a prerequisite associated with each membership status. Upon fulfilling a specific set of prerequisite, the member is assigned the corresponding membership status of said prerequisite. E-commerce system  preferably treats the member according to the membership policies. For example, for membership status A , the prerequisite may include requirements A, A, A . . . AN. If a member fulfills all the requirements and reaches the membership status A, e-commerce system  treats the member according to a policy A . The policy may be a combination of predetermined and dynamic terms and benefits.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the highest membership status (membership status A) has the strictest prerequisite but holds the most privileged policy. Using the cancellation policy as an example, membership status A may have a prerequisite of lifetime and recurring fulfillment rate of 95% or less and may hold a policy that allows unconditional cancellation\/return with full refund guarantee.","Membership status C may be a default status, which members begin from this level of membership once they sign up for services. In reality, there may be multiple default statuses in order to separate members into different from the very beginning. The default membership status C may have a stricter prerequisite and holds a less privileged policy. Using the cancellation policies as an example again, it may have a prerequisite of lifetime fulfillment rate of 70% or more and may hold a policy that allows cancellation within 24 hours with full refund.","In order to encourage constructive participation and discourage destructive members, a membership status X may be created for abusive or non-cooperative members. The membership status X may have the least strict prerequisite and hold the strictest policy. For example, using the cancellation policies as an example, a member with a lifetime fulfillment rate of 30% or less may qualify for membership status X. With the strictest policy enforced in this membership status category, policies for the members may include cancellation of orders only within 24 hours from placing the order and payment refunds only as credit for future purchase. This cancellation system may resemble a negative feedback control system, in which seller's cancellation and order fulfillment resemble a negative and a positive signal respectively. Each membership status may represent a state in which a seller can reside. As buyer  cancels an order (negative signal), his or her membership status is driven to a state with stricter policy and less privilege. With a stricter policy and less privilege, buyer 's likelihood to abuse the e-commerce platform or the seller attenuates, and thus may lead to a lower order cancellation rate. Should this occurs, buyer  may be inclined to complete more orders with fewer cancellations and drive the membership status up. Thus, cancellation module  preferably attenuates\/discourages buyer 's abusive cancellation.","In yet another example, buyer  starts with the membership status C. Due to the order cancellations, buyer 's may not qualify for the minimum requirement for membership status C anymore. In transition , membership status evaluation module  may re-assign buyer  to an inferior membership status . As buyer  completes more orders (positive signal), buyer 's membership status may be driven to a state with less strict policy and more privileges. For example, while buyer  may start with membership status C, after buyer  completes more orders, membership status evaluation module  may detect change of parameters that govern the membership status and new membership status may be assigned to buyer .","Relisting after Cancellation","A relisting mechanism may be incorporated into cancellation module  and purchase\/sale module . Upon cancellation, a listing may be relisted automatically or manually under predetermined rules. These rules may reside in rule\/policy database  and\/or defined elsewhere.","As illustrated in , in step , an order cancellation is accepted by the cancellation module . The routine proceeds to step , where cancellation module  determines where seller  meets the requirements for auto-relisting. This requirement may be based on seller's membership status, reason of cancellation or any other factors that cancellation module  may retrieve. If seller  qualifies for auto-relisting, the branch \u201cYES\u201d may be followed to step  and the branch \u201cNO\u201d may be followed to step  otherwise.","In step , cancellation module  may further determine if seller  opts for the auto-relisting feature. If seller  does not opt for auto-relisting, the branch \u201cNO\u201d may be followed to step , or alternatively, the branch \u201cYES\u201d may be followed to step . In step , purchase\/sale module  may offer different relisting options, such as discounts.","In step , purchase\/sale module  preferably checks if the original listing has a remaining quantity for sale at the moment of the order cancellation. If the listing still has a remaining quantity for sell, the \u201cYES\u201d branch may be followed to step  where the inventory may be updated with the new quantity. If step  does not have any remaining inventory from original listing, the branch \u201cNO\u201d may be followed to step  where the cancellation module sends a relisting request to purchase\/sale module .","Buyer Triggered Cancellation","An order includes a mutual agreement between buyer  and seller  to exchange goods or service for financial return, regardless of whether it was actually fulfilled or canceled. A canceled order may be an order that is terminated either by buyer  or seller .","The fulfillment count and the non-fulfillment count may be the number of orders completed and the number of the order canceled by a user, respectively. The total order count may be the number of orders associated with the user. However, an order can be ignored and taken out of the calculation of fulfillment count, non-fulfillment count, total order count, etc. It is to be appreciated that an order can be taken out of the calculation towards one user's fulfillment rate while remaining in another user's fulfillment rate. For example, a canceled order may be ignored in calculating the seller's fulfillment count and total order count while taken into account of the buyer's fulfillment count and total order count.","The fulfillment rate may be the ratio of fulfillment count to total order count. The non-fulfillment rate or cancellation rate may be the ratio of non-fulfillment count to number of orders placed.","It is to be appreciated that the definition of fulfillment and nonfulfillment can be defined arbitrarily with a specific set of rules. In one aspect of an embodiment of the present invention, the nonfulfillment count attributes only to the party that causes the cancellation. For example, if buyer  canceled the order because he had changed his mind, this canceled order will be counted toward the buyer's nonfulfillment count but not the seller's. Should this situation occurs, the fulfillment rate and non-fulfillment rate will not be add up to 1 but a number smaller than 1. The missing portion attributes to the number of orders that is taken out of the equation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0244","num":"0243"},"figref":"FIG. 29A","b":["3005","210","3010","2660","2660","2640","2695"]},"If cancellation request is rejected by any of these two modules, the \u201cNO\u201d branch is followed to step A where request processing module  rejects the cancellation request by buyer . If the cancellation request is granted, the \u201cYES\u201d branch is followed to step A where cancellation processor  processes the cancellation.","During request for cancellation, buyer may specify the reason of cancellation. Buyer  may be presented with a survey inquiring the reason of cancellation. Based on the answer provided, cancellation processor  may analyze buyer's cancellation reasons to determine if buyer  should assumes the responsibility of canceling the order. Specifically, if the reason for cancellation is because he changed his mind, cancellation processor  may conclude that buyer  is responsible for the cancellation. Alternatively, if seller  states that the goods are out of stock, buyer  does not assume any responsibility.","If buyer  assumes the responsibility, the \u201cYES\u201d branch may be followed to step A where cancellation processor  may increase the buyer's non-fulfillment count and total order count by 1. Upon the change of the non-fulfillment count, membership status evaluation module  may re-evaluate buyer 's membership status based on the new fulfillment rate. Membership status evaluation module  may assign a new membership status to buyer  if a membership status change occurs.","Referring again to step A, if buyer  does not assume the responsibility, the \u201cNO\u201d branch is followed to step A where cancellation module  may survey seller  about the cancellation reasons. Upon receiving the cancellation reasons from seller , the routine may proceed from step A to step A where cancellation processor  may determine if seller  assumes responsibility for the cancellation. If seller  assumes the responsibility, the \u201cYES\u201d branch may be followed to step A where cancellation processor  increments seller's non-fulfillment count and total order count by 1.","Referring again to step A, if seller  does not assume the responsibility, the \u201cNO\u201d branch may be followed to step A where cancellation processor  increments both parties' nonfulfillment count and total order count by 1. In step A, membership status evaluation module  may re-evaluate the membership statuses of both parties based on the new fulfillment rates. In step A, membership status evaluation module  may re-assign membership statuses if any change occurs.","Seller Triggered Cancellation","Preferably, the routine begins at step B where seller  specifies the reason of cancellation and requests a cancellation. Seller  may be presented a survey inquiring the reason of cancellation. Based on the answer provided, cancellation processor  determines the party to which the cancellation is attributed.","Preferably, in step B, cancellation request is first tested by request processing module  to determine if the request should be granted based on some predetermined requirements. If the request is not rejected by request processing module , it may be tested again by cancellation processor  based on rules and policies defined in rules & policies database . If the cancellation request is rejected by any of these two modules, the \u201cNO\u201d branch may be followed to step B where request processing module  rejects the cancellation request by seller .","Referring again to step B, if the cancellation request can be granted, the \u201cYES\u201d branch may be followed to step B where request processing module  analyzes seller's cancellation reasons to determine if seller  assumes the responsibility for order cancellation. More specifically, if the reason for cancellation is because the seller runs out of stock, request processing module  may attribute the responsibility to seller . Alternatively, if seller  claims that buyer  does not want to proceed with the completion of the order, seller  may not assume any responsibility. If seller  assumes the responsibility, the \u201cYES\u201d branch may be followed to step B where request processing module  increments the seller's non-fulfillment count and total order count by 1. If seller  does not assume the responsibility, the \u201cNO\u201d branch may be followed to step B where cancellation processor  processes the cancellation. Cancellation processor  may also determine and delegate any of the following post-cancellation procedures (e.g. re-listing, reward reverse, payment refund and the like) according to seller's membership status at the moment the order was made.","In step B, cancellation module  may survey buyer  about the cancellation reasons. Upon receiving the cancellation reasons from buyer , the routine may proceed to step B where cancellation processor  determines if buyer  assumes that the responsibility of cancellation. If buyer  assumes the responsibility, the \u201cYES\u201d branch may be followed to step B where cancellation processor  increments buyer's non-fulfillment count and total order count by 1.","Referring again to step B, if buyer  does not assume the responsibility, the \u201cNO\u201d branch may be followed to step B where cancellation processor  increments both parties' nonfulfillment count and total order count by 1. In step B, membership status evaluation module  may re-evaluate the membership statuses of both parties based on the new fulfillment rate. In step B, membership status evaluation module  may re-assign membership statuses if any change occurs.","Whereas the fulfillment rate and the non-fulfillment rate may be assumed to be the ratio of the fulfillment count and non-fulfillment count to the total order count, respectively. It is to be appreciated that the fulfillment rate and the non-fulfillment rate could be any rate that is positively related to the number of order completed and canceled with respect to the number of all order placed.","Preferably, in this dynamic cancellation policy, both buyer  and seller  have nothing to gain by changing only his or her own strategy unilaterally because neither buyer  nor seller  benefits by not assuming his or her responsibility for cancellation without the counter-party's confirmation.","In general, after an order is completed in step  of , both the buyer's and the seller's fulfillment counts and total order count may be incremented by one. At step , membership status evaluation module  may re-evaluate the membership statuses of buyer  and seller  and new membership statuses may be assigned to both parties if they were changed upon evaluation. It is to be appreciated that although fulfillment count is described herein as the sole parameter to determine the membership status, membership status can be based on various types and number of parameters and re-evaluated anytime any parameter is changed.","It is also to be appreciated that the definition of order completion may vary.
