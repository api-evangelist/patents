{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The prevalence of mobile devices leads to more and more location-based services that are accessible with mobile devices. Location-based services utilize the geographical position of the mobile devices and include services to identify the location of a person, object or service. The geographical location of a mobile device may be determined by a location engine of the mobile device based on, for example, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), a Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS) or an inertial navigation system (INS). Location-related information provided by the location engine, is utilized by one or more higher-layer software applications running on the mobile device that render one or more services to a user of the mobile device. As the location of a mobile device carried by a user is expected to change from time to time, there presently exist a few approaches for the location engine to report location-related information to one or more modules and applications of higher layer(s).","One of the approaches is for the location engine to provide location-related information according to a regular periodic reporting pattern. According to the regular periodic reporting pattern, the location engine provides, or reports, the location-related information to a module or application that needs the information periodically. For example, the location engine may provide location-related information with passage of every 1 second of time with updated location-related information. The reporting may be more frequent or less frequent depending on the particular need. In any case, the periodicity based on which the location engine reports the location-related information is set and does not change. Under this approach, the location engine reports the location-related information periodically irrespective of whether the location of the mobile device is changing or whether the application or module that utilizes the location-related information may still render the location-based service to the user with less frequent updates of the location-related information. From a perspective of power conservation, this approach may at times consume power unnecessarily.","Another approach is a one-time, on-request approach in that the location engine does not provide location-related information, unless it is requested by a module or an application to provide the location-related information. In terms of power conservation, this approach may be better than the above-described approach. However, this may be at the expense of accuracy of the provided location-related information. More specifically, as a given amount of time may be required for the location engine to obtain the latest geographical information of the mobile device, the location engine may not have the most up-to-date geographical information at the time when it receives the request for location-related information. For example, when the location engine uses GNSS to determine the geographical location of the mobile device, it takes a duration referred to as the time to first fix for the location engine to acquire satellite signals and navigation data to calculate a location solution. Accordingly, when the mobile device is on the move with its location continuously changing, this approach may be undesirable.","The Detailed Description references the accompanying figures. In the figures, the left-most digit(s) of a reference number identifies the figure in which the reference number first appears. The same numbers are used throughout the drawings to reference like features and components.","Disclosed herein are techniques, architectures, platforms, devices, framework, mechanisms and processes report location-related information according to an irregular periodic reporting pattern. The techniques enable the location engine to operate in irregular periodic reporting modes and dynamically adapt one or more different irregular periodic reporting patterns. The techniques may advantageously enable significant power saving while maintaining adequate accuracy in the reported location-related information to satisfy a given level of quality of service.","The techniques may be implemented as an extension of current location application programming interface (API). An API according to the present disclosure may enable both the operating system and the location engine to determine and negotiate on irregular periodic reporting patterns or the next reporting period. The request for location-related information to be reported on an irregular periodic reporting pattern may be initiated by higher OS, a communication layer (e.g., an application layer), or a lower-layer location engine component (e.g., a location protocol stack). Alternatively, the techniques may be implemented in the API, an application, a location engine, or a combination thereof. Each irregular periodic reporting pattern described herein has non-constant intervals between adjacent instances of reporting of the location-related information.","Example Framework",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","200"]},"As shown in , the framework  includes an application  that includes a decision function module , an API  that includes a decision function module , and a location engine  that includes a decision function . The application , API  and location engine  may be implemented in a mobile device  as shown in . The mobile device  is a portable electronic device that may be, for example, a tablet computer, a notebook computer, a laptop computer, a smartphone, a personal navigation device, a personal digital assistant or the like. In some embodiments, functions of the application  and\/or the API  are executed by a central processing unit (CPU) of the mobile device  while functions of the location engine  is executed by a separate processor, e.g., a GNSS-processing chip. In some embodiments, functions of some or all of the application , API  and location engine  are executed by the CPU or a single processor of the mobile device .","The application  may be an application that provides location-based services to a user of the mobile device  who, in turn, carries the mobile device  and the location of which changes from time to time. The decision function  of the application  is a portion of the application  that is capable of making decisions and executing operations with respect to the techniques of the present disclosure, and may be implemented as a set of instructions or code in the application  for example. The application  may execute one or more operations with respect to the techniques of the present disclosure as directed by the decision function .","The API  may be an API of the operating system (OS) of the mobile device . The API  is capable of initiating requests as well as forwarding messages and information between the Application  and the location engine . The decision function  of the API  is a portion of the API  that is capable of making decisions and executing operations with respect to the techniques of the present disclosure, and may be implemented as a set of instructions or code in the API  for example. The API  may execute one or more operations with respect to the techniques of the present disclosure as directed by the decision function .","The location engine  may be implemented in the form of software, firmware, hardware or a combination thereof. The location engine  may utilize the GNSS, WPS, INS, one or more other navigation software, firmware or hardware components, or a combination thereof to determine geographical location of the mobile device  and provide location-related information to the API  and the application . The one or more other navigation software, firmware or hardware components of the location engine  may include, for example, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, or a combination thereof. The decision function  of the location engine  is a portion of the location engine  that is capable of making decisions and executing operations with respect to the techniques of the present disclosure, and may be implemented as a set of instructions or code in the location engine  for example. The location engine  may execute one or more operations with respect to the techniques of the present disclosure as directed by the decision function . The location-related information provided by the location engine  may include longitude and latitude of the mobile device , a relative distance between the mobile device  and one or more other mobile devices, geographical locations, facilities and\/or services, or a combination thereof.","In one example scenario, the API  may determine, based on one or more factors including user input and status of the mobile device , that the location engine  needs to provide location-related information on an irregular periodic reporting pattern. The API  may send a request  that requests the location-related information be provided according to an irregular periodic reporting pattern. In response, the API  may receive a response  that includes the location-related information according to the irregular periodic reporting pattern or, alternatively, a request from the location engine  to provide the location-related information according to another irregular periodic reporting pattern as will be described below.","In another example scenario, the application  may determine, based on one or more factors including user input and status of the mobile device , that the location engine  needs to provide location-related information on an irregular periodic reporting pattern. The application  may send a request  that requests the location-related information be provided according to an irregular periodic reporting pattern. In response, the application  may receive a response  that includes the location-related information according to the irregular periodic reporting pattern or, alternatively, a request from the location engine  to provide the location-related information according to another irregular periodic reporting pattern as will be described below. The API  may forward the request  received from the application  to the location engine , and forward the response  received from the location engine  to the application .","As shown in , the application  sends a request to receive location-related information according to a given irregular periodic reporting pattern, e.g., non-periodic time cycles. Upon receiving the request, the API  sends an acknowledgement to the application  and forwards the request to the location engine . In response to receiving the request, the location engine  sends an acknowledgement. In some cases, the engine location  may apply the irregular periodic reporting pattern and provide updates on the location-related information according to the irregular periodic reporting pattern. In other cases, the location engine  may send feedback to the application  or to the API . The feedback may include a request to provide the location-related information according to another irregular periodic reporting pattern different from the one originally requested.","Example Implementation Scheme",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","120","300","110","130","300"]},"At operation , an initial irregular periodic reporting pattern is stored in memory. For example, the initial irregular periodic reporting pattern may be previously negotiated between the location engine  and the API  or the application . Alternatively, the initial irregular periodic reporting pattern may be calculated by the location engine , the API , or the application . The initial irregular periodic reporting pattern is stored in respective memory by the location engine , the API  and\/or the application .","At operation , one or more key performance indicators (KPIs) are calculated. For example, the one or more KPIs may include power consumption, accuracy, time to first fix, or a combination thereof KPIs are also referred to as performance requirements herein.","At operation , it is determined whether the one or more KPIs will be met if the initial irregular periodic reporting pattern is applied. For example, the API  or the location engine  may perform computation to determine whether power consumption may be excessive, whether accuracy of the location-related information may be lower than a threshold level, or whether the time to first fix may be too long if the initial irregular periodic reporting pattern is applied.","At operation , in an event that it is determined that the one or more KPIs will still be met when the initial irregular periodic reporting pattern is applied, the location engine  applies the pattern and provides updates on the location-related information to the API  and\/or the application . The location-related information may include, for example, longitude and latitude and\/or relative distance wither respect to the mobile device .","At operation , in an event that it is determined that the one or more KPIs will not be met when the initial irregular periodic reporting pattern is applied, a new irregular periodic reporting pattern is calculated. For example, the location engine  or the API  may calculate the new irregular periodic reporting pattern.","At operation , a request is sent to request to provide the location-related information according to the new irregular periodic reporting pattern. For example, the location engine  may send the request to the API  and, optionally, the API  may forward the request to the application . Alternatively, the request may be sent by the API  to the application .","At operation , it is determined whether the request is to be approved. For example, the API  may make such determination or, alternatively, the application  may make such determination.","At operation , in an event that the request is approved, the memory is updated to store the new irregular periodic reporting pattern. For example, the location engine , the API  and\/or the application  may store the new irregular periodic reporting pattern in its respective memory to replace the initial irregular periodic reporting pattern. An acknowledgement may be sent by the API  or the application  to the location engine  to acknowledge the approval of the new irregular periodic reporting pattern.","At operation , updates on the location-related information are provided according to the new irregular periodic reporting pattern. For example, the location engine  may send the updates on the location-related information to the API  and\/or the application  according to the new irregular periodic reporting pattern.","At operation , in an event that the request is not approved, a feedback is provided. For example, the API  or the application  may evaluate one or more factors, such as user input or status of the mobile device  for example, and determine not to approve the request. The API  or the application  may calculate a different irregular periodic reporting pattern and send it as the feedback to the location engine . Alternatively or additionally, the API  or the application  may determine one or more new KPIs, e.g., new power consumption requirement, new accuracy catering to a new level of quality of service, new time to first fix, etc., and the feedback includes the one or more new KPIs.","At this point, the operation  is repeated. More specifically, upon receiving the feedback, the location engine  or the API  may calculate a different irregular periodic reporting pattern according to the one or more new KPIs when the feedback includes the one or more new KPIs. If the feedback includes the different irregular periodic reporting pattern, the scheme may proceed to operations  and .","Example Processes",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 4","b":["5","6","7","400","500","600","700","400","500","600","700"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","120","130","120","130"]},"The process  begins with operation , where a first request that location-related information be provided according to a first irregular periodic reporting pattern is received. The first irregular periodic reporting pattern includes non-constant intervals between adjacent instances of reporting of location-related information. For example, the location engine  or the API  may receive such a request from the application .","At operation , in response to receiving the first request, updates on the location-related information are provided according to the first irregular periodic reporting pattern. For example, the location engine  may confirm the request and start providing updates on the location-related information according to the first pattern.","At operation , it is detected that there is a change in a first performance requirement. For example, as the location engine  provides the updates according to the first pattern, one or more KPIs, or performance may change and such change may be detected by the location engine .","At operation , a second irregular periodic reporting pattern is calculated.

The first performance requirement may include, for example, power consumption, accuracy, time to first fix, or a combination thereof. The first performance requirement may be determined by the location engine  or, alternatively, may be provided previously by the API  or application  and accepted by the location engine .
