{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The user experience on the World Wide Web has evolved from viewing static pages of information to interaction with web-based applications. Most users experience the web through a Web Browser application such as Internet Explorer, Opera, Netscape or Firefox. Web browsers essentially provide a forms-based environment originally designed to display text and presentation information to the application developer. Techniques for manipulating browsers now include richer tools and HTML enhancements, including client side scripting environments, such as JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and animation plug-ins such as Macromedia Flash.","Web based applications now provide users various types of functionality. When building Web applications, it is difficult to create maintainable, component-based cross-browser applications. Scripting allows developers to add increased interaction, information processing, and control in Web-based content.","Current technology fails to address well understood architectural approaches for defining and implementing associations between different behaviors on the page, and fails to enable reuse of behaviors in the web application design process. Generally, functions are enabled using downloadable java applications or JavaScript nested within the webpage. JavaScript is placed throughout the page in a manner which is not managed centrally. Most Web applications have scripts and behavior randomly placed throughout the page. For example, scripts may be in the head section, in-line, or attached directly to an element. There is no common approach to managing the dependencies between handlers and scripts. This can lead to performance or timing issues, such as when a user clicks a button and the script is not yet available. As a result, resource management to support scripts and web application becomes a problem.","Another issue for developers is managing the constraints of a client-side application. Web-applications are potentially downloaded via a constrained connection to a server. As applications become more interactive, the size of code and data increases, slowing the download process. There is typically a conflict between providing an enriched client interactivity in a web document while maintaining client performance. Therefore, developers seek to remove bottlenecks associated with adding behaviors. Perceived performance is correlated to rendering speed, or how fast the first screen of content displays.","Adding to the resource management problem is the fact that some web applications are evolving to be in an unbounded manner. For example, a typical custom home page can contain anywhere from one to many different components where the component set is potentially limitless. These pages can be very expensive in their ability to download and render. Therefore, as the set of components grow, there needs to be an infrastructure that can properly delegate and manage the deployment of necessary resources and an approach that provides the fastest response to the user.","A framework for implementing web-based applications using standard object-oriented programming techniques is provided. The framework may be implemented by a script file interpreted by a browser. The framework allows a page developer to create web pages and application using a component-based pattern. The architecture extends the separation of document presentation from the document structure to include document behaviors.","In one embodiment, a computer-readable medium having computer-executable components executable by a Web browser is provided. The components include a resource creation method for creating resource objects, a page interpreter creating instances of objects based on bindings defined in a web-page, and a lifecycle management component for managing instances of the objects.","In an alternative embodiment, a method of providing a web-based application from a server to a client is provided. The method includes the steps of storing a plurality of resources on the server, providing a resource control framework interpretable by a Web-browser to a browser on a client; and providing ones of said resources to the resource control manager on the client device responsive to the browser interpreting bound resources in a document.","In another embodiment, a method of creating a web page rendered on a computer is provided. The method may include defining a call to a management framework executable by a web browser, defining at least one resource object accessible by the framework; and creating bindings to the resource object in the web page.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A method and framework for developing web applications is disclosed. The method and framework enables developers to create applications and pages by binding behaviors to page elements, behaviors and unbounded client applications can be more easily designed and result in optimized application performance.","A binding pattern is defined that associates JavaScript classes to elements on a page. Additionally, a registration process allows bindings to register for other bindings on the page, which allows a dynamic and loose association of bindings on a particular page. This method and framework enables a layered approach to resource reusability since all interactive sites can be built over the same set of core framework services. In addition additional UI paradigms and gestures can be built on top of the core services. These can be designed to be shared or can be specific to a site implementation.","The framework implements a unique component-based pattern heretofore unknown in Web-based development or highly interactive and dynamic cross-browser web sites. The framework architecture extends the separation of document presentation from the document structure to include document behaviors.","In one implementation, the framework is implemented by allowing users to build objects in a browser environment, and bind the objects to a page. The framework is implemented by one or more core files, which in one embodiment are JavaScript files, downloaded from an application server. There provide client level libraries that perform a number of functions, including object registration, destruction, and management. It is noted that the implementation of the core files as JavaScript is suitable for current Web browser as currently Web Browsers typically only understand JavaScript. However, the principles of the present invention need not be limited to JavaScript nor need each of the objects be limited to JavaScript.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer . Components of computer  may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.","Computer  typically includes a variety of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by computer . Combinations of the any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive  is typically connected to the system bus  through an non-removable memory interface such as interface , and magnetic disk drive  and optical disk drive  are typically connected to the system bus  by a removable memory interface, such as interface .","The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in , provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus  via the user input interface , or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","215","220","222","224","226","228","210","215","220","222","224","228","224","200"]},"To develop page  using the framework, each module is defined as a JavaScript object which is then bound to the page definition and managed by the Framework. As such, the resources required by the module (or other component or element) can be managed and reused by the Framework, and developers to create documents using an object based design.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["330","302","304","302","304","302","340","312","304","302","310","310","302","330","330"]},"It will be further recognized that while the framework will be described herein as implemented with respect to JavaScript and a browser as the interpreting application, the principles of the framework are not limited thereto. The framework could be implemented in any interpreted language.","Returning to , application server  also includes script objects , style sheets , and common images  used in the pages  which may be downloaded as discussed below when any page  is parsed and interpreted by browser . The framework  may include a resource download controller which manages the deployment and instantiation of the scripts. The framework can load scripts asynchronously and in parallel leading to better performance on faster connections. Framework scripts, style sheets, and common images are shared across the network from a single source, thereby increasing the overall actual and perceived performance to the user. The more the user visits the application server, the faster the network runs as there is a continually increasing probability that prerequisite files are cached. The only extra downloads will be the task-specific files to the properties.","In essence, the framework enables a shared domain for hosting these shared resources. Rather than having to implement one-off scripts for shareable content, a developer is able to leverage the implementation of any individual property and inject the content into a page. This injected content uses a shared HTML semantic to ensure that it is rendered properly by each properties theme.","The client device  includes, for example, a web browsing application  which may interpret the scripting language that the framework is implemented in. Upon loading a page implementing the framework, core libraries  and script objects  used by the browser to render pages under the Framework are downloaded to the client device memory .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"At step , the developer will define the page header and body of the web page.

This enumeration specifies all public events. To fire an event, for binding calls a \u201cfire\u201d method. This method takes two arguments, the event name and an object representing any payload carried with the event fire (\u201ceventName\u201d,data). The event object is the first argument past to all event handlers. The event object has at least three properties: srcBinding, eventName, and Package. The Package represents the data past by the event initiator.","To assist in defining properly scoped style definitions to a binding, bindings automatically or manually apply a class structure consistent with a binding type to the bound element. In a binding intiialize( ) constructor, one can call a \u201cthis.ApplyClass( )\u201d method. This method will append javascript types (including any derived from) to the bound element's class attribute. For example, if one were to bind a class Start.WeatherModule to the DIV element <div class=\u201croot\u201d> . . . <\/div>, after calling this.ApplyClass( ) the class name on this element will be extended to: <div class=\u201croot Start_WeatherModule Framework_Bindings_Base\u201d> . . . <\/div>.

Generally, one defines the binding type as a string unless it is known that the binding type already exists. Optional binding resources such as style sheets and scripts are supplied as an array.","Bindings attached programmatically via a selector can specify a root element (p_elRoot) to apply the selector against. The selector is then validated against the sub-tree below the specified root element. If a root element is not specified, the entire document is scanned for matching elements. A selector method returns an array of bindings when no external sources are specified. If any external script sources are specified, the return value is an empty array and a reference to the attached bindings may be obtained via a callback (the binding is instantiated asynchronously). In all cases, if a callback is specified, it will be called when the binding is created.","The Framework supports encapsulation and the binding scope is useful when creating a hierarchy of bindings. All bindings have a scope\u2014whether the global scope or encapsulated within another binding. Scope is useful when creating a hierarchy of bindings. If scope is not specified, the binding is registered in the global scope. Scoping enables an object hierarchy of bindings to be established and defines the bindings visibility for registrations (see below).","In one case, one can attach a binding directly to an element. An element can be anything in the page definition Directly attaching a binding takes a single element to which the binding is attached and an optional scope. The rest of the arguments work the same as the AttachSelectorBinding method previously described.","As noted above,  illustrates step  in , the process of page loading and rendering. Initially, at step , a web page is parsed by a browser. As noted above, to implement the framework, the binding framework reference is included in the document . At step , the browser will determine whether the Framework libraries have been already downloaded and if not, will download the Framework core files at . This may include downloading one or more core functionality files and one or more compatibility files, as discussed herein.","Next, at step , the binding declarations listed in the document will be parsed by the browser. A first FOR loop at  begins such that for each declaration in the page, an binding declaration object is created at step  and the object is added to a global list of binding declarations maintained by the framework. Next at step , the elements for the declaration are determined using the declaration's ElementQuery. Next, a binding instance is created at  for each element in the list. Steps ,  and  are also performed for any new binding declaration defined.","Bindings are automatically established when the framework is initialized. While not precluded, there is no automatic revalidation if the document structure changes. If an element is added, removed, or changed, and bindings need to reflect such changes, one will typically manually revalidate the elements. There are a number of methods available for this process. A Bindings.revalidateBinding( ) method will review all existing bindings specified with a CSS selector within a scope and validate that the selector still applies to the element. Note that any bindings attached directly to the element (not using a CSS selector) are not removed. A Bindings.extendBinding( ) method reviews all selector based bindings and adds any new bindings that match the element within the specified scope. A Framework.Bindings.removeBindings( ) method removes all bindings attached to an element. This method may be called before deleting a node from the document tree that may contain a binding. This ensures that any references are properly cleaned up.","Sub-bindings are created as children of an existing binding using the aforementioned scope. This is done by directly calling an Attach*Binding methods. However, if access to another binding on the web-page is required, it may be requested via the registration mechanism.","Registration is the process of requesting a notification when an instance of a specific or any binding type is created. Two methods are provided for registering for bindings\u2014one for bindings within the current page and another for registering for bindings that exist in another window. The registerFor method is for requesting access to each instance of other binding types that may exist on a page. The class name is specified as a string and its definition does not need to exist at the time of the call. Once a binding instance of the specified type is created, a notification will be provided via an \u201conregister\u201d notification or the optional specified callback (Step  below). An optional argument, p_elRoot, specifies whether to only look for bindings that are a descendant element of a specific element or to look for the binding instance anywhere within your scope.","A registerForlnWindow method enables cross-window accessing of bindings. This method is similar to the registerFor method, but allows one to specify a window object that specifies the window used to look for the binding instances.","You can register for all bindings within a scope by specifying as the binding type. In addition, when you register for a binding's class, you are notified for all binding instances that match that class and any binding instances that derive from that class. Therefore, registering for \u201cFramework.Bindings.Base\u201d is analogous to registering for \u201c*\u201d since all bindings are derived from that base class.","When a binding matches the registration, your specified callback is executed. The callback received two arguments.

An onbinding or onunbinding event occurs if another binding is attached or removed from your bound element. This event receives a reference to the newly instantiated binding.","Returning to , a second FOR loop occurs for registered callbacks and notifications. At step , for each registered callback in the same scope as the binding instance, determination of whether the target type matched the type of the new instance is made at step . If so, a callback is fired at . If not, the callback is registered to the global callback list at . Note that when a new binding instance may register for notification of the existence of another binding type at . When this occurs, the registration is added into the list of registered call backs at step , and at step , for each binding instance in the calling binding scope, steps ,  and  are performed.","A dispose is provided so that developers can remove references to other objects, bindings, or events. One must make such dereferences so not to receive events or other notifications when their binding is no longer active.","Dispose is called when a binding is detached from an element or the page unloads. The Boolean argument is true when the binding is being destroyed because the page is unloading. In this event, you should remove any synched events and clear any object references you may have made. Failure to do so can cause random results.","The framework also supports Application level bindings. An Application level binding is a non-UI binding that is used to manage the interactions on a web-page. An application binding is defined by not specifying any selector. Since all bindings ultimately are associated with an element, application level bindings are attached to the HTML element.","Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
