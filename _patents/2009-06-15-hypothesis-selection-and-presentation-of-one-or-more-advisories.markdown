In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.","A recent trend that is becoming increasingly popular in the computing\/communication field is to electronically record one's feelings, thoughts, and other aspects of the person's everyday life onto an open diary. One place where such open diaries are maintained are at social networking sites commonly known as \u201cblogs\u201d where users may report or post their latest status, personal activities, and various other aspects of the users' everyday life. The process of reporting or posting blog entries is commonly referred to as blogging. Other social networking sites may allow users to update their personal information via, for example, social networking status reports in which a user may report or post for others to view their current status, activities, and\/or other aspects of the user.","A more recent development in social networking is the introduction and explosive growth of microblogs in which individuals or users (referred to as \u201cmicrobloggers\u201d) maintain open diaries at microblog websites (e.g., otherwise known as \u201ctwitters\u201d) by continuously or semi-continuously posting microblog entries. A microblog entry (e.g., \u201ctweet\u201d) is typically a short text message that is usually not more than 140 characters long. The microblog entries posted by a microblogger may report on any aspect of the microblogger's daily life. Typically, such microblog entries will describe the various \u201cevents\u201d associated with or are of interest to the microblogger that occurs during a course of a typical day. The microblog entries are often continuously posted during the course of a typical day, and thus, by the end of a normal day, a substantial number of events may have been reported and posted.","Each of the reported events that may be posted through microblog entries may be categorized into one of at least three possible categories. The first category of events that may be reported through microblog entries are \u201cobjective occurrences\u201d that may or may not be associated with the microblogger. Objective occurrences that are associated with a microblogger may be any characteristic, incident, happening, or any other event that occurs with respect to the microblogger or are of interest to the microblogger that can be objectively reported by the microblogger, a third party, or by a device. Such events would include, for example, intake of food, medicine, or nutraceutical, certain physical characteristics of the microblogger such as blood sugar level or blood pressure that can be objectively measured, activities of the microblogger observable by others or by a device, activities of others that may or may not be of interest to the microblogger, external events such as performance of the stock market (which the microblogger may have an interest in), performance of a favorite sports team, and so forth. In some cases, objective occurrences may not be at least directly associated with a microblogger. Examples of such objective occurrences include, for example, external events that may not be directly related to the microblogger such as the local weather, activities of others (e.g., spouse or boss) that may directly or indirectly affect the microblogger, and so forth.","A second category of events that may be reported or posted through microblog entries include \u201csubjective user states\u201d of the microblogger. Subjective user states of a microblogger may include any subjective state or status associated with the microblogger that can only be typically reported by the microblogger (e.g., generally cannot be directly reported by a third party or by a device). Such states including, for example, the subjective mental state of the microblogger (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, tension, state of alertness, state of mental fatigue, jealousy, envy, and so forth), the subjective physical state of the microblogger (e.g., upset stomach, state of vision, state of hearing, pain, and so forth), and the subjective overall state of the microblogger (e.g., \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cbad,\u201d state of overall wellness, overall fatigue, and so forth). Note that the term \u201csubjective overall state\u201d as will be used herein refers to those subjective states that may not fit neatly into the other two categories of subjective user states described above (e.g., subjective mental states and subjective physical states).","A third category of events that may be reported or posted through microblog entries include \u201csubjective observations\u201d made by the microblogger. A subjective observation is similar to subjective user states and may be any subjective opinion, thought, or evaluation relating to any external incidence. Thus, the difference between subjective user states and subjective observations is that subjective user states relates to self-described subjective descriptions of the user states of one's self while subjective observations relates to subjective descriptions or opinions regarding external events. Examples of subjective observations include, for example, a microblogger's perception about the subjective user state of another person (e.g., \u201che seems tired\u201d), a microblogger's perception about another person's activities (e.g., \u201che drank too much yesterday\u201d), a microblogger's perception about an external event (e.g., \u201cit was a nice day today\u201d), and so forth. Although microblogs are being used to provide a wealth of personal information, thus far they have been primarily limited to their use as a means for providing commentaries and for maintaining open diaries.","In accordance with various embodiments, methods, systems, and computer program products are provided to, among other things, select a hypothesis from a plurality of hypotheses based on at least one reported event associated with a user, the selected hypothesis being a hypothesis that may link together (e.g., correlate) a plurality of different types of events (i.e., event types). In some embodiments, the selected hypothesis (as well as, in some cases, the plurality of hypotheses) may be relevant to the user. After making the selection, the methods, systems, and computer program products may present one or more advisories related to the selected hypothesis. The methods, systems, and computer program products may be employed in a variety of environments including, for example, social networking environments, blogging or microblogging environments, instant messaging (IM) environments, or any other type of environment that allows a user to, for example, maintain a diary.","In various implementations, a \u201chypothesis,\u201d as referred to herein, may define one or more relationships or links between different types of events (i.e., event types) including at least a first event type (e.g., a type of event such as a particular type of subjective user state, for example, an emotional state such as \u201chappy\u201d) and a second event type (e.g., another type of event such as particular type of objective occurrence, for example, favorite sports team winning a game). In some cases, a hypothesis may be represented by an events pattern that may indicate spatial or sequential relationships between different event types (e.g., different types of events such as subjective user states and objective occurrences). Note that for ease of explanation and illustration, the following description will describe a hypothesis as defining, for example, the sequential or spatial relationship between two different event types, a first event type and a second event type. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that such a hypothesis could also identify the relationships between three or more event types (e.g., a first event type, a second event type, a third event type, and so forth).","In some embodiments, a hypothesis may, at least in part, be defined or represented by an events pattern that indicates or suggests a spatial or a sequential (e.g., time\/temporal) relationship between different event types. Such a hypothesis, in some cases, may also indicate the strength or weakness of the link between the different event types. That is, the strength or weakness (e.g., soundness) of the correlation between different event types may depend upon, for example, whether the events pattern repeatedly occurs and\/or whether a contrasting events pattern has occurred that may contradict the hypothesis and therefore, weaken the hypothesis (e.g., an events pattern that indicates a person becoming tired after jogging for thirty minutes when a hypothesis suggests that a person will be energized after jogging for thirty minutes).","As briefly described above, a hypothesis may be represented by an events pattern that may indicate spatial or sequential (e.g., time or temporal) relationship or relationships between multiple event types. In some implementations, a hypothesis may merely indicate temporal sequential relationships between multiple event types that indicate the temporal relationships between multiple event types. In alternative implementations a hypothesis may indicate a more specific time relationship between multiple event types. For example, a sequential pattern may represent the specific pattern of events that occurs along a timeline that may indicate the specific time intervals between event types. In still other implementations, a hypothesis may indicate the spatial (e.g., geographical) relationships between multiple event types.","In various embodiments, the development of a hypothesis may be particularly useful to a user (e.g., a microblogger or a social networking user) that the hypothesis may be associated with. That is, in some instances a hypothesis may be developed for a user that may assist the user in modifying his\/her future behavior, while in other instances such a hypothesis may simply alert or notify the user that a pattern of events are repeatedly occurring. In other situations, such a hypothesis may be useful to third parties such as advertisers in order to assist the advertisers in developing a more targeted marketing scheme. In still other situations, such a hypothesis may help in the treatment of ailments associated with the user.","One way to develop a hypothesis (e.g., creation of and\/or further development of a hypothesis) is to determine a pattern of reported events that repeatedly occurs with respect to a particular user and\/or to compare similar or dissimilar reported pattern of events that occurs with respect to a user. For example, if a user such as a microblogger reports repeatedly that after each visit to a particular restaurant, the user always has an upset stomach, then a hypothesis may be created and developed that suggests that the user will get an upset stomach after visiting the particular restaurant. If, on the other hand, after developing such a hypothesis, the user reports that the last time he ate at the restaurant, he did not get an upset stomach, then such a report may result in the weakening of the hypothesis. Alternatively, if after developing such a hypothesis, the user reports that the last time he ate at the restaurant, he again got an upset stomach, then such a report may result in a confirmation of the soundness of the hypothesis. Note that the soundness of a hypothesis (e.g., strength or weakness of the hypothesis) may depend upon how much the historical data supports such a hypothesis.","Numerous hypotheses may be developed and may be associated with a particular user. For example, in the case of a microblogger, given the amount of \u201cevents data\u201d (and the large amounts of reported events indicated by the events data) that may be provided by the microblogger via microblog entries, a large number of hypotheses associated with the microblogger may eventually be developed based on the reported events indicated by the events data. Alternatively, hypotheses may also be provided by one or more third party sources. For example, a number of hypotheses may be provided by other users or by one or more network service providers.","Thus, in accordance with various embodiments, methods, systems, and computer program products are provided to, among other things, select a hypothesis from a plurality of hypotheses that may be associated with a particular user (e.g., a microblogger), where the selected hypothesis may link or correlate a plurality of different types of events (i.e., event types). After making the selection, the methods, systems, and computer program products may present one or more advisories related to the selected hypothesis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","b ","b"],"b":["1","100","10","10","60","60","61","62","60","10","81","80","81","10","90","81"]},"As indicated earlier, in some embodiments, the computing device  may be a server while in other embodiments the computing device  may be a standalone device.

Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and\/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communications link, a wireless communication link, etc.).","In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof can be viewed as being composed of various types of \u201celectrical circuitry.\u201d Consequently, as used herein \u201celectrical circuitry\u201d includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein), electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of random access memory), and\/or electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, or optical-electrical equipment). Those having skill in the art will recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.","Those having skill in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and\/or processes in the fashion set forth herein, and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and\/or processes into data processing systems. That is, at least a portion of the devices and\/or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation. Those having skill in the art will recognize that a typical data processing system generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, a memory such as volatile and non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors, computational entities such as operating systems, drivers, graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices, such as a touch pad or screen, and\/or control systems including feedback loops and control motors (e.g., feedback for sensing position and\/or velocity; control motors for moving and\/or adjusting components and\/or quantities). A typical data processing system may be implemented utilizing any suitable commercially available components, such as those typically found in data computing\/communication and\/or network computing\/communication systems.","The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components and\/or logically interacting and\/or logically interactable components.","While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.","In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.).","In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 1","i":["a ","b "],"b":["1","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","b.
