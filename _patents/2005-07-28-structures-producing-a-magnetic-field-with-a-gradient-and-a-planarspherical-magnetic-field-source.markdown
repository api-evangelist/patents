No. 10\/644,566, entitled, \u201cStructures Producing A Magnetic Field With A Gradient,\u201d which was filed on Aug. 19, 2003. A patent based on that Parent application is about to be granted. That Parent application was filed by the inventor herein, is currently pending before the U.S. Patent Office and, under 35 USC \u00a7 120, is \u201can application similarly entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the first application.\u201d This divisional application is being filed under 35 USC \u00a7 120, 35 USC \u00a7 121 and 37 CFR \u00a7 1.53 (b), and priority from the Aug. 19, 2003 effective date of the Parent application (Ser. No. 10\/644,566) is hereby claimed.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment to me of any royalty thereon.","The present invention relates generally to permanent magnetic field sources, and more particularly to magnetic structures that are field gradient sources.","There is a continuing demand for strong magnetic fields of thousands of gauss with large gradients of thousands of gauss per centimeter for mechanical device applications such as activators, mechanical bearings and magnetic separators, as well as electromagnetic applications including partial beam experiments, microwave radiation sources, mm-wave radiation sources, free electron lasers and so on. A major difficulty in magnetic design is the lack of the free electronic charge used in electrical designs. In magnetics, every magnetic positive charge, e.g. north magnetic pole, is always accompanied by an equal and opposite negative charge in the south magnetic pole. Whenever a specific charge distribution is needed to configure a desired magnetic field, the negative counterparts of the required charges need to be rendered minimally deleterious to the desired magnetic field. Further, prior art techniques for producing a magnetic field gradient such as producing a field-taper normal to the direction of the field lines, an axial taper in the remanences of the magic cylinders, or a longitudinal taper, are considered inadequate and ineffective because they are complex, expensive and time-consuming. Prior art magnetic structures are unable to effectively minimize the deleterious effects of the unwanted counterparts of required charges. Thus, there has been a long-felt need for simple and inexpensive magnetic field gradient sources that produce a strong volume charge density using layered structures that can cancel unwanted surface charges. This invention's magnetic field gradient source structures can produce the long-sought volume charge density in a number of inexpensive and relatively simple layered arrangements that cancel unwanted surface charges, without suffering from the disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings of prior art magnetic structures.","The magnetic structures of the present invention overcome the shortcomings and limitations of minimizing unwanted negative charges with a layered, or laminated, arrangement of magnets configured so that the unwanted negative charges are mutually cancelled by other parts of the structure. The field gradient sources of the present invention comprise a series of stacked magnetic laminae that are magnetically oriented perpendicular to their planes in a number of configurations. The magnetic structure of the present invention makes it possible to fulfill the long-felt need for a simple and inexpensive way of providing a field gradient source that does not suffer from the disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings of complex, expensive and time-consuming prior art high magnetic field devices. As used herein, the terms \u201clamina\u201d and \u201claminae\u201d are defined as any thin plate, sheet or layer.","It is an object of this invention to provide simple and inexpensive field gradient sources.","It is another object of this invention to provide a flat-layered magnetic structure as a field gradient source.","It is still another object of this invention to provide a layered magnetic cylinder composed of magnetic laminae that are magnetically oriented perpendicular to their planes as a field gradient source.","It is yet another object of this invention to provide layered magnetic spheres composed of magnetic laminae that are magnetically oriented perpendicular to their planes as field gradient sources.","It is still a further object of this invention to provide methods for providing a field gradient source based on a layered magnetic structure composed of magnetic laminae that are magnetically oriented perpendicular to their planes.","These and other objects and advantages are accomplished with the present invention providing magnetic field structures comprising stacked magnetic laminae that are magnetically oriented perpendicular to their planes and configured so that a volume charge density is provided and the field effects of unwanted surface negative charges are cancelled. These objects and advantages are accomplished by arranging stacked thin magnetic laminae into various configurations where each of the magnetic laminae is thinner than the radius of that particular layer and the magnetic strength, M(r), of each layer will vary linearly with the normal distance (r) from the stack's center based on the equation: \n\n\nwhere t is the half-thickness of the stack. Such an arrangement causes a uniform volume magnetic charge density, \u03c1, which results in a magnetic field normal to the laminae of the magnitude, M. One important advantage of this invention's stacked magnetic laminae magnetic field structures is to cancel the field effects of the deleterious unwanted surface charges because these surface charges are so situated that their contributions to the internal magnetic field mutually cancel each other, and thus they are no longer detrimental to the magnetic field created by the volume charge density. Additionally, working spaces to use the internal magnetic field can be made with radial tunnels, meridional slots and so forth.\n","One embodiment of the present invention provides a planar magnetic field gradient source structure. Other embodiments provide a series of nested spherical magnetic shells, a layered magnetic cylinder and several layered magnetic spheres. It is also within the contemplation of the present invention to provide methods for generating magnetic field gradient sources based on a layered magnetic structure composed of magnetic laminae that are magnetically oriented perpendicular to their planes. The present invention's advantageous arrangements of stacked circular magnetic laminae fulfills the long-felt need for a simple and inexpensive way of providing a field gradient source, without suffering from the disadvantages, limitations and shortcomings of prior art magnetic structures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["15","10","10","15","10","11","11","10","11","11","11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0022"},"br":{},"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["M","r","M","r"],"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c1","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mover":{"mo":["\u2207","\u2192"]}},{"mover":{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2192"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"r"}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mo":"\u2202","mrow":{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"r"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mi":"t"}}}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"r"}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c1","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mi":"t"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}]}}}},"where M(t) is the magnetization of the stack at t and M=M(t)r\/t, which is formula (1) given above. A quasi-uniform volume magnetic charge density, \u03c1, is present throughout the entire planar magnetic field gradient source . This volume magnetic charge density is described as quasi-uniform because the change in magnetization is not continuous, but rather varies abruptly from one lamina  to another. However, by making the laminae  sufficiently thin, as compared to thickness, t, it is possible to approximate uniform density as closely as is necessary.","The magnetic field, H (r), anywhere within one lamina  varies according to the following equation:\n\n()=2\u03c0\u03c1\u00b724\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nbut so that \n\n\nwhere ()=4()\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nis the magnetic remanence of the magnetic material used and M(t) is the maximum magnetization in the stack of the planar magnetic field gradient source . The now unpaired negative charges  and  are found on the two surfaces and cancel each other's effects on the magnetic field as the two surfaces act in opposition with equal strength. By using commercially available material with the greatest Bof about 14 kG, and constructing a magnetic structure where t=5 cm., the maximum field would be 14 kG just inside the surface. Numerous variations to the planar magnetic field gradient source  are possible, such as the volume magnetic charge density, \u03c1, varying abruptly from one of the magnetic laminae  to another or positioning a tunnel through the planar magnetic field gradient source  as a working space and the laminae  being disks.\n","Another embodiment of this invention's magnetic field gradient source is a cylindrical field gradient source composed of nested cylindrical magnetic laminae as depicted in . Referring now to , there is depicted a cross sectional side view of a cylindrical field gradient source , comprising a plurality of nested cylindrical magnetic laminae  arranged around a center  along with a surface charge . The magnetic strength, M(r) of each nested cylindrical magnetic laminae  varies linearly with the radial distance from the center  with the magnetic field intensity measured in Tesla's. Similar to the first embodiment's planar magnetic field gradient source, this arrangement gives rise to a volume magnetic charge density,
