{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61\/107,825, filed Oct. 23, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In the modern world, goods or services may be offered through or supported by a telecommunications-based network of call centers that can receive and handle calls from various customers. Such call centers often comprise a combination of human (e.g., customer service representatives) and machine resources that are intended to serve and be responsive to the needs or desires of the customers. Typically, the customer service representatives have varying levels of expertise on particular products and\/or services, interpersonal skills, company policies, or any of a number of other areas. Additionally, the customer service representative typically must use a wide array of software applications and programs to access pertinent data. An important objective of a call center network is to provide each customer who calls in with the highest quality of service within the shortest amount of time by the most qualified customer service representative available who has at his or her disposal the appropriate information for a particular customer call.","An incoming call can be received initially by any one of the agents or customer service representatives staffed at the call centers. These customer service representatives, however, might not be able to adequately and\/or efficiently handle the needs of the caller. For example, the customer service representatives may not have the skill set, training, understanding of the goods\/services, or understanding of the customer service representative user interface to perform the needed tasks accurately and efficiently. In some cases, the customer service representative might need to transfer the caller to a second customer service representative who can properly handle the requests of the caller. At a minimum, the transfer requires an incoming line supporting the call into the receiving call center, an outgoing line from the first customer service representative, and an incoming line into the second customer service representative or call center to which the call was transferred. Transferring a call also might add to the total length of the call for the caller, which could be undesirable. In other cases, if the customer service representative does not transfer the caller, the customer service representative might spend an excessive amount of time to address the issue of the caller. This time may be spent by the customer service representative maneuvering through the multiple screens and programs of the customer service representative user interface to locate the proper information for the caller.","Consequently, in order to provide quality service to customers, it is important to have a customer service representative who is knowledgeable of the goods and services supported by the call center and who can access relevant information with the customer service representative user interface quickly and efficiently. In some instances, it is also important for the customer service representative to recommend promotions or products that may be of interest to the particular caller. The ability to efficiently recommend these promotions or products may require additional training or supervision. Ultimately, in order for a customer service representative to be proficient, the customer service representative typically must be trained and supervised by a supervisor or manager during customer calls. In some cases, a supervisor may \u201clisten in\u201d to the calls to aid in the training. Such training and supervision requires resources and expenses.","Speech recognition systems have previously been developed to process and recognize human speech, and may also take action or carry out further processes. Developments in speech recognition technologies support \u201cnatural language\u201d type interactions between automated systems and users. A natural language interaction allows a person to speak naturally. Voice recognition systems can react responsively to a spoken request. Speech recognition technologies typically have been implemented with customer call centers in the area of automatic call routing (\u201cACR\u201d). A goal of an ACR application is to replace the customer service representative or to lessen the role of a customer service representative during a call. An ACR application typically requires the caller to speak one of a finite set of answers in response to automated questions. The ACR application then attempts to route the caller to an appropriate agent or destination for servicing the caller's request.","ACR systems, however, may not accurately route calls to the proper customer service representatives if the speech recognition system partially understands or misunderstands the caller's intent. Additionally, callers typically prefer to speak directly with a human customer service representative when initiating a call with a call center instead of with an ACR application. As discussed above, even if the caller engages a customer service representative, that particular customer service representative may not have the proper training or skills to adequately address the caller's issue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","12","14","16","14","18","12","12","14","16","12","12","14","12","12","18","18","12","16","20"]},"Still referring to , the customer service representative  may interact with a user interface or workstation, such as a terminal . The terminal  may be, for example, a personal computer (\u201cPC\u201d), a laptop, or any other suitable computer-based device. The terminal  may have an input device , such as a keyboard and\/or mouse. In various embodiments, the customer service representative  may type information learned from the caller during the call  into the terminal  to obtain relevant information about the caller, etc. In other embodiments, the input device may be a touchscreen, for example. It is appreciated that a single customer service representative may interact with multiple terminals , although only one is illustrated.","In various embodiments, the terminal  may be connected to a computing system  through a data communication network . The network  may comprise a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) or any other suitable computer network (such as the Internet or an intranet) utilizing wired and\/or wireless communication links.

In some embodiments, the computing system may comprise one or more computer servers .","Still referring to , computing system  may store information related to (i) the goods and services supported by the call center  and (ii) account information. For example, computing system  may store information related to account information, billing information, address information, repair information, schedules, pricing information, employee information, travel information, technical support information, store\/office locations, or any other information. The information in computing system  may be accessible to the customer service representative  via network  and may be stored in one or more computer databases of the computing system . The storage structure of the databases may be memory units (e.g., ROM) of the servers  or mass storage devices, such as hard disk drives, etc. The servers  may be, for example, database servers.","The terminal  and computing system  may include operatively associated computer-readable media such as memory (e.g., ROM or RAM) for storing software applications used in obtaining, processing, storing, and\/or communicating data. It can be appreciated that such memory can be internal, external, remote, or local with respect to its operatively associated computer or computer system. Memory may also include any means for storing software or other instructions including, for example and without limitation, a hard disk, optical disk, floppy disk, DVD, compact disc, memory stick, ROM (read only memory), RAM (random access memory), PROM (programmable ROM), EEPROM (extended erasable PROM), and\/or other like computer-readable media.","Still referring to , the communications system  may include an computer-based automated assistant . The automated assistant  may be a separate computer-based device (as shown) or it may be integrated with any part of the communications system , such as the call center , the terminal , and\/or the computing system , or it may reside on a separate dedicated server, computer, or device, for example. In some embodiments, various components of the automated assistant  may reside in different places. The automated assistant may be connected to the call center via communication link .","The automated assistant  may be configured to deliver information to the customer service representative  based on speech utterances from the caller  or the call  that are detected and analyzed by the automated assistant . In the illustrated embodiment, the automated assistant  delivers information to the terminal  via communication link . It is appreciated that any suitable technique may be used to connect the automated assistant  to the terminal , including but not limited to a wireless network, a local area network, an intranet, or the internet. As discussed in more detail below, the automated assistant  may process the speech utterances of the incoming call  to determine its contents. Based on the content of the incoming call , the automated assistant  may deliver information to the customer service representative  that may be helpful in handling the caller's call. In various embodiments, the automated assistant  may be in communication with the computing system  via a communication link . It is appreciated that any suitable connection may be used, such as a wireless network, a local area network, an intranet, or the internet.","Referring now to , sample screen shots of terminal  are illustrated. The terminal  may have a screen  used to display information to the customer service representative . The screen may display various windows or fields, such as field . In other embodiments, different display configurations may be used. Field  may display information about the caller  or other information that the customer service representative  can convey to the caller. For example, field  may display account information, product\/service information, billing information, or any other information that may be useful to the customer service representative . While speaking to the caller , the customer service representative  may use the input device  () to access the various information, such as the information stored in the computing system . For example, if the caller  inquires about a bill or an invoice, the customer service representative  can access the caller's billing information stored in the computing system  and convey the information presented on the terminal  verbally to the caller .","While the call is transpiring, the automated assistant  may be concurrently deciphering the utterances of the call  in \u201creal time.\u201d After determining the contents of the caller's inquiry or request (according to a threshold confidence level), the automated assistant  may display a first recommendation  on the terminal . It is appreciated that the first recommendation  may be displayed using any suitable technique. For example, the first recommendation  may be a \u201cpop-up\u201d window (as shown in ), or it may be presented as a text or an image in field . If multiple terminals  are utilized by the customer service representative , the first recommendation  may appear on any number of terminals using any number of techniques.","The first recommendation  displayed in a recommendation window  may provide information that is useful or helpful to the customer service representative  in handling the call from the caller . For example, if the automated assistant  determines the caller  is inquiring about an account balance, the first recommendation  may provide the caller's account balance. In other examples, the first recommendation may include a link, such as a hyperlink, to access a table or database containing the caller's account information. To retrieve the information conveyed by the first recommendation , the automated assistant may communicate with the computing system . If the information displayed to the customer service representative  is useful or relevant, the customer service representative  may utilize the information during the call. In some instances the information conveyed by the first recommendation  may not be helpful to the customer service representative . For example, the automated assistant  may have misinterpreted the caller's inquiry or otherwise provided unhelpful information. If the first recommendation  is not deemed relevant by the customer service representative , it can simply be ignored. Furthermore, if the customer service representative  has a high level of training or competence with the system, the recommendation  may be ignored or disregarded.","As shown in , the automated assistant  may display multiple recommendations, such as a second recommendation  in the recommendation window , in response to a second concept spoken by the caller  and analyzed by the automated assistant . In some embodiments, a field  may be displayed by the terminal  in response to data from the automated assistant . The field  may be populated with text, graphics, or information potentially relevant to the caller  based on the call . For example, if the caller  inquiries about a technical support issue, the second recommendation  may include suggested techniques to address the technical issue conveyed. The field  may be populated with other useful information, such as wiring diagrams or architecture diagrams. As readily appreciated by one skilled in the art, the automated assistant  may be used with any type of call center  regarding any type of goods or services. The automated assistant  is not limited to any particular type of call center , terminal , or computing system .","In some embodiments, the recommendations provided by the automated assistant  may remain displayed on the terminal for a certain period of time. After the period of time has expired, the recommendation may disappear from the screen. In some implementations, a log or file of previous recommendations may be maintained, stored in a memory medium associated with system  (), for example. Therefore, the customer service representative  could have the option to access recommendations made in the past by the automated assistant . In various embodiments, the recommendation window  may be \u201cclosed\u201d or \u201cexited.\u201d For example, the recommendation window  may include an icon  which can be activated by the customer service representative  to close or exit the window.","The automated assistant  may also provide recommendations or suggestions to the customer service representative  about information not specifically requested by the caller . Referring to , the automated assistant  may determine, for example, the demographical information about caller  based on caller ID for the call  or information stored about the caller  in the computing system  or elsewhere. Using that information, the automated assistant  may display information to the customer service representative , such as a first promotion  in a promotion window  and a second promotion  in a promotion window . The information displayed could be any information potentially relevant to the caller, including, for example, marketing or promotional material. The customer service representative  could then convey this information to the caller. It is noted that while displaying the promotional information, the automated assistant  may be continually interpreting the utterances of the call  in order to display any recommendations, such as a recommendation  in recommendation window .","It is appreciated that the display of the information based on the caller's utterances can be displayed in any suitable technique. The displaying of the recommendations and the type of information conveyed is not limited to any particular type or format. For example, the recommendations, promotions, and\/or other information may be displayed in a series of windows, in a single window, as a tabbed windows, as a log, in a list, as hyperlinks, as a URL, as text, as graphics, as images, on a separate screen, on a pop-up window, or any combination thereof.","Referring now to , the computer-based automated assistant  may comprise a speech processor  and a back-end computer-based customer service representative recommendation system  (). In various embodiments, as shown in , the speech processor  may comprise an acoustic processor , an acoustic model , a language model , a lexicon , and a decoder . The speech processor  may receive the incoming call  and convert the caller's utterances in the call into a string of one or more words based on the configuration of the models in the system. The speech processor  may then provide a decoded audio string  as output. In various embodiments, the string of words may additionally be accompanied by a score or rating that indicates the speech processor's level of confidence with the voice recognition. For example, the score or rating may be an indication of the level of confidence in either the individual words and\/or the entire recognized string. Optionally, the speech processor  may output a list of possible matches to the utterances. For example, the speech processor  may output the top three, five, or thirty matches. It may be understood that any number of possible matches could be provided by the speech processor . In various embodiments, the speech processor  may output or otherwise store or log a recognition lattice. The recognition lattice may represent the speech processor's  internal representation of the decoded utterance and what the speech processor  uses to derive the best output, or plurality of possible outputs.","Referring now to , the customer service representative recommendation system  may process the decoded audio string  from the speech processor . The customer service representative recommendation system  may comprise various computer-based components, including a language understanding software module , a knowledge database , and a recommendation engine . The customer service representative recommendation system  may be a computing device that executes the modules that are stored in a memory device. The language understanding module  may be configured to accept a textual representation of the spoken utterances, such as the decoded audio string , and extract the meaningful concepts or content. In various embodiments, the language understanding module  may also accept a score or rating which indicates a level of confidence. Additionally, in some implementations, the language understanding module  may accept a plurality of possible matches to the utterances in the call  ().","The language understanding module  may extract meaningful concepts or content from a textual representation of the call  using any number of a variety of techniques from the field of natural language understanding. In various embodiments, the speech processor may utilize a regular expression parser such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,565,368 to Zartler, et al., the entirety of which is incorporated by reference. As may be appreciated by those skilled in the art, there are various systems capable of implementing the natural language understanding component. In various embodiments, a concept may be considered to be a composition of one or more ideas that are pertinent to the application domain. These critical ideas may be expressed in the textual representation via patterns of one or more \u201cvocabs,\u201d \u201chelper terms,\u201d \u201cbuilding blocks,\u201d and\/or other forms of expression. The assignment of the vocabs, helper terms, building blocks, and\/or other forms of expression to various concepts may be created by a human or may be generated automatically using any of a variety of standard (unsupervised or supervised) machine learning techniques. As appreciated by those skilled in the art, the process of extracting concepts from a textual representation may not be exact and, therefore, a matching score to each of the one or more possible matching concepts in the textual representation may be assigned. These one or more possible matching concepts and their associated scores may then be passed on to the recommendation engine . In various embodiments, the one or more possible matching concepts may be archived, such as by a database or other storage medium, for later analysis and review by a human or machine in order to further improve the performance of the system.","The recommendation engine  may match the concepts of the decoded audio string  to \u201cresponses\u201d contained in the knowledge database . The system  may then output a response  to the customer service representative . As discussed above, the response  may be a recommendation, promotional materials, or other information that may be helpful to the customer service representative  during a call with a customer. In various embodiments, the recommendation engine  may use concept-response mapping. In some implementations, the concept-response mapping may be generated either automatically or by a human during the development of the application .","The automated assistant  may also use information from the outcome of past recommendations to influence its choice of which recommendations to present to the customer service representative . For example, the automated assistant may create a log  for tracking the customer service representative's use of the responses . From the log , the usefulness or appropriateness of the response  may be metered. In various embodiments, the knowledge database  may utilize the data in the log . Based on that data, future recommendations by the automated assistant  may be altered or modified to increase the usefulness of the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["134","134","104","108","100","102","104","100","100","106","100","104","108","26","134","106"]},"According to one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method that comprises the steps of receiving by a call center a call from a caller, the call comprising utterances from the caller, and routing the call to a customer service representative of the call center, where the customer service representative interacts with a computer device comprising a display.

Such computer networks can be classified according to the hardware and software technology that is used to interconnect the devices in the network, such as optical fiber, Ethernet, wireless LAN, HomePNA, power line communication or G.hn. The computer networks may also be embodied as one or more of the following types of networks: local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), virtual private network (VPN), storage area network (SAN), or global area network (GAN), among other network varieties.","For example, a WAN computer network may cover a broad area by linking communications across metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries. The network may use routers and\/or public communication links. One type of data communication network may cover a relatively broad geographic area (e.g., city-to-city or country-to-country) which uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone service providers. In another example, a GAN computer network may support mobile communications across multiple wireless LANs or satellite networks. In another example, a VPN computer network may include links between nodes carried by open connections or virtual circuits in another network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The link-layer protocols of the VPN can be tunneled through the other network. One VPN application can promote secure communications through the Internet. The VPN can also be used to separately and securely conduct the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network. The VPN may provide users with the virtual experience of accessing the network through an IP address location other than the actual IP address which connects the access device to the network.","The computer network may be characterized based on functional relationships among the elements or components of the network, such as active networking, client-server, or peer-to-peer functional architecture. The computer network may be classified according to network topology, such as bus network, star network, ring network, mesh network, star-bus network, or hierarchical topology network, for example. The computer network may also be classified based on the method employed for data communication, such as digital and analog networks.","Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may employ internetworking for connecting two or more distinct electronic computer networks or network segments through a common routing technology. The type of internetwork employed may depend on administration and\/or participation in the internetwork. Non-limiting examples of internetworks include intranet, extranet, and Internet. Intranets and extranets may or may not have connections to the Internet. If connected to the Internet, the intranet or extranet may be protected with appropriate authentication technology or other security measures. As applied herein, an intranet can be a group of networks which employ Internet Protocol, web browsers and\/or file transfer applications, under common control by an administrative entity. Such an administrative entity could restrict access to the intranet to only authorized users, for example, or another internal network of an organization or commercial entity. As applied herein, an extranet may include a network or internetwork generally limited to a primary organization or entity, but which also has limited connections to the networks of one or more other trusted organizations or entities (e.g., customers of an entity may be given access an intranet of the entity thereby creating an extranet).","Computer networks may include hardware elements to interconnect network nodes, such as network interface cards (NICs) or Ethernet cards, repeaters, bridges, hubs, switches, routers, and other like components. Such elements may be physically wired for communication and\/or data connections may be provided with microwave links (e.g., IEEE 802.12) or fiber optics, for example. A network card, network adapter or NIC can be designed to allow computers to communicate over the computer network by providing physical access to a network and an addressing system through the use of MAC addresses, for example. A repeater can be embodied as an electronic device that receives and retransmits a communicated signal at a boosted power level to allow the signal to cover a telecommunication distance with reduced degradation. A network bridge can be configured to connect multiple network segments at the data link layer of a computer network while learning which addresses can be reached through which specific ports of the network. In the network, the bridge may associate a port with an address and then send traffic for that address only to that port. In various embodiments, local bridges may be employed to directly connect local area networks (LANs); remote bridges can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs; and\/or, wireless bridges can be used to connect LANs and\/or to connect remote stations to LANs.","In various embodiments, a hub may be employed which contains multiple ports. For example, when a data packet arrives at one port of a hub, the packet can be copied unmodified to all ports of the hub for transmission. A network switch or other devices that forward and filter OSI layer 2 datagrams between ports based on MAC addresses in data packets can also be used. A switch can possess multiple ports, such that most of the network is connected directly to the switch, or another switch that is in turn connected to a switch. The term \u201cswitch\u201d can also include routers and bridges, as well as other devices that distribute data traffic by application content (e.g., a Web URL identifier). Switches may operate at one or more OSI model layers, including physical, data link, network, or transport (i.e., end-to-end). A device that operates simultaneously at more than one of these layers can be considered a multilayer switch. In certain embodiments, routers or other like networking devices may be used to forward data packets between networks using headers and forwarding tables to determine an optimum path through which to transmit the packets.","As employed herein, an application server may be a server that hosts an API to expose business logic and business processes for use by other applications. Examples of application servers include J2EE or Java EE 5 application servers including WebSphere Application Server. Other examples include WebSphere Application Server Community Edition (IBM), Sybase Enterprise Application Server (Sybase Inc), WebLogic Server (BEA), JBoss (Red Hat), JRun (Adobe Systems), Apache Geronimo (Apache Software Foundation), Oracle OC4J (Oracle Corporation), Sun Java System Application Server (Sun Microsystems), and SAP Netweaver AS (ABAP\/Java). Also, application servers may be provided in accordance with the .NET framework, including the Windows Communication Foundation, .NET Remoting, ADO.NET, and ASP.NET among several other components. For example, a Java Server Page (JSP) is a servlet that executes in a web container which is functionally equivalent to CGI scripts. JSPs can be used to create HTML pages by embedding references to the server logic within the page. The application servers may mainly serve web-based applications, while other servers can perform as session initiation protocol servers, for instance, or work with telephony networks. Specifications for enterprise application integration and service-oriented architecture can be designed to connect many different computer network elements. Such specifications include Business Application Programming Interface, Web Services Interoperability, and Java EE Connector Architecture.","In various embodiments, computers and computer systems described herein may have the following main components: arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), control unit, memory, and input and output devices (I\/O devices). These components can be interconnected by busses, often comprising groups of wires or cables. The control unit, ALU, registers, and basic I\/O (and often other hardware closely linked with these sections) can be collectively considered a central processing unit (CPU) for the computer system. The CPU may be constructed on a single integrated circuit or microprocessor.","The control unit (control system or central controller) directs the various components of a computer system. The control system decodes each instruction in a computer program and turns it into a series of control signals that operate other components of the computer system. To enhance performance or efficiency of operation, the control system may alter the order of instructions. One component of the control unit is the program counter, a memory register that tracks the location in memory from which the next instruction is to be read.","The ALU is capable of performing arithmetic and logic operations. The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to adding and subtracting or might include multiplying or dividing, trigonometry functions (sine, cosine, etc.) and square roots. Some may be programmed to operate on whole numbers (integers), while others use floating point to represent real numbers, for example. An ALU may also compare numbers and return Boolean truth values (e.g., true or false). Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs to facilitate processing multiple instructions at the same time. For example, graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often possess ALUs that can perform arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices. Certain computer systems may include one or more RAM cache memories configured to move more frequently needed data into the cache automatically.","Examples of peripherals that may be used in connection with certain embodiments of the invention include input\/output devices such as keyboards, mice, screen displays, monitors, printers, hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, joysticks, and image scanners.","Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein may divide functions between separate CPUs, creating a multiprocessing configuration. For example, multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) computer systems with co-processing capabilities may be employed. Also, multitasking may be employed as a computer processing technique to handle simultaneous execution of multiple computer programs.","In various embodiments, the systems and methods described herein may be configured and\/or programmed to include one or more of the above-described electronic, computer-based elements and components. In addition, these elements and components may be particularly configured to execute the various rules, algorithms, programs, processes, and method steps described herein.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described herein, it should be apparent, however, that various modifications, alterations and adaptations to those embodiments may occur to persons skilled in the art with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the present invention. The disclosed embodiments are therefore intended to include all such modifications, alterations and adaptations without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"FIGURES","p":["Various embodiments of the present invention are described herein by way of example in conjunction with the following figures, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
