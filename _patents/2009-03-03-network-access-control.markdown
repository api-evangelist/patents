{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a network access control.","Within a network environment, IP-based applications are increasingly running on User Equipment (UE) such as mobile devices, Home Gateway solutions, as defined in ETSI Technical Specification 185 003 \u201cTISPAN CNG Architecture and Interfaces\u201d, etc., particularly with the emergence of Voice over IP (VoIP) and related internet telephony services. Some such applications could also perform sensitive IP-based access protocols such as, SSH (Secure SHell), FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) sessions, on a public access network and could receive a variety of different formats of IP (Internet Protocol) traffic.","Also, with improving device performance, it is foreseen that a mobile terminal could be interconnected through a private local IP link to embedded internal devices, and\/or to external terminal equipment such as by way of a WiFi private network. In the field of the Home Gateway (HG) technology, the HG can also be connected through a private local IP link.","In all such situations, the local IP sub-network is effectively \u201chidden\u201d behind the UE acting as a border gateway and router to provide connectivity to the IP based services that can be offered by wireless operators. However the UE is often seen as a single device on the public access network, and in some configurations (IPv4, IPv6 stateful autoconfiguration mode) only a single routable, IP address will be allocated. To take account of such configurations, a Network Address Translation (NAT, defined in RFC 3022 \u201cTraditional IP Network Address Translator\u201d) based solution is required for management of the addressing of the local sub-network elements in order to map internal\/private addresses, i.e. the local-link addresses, to the single routable IP address allocated by the public access network. Filtering functions required for address translation can also be extended to cover firewall type capabilities which can assist in the control of IP traffic, the local IP network security and also protect access to the public network.","Additionally, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP, as defined in RFC3261)\/IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS, as defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project in Technical Specification 23.228 that specifies the IMS stage 2) applications including network information such as the IP address, and port number at application layer, in addition to network layer, can also employ Application Level Gateway (ALG, as defined in RFC2663) translations at the border gateway element of the telecommunication mobile device arranged with the local IP network.","Besides, by-passing of NAT during SIP communication, for example by way of the Simple Traversal of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) through NAT (STUN) protocol as defined in RFC3489, is possible since specific protocols transport IP level information at the application level and which are contrary to the network layer philosophy. It is also well known that firewall (whether SIM-based or not) and NAT solutions exist to enable the control and management of IP flows. Further, NAT is often accompanied by an Application Level Gateway (ALG) to monitor the payload of the packet and perform the alteration when IP level information is transported at application layer for example with the SIP protocol.","It is further foreseen that mobile devices will enable users to download a wide variety of IP-based applications requiring connection with different network services through a home operator network. While the application download may be restricted at the time of application installation, there is farther desire for security in limiting undesired access at the network level and thereby preventing a potentially malicious application from achieving network-connection. For example subsequent to installation of an IP-based application, the network operator may later notice malicious actions from that application such as the sending of undesired network\/application requests are sent and so firewall application\/software is then required.","Also, a network operator can enter into agreements with service providers for services such as Instant Messaging applications or VoIP applications. However since future mobile platforms are likely to be open to many IP-based applications, the user may be able to download any application of choice thereby rendering the agreement between the network operator and the service provider(s) potentially ineffective. Besides such agreement may further be limited by the time at which a user can access the IP-based service.","The degree and adaptability of network access control is therefore restricted.","The present invention seeks to provide for a system and arrangement for controlling and configuring network access and which exhibit advantages over known such systems and arrangements.","According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided telecommunications user equipment including network access control means operative responsive to control parameters and further including a subscriber module accessible remote from the user equipment and arranged to store the said control parameters for use by the said access control means.","According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a telecommunications system comprising a network element and a telecommunications user equipment as defined above and further including a local IP link and at least one device connected via the local IP link and which may be an embedded device (for instance a Central Control Processing Unit, an Application Control Processing Unit, a Subscriber Identity Module, a SD Card) or external terminal equipment (for instance a PC, a laptop, a Personal Digital Assistant, a handset).","Yet further, the present invention provides for a method of network access control by way of control parameters in a user equipment of a telecommunications system, comprising the steps of storing the control parameters in a subscriber module of the user equipment, and allowing access by network access control means of the user equipment to the subscriber module for use of the said control parameters.","According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of controlling network access by way of control parameters in a user equipment of a telecommunications system including the steps of remotely accessing a subscriber module of the user equipment for the provision of the said control parameters therefrom.","The invention is described further hereinafter, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:","Turning first to , there is provided a schematic illustration of a communication system  in which a mobile radio communications device such as a cell phone handset  achieves connectivity with both a local terminal device , and a public network .","As will be appreciated from the present invention, the handset  can function as a network gateway device allowing for IP communication  by way of a local link with the terminal device , and can also allow for the transfer of ALG parameters and filtering rules  with optional exchange\/updates capabilities.","IP communication  is also provided between the handset  and the public network  and an update  of NAT parameters and filtering rule updates at the handset  can be initiated from the network .","Importantly, the handset  includes a subscription module such as a SIM or USIM which provides for NAT and IP filtering within the handset  on the basis of the filtering rules and NAT parameters found therein and as described further below.","There are currently no mechanisms to enable an operator to manage IP traffic and NAT in UE including a subscription module at pre-provisioning and which would ensure that the appropriate applications will be granted network level access. Besides such NW Access can further be limited in time and dependent upon the localisation.","As will be appreciated, the present invention serves to enable the operator to limit the access of the network services to IP-based applications on the basis of information stored in a subscription module such as a SIM or USIM.","The invention is embodied in a device, system and method serving to enable NAT, IP filtering and QoS settings in a UE such that an operator can restrict access to specific applications, control addition of further application dynamically loaded on the UE and provide for pre-provisioning of security rules enabling the device to safely connect to the IP-based network. As such, the invention enables the operator to grant network access to specific services for which it may have concluded appropriate agreements with service providers.","The UE can be in the form of a mobile phone, personal digital assistant with mobile telecommunication capabilities or Home Gateway etc., which, with a subscription module, can comprise a Border Gateway element having an access-control functionality by means of at least one of NAT, Firewall, or Quality of Service elements.","In the form of a border gateway, the device can be interconnected via a local IP link to other internal devices or external terminal equipment devices requiring IP connectivity to a wireless public access network.","The Border Gateway can then act as a router for a local IP link, applying, as required, NAT parameters and filtering rules.","The UE can have a well defined API to access the NAT parameters and\/or filtering rules from the subscriber module element, and the NAT and filtering rules can be read, undated, or removed as required.","In particular, the NAT parameters can be modified dynamically during an IP-based session such as for example a SIP session or a media session.","The NAT parameters can further be used to perform additional ALG translation functions.","The storing of the control parameters such as the NAT\/Filter\/QoS rules and preferences in the subscription module to enable operator and user control on the incoming or outgoing IP traffic advantageously serve to enable pre-provisioning and improved operator control on the IP traffic at the UE.","Turning now to , there is provided a schematic illustration of a network gateway device such as the cell phone handset  of .","Respective connectivity ,  between the local terminal device  and public network  is again illustrated alone with the further functional characteristics of the handset .","That is, the handset  includes a border gateway element  with NAT and\/or firewall functionality and which is arranged to communicate with read\/update\/remove operators, NAT and filtering rules preferences  with a subscriber module  of the handset  which, as noted, can comprise a SIM or USIM.","Within the subscriber module  there is stored the operators NAT\/NAPT\/ALG and filtering rules preferences.","As will be appreciated from the following, the appropriate locations within the subscriber module  are arranged to be accessed and updated by way of the communication link  from the public network  such that a network operator can update, and otherwise enable or disable, the appropriate NAT and firewall functionalities so as to allow for dynamic, adaptation of the gateway functionality of the handset .","It will be appreciated that the invention is well suited to configure incoming\/outgoing IP traffic to a local IP Link such as the IP-based application residing on the same device in which is located the firewall\/NAT solution or the IP-based application residing on another device connected through the IP-local link. Undesired applications are consequently prevented from accessing network services either such as local IP Network Services or public network services, if they do not meet the operator policy.","As illustrated, an example of the overall system comprises a network element a UE with IP-technology capability, a local IP link, and one or more embedded internal devices and\/or external terminal equipments, connected through the local IP link and requiring IP connectivity to public access network. The network element can of course that transfers IP traffic over any transport technology and underlying Access Technology such as 2G, 3G, WiFi, WiMAX, XDLS.","As required for the border gateway, a UE single routable IP address will be available and as provided by wireless public access network, such as an IPv4 or an IPv6 public address to be used by NAT functions to perform address translation. Also provided is a border gateway link-local IP address for communication on IP private local link, acquired for example at startup via IPv4 or IPv6 configuration procedures. Further, each internal device\/external terminal equipment a link-local IP address is provided for communication on private local link, acquired for example at startup via IPv4 or IPv6 configuration procedures, will be used by NAT functions to perform address translation.","For any IP based application or service, the UE or external terminal equipment will use its link-local address in all IP packets. In a scenario in which the ALG function is implemented with the NAT function, the link-local IP address and port will also be used to build all application level messages. The user or device that controls the UE may also enable\/disable the gateway capabilities using a field value in the subscription module. As such the gateway can disable any IP traffic from any of the devices configured in the local IP network","At the UE, the NAT function can serve to control replacing the link-local IP addresses (and ports) of the messages with the UE public IP address and ports for all outgoing IP flows. NAT tables can have been previously populated with the appropriate information such as IP flow direction, source and destination IP addresses and ports in order to filter and translate the IP traffic. For incoming flows the IP address would be replaced by the appropriate link-local IP address where resides a network service accessible from the outside network.","In one arrangement of the invention, the filtering and translation information that can be stored can include optionally the IP flow direction, i.e. whether outgoing or incoming flow, the original calling\/callee IP addresses and\/or ports for filtering purposes, for translation purposes, the new calling\/callee IP addresses and\/or ports can be included and which comprise a combination of both port and IP address for translation purpose can be used in case of NAPT (Network Address Port Translation, also known as \u201cPort Address Translation\u201d or \u201cReverse Address and Port Translation\u201d).","In general at least a subset of the filtering and\/or translation rules must be provided. The NAT is used to perform translation of address and\/or port whereas the filtering is used to reject\/accept a particular type of traffic. Of course QoS rules (Quality of Service) are used to apply a specific QoS Policy on a particular type of traffic, or on a given Interface.","Any NAT parameters pre-configured in the subscription module will advantageously be used to populate the NAT table for \u201cstatic NAT\u201d purposes such as for Network address\/port Translation for connection initiated outside the local network. Such an example could comprise a server application having local IP non routable address accessible by a network operator client for device management purposes. Another example would arise when a client application of a remote HG network desires to access a server application of the local HG network, such that point-to-point sessions can be allowed between the HG routers.","The filtering and translation rules applied by a NAT Solution for Source NAT (Alteration of the source address at POSTROUTING or OUT) would be\n\n","In this case the packets issued from the local IP address on the local port and destined to the callee IP address on the callee port will be modified into packets issued from the public IP on public port and destined to callee IP and callee port. The source information is translated thereby enabling the callee to reply by sending the packets to the public IP address.","Wherein the filtering and translation rules applied by a NAT Solution or the Destination NAT (Alteration of the destination address at PREROUTING) would be\n\n","In this case the destination information is translated by the local information of the IP local IP link.","For clarification:\n\n","It should be noted that the local IP address may also relate to a pool of addresses by indicating the mask value: e.g. \/16 or \/8 if the network devices are to be configured with an address from a predefined set of IP addresses, for example as from a sub-network.","While the port may be specified if it is statically attributed, since the port (or service) used can change dynamically, the value can be null in the Access Control Parameters and the port is then dynamically set by the Firewall\/NAT solution.","Insofar as the Public IP address may not be known, the information available in the Access Control Parameters can therefore include the type of Radio Access Technology (RAT) which is usually attached to a network interface. Consequently by indicating this information, the alteration of the IP address just needs to replace the address of the packets by the one affected on the Interface for source NAT.","Advantageously a domain name will be provided in place of an IP Public Address thereby requiring the UE to further resolve it into an IP address using Domain Name Resolution (DNS) means, while the DNS Server address can be retrieved using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol means.","The destination NAT can be used when external devices want to access a network service attached to the link-local IP address. For a specific service, for example an operator application server for configuration purpose, the application must be arranged to provide security access mechanisms to ensure that only the legitimate persons can access the server. This can be controlled by way of the NAT Information for the translation to he made and the service to he accessible","For traffic and device access control, other Access Control parameters can be added such as the number of IPsec (Internet Protocol Security, whose reference architecture is defined in RFC 2401) sessions allowed, whether or not the Gateway is enabled for all types of connection supported by the device such as 2G\/3G, WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), XDSL (Digital Subscriber LAN), etc., whether or not NAPT is enabled and whether or not an application, and if so which application, is allowed to modify parameters","The NAT\/Filter\/QoS Information stored in the USIM can be included in the Configuration Information used a Customer Network Gateway (CNG). In this example of the invention, an Interface is required between the CNG-NAPT and Firewall function of the CNG and subscription module for retrieving the information of present invention.","When a UE starts up, NAT rules, IP filtering rules and QoS rules can be read from SIM\/USIM so as to configure the Access Control element. Also, the information about data and Time duration, location, and whether the gateway shall be turned on or off is retrieved if present. When the telecommunication mobile device establishes an IP bearer with the network as well as a PDP (Packet Data Protocol) context for 3GPP Access Network, then IP communication can be received by the telecommunication mobile device if the PDP Context refers to an IP context.","During any currently established IP communication, the filtering rules and NAT will apply. On this basis, some of the traffic, whether it is incoming or outgoing traffic, is not blocked and filtered at the border gateway element. For example, in the example of an embedded web server listening on a given port number with a specific IP address, incoming traffic can be filtered so as to give access to incoming connection with the server only. In addition, for SIP based communication NAT coupled with for example the STUN protocol can be used to enable network address translation during data transmission sessions.","Files are added in to the USIM. The AFDshall be selected using the AID (Application Identifier) and information in EFDIR as defined in 3GPP TS 31.102. The services can be added at first bit of byte  within EFstructure so that the telecommunication mobile device can select those services for the purpose of NAT and\/or Filtering rules execution, and\/or QoS settings and as shown in the following table of available services for NAT parameters and filtering rules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Service Contents:","Service n \u00b081:","NWCTRL"]},{"entry":[{},"Service n \u00b082:","RFU"]},{"entry":[{},"Service n \u00b083:","RFU"]},{"entry":[{},"Service n \u00b084:","RFU"]},{"entry":[{},"Service n \u00b085: ","RFU"]},{"entry":[{},"Service n \u00b086: ","RFU"]},{"entry":[{},"Service n \u00b087: ","RFU"]},{"entry":[{},"Service n \u00b088: ","RFU"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Service 81 relates to NAT\/FILTER\/QOS (NWCTRL) Service.

In this case the NAT access control element must be able to exchange configuration information for ALG processing. NAT tables configuration by ALG may also be possible.","As will be appreciated, the described method includes the storage of the preferences on the SIM\/USIM attached to a UE reading, removing and updating of said preferences to be used by the UE during IP communication for IP based services. The NAT\/ALG\/NAPT pre-provisioned configurations, parameters and preferences are advantageously set up at a switch-on of the UE to secure and filter the IP traffic.","The invention is well suited to configure incoming\/outgoing IP traffic to local IP Link such as an IP-based application residing on the same device in which is located the firewall\/NAT solution or the IP-based application residing on another device connected through the IP-local link. Undesired applications are consequently prevented from accessing network services (either local IP Network Services or Public network services) if they do not meet the operator policy and the contract that the user has subscribed to.","The invention can therefore enable restriction for network access to IP-based applications which can further be based on date and time duration associated with the control parameters and the settings can vary depending on the location of the UE. Moreover easier application of said control parameters will be performed thanks to profile settings associated with the control parameters thereby leading to personalized network access settings.","According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided telecommunications user equipment including network access control means operative responsive to control parameters and further including a subscriber module accessible remote from the user equipment and arranged to store the said control parameters for use by the said access control means.","The invention can prove advantageous in facilitating operator and user control of network access. In particular, updates that can only be performed by the operator can be provided in a restricted area in the subscription module. Also, IP policy rules can be applied when the user equipment is turned on and this can include other IP-based session information such as the number of IP sessions allowed.","The network operator can therefore perform IP traffic analysis and dynamically set filtering rules to block undesired traffic which would not respect a service agreement. When a UE allows IP-based application installation, the service management becomes complex and the operator cannot guarantee high level of control which may cause a breech of the agreements the operator has entered into with the service provider(s). Therefore it should be possible for the operator to define a local IP based policy applied on each individual UE and which may depend on the location of the UE (e.g. at a corporate network or at home or in outdoor network), the subscription, and IP security level to be applied.","The telecommunications user equipment can comprise a network gateway device providing access to the external\/public network to internal devices located in the local IP sub-network, and the invention advantageously exhibits the possibility for the user to turn on\/off the gateway functionality.","Further, the telecommunications user equipment can comprise a router between a public network and IP local link, and the subscriber module can of course comprise a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) or USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module, as defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project in the Technical Specification 31.102) card.","In one aspect of the invention, the telecommunications user equipment comprises a mobile radio communications device.","Preferably the control parameters comprise at least one of NAT, filtering, and\/or quality of service preferences.","Preferences are further dependant upon the location of the UE (for instance in outdoor, home, or corporate network, the settings may vary). As such the control parameters may comprise an indication of which situation they apply to.","Further said control parameters are associated to time restriction and as such the control parameters may only be applied at a given date for a defined period of time thereby limiting the access to the specific applications depending on the contract the user has subscribed to.","The telecommunications user equipment can advantageously include an Application Programming Interface (API) for retrieval of the parameters from the subscriber module by the control means.","The telecommunications user equipment can include a Network IP (NWIP) policy manager for retrieval and application of the said control parameters.","According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a telecommunications system comprising a network element and a telecommunications user equipment as defined above and further including a local IP link and at least one device connected via the local IP link and which may be an embedded device (for instance a Central Control Processing Unit, an Application Control Processing Unit, a Subscriber Identity Module, a SD Card) or external terminal equipment (for instance a PC, a laptop, a Personal Digital Assistant, a handset).","Yet further, the present invention provides for a method of network access control by way of control parameters in a user equipment of a telecommunications system, comprising the steps of storing the control parameters in a subscriber module of the user equipment, and allowing access by network access control means of the user equipment to the subscriber module for use of the said control parameters.","The said parameters can be further associated with time and location restrictions. Also, the said parameters can be further associated with one or more configuration profile for the network access control means to easily apply those control parameters. For examples such a profile may refer to a \u201cchild profile\u201d corresponding to a set of control parameters enabling access limitation only to child specific applications.","Besides the control parameters, when referring to NAT rules application, can be further adaptive to the Radio Access network Technology (RAT) Interface. That is a RAT interface can be deduced according to the information indicated in the said control parameters. As such, different settings can be applied for different types of RAT such as a GPRS Evolved Radio Access Network (GERAN) RAT, a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) RAT, Evolved UTRAN (EUTRAN) RAT or a WiFi RAT, or a WiMAX RAT.","The parameters can be factory configured and further be updated, or they can be dynamically provisioned by way of remote access means.","The method can employ remote access of the subscriber module for provisioning of the control parameters.","In particular, the said remote access can be provided for pre-provisioning of the control parameters.","Yet further, the said remote access can allow for updating of the control parameters.","According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of controlling network access by way of control parameters in a user equipment of a telecommunications system including the steps of remotely accessing a subscriber module of the user equipment for the provision of the said control parameters therefrom.","Again, such remote access can allow for pre-processing of the control parameters, and the said remote access can allow for updating of the control parameters within the subscribed module and which can comprise an over the air update procedure.","In one particular exemplary embodiment said remote access can allow for updating of the control parameters within the subscriber module on the basis of an IP-based embedded server in the UE (either in the mobile communication radio device or in the subscriber module), and said embedded server allowing for provisioning of said control parameters, and said embedded server receiving incoming requests if they are issued by the legitimate remote access (e.g. this can be achieved by pre-provisioning the remote access identifier by way of an IP address or domain name).","In another particular exemplary embodiment said remote access can allow for updating of the control parameters based on UE location thereby leading the subscriber module to trigger the access network control means for application of the new access network control settings by way of NAT rules, filtering rules or QoS settings to specific IP traffic.","As with the device and system defined above, the control parameters within the method can comprise one or more of NAT, filtering and\/or quality of service preferences.","The proposed solution enables the operator to limit the access of the network services to IP-based applications and on the basis of information stored in the subscriber module. Such information can be applied in a Firewall\/NAT software or hardware solution, for example as an IP security policy that can be retrieved from the subscriber module.","Such stored information can be in a generic format, stored in the subscriber module, and to be used irrespective of the type of NAT\/Filtering Solution employed in the UE, and such as Netfilter, IPchain. IPFilter and IPFirewall fire walling tools.","Such stored information can alternatively be formatted in a script file, stored in the subscriber module, and to be used irrespective of the type of NAT\/Filtering Solution employed in the UE, thereby requiring said Solution to execute or interpret said script for the application of said control parameters.","The present invention can therefore advantageously provide a method and system for assisting network operators in the definition of their IP Policy by way of for example IP filtering rules, NAT pre-configuration, authorized port and gateway on\/off control.","As noted, in one arrangement the invention is based on the concept of a UE comprising NAT\/filtering capabilities, and a subscriber module such as for example a SIM or USIM for the storage of NAT information and filtering rules.","By means of the present invention an operator can control IP based services running on a telecommunication device for which a NAT is required and firewall rules need to be applied for security and IP traffic control purpose. As such the invention can provide means for an operator mobile device to control outgoing and incoming IP traffic at the \u201cend device\u201d having a public IP address and such as a mobile device, or a Home\/Corporate Gateway with a SIM\/USIM. Data is stored and may be pre-provisioned in the SIM or USIM and can be updated by the operator such as by way of Over-The-Air (OTA) functionality or otherwise.","It should be appreciated that the invention can be employed with any kind of internal device or external terminal equipment implementing IP based applications and connected via an IP local link, located behind a device, for example, a Mobile Equipment or a Corporate Customer Gateway, acting as a router and performing NAT to convert link-local addresses into routable addresses assigned by network and in which is applied firewall rules.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, the invention is not limited to these embodiments.
