title: Modal progress dialog
abstract: A system and method for modal progress dialog may provide progress feedback to a user when an application accesses or uses system resources on a computing platform. The application may access or use the system resource by invoking an operation via a system interface. Execution of the application may be blocked pending receiving a result of the system resource operation. The progress feedback may be provided by the system interface without the involvement of the application. The progress feedback may include displaying a progress dialog. The progress dialog may be displayed in a window associated with the application. The progress dialog may include a visual indication of a degree of completion of the system resource operation. The progress dialog may mitigate a user misinterpreting delays in completion of the system resource operation as misoperation or failure of the application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The present disclosure relates to the field of human-machine interfaces (HMI). In particular, to a system and method for modal progress dialog.","2. Related Art","Various computing platforms provide for the execution of applications. The applications may include native applications and\/or 3-part applications. The applications access and use system resources (e.g. objects in a file system) by invoking system interfaces (e,g, application programming interfaces (API)). In so doing, the applications may be coded with little or no insight or knowledge into the detailed operation and control of the system resources.","When an application invokes a system interface to access or use a system resource there is typically a delay before the system interface responds. The delay can vary from a virtually human-imperceptible time (e.g. on the order of 10's of mS for some local operations) to a user-frustratingly long time (e.g. on the order of 10's of sec to minutes for some network operations). In the absence of some feedback, the user may mistakenly perceive a long delay as misoperation or failure of the application.","A system and method for modal progress dialog may provide progress feedback to a user when an application accesses or uses a system resource on a computing platform. The application may be a native or a 3-party application. The application may access or use the system resource by invoking an operation via a system interface. The system resource operation may include, for example, a file system operation, a network operation, an input\/output (I\/O) operation or other similar operations. Execution of the application may be blocked pending receiving a result of the system resource operation. The progress feedback may be provided by the system interface without the involvement of the application. The progress feedback may include displaying a progress dialog. The progress dialog may be displayed in a window associated with the application. The progress dialog may include a visual indication of a degree of completion of the system resource operation. The progress dialog may mitigate a user misinterpreting delays in completion of the system resource operation as misoperation or failure of the application.","The system and method for modal progress dialog may allow applications that access or use system resources to be coded with little or no insight or knowledge into the detailed operation and control of the system resources while still providing the user with progress feedback. The progress feedback may be provided by system software while the application is blocked pending receipt of the result of the system resource operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","102","108","102","110"]},"Each of one or more resource managers  may provide management of, and control access to, one or more system resources . The action request may, at least partially, be processed by one or more resource managers . The resource managers  may include, for example, a file system manager, network protocol stack or I\/O controller. The system resources  may include, for example, files and directories in a local or remote file system, network streams, I\/O pipes and other similar system resources. The action request may include operations such as, for example, file open, file read, file write, file copy, file or directory move, file transfer, and other similar operations on system resources .","The progress manager  may interoperate with the system interface , the one or more resource managers  and other entities executable on the computing platform. The progress manager  may determine when a progress dialog  is to be displayed during the processing of an action request. Some action requests may be completed in a time duration that is perceived as immediate or acceptably short by a user. Other action requests may be completed in a time duration that is perceived as long or objectionable by the user. When no feedback is provided to the user for an action request that has long or objectionable duration (delay), the user may mistakenly perceive the delay as misoperation or failure of the application . The progress manager  may determine when a progress dialog  is to be displayed when an expected duration of processing the action request exceeds a threshold. The expected duration may be a function of any one or more of the action requested, the system resource associated with the action requested, a location of the system resource and a measured time to execute a portion of the action (e.g. the time required to complete a first 1MB or a previous 5% of the operation). When the progress manager  determines that a progress dialog  is to be displayed, the progress dialog may be shown on a display  associated with the computing platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["110","202","114","202","206","114","202","206","114","110","204","110","102","204","110","102","104","104","112","202","206","110","110","112","112","208","208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["112","112","208","208","112","302","112","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 5"],"b":["400","100","500","400","402","108","110","102","404","406","112","112","408","112","202","206","110","410","110","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","502","506","504","502","500","102","104","106","110","504","112","202"]},"The processor  may comprise a single processor or multiple processors that may be disposed on a single chip, on multiple devices or distributed over more that one system.
