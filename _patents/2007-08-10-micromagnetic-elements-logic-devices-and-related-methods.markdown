Computers using magnetic processors would have the potential for low power requirements, and indefinite data retention during power interruptions. Some Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM)-based reconfigurable logic elements have been developed. For example, Ney et al., Nature, 425(6957): 485-487, 2003 reported MRAM-based devices where a tunneling current travels through a barrier layer between a high coercivity (hard) layer and a low coercivity (soft) layer. In Ney's system, signal contrast results from the relative alignment of the magnetization (parallel or antiparallel) in the hard and soft layers. Reconfiguration of the gate is possible using strip lines. However, in all of these MRAM systems, good signal contrast relies on the formation of thin tunnel barriers, which are susceptible to chemical degradation, defect formation and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) damage. In other work, magnetic systems using either domain wall motion or flipping of dipole states have been used to process binary data.","A vortex magnetization state that closes on itself, most often in a ring-shaped structure, exhibits excellent stability once the magnetization is written into the material. The closed loop structure has very symmetric fields and thus, does not affect nearby elements significantly. Multiple elements may therefore be arranged in close proximity to one another with an ultimate area density approximated at 400 Gbits\/in. However, the low leakage fields of these elements can make it difficult or impossible to detect the direction of the vortices (i.e., the stored bits of \u201c1\u201d and \u201c0\u201d) using conventional magneto-optical readout methods.","Readout from planar magnetic devices is typically accomplished using either a polarized Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) signal from the entire device or Magnetic Force Microscopy signals from local regions. MOKE is a non-contact optical technique that uses either a polar, longitudinal or transverse light beam. A small portion of the incident light beam undergoes a polarization rotation upon reflection, and this polarization rotation is proportional to magnetization and off-diagonal elements of the sample's dielectric matrix. The polar Kerr effect has been used in magneto-optic storage applications, but for the examination of in-plane magnetization, the longitudinal or transverse Kerr effect must be used, despite the inherently small signal associated with each of these geometries.","In one embodiment, a micromagnetic element includes a magnetic film having a width of one micrometer or less, and an optical coating that covers at least a portion of the magnetic film.","In one embodiment, a micromagnetic logic device includes a plurality of micromagnetic elements that are physically linked to one another, and at least one of the micromagnetic elements includes an optical coating covering at least a portion of the micromagnetic element.","In one embodiment, a method of forming a micromagnetic logic device includes providing a plurality of interconnected micromagnetic elements on a substrate and coating at least a portion of one of the micromagnetic elements with an optical coating.","In one embodiment, a method of using a micromagnetic logic device to perform a logic operation includes: providing a first external magnetic field having a first direction of magnetization, the first external magnetic field magnetically saturating a first micromagnetic element and a second micromagnetic element of the logic device, the first micromagnetic element and the second micromagnetic element are joined; reducing the first external magnetic field, thereby forcing the first and second micromagnetic elements to adopt onion configurations; and applying a second external magnetic field proximal to the first micromagnetic element, the second external magnetic field having a direction of magnetization that is perpendicular to the first direction of magnetization, thereby inducing a clockwise or counter clockwise vortex state in the first micromagnetic element and an opposite vortex state in the second micromagnetic element.","In one embodiment, a method for detecting a magnetic state of a micromagnetic element includes applying an optical coating to at least a portion of the micromagnetic element, measuring an optical signal received from the micromagnetic element, and determining the magnetic state of the micromagnetic element based upon the measured signal.","Micromagnetic elements, logic devices and methods of fabricating and using them to store data and perform logic operations are disclosed herein. The elements and devices may advantageously operate with low power requirements, are reconfigurable and have the ability to retain data during power interruptions. Further, the elements and devices can be inherently radiation hard and immune to EMP effects.","In addition to use of the micromagnetic elements in magnetic storage media and magnetic logic devices, the disclosed micromagnetic elements are, for example, usable for anti-counterfeiting purposes and in humidity and temperature sensors. In anti-counterfeiting applications, micromagnetic elements may be used to form a magnetic watermark that is only visible under polarized light and in the presence of a magnetic field. In sensors, a polymer film applied over the magnetic film may change thickness in response to the environment, thereby altering reflectance.","In the attached drawings, like numbers represent similar elements in multiple figures. Numbering without parentheses is used to denote a genus (e.g., device ), whereas numbering with parentheses denotes a species within a genus (e.g., device ()). These drawings may not be drawn to scale, and multiple elements may not be labeled for the sake of clarity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2","b":["100","100","102","102","102"]},"A portion of magnetic film  (e.g., half) may be coated with an optical coating , such as a vacuum deposited dielectric or metal, or a spin coated or dip coated polymer.

However, magnetoresistive techniques, using electrical contacts, can be used to determine the magnetic state of a micromagnetic element. Such techniques may permit fast and accurate readout of the magnetic state of multiple logic devices formed on a substrate.","In one example of optical readout from a micromagnetic logic device , only the output element  is coated with an optical coating . In another embodiment, a coating  may be used to suppress substrate reflections and\/or obscure parts of logic device  from which signals will not be obtained. Thus, in accordance with the disclosed instrumentalities, an optical coating may be used to either enhance or suppress the optical signal deriving from the magnetization of micromagnetic element . Signal to noise contrast enhancement by a factor of twenty-five has been demonstrated with coatings  described herein. The coatings  detailed above are such that the ability of logic device  to operate with either magnetic or electrical drive circuits is not affected.","When the magnetization of micromagnetic element  is in the x-y plane (best seen in ), the use of measurement techniques that seek to detect changes along the x- and\/or y-axes can be prevented, as there is no net magnetization component in the x-y plane. Instead, micromagnetic elements , which should be at least partially covered by an optical coating, facilitate readout by creating an asymmetry in a detected optical signal from the two portions (e.g., coated and uncoated portions) of a magnetically aligned structure, or by selectively suppressing the signal from control bits.","In one embodiment, optical coating  may be applied to magnetic film  with a gradient thickness. Differences in coating thickness between one portion of element  and another portion of the same element  create asymmetry in a detected optical signal.","A computational model has been developed to allow prediction of the effects of coatings . The computational model, expressed in code, functions by modeling the effect of dielectric coatings in enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of optical reflectance signals derived from the magnetic behavior of materials. The following non-limiting examples provide details of the computational model and comparisons with experimental results.","A multilayer matrix method was implemented in MATLAB\u00ae (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.) to determine coating reflectivities, and these values were used in a model that predicts the measured contrast in the coatings. The signal contrast or Kerr contrast, \u0394I\/I, was used as a figure of merit following the analysis of Allwood, D. A. et al., -. Journal of Physics D-Applied Physics, 2003, 36(18): 2175-2182, where \u0394I is the modulation intensity induced by magnetic field reversal, and Iis the dc magnitude of the signal. The use of a single layer antireflection coating on Ni was examined, both experimentally and numerically, as well as a material-dielectric structure over opaque Ni coatings.","In-plane magnetization effects, and in particular, the longitudinal Kerr effect were modeled. At oblique incidence angles, with either s- or p-linearly polarized light, the off-diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor gave rise to a reflectance component whose polarization was rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the incident light polarization. The magnitude of the signal depended on the input intensity, the incidence angle, the magnetization, the size of the off-diagonal tensor elements, and the impedance match between the incident and exit media and the magneto-optic coating. From the known dielectric properties of the relevant materials, the coefficients for the rotated and unrotated (Fresnel) reflectance components were determined using the matrix method, as formulated by Abdulhalim, I., . Journal of Optics a-Pure and Applied Optics, 1999, 1(5): 646-653 and Abdulhalim, I., -. Journal of Optics a-Pure and Applied Optics, 2000, 2(6): 557-564. These coefficients were then used in a direct determination of the magnetic field-induced signal in the experimental apparatus.","The magnetization-induced signal was measured as an intensity variation, or asymmetry, during magnetization reversal in the samples. A vector diagram of the emerging field components is shown in , where Eand Erepresent energy vector for s-polarized and p-polarized light respectively; E represents an energy vector for light reflected from the sample; \u03b8is the Kerr angle; and \u03b8 is the angle at which transmission is measured by a polarizing analyzer. The experimental conditions were modeled, in which phase differences between the reflected s- and p-polarized components were eliminated by a quarterwave plate, and the signal was examined for the case of s-polarized incident light. In addition to the unrotated component r, there is an orthogonal Kerr component, r, in the light reflected from the sample. (As used herein, lower case (e.g., r) is the amplitude reflection coefficient and uppercase (e.g., R) is the intensity reflectance. The first subscript represents the input polarization, and the second, the reflected polarization.) When rand rare in-phase, the reflected polarization will be rotated by the Kerr angle \u03b8compared to the incident polarization (). For opposite magnetization directions, the sign of rwill change, providing a rotation in the reflected polarization vector for opposite magnetization of 2\u03b8.","Experimentally, a polarizing analyzer with a transmission axis making an angle \u03c6 to rwas used in order to block most of the reflected s-polarized light (). For \u03c6=0\u00b0, the transmitted intensity of the Kerr component Ris a maximum but the signal change for opposite magnetization directions will be zero. Rotating the analyzer to a small non-zero angle breaks the symmetry of the system, and the difference in the cross-term between rand \u00b1Rbecomes measurable. Following the development by Allwood et al. (2003), an expression was derived for the signal change during field reversal; this allowed a determination of the optimal choice of \u03c6 for measuring the contrast.","When the magnetic field is applied in the positive direction (rvector points in the positive direction), the intensity of the light transmitted through the polarizer is given by:\n\n*=(sin(\u03c6)+cos(\u03c6))sin(\u03c6)+2sin(\u03c6)cos(\u03c6)+cos(\u03c6)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nfor rin the negative direction (opposite magnetization):\n\n=(sin(\u03c6)+cos(180\u2212\u03c6))=(sin(\u03c6)\u2212cos(\u03c6))sin(\u03c6)\u22122sin(\u03c6)cos(\u03c6)+cos(\u03c6)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nThe average transmitted intensity for light coming from the sample is:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","avg"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["I","sample"],"mo":"+"},{"mi":["I","sample"],"mo":"-"}],"mo":"+"}}},{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mi":["r","sp"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"cos","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}},{"msubsup":{"mi":["r","ss"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"sin","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["I","r","r"],"sub":["sp","ss "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","I"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"msub":{"mi":["I","avg"]}},{"mrow":[{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":[{"mi":["r","sp"]},{"mi":["r","ss"]}],"mrow":[{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}]},{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mi":["r","sp"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"cos","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}},{"msubsup":{"mi":["r","ss"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"sin","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}}],"mo":"+"}]}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"sp "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","I"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"msub":{"mi":["I","avg"]}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":[{"mi":["r","sp"]},{"mi":["r","ss"]}],"mrow":[{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}]},{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mi":["r","sp"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"cos","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}},{"msubsup":{"mi":["r","ss"],"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"sin","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}}],"mo":["+","+"],"mi":"\u03b3"}]},{"mrow":[{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":[{"mi":["r","sp"]},{"mi":["r","ss"]}],"mrow":[{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}]},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["R","sp"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"cos","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}},{"msub":{"mi":["R","ss"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"sin","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03d5"}}}],"mo":["+","+"],"mi":"\u03b3"}]}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"6"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["avg","avg "]},"Predictions made by Abdulhalim's formulation (1999 and 2000) rely on knowledge of all terms of the dielectric tensor of each material in the multilayer stack. A dielectric tensor is a 3\u00d73 matrix that contains information about how an electromagnetic wave will propagate in a given material. The components of a dielectric tensor are in general non-equal and complex, and can be expressed as:\n\n\u2208=\u2208\u2033\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nwhere i, j=x, y, z. An isotropic material will have a dielectric tensor in which the diagonal terms \u2208, \u2208, \u2208are all equal and non-zero, and are referred to as the dielectric constant, \u2208. The dielectric constant, \u2208, of an isotropic material is related to the index of refraction, n, of that same material by the expression:\n\n\u2208=(8)\n\nwhere the index of refraction can be real or complex. For a magneto-optic material, there will be additional terms in the 3\u00d73 matrix that are non-zero. The Kerr geometry (polar, longitudinal, or transverse) determines which of these off-diagonal terms will be non-zero.\n","Abdulhalim's general algorithm makes two primary assumptions that apply to every material in the multilayer stack. The first is that none of the materials contain sources of energy. The second is that the materials are all homogeneous in the x-y plane. These two assumptions mean that the electric and magnetic fields in these materials can be expressed as:\n\n()=()exp(()\n\n()=()exp(()\u2003\u2003(9)\n\nwhere\n\n\u2003\u2003(10)\n\nis the propagation vector. However, Abdulhalim reformulated this propagation vector to contain what can best be described as a unit direction vector, {right arrow over (v)}. Using the indices of the unit direction vector, {right arrow over (v)}=(v, v, v), the propagation vector can be rewritten as {right arrow over (k)}=k(v, v, v), where k=2\u03c0\/\u03bb. The x- and y-components of the unit direction vector can be easily calculated:\n\nsin \u03b3 cos \u03c6\n\nsin \u03b3 cos \u03c6\u2003\u2003(11)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the angle that the incident light makes with respect to the z-axis, \u03c6 is the angle that the light makes with the x-axis, and nis the index of refraction of the incident medium. For simplicity, it is assumed that the plane of incidence is the xz-plane so that \u03c6=0, which means that v=0. Calculation of the z-component of the unit direction vector can vary depending on whether the material involved is a general biaxial material or a material that leads to eigenmode degeneration, such as an isotropic material. Abdulhalim clearly explains the calculation of the z-component for both of these cases.\n","In order to optimize the Kerr signal, it is desirable to couple most of the input light into the magnetic material. Such optimization can be accomplished by overcoating with a dielectric material. A brief introduction to one method of coating design from Macleod, H. A., 3rd ed. 2001: Taylor and Francis is presented. An antireflection coating can be thought of as an admittance transformer, matching the admittance of the substrate material to that of the incident medium. It is common in optics to work with admittance in free space units, where (for normal incidence) the characteristic admittances of materials become equal to their complex refractive indices. In determining the optical response of a coated material, it is useful to create a graph of the evolving admittance with coating thickness, known as an admittance locus. For a dielectric film, this admittance locus gives a circle centered on a real axis, intersecting it at two points, aand awith a*a=n, where n is the index of the layer (normal incidence). For perfect antireflection, the admittance locus must end at the admittance of the incident medium, i.e., (1, 0) for air.","Given a continuous range of film indices between nand n, as shown in , it is possible to antireflect perfectly, for a single wavelength, any material with a characteristic admittance in the region bounded by the two circles. Should a material lie outside this region, as is the case with nickel, the best that can generally be done with a single layer is illustrated by the locus AB for the highest index available. For a perfect antireflection coating, using dielectric materials, the AB locus must be joined to one of the loci in the shaded area, most conveniently that of the high-index material. Provided that the point B has an admittance greater than n\/njoining the AB locus to one of the loci in the shaded area will be possible with the addition of a low-index layer to yield a three-layer antireflection coating.","An alternative embodiment makes use of a metallic layer to bridge the gap between the locus AB and the point 1.0 on the real axis. This embodiment has the advantage of simplicity but the disadvantage of some absorption in the metal layer.  shows the admittance locus for such an antireflection coating for p-polarization of 45\u00b0. Note that, in this example, the admittances have been further normalized so that the air incident medium remains at the point unity at non-normal incidence. These design concepts apply rigorously to Fresnel reflection coefficients, but not as directly to the Kerr components. The design concepts can be used to minimize the substrate reflectance from the area surrounding a micromagnetic element, and to provide an approximation of the conditions necessary for optimization of the Kerr reflectance, R. Maximizing the transmission into the material increases the amount of light that can be rotated, but does not necessarily maximize the transmission of the rotated component as it exits the film in the direction of the detector. The situation gets more complicated when considering non-normal incidence angles. A numerical approach is therefore used to better refine the designs and determine the optimum coating parameters.","Thin film samples were fabricated by vapor deposition onto fused silica substrates. The samples were of bare Ni and ZrOcoated Ni. The thickness of the dielectric was graded across the sample, from 150-400 nm. The ZrOlayer was patterned photolithographically to permit an accurate determination of the physical thickness at each measured point. The ZrOwas coated onto 42.5 nm of nickel, and a corner of the sample was masked to leave bare Ni for measurements.","Fused silica substrates were first washed with a solution of distilled (DI) water and Alconox\u00ae detergent. After rinsing in flowing DI water, they were ultrasonically cleaned in isopropanol in a Teflon\u00ae substrate holder. The substrates were removed from the isopropanol and immediately blown dry with filtered nitrogen gas.","The nickel (99.9% pure) was then c-beam evaporated at a rate of 4-6 \u212b\/sec in a diffusion-pumped vacuum chamber. Base pressure in the chamber at the beginning of deposition was 3\u00d710Torr, and the maximum pressure reached during the nickel deposition was approximately 1\u00d710Ton. The ZrOwas deposited by reactive electron beam deposition of Zr in a background of 1\u00d710Torr of O. Thicknesses were monitored using a quartz crystal monitor, and verified by a Tencor Alphastep\u00ae profilometer measurement. The gradient in thickness for the ZrOwas made by partially blocking the substrate with an aluminum plate placed 5 cm from the substrate. The finite size of the source led to a gradient in the coating thickness over a lateral distance of 7 mm.","Measurements were made using a NanoMOKE II\u00ae magnetometer, produced by Durham Magneto Optics, Ltd. The longitudinal MOKE configuration was used, with an applied field of +\/\u2212150 Oe. A laser diode of the magnetometer has a wavelength of 635 nm and was incident upon the sample at an angle of about 45 degrees. Linearly polarized light was incident on the sample with either the p- or s-polarization, and the reflected signal was measured. A quarterwave plate was adjusted to restore linear polarization after reflection off the sample. Since the magnetically rotated reflectance component was so small, a cross-term with the unrotated light was measured by moving the analyzer slightly off the excitation angle.","Components of the measurement system are shown in . In addition to the standard components, a variable neutral density filter was inserted into the beam path between the receiving lens and quarter waveplate to allow measurement to be made at large analyzer angles without saturation of the photodetector. A zero-order half waveplate centered at 632.8 nm was placed between the polarizing cube and the objective lens in order to select for p-polarized or s-polarized light; this plate was tilted a few degrees to provide optimal rotation of the 635 nm wavelength input light. The tilt was adjusted by minimizing the null signal at the detector with the analyzer at the extinction angle.","A schematic hysteresis loop is shown at the top of . An applied field is plotted along the x-axis, and the intensity incident at the photodetector is plotted along the y-axis. The two metrics of particular interest for this experiment are \u0394I, the height of the loop, and I, the intensity at the vertical center of the loop. The Kerr contrast is defined as \u0394I\/I, and is the metric that was maximized, as it is the manifestation of the magnetic response of the material.","Measurements of \u0394I\/Ifor all samples were made by first minimizing (nulling) the signal at each thickness by iteratively rotating the quarter waveplate and analyzer. The nulled analyzer position defines \u03c6=0\u00b0, and the quarter waveplate rotation angle and null signal were recorded. The signal change, \u0394I, induced by the applied field, and average signal, I, as a function of analyzer angle, \u03c6, were then measured.","The NanoMOKE II\u00ae magnetometer used for these measurements could only saturate nickel films with thicknesses up to 50 nm. For 42.5 nm thick samples, approximately 2% transmission was observed, but the difference between the Kerr component of reflectivity of an opaque film and one of 42.5 nm was less than 0.1%, based on both calculations and observations.","Optimization of the MOKE contrast for the case where the phase shift is externally adjusted requires maximization of ror r(the rotated light reflectivity) and adjustment of ror r(the Fresnel component) to the optimal level for the given experimental setup. Calculations were used to model the improvement in contrast resulting from coating the magneto-optic material, and measurements confirmed the results for a coated film of nickel.","Optical constants were taken from the literature and the values were confirmed by measurements of the s- and p-polarized reflectivities at a 45\u00b0 angle of incidence. The values for the diagonal elements, \u2208=\u2208=\u2208were 4.2 for ZrO(see Sloan, -(Sloan Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, Calif.)), \u22129.9+1.01 i for Au (see Palik, E. D., ed. 1985, Academic Press: Orlando, Fla.) and \u221213.45+21.38 i for Ni (Palik, 1985). The components of the off-diagonal elements of the dielectric matrix were determined by measuring the magneto-optic coefficients of bare nickel films, and were in reasonable agreement with values from the literature (see Erskine, J. L. and E. A. Stern, -. Physical Review Letters, 1973, 30(26): 1329-1332 and Visnovsky, S. et al., . Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, 1993, 127(1-2): 135-139). The off-diagonal terms, \u2208for Ni were taken as 0.324-0.015 i, based on fitting the measured values of \u0394I\/I for s- and p-polarized measurements of the MOKE signal. It should be noted that the depolarization factor introduced by the collimating lens leads to some distortion of these values. However, for determining the enhancement obtainable with a coating, it is desirable to use these experimental values.","Polar Kerr Effect\u2014Code Validation","In order to model a wide variety of optical coatings, the method described by Abdulhalim (1999 and 2000) was implemented, using MATLAB\u00ae. The code was validated by calculating the four-layer design of Balasubramanian, K., A. S. Marathay, and H. A. Macleod, ---. Thin Solid Films, 1988, 164: 391-403, (previously used for validation by Mansuripur, M., --2\u00d72 . Journal of Applied Physics, 1990, 67(10): 6466-6475 and by Abdulhalim (1999)) for magneto-optic storage layers, successfully reproducing their results.","Enhancing rUsing Optical Overlayers","Examining again the expression in Eq. (6), it is clear that an increase in rwill lead to an enhancement of the Kerr contrast. Such an increase in rcan be accomplished by addition of an antireflection layer. A coating applied to the nickel (or other magneto-optic material) can increase the amount of light that reaches the interior of the magneto-optic layer, and hence the rotated component. As Qureshi, N., H. Schmidt and A. R. Hawkins observed, for a single layer dielectric (-. Applied Physics Letters, 2004, 85(3): 431-433), an optimal impedance match is achieved for n\u02dc3.7, which is a somewhat inconvenient value for an experimentalist wishing to operate in the visible region of the spectrum. However, it is possible to obtain the same impedance match through either a multilayer design, or a two layer metal-dielectric coating, as described above.","In , the calculated reflected longitudinal Kerr intensity, R=r, is shown as a function of incidence angle and refractive index for a single layer dielectric coating on Ni. For each index value, a thickness of overcoat that maximizes the value of Ris used. The value of Rat n=1 represents uncoated metal. A factor of approximately 8 improvement in the rotated component of the intensity may be expected from a ZnS (n=2.35) overcoat on Ni. An additional gain in the raw longitudinal Kerr signal may be realized by adjusting the incident angle. The optimal angle also shifts slightly when the magneto-optic material is overcoated with the dielectric, as shown.","Increases in the value of rwill increase the numerator in Eq. (6), but the contrast ratio of the system is a function of rand r, which are interdependent quantities.","Optimum Ratio of rto ror r","Although rand rare almost inversely related, a small reduction in rfrom the maximum value allows tuning of rthrough a substantial range to find the optimal conditions for magnetic contrast. From Eq. (6), the maximum contrast is obtained by optimizing \u0394I\/I. Since ris many orders of magnitude smaller than rfor (small) values of \u03c6 that lead to non-zero numerators, the dominant term in the denominator is Ror \u03b3.","When an antireflection coating is applied to increase the value of r, a simultaneous reduction in r(and r) is generally observed. Although this gives a larger value for the Kerr rotation angle, it also leads to a reduction in the magnitude of the cross-term that is measured. Analyzer angles are typically on the order of 10radians, and \u03b3 is typically on the order of 10, so reduction of rbelow a few percent no longer enhances the contrast. In fact, reduction of rreduces \u0394I while Istays constant (\u03b3 dominates), reducing the overall contrast. This signal loss can be regained under some conditions by measurement at a larger analyzer angle, \u03c6. In the calculations below, Abdulhalim's formulation is again used to derive the reflection coefficients and Allwood's treatment of the signal in the presence of a depolarization term is used to predict the signal contrast ratio for a dielectric coated magneto-optic film for both s- and p-polarized light incident at 45 degrees. Phase effects are not considered in these calculations, as these experimental conditions permit adjustment of the phase to generally obtain only linearly polarized light.","ZnOon Ni","The effect of a dielectric overcoat on a magneto-optic material was modeled to determine the relationship between r, r, the Kerr angle and the angle-independent term in the expression for \u0394I.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIGS. 27 and 28","FIG. 27","FIG. 28"],"sub":["2","sp","ss","sp","ps","pp","avg ","avg "]},"For both p-polarized and s-polarized light, the coating increases the \u0394I\/Iratio and moves the optimum analyzer angle to larger values. The larger analyzer angle is helpful to recoup losses in the magnitude of the cross-term due to the reduction in Rand R. This increased magnitude at larger analyzer angles is more marked for s-polarized light than for p-polarized light, due to larger reductions in R.","Metal-Dielectric Coating\u2014Au\/ZrO\/Ni","To improve the impedance matching using some available dielectrics, a two layer design including a thin metal layer atop the dielectric can be used. For this example, 16 nm of gold (based on an optimization of the contrast) was deposited onto a variable thickness ZrOcoating on a 42.5 nm thick Ni film.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 29","sub":["2 ","avg"]},"Bare Ni Film","Results for measurement and modeling of \u0394I\/Ifor an uncoated region of the 42.5 nm thick Ni film are shown in . Calculations used a value of \u03b3=1\u00d710. Experimentally, experienced depolarization and low throughput of the system imply larger uncertainties at small analyzer angles. The minimum detector voltage value, I, for p-polarized light, measured at the null point, was 50 mV. At the peak, \u0394I\/Iwas 100 mV, and at angles about 3 degrees, it was maintained at 2000 mV by adjusting the neutral density filter. Angles below 1 degree were difficult to measure accurately, so they were instead derived from the theoretical asymptotic form of I, which decreases as sin\u03c6. For the s-polarized curve, the null value was 62 mV (due to imperfections in the halfwave plate). The value of Iat the peak contrast was 122 mV, and above 3 degrees Iwas maintained at 2000 mV. The null values were reproducible within 8 mV, suggesting that they are a reasonable measure of the depolarization fraction.","ZrO\/Ni Film","The \u0394I\/Ibehavior as a function of film thickness and analyzer angle was measured for a 42.5 nm film of Ni with a gradient thickness overlayer of ZrO(index=2.05). The data mirror the calculations, as shown in , but with some minor differences. There is a factor of 2-2.5 times enhancements in the contrast obtained with the overcoat of ZrO, in accord with the model, and there are interference peaks in the thickness vs. contrast curves. The peak enhancement occurs at slightly larger analyzer angles for s-polarization than for p-polarization, as predicted by the calculations. However, there is a notable asymmetry in the data on the two sides of the enhancement peak. In particular, the drop-off in the signal with thickness is slower, and the width of the peak with respect to analyzer angle is greater on the high thickness side of the enhancement peak. This behavior is clearly correlated with a measured asymmetry in the values of the depolarization leakage that were measured when the signal was nulled at each thickness value.","The minimum (null) signal was recorded at each thickness, which was used to derive a value for \u03b3, based on a multiplicative increase over the value (10) obtained for the bare Ni film. Using these modified \u03b3 values, the analyzer angle response at several thicknesses was modeled. The results are shown in . Asymmetry in the data is well reproduced. A source of excess depolarization on the high thickness side is believed to be related to a multitude of planes of incidence from the focusing lens, with additional phase shifts being introduced by the coating.","Metal-Dielectric Coating","Experiments were performed on a metal-dielectric coating on a thin Ni layer deposited on opaque aluminum. For this example, a film stack consisted of 100 nm of Al on SiO, coated with 20 nm of Ni, a variable thickness layer of ZnS, and a crossed gradient layer of Au deposited on the ZnS. There were no fiducial marks on the films, so the exact thicknesses were inferred from optical behavior. ZnS and Au thickness determinations for the calculations were made based on matching the s- and p-polarized reflectivities of the structure. The qualitative features of the model, such as peak shifts to higher analyzer angles, and the Kerr angle sign change for the s-polarized signal, were observed in the film structures. However, contrast ratios were not noticably improved over those obtained with the dielectric coating.","Improvements in longitudinal Kerr contrast were measured and modeled for thin Ni films with simple anti-reflection coatings. \u0394I\/Iwas taken as the key parameter, rather than the Kerr angle, and it was found that these quantities are optimized under different conditions. For opaque magneto-optic films, an anti-reflection coating is important to enhancing \u0394I\/I. While the model suggests that reduction in the unrotated reflectance component (Ror R) can be accommodated by measurement at higher analyzer angles, it was found that there is increased depolarization under the conditions that favor measurement at large analyzer angles, which reduces the overall contrast attainable.","Using a single overcoat of ZrO, an improvement in \u0394I\/Iof a factor of 2.5 at an incidence angle of 45 degrees for both polarizations was calculated. Experimentally, for p-polarization, an improvement of a factor of 2.45 was measured, while for s-polarization, the enhancement measured was only 2.14. Increasing the incidence angle to 65 degrees is expected to lead to an enhancement of a factor of 3. The metal\/dielectric coating is thus predicted to have slightly superior (5% better) performance at this higher angle of incidence.","Changes may be made in the above methods and devices without departing from the scope hereof.
