title: Method and apparatus for remotely changing flow profile in conduit and drilling bit
abstract: An apparatus and method for remotely adjusting the hydraulic horse power per square inch (HSI) of a drill bit. The apparatus and method may allow the nozzle geometry to be varied remotely without the need to pull the drill string outside the hole. This nozzle may include a body configured to be secured within the rotary drill bit, and a fluid passage within that body that leads to an orifice. The geometry of the fluid passage may be variable, and varying it may result in a change in the nozzle HSI; this may allow drilling different rock formations to be optimized in different drilling environments. Different placements of the nozzle, such as within the inner flow passage or between the inner flow passage and annular flow passage for controlling flow profile within a wellbore, a tubular string or a flow conduit, may be envisioned.

No. 8,342,266, issued Mar. 15, 2011, for TIMED STEERING NOZZLE ON A DOWNHOLE DRILL BIT, by David R Hall, included by reference herein.","The concept of forming subterranean wells is referred to; a drill string is typically used to drill a wellbore of a first depth into the formation.","While drilling, a drilling fluid (ormud fluid) is circulated down through the tubular string, then through perforation(s) in a drill bit which is located at the end of the drill string. Then, the drilling fluid continues the circulation up through the annular flow passage between the outer perimeter of the tubular string and inner wall of the well.","The mud jets from the bit nozzles are normally directed toward the hole bottom and formation being drilled, with the velocities of several hundred feet per second to create turbulence which serves to clean the bit, as well as carry away the cut chips. The drill bit nozzles are removable flow-restrictors which determine the total area of the drill bit outlet, and therefore the terminal velocity of the mud jet.","The majority of drilling systems in current use include a heavy tubular string with a substantially large outer diameter, and a Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) linked to that tubular string and located below it. The BHA may include the drill bit, as well as other equipment such as motors, logging while drilling equipment, directional drilling control systems, or any combination thereof. Above the BHA, there normally extend smaller drill pipes connecting the BHA to the surface.","When drilling in earth formations having rapid variations in mechanical properties between layers, the drill bit nozzle hydraulic horse power per square inch (HSI) can be too high for the formation, resulting in the formation being overdrilled, or can be too low for the formation, which results in less efficient removal of cuttings.","Conventionally, the drill bit nozzle lowered in the wellbore has a fixed flow geometry and total flow area (TFA). It is not possible to change to another nozzle geometry except through pulling the tubular string out of the wellbore.","Flow restrictors used within a tubular string during drilling, for example for the mud motor, may have a fixed geometry connecting between the inner flow passage and the annular flow passage. It is desirable to be able to change the flow restrictor flow geometry without the need to pull the tubular string out of the hole.","Flow restrictors exist in other components of the tubular string used for drilling or conduits used for flow of fluid in certain industries (like the oil and gas industry, or other industries at large) that communicate fluid from one point to another. Changing the geometry of flow restrictors remotely is desirable.","The majority of drilling systems used today use drill bit nozzles with fixed total flow area (TFA). One way to change the drill bit nozzle HSI is to change the mud flow rate through the whole drilling string, i.e. reduce mud circulation flow rate or increase the flow rate from the optimum flow rate.","Another way to change nozzle Total Flow Area (TFA) of the drill bit or other flow restrictor disposed within the conduit is to pull out the tubular string from the wellbore and replace the nozzle with another of the desired TFA.","A previously-described adjustable geometry nozzle requires the operator to pull the string out of the wellbore.","Changing mud flow rate from the optimum to adjust the HSI requires reducing mud circulation flow rate or increasing the flow rate from the optimum flow rate. This results in undesired annular flow velocity which causes deterioration in the hole cleaning efficiency through increase of suspended solids or cuttings within the wellbore or causing a washout when formation or other undesirable acts.","Pulling out the tubular string from the wellbore to replace the nozzle with another of the desired TFA cost the operator significant time and money and increase drilling risks.","One aspect of the current invention is to introduce methods and apparatus to remotely change the geometry of a drill bit nozzle which allows to adjust the HSI of the nozzle while maintaining optimum flow rate. Another aspect of the present invention is to introduce an apparatus and method for remotely and selectively changing flow profile within the tubular string or between the tubular string inner flow passage and annular flowpassage.","Maintenance of annular velocity and the introduction of adjustable TFA drill bit nozzles using the current invention will reduce the operating cost and risks associated with suspended solids or cuttings as well as risks associated with possible formation collapse.","Drill bit nozzles are made of fixed size, therefore drill bit manufacturers provide different drill bit designs with alternative number of nozzles and sizes. A typical nozzle (shown in ) is inserted into an aperture, and is held in place by any one of several means, such as a snap ring, screw threads, or a nail lock. The inner diameter of the nozzle outlet is approximately equal to the opening above which. The final outlet internal diameter of the nozzle is measured in increments of 1\/32 of an inch. To adjust the flow, the nozzle has to be replaced with another nozzle which has a different outlet inner diameter.","Replacing a drill bit nozzle requires pulling the drill string out of the hole (POH) which retards drilling operation and multiplies drilling cost. The size of nozzle needed cannot be determined in advance due to the many factors affecting nozzle sizing. Therefore, drill bits are commonly shipped off-shore with several nozzles with different sizes for each aperture. At the drilling site, the correct-size nozzle is installed whereas unused nozzles are normally discarded or lost which increases the cost and time of drilling.","In a more recently disclosed invention, a drill bit nozzle with adjustable orifice is proposed (shown in ). This design allows the same nozzle to deliver the mud at variable pressures. This is accomplished by the use of two thick plates, each having a shaped aperture therein. The degree to which the two apertures are overlapped determines the size of the orifice. The movement of at least one of the plates, and thus the size of the orifice, can be adjusted at the drill site, to give a desired pressure drop across the nozzle.","In one example, disclosed is a nozzle adapted for use in a rotary drill bit for drilling a n earth borehole based on changing the environment in the borehole, the nozzle including: a body configured to be secured within the rotary drill bit, at least one fluid passage of variable geometry through the body for connecting a fluid through the body, an orifice disposed within the body, in fluid communication with the at least one fluid passage and the borehole, a means for changing the geometry of the at least one fluid passage having at least one movable element, in fluid communication with the fluid passage and the orifice, the at least one movable element is movable from an initial position to at least one other predetermined position in response to intended changes in the borehole environment.","In one example, the at least one moveable element is movable from an initial position to another predetermined position under normal fluid circulation (from the drill bit to the borehole), and the at least one moveable element is movable from an initial position to a different predetermined position under reverse fluid circulation (from the borehole to the drill bit).","In one example, the at least one moveable element is rotatable to a plurality of predetermined positions.","In one example, disclosed is an apparatus for remotely changing flow profile in conduit and rotary drill bit based on changing the environment in the borehole, the apparatus including: (a) a nozzle adapted for use in a rotary drill bit for drilling an earth borehole, the nozzle including: a body configured to be secured within the rotary drill bit, at least one fluid passage of variable geometry through the body for connecting a fluid through the body, an orifice disposed within the body, in fluid communication with the at least one fluid passage and the borehole, a means for changing the geometry of the at least one fluid passage having at least one movable element, in fluid communication with the fluid passage and the orifice, wherein the at least one movable element is movable from an initial position to at least one other predetermined position in response to intended changes in the borehole environment;

and (c) causing the actuating means to use the energy provided by the powering means to change the geometry of the at least one fluid passage within the nozzle.","In one example, the change in a physical property of the environment is a mechanical movement of the apparatus by means of moving the tubular string, causing the apparatus to move within the wellbore in at least one direction detectable by the detecting means.","In one example, the change of physical property includes a change in one or more of the following fluid properties: pressure, temperature, flow rate, density, viscosity, color, and composition, detectable by the detecting means.","In one example, the change in a physical property includes a change in one or more of the following physical properties: electromagnetic, electrostatic, and seismic, detectable by the detecting means.","In one example, changing the geometry of the at least one fluid passage includes reducing the area of the nozzle orifice to increase the velocity of the nozzle jet.","In one example, changing the geometry of the at least one fluid passage includes increasing the area of the nozzle orifice to decrease the velocity of the nozzle jet.","In one example, the change of physical property includes a change in the direction of flow circulation.","In one example, changing the geometry of the at least one fluid passage includes moving the at least one movable element from a first position to a second position when the flow is circulated in one direction and moving the at least one movable element from the second position to the first position when the flow is circulated in the opposite direction.","In one example, the apparatus may further include a cam and a latch to hold the at least one movable element in a position resulting in the desired change of the geometry of the at least one fluid passage and allowing the flow circulation to be changed.","In one example, the actuating means includes an actuator selected from at least one of a rack-type actuator, an electric motor, a solenoid, and a cam-type actuator.","In one example, the rack-type actuator includes at least one rack, and actuating the means for changing the geometry of the at least one fluid passage includes moving the rack between a first position and a second position.","In one example, the powering means includes a power source selected from at least one of a hydraulic power, an energized resilient element, a battery, a super capacitor, and an energy harvester.","In one example, the energy harvester is selected from at least one of an electromagnetic induction harvester, a piezoelectric harvester, and a thermoelectric harvester.","In one example, the hydraulic power includes creating a net pressure force on the surfaces of the movable element exposed to the fluid passing through the nozzle.","For purposes of clarity and brevity, like elements and components will bear the same designations and numbering throughout the Figures.","U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/710,887, filed Oct. 8, 2012 for METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL THE MUD FLOW IN DRILL STRINGS AND WELLBORE ANNULUS 156, by Ahmed TAHOUN, Raed Kafafy, Karam Jawamir, Mohamed Aldheeb, Abdul Mushawwir Mohamad Khalil is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/622,572, filed Apr. 11, 2012 for METHOD AND APPARATUS OF CONTROL DRILLING FLUID LOSSES AND IMPROVED HOLE CLEANING IN OIL & GAS SUBTERRANEAN DRILLING OPERATIONS, by Ahmed Moustafa Tahoun is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/710,823, filed Oct. 8, 2012 for METHOD AND APPARATUS TO HARVEST ENERGY INSIDE WELLBORE 100 FROM CHANGE OF FLUID FLOW RATE, by Ahmed M.
