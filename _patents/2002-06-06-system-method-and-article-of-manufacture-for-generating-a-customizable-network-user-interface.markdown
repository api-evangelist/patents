No. 09\/363,066. Each of the foregoing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes","The present invention relates to user interfaces and more particularly to generating and managing network-based user interfaces.","Information on the Internet exists in the form of hyperlinks that appear in different HTML pages. A news site for example may contain headlines that are hyperlinks to their detailed exposition. Similarly, a company's intranet may contain multiple pages with several hyperlinks on each.","Custom Internet portals to display web-centric information exist (e.g., myYahoo, myLycos etc.). These portals aggregate information from different HTML sources into one interface where it can be accessed through one interface. However, the possible number of sources from which information is aggregated is fairly minimal. In typical portals, the user chooses from pre-selected information collected from a pre-determined set of information sources. The user has no control over either the sources he\/she gets the content from or the information that is harvested from those web-sites. Further, the user has very little control over how the information is presented.","For example, if the user is interested in Indian politics, Soccer, and Semiconductor High Tech companies, myYahoo allows the user to configure Yahoo's news source to filter through news on these topics. However, the user must take all this content strictly from Yahoo-selected content providers. This arrangement prohibits users from choosing not just the type of content but the source of the content as well. While, for example, a user may want to be able to receive world politics news from his two favorite Indian news dailies every morning, get his Hi-Tech news coverage from Red Herring and CNET, and get sports news from Cricket.org and dailysoccer.com, access to all these sites through a prior art internet portal would be predicated on the Internet portal offering access to all of the particular site via that particular portal. This limitation forces the users to have access to only \u201cpopular\u201d sources of information and effectively bars them from getting anything else.","What is needed is a method that allows the user to completely configure both the source and content that he\/she wants on his\/her own portal. The present invention overcomes the above-described disadvantages by providing a method, system, and article of manufacture that allows a user to aggregate any content or data from any source into a single customizable network user interface of his\/her choice.","A method for generating a user-sharable network user interface is provided. A management interface is displayed. The management interface allows a user to select and manage information displayed on an information screen of a habitat. The management interface includes information of one or more content sources. The user is allowed to select portions of the information available in the content sources. The selected information of the content source is marked and stored. The marked information is retrieved and displayed on the information screen. The information screen includes at least one view. Each view contains at least one window for displaying the marked information. A permission status of a second user is checked to determine whether the second user is authorized to see a window. The second user is allowed to see the window of the information screen of the first user if the second user is authorized.","The first user may set permissions for allowing other users to view view(s) and\/or window(s). As an option, the second user can add and\/or remove content from the window. Preferably, a notice saying the window is shared is sent to the second user.","A method for customizing a network user interface is also provided. A management interface is displayed on a wireless device for allowing a user to select and manage information displayed on an information screen. The management interface includes information of one or more content sources and customization tools. The user is allowed to select portions of the information available in the content source(s). The selected information of the content source(s) is marked and stored for subsequent output on the information screen. The user is allowed to interact with the customization tools via the wireless device for customizing the management interface.","The customization that can be performed using the tools on the management interface can include adding and\/or deleting a window to the information screen, the window being for displaying at least a portion of the marked content; adding and\/or deleting a view, the view including a plurality of windows; adding a row of windows to a view; and changing user profile information. Illustrative wireless devices are a wireless telephone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a handheld computer such as a handheld PC or a Blackberry-type device, and a pager.","A system, method and computer program product for generating a customizable network user interface are provided according to one embodiment. A management interface, that allows a user to select and manage information displayed on an information screen, is presented. Specification of a transaction pattern is received. The pattern performs an interaction with a remote data source, which can be a remote application, web page, a legacy application, etc., for retrieving data upon replay of the pattern. The pattern is replayed for retrieving the data. The information selected by the user on the management interface and the data retrieved upon replay of the pattern are displayed on the information screen.","According to one embodiment, the execution of the transaction pattern includes submission of required parameters during the transaction. The execution of the transaction pattern can involve automatic navigation during the transaction.","Another method for generating a customizable network user interface is provided according to an embodiment. A management interface is displayed for allowing a user to select and manage information displayed on an information screen. A specification of an application to invoke is received. The application is interfaced with for invoking the application. Data is received from the invoked application. User-selected information and the data received from the application are displayed on the information screen.","A method for managing an enterprise network data interface system is provided according to one embodiment. Identification information is assigned to data of an enterprise (i.e., business or organization). Enterprise data can include documents, email, spreadsheets, data in a database, web content, output of other applications, or any other type of data. Users are allowed to access the data via a habitat based on access privileges. The users are assigned to groups, which are tiered. Selected identification information of the enterprise data can be associated with each group. Users in a particular group are allowed to access data associated with their particular access tier. Users in a particular group are also allowed to access data associated with a group in a lower tier. Administrative privileges to the data interface system are controlled. The administrative privileges are also tiered. A user on a particular administrative tier has administrative rights over all users in lower administrative tiers.","The administrative privileges can include adding user accounts, deleting user accounts, editing user accounts, searching user accounts, setting data access privileges, assigning users to the access and\/or administrative tiers, associating data with the access tiers, etc. As an option, deleted user accounts can be archived. This allows them to be reactivated at a later time. Users can be assigned to groups based on an organization structure (such as an employee hierarchy) of the enterprise. Preferably, a user with administrative privileges assigns users to groups.","A method for generating a network user interface with sharable data is provided. A management interface, that allows a user to select and manage information displayed on an information screen of a habitat, is displayed. The management interface includes information of at least one content source. The user is allowed to select portions of the information available in the content source(s). The selected information of the content source is marked. The marked information is stored in the habitat for subsequent output on the information screen. An external application is allowed to access the marked information in storage and\/or when displayed for extracting data therefrom. The external application can also be allowed to add data to the habitat.","A method for providing a customizable network user interface is provided. A management interface is displayed. The management interface allows a user to select and manage information displayed on an information screen of a habitat, where the management interface includes information of at least one content source. The user is allowed to select portions of the information available in the at least one content source. The selected information is marked and stored. The marked information is retrieved from storage and translated to a different human language than it was in as stored. For example the translation could be from English to Japanese, etc. The translated information is displayed on the information screen.","The marked information can be textual, in which case, the information is displayed in the character set of the language translated to. The marked information can also include audio data. The audio data can also be translated to a different language and output.","A preferred embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention is preferably practiced in the context of a personal computer such as an IBM compatible personal computer, Apple Macintosh computer or UNIX based workstation. A representative hardware environment is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation in accordance with a preferred embodiment having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned.","A preferred embodiment is written using JAVA, C, and the C++ language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with it (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, one's logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language\u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystem's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as: \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, small, fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.","The present invention allows a user to create an information portal whose information sources and content is completely customizable. Information on the internet exists in the form of hyperlinks that appear in different HTML pages. A news site for example may contain headlines that are hyperlinks to their detailed exposition. Similarly, a company's intranet may contain multiple pages with several hyperlinks on each. In typical portals, the user chooses from a pre-determined set of information collected from a pre-determined set of information sources. The user has no control over either the sources he\/she gets the content from or the information that is harvested from those web-sites.

To allow current and updated information to be presented to the user via the information screen, a check is performed in operation  to determine whether any of the marked information has changed on the content source. Preferably, the check is performed periodically or upon occurrence of some event. The marked information is retrieved in operation . In operation , the marked information may then be retrieved manually or automatically from the content source and displayed on the information screen.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the information screen may include a plurality of different views pages or \u201cviews\u201d. Each view may contain at least one section or a \u201cwindow\u201d for displaying the marked information. Further, the user may be allowed to select, maximize, minimize, refresh and edit the content of the window.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the user may be allowed to share the views with other users such as via electronic mail or by permitting access to the views. As an option, the marked information may be presented on the information screen over a configurable number of days in the past. Further, the user may be allowed to \u201cdrag and drop\u201d information of his\/her choice from the customizing interface to the information screen. As mentioned above, desired information can also be added to the information screen through various means, such as for example highlighting, selecting from a menu, menu-based tagging (R+click), and\/or an action through an input device, such as a mouse, touchpad, etc. The information may also be marked upon dropping the information in the information screen.","In still yet another embodiment, the step or act of marking the selected information may include determining an invariant descriptor of the selected information and\/or of the tables, rows, columns, and\/or cells comprising the selected information. The invariant descriptor may consist of a description of the location of the selected information within its source and of various distinguishing attributes of the sub-section(s) of the source that contain the selected information. Further, the step or act of checking for change of the marked information may include the steps or acts of determining whether the content of the marked information has changed and determining whether the format of the marked information has changed.

The tables that are not contained in any other table (highest-level tables) are assigned identifying numbers starting from 1. Tables contained within the highest-level tables are assigned numbers that take into account the tables that contain them. If a table is not contained in any other table, then it may be assigned a number, say 3. If table number 3 contains two tables, then they will be assigned numbers 3-1 and 3-2 respectively. Each table is composed of a unique number of rows and columns. Each item of content resides within a cell that belongs to a specific row and column of a table. The complete address of an item of content is then the unique identifier of the table that contains it and the position of that item of content within that table.","In addition to the address, specific information about different items of content, the attributes of the items or of their locations within the source page may also be used. For example, HTML tables have properties in terms of their headers, numbers of columns, the fonts used in various parts, border widths etc. The attributes for tables are captured in exactly the same manner as the address indicated previously. Together, address and attribute information can be used to select and mark user requested information. For example, an invariant descriptor is generated by a combination of the address and the attributes. The invariant descriptor is then stored.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","606","608"]},"This mechanism also allows a capture of configurable sections of a web-page, including individual words, lines, paragraphs.","In the case of secure information like email or bank accounts, the mechanism followed is shown in , which is a flow diagram of a process  for tagging secure information contained in a web-page. First, in operation , forms are created to allow a user to log into their accounts. These forms consist of (a) Dynamic information (like the user name and password) which is captured during the session (b) Static information that is required by the remote account server which is stored in a database and retrieved when an account is selected. Using the dynamic and static information, the server logs into the remote server in operation . The account information is retrieved in operation  and, in operation , the account information is presented in a suitable and configurable format.","The mechanism for local storage or caching of selected content.","The selected information is cached or stored locally to enable a faster access. Once a web site is selected by a user, a copy of the site, including text and images, is kept locally in the servers. When any user requests a page that has been requested before, the cached copy is presented if the content of the site has not changed since the time the page was cached. The process is broken down into two: Simple and Customized addition of content:","Addition of default content: The addition of default content proceeds as follows:\n\n","Addition of customized content: In the case of addition of customized content, the process is as follows:\n\n","The mechanism for communication of selected information to the backend servers.","Once a hyperlink is dropped into a window, information is passed by the window to the backend servers. This information includes the address of the hyperlink, as defined above. In addition, the information about the window and the view containing that window is also sent to the server. This information is then used by scripts to generate the front page in HTML.","The mechanism for regular retrieval of preferred content from selected sites.","The power of the current invention is that refreshed content is retrieved from the selected sources of information as they are updated. The sources of information, or web sites, selected by users are cached locally. The web pages stored locally are categorized according to the number of times they are requested. High request sites are retrieved once every few hours, for example.","The mechanism to check for a change of content or format in the selected sources of information.","Once a page has been requested by a user, it is retrieved on a regular basis. There are two checks performed to find out a change in the information in the page. The first involves a change in the content of the page and the second a change in the format in which the content is presented.","Change in a page's content:","Every time a page is retrieved, a copy is kept locally on servers. Once a page is automatically retrieved, the content from the newly retrieved version of the page is compared to the content from a previous version of the page. If there is a change in the content, then the updated content is retrieved.","A change in the format of the content:","The formatting of the content in a page is stored in terms of a complete addressing scheme for the page, which specifies the breakdown of the page into its sub-sections. Once there is a change in the formatting of the page, then the relations of different sub-sections of the page to their parent sections change. A mechanism is implemented that keeps track of the number of differences between the format of a previously stored version of the page and the newly retrieved version. An alert is sent to the users if the number of differences is greater than a configurable number.","Sharing",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0149"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","806","808","810","812"]},"Information on the web exists in the form of hyperlinks that appear in different web sites.

The first habitat is allowed to access other habitats in operation  for retrieving information from the other habitats.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, other habitats retrieve information from the first habitat and\/or other habitats. In an example of use, a first user has similar interests in investing as a second user, but the first user is not as adept at finding investment news. The habitat of the first user can automatically retrieve investment news from the habitat of the second user.","In a preferred embodiment, the first habitat selects portions of the retrieved information for display based on user-input. Continuing with the investment example, perhaps the user only wishes to review information about stocks listed on the NASDAQ Combined Composite Index and not those traded on the Dow Jones Industrials Exchange. The first habitat would then perform an analysis on the information in the second habitat either prior to or after retrieval to select only the information pertinent to the NASDAQ for display. Such analysis can include a key word search, such as a search for \u201cNASDAQ\u201d or the symbol of a particular stock known to be listed on the NASDAQ. Note that each of the habitats can have an assigned address such as a web address.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a point-to-point connection between habitats can be created.

In this model, the first habitat sends out a request for desired information to a plurality of habitats and retrieves the desired information from one or more of the habitats that respond to the request preferably via a point-to-point connection.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, the first habitat is in communication with a plurality of habitats such that a sub-network of habitats is formed. This enables such things as real-time updates of the various habitats when content changes in one of the habitats. Also, a user viewing the information of the first habitat can \u201cjump\u201d to one of the other habitats to view the information available there.","According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, application-habitat communication is enabled.

As an option, the second user can add or remove content from the window. Preferably, a notice saying the window is shared is sent to the second user.","For example, if a user wants to share all six windows with another person, the user sets his or her habitat to share the view. An announcement is sent to the other person saying that the user wants to share a view or window with the other person. The other person can preview the view. If he likes it, he can accept the invitation and view the window or view. If not, he can decline.","A user can also only allow access to certain windows.

Finally, the fine-grain control afforded to the user to control who sees what is highly distinguishable from known systems, as such systems make users share everything.","A customizable information retrieval engine has thus been described that allows users to aggregate content of their choice from any web-site in existence and share that content with others. The content may include, but is not restricted to: text (i.e. news headlines, hyperlinks in web-pages), secure account information (i.e. email, bank accounts, utilities, and stock portfolios), services (i.e. maps, directions, weather, web searches), financial transactions (i.e. online shopping, buying, selling, trading, auctions, barters, comparisons) and other dynamic tasks that involve interaction of the users with other web-based (client and server side) services.
