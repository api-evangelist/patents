The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to use of the Global Positioning System (GPS); and, in particular, to techniques for circumventing jamming of GPS receivers.","2. Description of the Related Art","The Global Positioning System (GPS) is widely known and used to provide precision positioning information anywhere on Earth. GPS includes a constellation of earth orbiting satellites that transmit coded signals, and a portable unit called a GPS receiver to receive those coded signals. The GPS receiver includes a radio frequency receiver, a processor, a clock, and data used to determine a position of the portable unit based on signals received from four or more of the GPS satellites. The GPS receiver measures raw ranges to the four or more satellites and solves for a position and clock offset that fits the measured ranges. Because the signals emitted by the satellites are digital, the system works even at low power. The low power is an advantage for conserving power on the satellites that must transmit over tens of thousands of miles from an orbit about 12,000 miles above the surface of the Earth. Positions can be determined within a few tens of meters both horizontally and vertically.","The high precision position information provided by GPS is valuable in a number of commercial and military scenarios. Opponents hostile to an enterprise's commercial or military goals might decide to deny the benefits of GPS positions to the enterprise by interfering with the GPS transmissions. Such an opponent may attempt to jam the GPS receivers with spurious signals. The spurious signals might have large enough amplitude to bury the low power GPS signals and thus prevent the determination of range to one or more of the GPS satellites. The spurious signals might spoof the GPS receiver by including data that appears to be from GPS satellites but that gives one or more raw ranges that prevent a proper solution for position and clock offset. Without positioning information, the enterprise may be unable to achieve one or more goals.","Based on the foregoing description, there is a clear need for a system that would circumvent jamming of global positioning system receiver so that an enterprise's goals can still be achieved in the presence of such jamming.","Techniques are provided for circumventing jamming of receivers for a global positioning system (GPS). In one aspect of the invention, techniques include determining that a receiver is being jammed by a jamming signal not originating from the GPS. A first signal is transmitted from a portable unit including the receiver to a component of a second positioning system that is different from the GPS. A position for the portable unit is determined in the second positioning system, based at least in part on the first signal. A second signal is transmitted from the second positioning system to the portable unit. The second signal includes data that indicates the position for the portable unit.","In another aspect of the invention, techniques include determining that a receiver is being jammed by a jamming signal not originating from the GPS. A first signal is transmitted from a portable unit including the receiver to a component of a second positioning system that is different from the GPS. A second signal is received from the second positioning system. The second signal includes data that indicates a position for the portable unit determined in the second positioning system, based at least in part on the first signal.","In another aspect of the invention, techniques include receiving a first signal at a component of a second positioning system that is different from the GPS. The first signal is received from a portable unit including a receiver for the GPS. The portable unit has determined that the receiver is being jammed by a jamming signal not originating from the GPS. A position for the portable unit is determined in the second positioning system based at least in part on the first signal. A second signal is transmitted to the portable unit. The second signal includes data that indicates the position for the portable unit.","In another aspect of the invention, a system includes a first positioning system that provides a receiver with a first position having a first precision. The system includes a second positioning system different from the first positioning system that determines a second position having a second precision for a transmitter. The system also includes a portable unit including a receiver for the first positioning system and a transmitter for the second positioning system. The portable unit is configured for determining that the receiver is being jammed by a jamming signal not originating from the first positioning system. A first signal is transmitted from the portable unit to the second positioning system. A second signal is received at the portable unit from the second positioning system. The second signal includes data that indicates the second position for the portable unit determined in the second positioning system based at least in part on the first signal.","In another aspect of the invention, an apparatus includes a receiver for obtaining a first position of the apparatus having a first precision from a first positioning system. The apparatus includes a transmitter for obtaining a second position of the apparatus having a second precision from a second positioning system different from the first positioning system. The apparatus also includes a processor configured for determining that the receiver is being jammed by a jamming signal not originating from the first positioning system. The processor causes a first signal to be transmitted to the second positioning system. The processor receives a second signal from the second positioning system. The second signal includes data that indicates the second position determined in the second positioning system based at least in part on the first signal.","These techniques allow a position obtained from the second positioning system to be used by an operational unit associated with the portable unit to achieve its goals during the absence of a usable GPS position because of jamming. In most embodiments, the precision of the position obtained from the second provisioning system is sufficient to support the goals of the operational unit.","A method and apparatus for circumventing jamming of GPS receivers is described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","1. Operational Context","Embodiments of the invention are described in the context of the Global Positioning System, but the invention is not limited to this context. The invention may be used in any high precision positioning system that uses passive receivers on portable units, which are subject to jamming by spurious signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","150","100","110","120"]},"The operational unit  is any unit of organization in an enterprise, including a person, a group of people, equipment or machinery, one or more vehicles, and one or more aircraft, among others. An operational unit is capable of holding, carrying, attaching to, or containing the GPS portable unit . The operational units are disposed on or a few miles above the Earth, which is represented in  by the horizon .","When viewed relative to the operational unit , several satellites , , , are above the Earth's horizon . The satellites  broadcast GPS signals, represented in  by the broken-line arrows, which include data indicating time of transmission, identity of the transmitting satellite, and information about the satellite orbit so that the satellite's position is precisely known.","The GPS portable unit  includes a radio frequency receiver  tuned to the radio frequencies of the GPS transmissions and a GPS processor . The radio receiver  includes an antenna  that picks up the GPS transmissions. The GPS processor  includes a computer processor, a computer readable medium storing data, and a clock. The GPS processor  compares the signals received with a time from its internal clock and data stored in the computer-readable medium to determine raw ranges to the visible satellites, e.g., raw ranges to satellites , , , . The GPS processor  converts the raw ranges to a clock offset and a position of the portable unit. Two levels of precision can be achieved for position and clock offset, depending on the type of the GPS processor  and which signals from the GPS satellites  are processed.","2. Structural and Functional Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","10","150","122","123","220","120","220","224","124","220","226","227"]},"Also shown in  are assets  of a second positioning system that relies on active transmissions from a transmitter in a portable unit. Any system known in the art at the time the portable units are deployed may be used. Several such systems are known in the art at the time of this writing. For example, in some embodiments, the second positioning system can be the threat warning and attack reporting system (TW\/ARS) currently under development by the United States Air Force. In such embodiments, the assets  include satellite receivers in lower Earth orbit than the GPS satellites .","In some embodiments, the second positioning system relies on one or more assets  with directional receivers that can determine a direction (\u201cbearing\u201d) to a transmitter. When viewed relative to the operational unit , one or more assets , , , are above the Earth's horizon . The assets  may be satellites, or non-satellite assets, or some combination. For example, in some embodiments the assets may be aircraft, such as helicopters and airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft. When a signal transmitted by a transmitter is received at an asset , the asset can determine a bearing to the transmitter. For example, when a signal transmitted by transmitter  is received at asset , asset can determine a bearing to transmitter . A position for the transmitter can be determined based on the measured bearing, the position of the asset, and some additional information.","The additional information may be the altitude of the transmitter. The altitude of the transmitter can be included in the signal sent to the asset, or an altitude can be assumed. For example, an altitude of zero above ground is assumed for ground units. The additional information may be the bearing to the transmitter from an asset  in another location. The position is inferred to be the closest location where the two lines through the two asset positions with the two bearings come closest to each other. The more bearings that can be obtained, the better the precision of the position can be determined. In some embodiments, the bearing from an asset in another location can be obtained by a different asset, such as asset . In such embodiments, there is some communication among the assets ; for example, asset transmits its information to asset . For security, the communication may be encrypted. If the assets  are moving, the bearing from an asset in another location can be obtained by the same asset, e.g. , at a later time. For such embodiments, the operational unit  is assumed to be stationary; or, if the operational unit  is moving, its speed and direction are included in the signals transmitted to the assets.","Also shown in  is a hostile jamming unit  of a competing enterprise. The jamming unit  sends spurious signals, represented by the thick broken-line arrow, that are picked up at the radio receiver . The spurious signals prevent a GPS processor, such as GPS processor  in , from determining the position of the portable unit; and, thus, the spurious signals interfere with the goals of the associated operational unit .","According to an illustrated embodiment of the invention, when the modified GPS processor  determines that the receiver  is being jammed with spurious signals that did not originate with the GPS satellites , the modified GPS processor  generates one or more signals that are transmitted over radio frequency transmitter  to one or more assets  of the second positioning system. The assets  of the second positioning system determine a position for the modified GPS portable unit  based at least in part on the transmitted signals. One or more assets  of the second positioning system then transmit one or more response signals that includes data indicating the position of the modified portable unit . Thus the modified GPS portable unit  uses the second positioning system to allow the associated operational unit  to achieve its goals.","In some embodiments, the precision of position obtained from the second positioning system is not as good as the precision from the GPS. However, in most embodiments, the precision is sufficient to support the goals of the operational unit . In almost all embodiments, the precision of positions from the second positioning system is sufficient to be better than an absence of any positional information from the second positioning system. In some embodiments, the response sent to the modified GPS portable unit includes data about the precision of the position computed by the second positioning system.","In some embodiments, the signal transmitted to the second positioning system includes data that authenticates the portable unit as an authorized user of the second positioning system. In such embodiments, the second positioning system performs authentication and authorization of the portable unit before transmitting the response signals with the position of the portable unit.","If deemed desirable, one or more of the assets  can request additional transmissions from the portable unit ; for example to increase the number of bearings used to solve for the position or change in position of the portable unit .","In the illustrated embodiment, the antenna  of the transmitter  of the modified GPS portable unit  is configured to form a narrow beam  through which the signals are transmitted to assets  of the second positioning system. An advantage of this embodiment is that operational units associated with the jamming unit  do not intercept the signals. In other embodiments, the antenna  is configured to broadcast the signals transmitted to the assets of the second positioning system, rather than to form a narrow beam. Information about the operational unit  is encrypted to keep such information secure against interception by hostile operational units.","In some embodiments, the response signals are transmitted at radio frequencies that use the same radio frequency receiver  and antenna  as used in the GPS system, but do so at high enough power to overcome the effects of jamming. In some embodiments, the response signals are transmitted at radio frequencies that use a different receiver or different antenna, or both, from the radio frequency receiver  and antenna  of the conventional GPS portable unit .","In some embodiments, the assets  that transmit response signals to the modified GPS portable unit  do so in narrow beams directed along the bearings to the operational unit , so that units associated with the jamming unit  do not intercept the response signals. An advantage of the narrow beam is that it concentrates power from the assets  on the modified GPS portable unit , increasing the amplitude received at radio frequency receiver . In some embodiments, the response signals are broadcast, rather than sent through a narrow beam. In some embodiments, information about the operational unit  is encrypted to keep such information secure against interception by hostile operational units.","3. Method of Circumventing Jamming",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"300"},"In step , a portable unit receives signals at GPS frequencies. For example, modified GPS portable unit  receives signals at radio frequency receiver  from GPS satellites , , , above the horizon  and from jamming unit .","In step , it is determined whether the signals indicate jamming. Any method known at the time the modified GPS portable unit is built may be used to detect jamming. Several methods are currently known. For example, if the signals contain random data, no satellite identification information can be detected; and the signals can be deemed to be spurious jamming signals. As another example, if no solution for position and clock offset can be obtained, or if the solution includes an absurd position or clock offset, then the signals can be deemed to include spurious jamming signals. In the illustrated embodiment, this determination is made in the modified GPS processor .","If it is determined in step  that the received signals do not indicate jamming, then control passes to step  to process signals for GPS position of the portable unit. For example, a GPS position is obtained for the modified GPS portable unit . In the illustrated embodiment this determination is made in a GPS processor, such as processor , included in the modified GPS processor . Control then passes back to step  to continue receiving signals at GPS frequencies.","If it is determined in step  that the received signals do indicate jamming, then control passes to step . In step , a signal is generated and transmitted that includes data used to authenticate and authorize the portable unit as an authorized user of the positioning system. The signal may also include data that indicates other information about the portable unit or associated operational unit. For example, the signal may include data that indicates the altitude of the portable unit  or the speed and direction of the portable unit . In some embodiments, the signal may include data about the operational unit, such as its identification, its health (e.g., listing damaged subsystems), and its status relative to achieving its goal (looking for target, target found). Step  also performs any encryption of data to be included in the signal. In the illustrated embodiment, the modified GPS processor  generates and encrypts the data for the signal and causes the radio frequency transmitter  to transmit the signal to one or more assets  of the second positioning system. In some embodiments, the modified GPS processor  determines the direction of the jamming signal and controls the antenna  of the radio frequency transmitter  to direct a narrow beam away from the jamming unit, and toward one or more assets (e.g., assets , ) of the assets  of the second positioning system.","The second positioning system determines the position of the portable unit based at least in part on the signal transmitted from the portable unit. For example, in some embodiments, the assets  decrypt the data, perform authentication and authorization, determine raw ranges from the portable unit, and solves for a position and clock offset. In some embodiments, the assets  decrypt the data, perform authentication and authorization, determine bearing to the portable unit, and determine additional information from the portable unit. In the illustrated embodiment, for purposes of illustration, it is assumed that asset decrypts the data, performs authentication and authorization, determines a bearing to the transmitter  and uses an altitude of zero above ground for determining a position for the transmitter .","In step , a response signal is received from the second positioning system. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, a response signal is received by receiver  of the modified GPS portable unit , in a high-power narrow beam from asset of the second positioning system, which does not impinge on the jamming unit . For purposes of illustration, it is assumed that the response signal from asset includes encrypted data that indicates a request for an additional transmission that includes health and status of the associated operational unit  and altitude of the modified GPS portable unit .","In step , it is determined whether the response signal includes a request for an additional transmission. Some data may be decrypted to perform step . If the response signal includes a request for an additional transmission, control passes to step  to generate and transmit an additional signal. If not, control passes to step  to extract the position of the modified GPS portable unit  from the response. After step , control passes back to step  to monitor signals at GPS frequencies. In embodiments that do not request additional transmissions, steps , ,  may be omitted and control passes from step  to step .","In the illustrated embodiment, control passes to step  and the modified GPS processor  generates another signal that includes the altitude of the modified GPS portable unit , and the health and status of operational unit . The modified GPS processor then encrypts the data and causes the transmitter  to transmit the signal and causes the antenna  to transmit the signal over a narrow beam  directed away from the jamming unit . Control then passes to step .","In step  it is determined whether the received response signal includes position for the modified GPS portable unit. If not, control passes back to step  to receive the next response signal from the second positioning system. If so, control passes to step  to extract the position of the modified GPS portable unit  from the response.","In the illustrated embodiment, the response does not include a position for the modified GPS portable unit , so control passes to step  to receive the next response signal from the second positioning system.","Meanwhile, in the illustrated embodiment, based on the bearing of the additional signal transmitted in step  and the data that indicates altitude in that signal, asset of the second positioning system has decrypted the data, performed authentication and authorization, and computed a revised position for the modified GPS portable unit . The second positioning system has also used any information obtained about the health and status of the operational unit . The revised position is sent in a second response signal transmitted by asset . It is assumed for purposes of illustration, that the precision of the revised position is also computed and included in the second response signal transmitted by asset . In step , the second response signal is received from asset by the receiver  of the modified GPS portable unit .","In step , it is determined that the received signal does not include a request for an additional transmission; and control passes to step . In step , data is decrypted, if neeeded, and the revised position is extracted from the second response signal by the modified GPS processor . It is assumed for purposes of illustration, that the precision of the revised position is also extracted from the second response signal by the modified GPS processor . Control then passes back to step  to monitor signals at GPS frequencies.","In following steps, not shown, the position of the modified GPS portable unit  is used by the operational unit  to achieve its goals. In most embodiments, the precision of the position obtained from the second provisioning system is sufficient to support the goals of the operational unit  during the absence of a usable GPS position. Use of the illustrated embodiments also allows inventorying or role calling of friendly assets, or both.","4.

The memory , such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, stores information including computer instructions. Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system . RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory  is also used by the processor  to store temporary values during execution of computer instructions. The computer system  also includes a read only memory (ROM)  or other static storage device coupled to the bus  for storing static information, including instructions, that is not changed by the computer system . Also coupled to bus  is a non-volatile (persistent) storage device , such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, for storing information, including instructions, that persists even when the computer system  is turned off or otherwise loses power.","Information, including instructions, is provided to the bus  for use by the processor from an external input device , such as a keyboard containing alphanumeric keys operated by a human user, or a sensor. A sensor detects conditions in its vicinity and transforms those detections into signals compatible with the signals used to represent information in computer system . Other external devices coupled to bus , used primarily for interacting with humans, include a display device , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a liquid crystal display (LCD), for presenting images, and a pointing device , such as a mouse or a trackball or cursor direction keys, for controlling a position of a small cursor image presented on the display  and issuing commands associated with graphical elements presented on the display .","In the illustrated embodiment, special purpose hardware, such as an application specific integrated circuit (IC) , is coupled to bus . The special purpose hardware is configured to perform operations not performed by processor  quickly enough for special purposes. Examples of application specific ICs include graphics accelerator cards for generating images for display , cryptographic boards for encrypting and decrypting messages sent over a network, speech recognition, and interfaces to special external devices, such as robotic arms and medical scanning equipment that repeatedly perform some complex sequence of operations that are more efficiently implemented in hardware.","Computer system  also includes one or more instances of a communications interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a two-way communication coupling to a variety of external devices that operate with their own processors, such as printers, scanners and external disks. In general the coupling is with a network link  that is connected to a local network  to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example, communication interface  may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus (USB) port on a personal computer. In some embodiments, communications interface  is an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In some embodiments, a communication interface  is a cable modem that converts signals on bus  into signals for a communication connection over a coaxial cable or into optical signals for a communication connection over a fiber optic cable. As another example, communications interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN, such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links, the communications interface  sends and receives electrical, acoustic or electromagnetic signals, including infrared and optical signals, that carry information streams, such as digital data. Such signals are examples of carrier waves.","The term computer-readable medium is used herein to refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media include, for example, dynamic memory . Transmission media include, for example, coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optic cables, and waves that travel through space without wires or cables, such as acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves, including radio, optical and infrared waves. Signals that are transmitted over transmission media are herein called carrier waves.","Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, a magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a compact disk ROM (CD-ROM), or any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, or any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), a FLASH-EPROM, or any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Network link  typically provides information communication through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to equipment  operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP equipment  in turn provides data communication services through the public, world-wide packet-switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet . A computer called a server  connected to the Internet provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example, server  provides information representing video data for presentation at display .","The invention is related to the use of computer system  for implementing the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in memory . Such instructions, also called software and program code, may be read into memory  from another computer-readable medium such as storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in memory  causes processor  to perform the method steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hardware, such as application specific integrated circuit , may be used in place of or in combination with software to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.","The signals transmitted over network link  and other networks through communications interface , which carry information to and from computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves. Computer system  can send and receive information, including program code, through the networks ,  among others, through network link  and communications interface . In an example using the Internet , a server  transmits program code for a particular application, requested by a message sent from computer , through Internet , ISP equipment , local network  and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, or may be stored in storage device  or other non-volatile storage for later execution, or both. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to an infra-red signal, a carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus  carries the information to memory  from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory  may optionally be stored on storage device , either before or after execution by the processor .","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof.
