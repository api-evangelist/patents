title: Provisioning network services
abstract: A network service database stores abstractions of services provided by network elements. The network elements may proactively initiate communication with the service database. Additionally, network elements may update the service database when the network element experiences a state change. Client applications may contact the service database to perform functions, such as provisioning network services, billing, and fault monitoring without having to be concerned with the underlying details of each of the network elements.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to communication networks, and more particularly, to the managing\/provisioning of network services.","B. Description of Related Art","Communication networks, such as Internet Protocol (IP) based networks, are often large networks maintained by network service providers. Typically, service providers sell services and bandwidth on their network to interested parties (e.g., end-users, corporations, etc.).","A typical IP network includes a number of network elements, such as routers, that act together to form the complete network. A router is a device that determines the next network element to which data units (e.g., packets) should be forwarded during their trip through the network. Conventional routers often support a number of network features beyond basic routing of data units. For example, a network may support value-added technologies and protocols such as Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Traffic Engineering, Class of Service Differentiation, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and IP version 6. A VPN, for example, is a mechanism through which a service provider may provide an encrypted link between multiple endpoints, such that a customer using the VPN is assured of a private connection, even though the path of the VPN through the network may extend through non-secure portions of the network.","Network provisioning may include the process of initially configuring the network to support a customer or a value-added service or technology for the customer. Network provisioning can be a complicated and difficult task. To help manage complex networks, service providers use network management software that may query the various network elements to discover their configurations and direct the network elements to reconfigure themselves for the various network provisioning tasks.","Existing network management software\/techniques, however, can be relatively complicated and problematic. For example, because of interoperability problems associated with a heterogeneous network made up of different types or vendors of network elements, the network management software may have difficulty consistently discovering the current state or capabilities of all the network elements. Additionally, actually communicating and configuring each network element may require individually logging on to the network elements through, for example, a basic command line interface, and providing commands from a set of commands designed to work with that network element.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a system that will allow service providers or others to more easily and reliably provision network services.","A first aspect consistent with the principles of the invention is directed to a network element that provides network services in a network. The network element includes a service broker configured to construct a model of services offered by the network element and to proactively transmit the model to a network database that maintains service information relating to a plurality of network elements in the network. The network element further includes an interface to the network.","Another aspect of the invention is directed to a network device that includes a database and an interface. The database stores services offered by elements in the network and the interface receives information defining the services offered by the elements. The information is pushed from the elements to the interface without a request for the information from the network device.","Yet another aspect of the invention is directed to a method for managing a network. The method includes issuing a network service request to a services database, where the request defines an abstraction of at least one service that is to be provisioned in the network. The method further includes receiving an acknowledgement of the completion or failure of the request.","Yet another aspect of the invention is directed to a network that includes a database configured to store services offered by network elements in the network. The network additionally includes a number of service brokers installed on respective ones of the network elements. The service brokers being configured to construct a model of services offered by the network elements and proactively transmit the model to the database.","The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers may be used in different drawings to identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and equivalents.","As described herein, network elements are represented as abstractions defined by the services they provide rather than as a collection of routers, links, and protocols. A database may be used to store the abstraction of the network elements. Each network element may proactively transmit changes in its state to the database. Clients contact the database to perform functions, such as provisioning network services, billing, and fault monitoring without having to be concerned with the underlying details of each of the network elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","100","110","112","114","116","118","120","116","118","120","110","112","114","130","116","118","120","130","134"]},"Routers - may generally be conceptualized as network elements that may each have a number of capabilities. Network  may include network elements other than routers -. The number and organization of the network elements shown in  are exemplary only; real-world networks may have many more, fewer, or different network elements.","Network  may be maintained by one or more service providers . Service provider  may need to reconfigure network , such as to provision network  for a new service or customer.","Consistent with an aspect of the invention, a database, called an Internet Services Database (ISD)  herein, may be associated with network . ISD  assists service provider  in provisioning network . ISD  generally keeps track of the services available from the network elements in network  and the services that have been provisioned for network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["160","100","160","205","210","210","100","210","110","120","100"]},"ISD interface  may connect to client applications and (collectively, \u201cclient applications \u201d) and to network elements and (collectively, \u201cnetwork elements \u201d). Client applications  may include, for example, applications implemented by service provider . Client applications  may generally allow the service providers to request the provisioning of services in network , view the status of services, or monitor network elements in network . Network elements  may generally represent any device in network , such as routers -. In one implementation, ISD  may itself be a network element that can remotely connect to client applications  and other network elements .","ISD  may act as a single management interface between client applications  and network elements . Client applications , when provisioning network , may simply transmit a request for the network service to ISD interface . For example, a client application may request that a VPN connection be formed between two addresses in network . ISD  may then decide how the request is to be handled, implement the request, and transmit an acknowledgement of the implemented request back to the client application. In this manner, client applications  are abstracted from the details of the communications with the network elements. This abstraction can allow services to be provisioned across mixed platforms from a single common policy and control layer, regardless of the underlying platform or equipment type.","As previously mentioned, service database  maintains information about the network services supported by the underlying network . Service database  may be, for example, a relational database or another type of database, and may use any of a number of architectures, such as Extensible Markup Language (XML), Common Information Model (CIM), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), or Common Open Policy Service Protocol (COPS), to model the services offered by the various network elements. The modeling architecture may be extensible so that it can support new services provided by the network elements.","Network elements  may include service broker modules -(collectively, \u201cservice broker modules ), which may be software modules that represent the network element to ISD . More particularly, each of service broker modules  may act as a software interface for network service provisioning. Service broker modules  may, for example, run as a daemon communicating with an operating system of the network element in order to receive information pertaining to the network element and control services of the network element.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["210","210","210","210"]},"Via service database , ISD  can determine whether a service requested by one of clients  can be implemented in network . For example, if a client requests that an L2 VPN connection be provisioned between two end points, ISD  may consult service database  to determine that the network elements \u201cA\u201d and \u201cC\u201d support this type of VPN connection. ISD  may then send requests to these two network elements to provision the L2 VPN connection. In this manner, in response to a client request, ISD  may select the most appropriate network elements to fulfill the request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["228","225","225","426","427","427","427","427"],"i":["a","a "]},"Packet forwarding engine  may receive incoming packets, look up an appropriate next hop for the packets from the tables maintained by routing engine , and transmit the packets to the appropriate output port or ports. In one implementation, routing engine  may be implemented using one or more general purpose processors that execute software designed to implement the routing protocols. The processor(s) that implement routing engine  may also implement service broker module ","Service broker module may include an interface component  that communicates with ISD . Additionally, service broker module may include, or communicate with, daemon processes and (collectively, \u201cdaemon processes \u201d) that are responsible for monitoring the state or changing the state of network element . In the exemplary implementation shown, daemon processes  communicate with operating system kernel  of routing engine .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["228","228","225","228","501","228","160","502","502","228","160","228","160","228","160","503"],"i":["a","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a "]},"During continued operation of network element , service broker module may monitor the state of the services of its network element (act ). When the state changes, service broker module may update its corresponding model of network element and transmit the updated information to ISD  (act ). In some implementations, even if no changes in network element occur, service broker module may periodically transmit a \u201ckeep alive\u201d message to ISD  that informs ISD  that service broker module is still functioning. In this manner, service broker module keeps ISD  apprised of the state of its network element, including faults or malfunctions that occur at the network element.","Additionally, during operation of network element , service broker module  may receive service requests from ISD  (act ). In response, service broker module may control its network element to implement the request (act ). Service broker module may be responsible for allocating resources of network element to handle the request. For example, for a VPN request, service broker module may instruct network element to initiate a VPN session with a target address specified in the VPN request. In some situations, network element may not be able to implement the service request. Service broker module may acknowledge whether the service request was successfully implemented by sending an acknowledge message back to ISD  (act ).","Service broker module , as described above, proactively publishes a model of offered services as well as changes to the model. The model may be an abstraction of the underlying capabilities offered by network element . By \u201cpushing\u201d an abstracted services model to a database, operation details unique to individual network elements, such as, for example, different manufacturers or models, can be hidden from service provider .","Returning to , clients  may be remote software applications that interact with ISD . The interaction may be implemented through an open application programming interface (API) at ISD . In this manner, the client applications could be customized for each service provider (or other user).","Clients  may generally perform a number of network management\/provisioning functions by interacting with ISD . For example, clients  may query ISD  for the state of a network element or the services offered by a particular network element or group of network elements. ISD  may continually inform clients  of any changes in the network elements in which client  has an interest. Clients  may also issue network topographical, maintenance, or service provisioning requests through ISD . When making these requests, no network discovery or device interrogation is necessary by client . When ISD  receives a service request from one of clients , it may examine database  and, based on this examination, select the most appropriate service broker modules  to fulfill the request. When the request is accomplished by the selected service broker module, ISD  may update database  and acknowledge completion (or failure) of the request to client . ISD  may retry the request with alternate service broker modules  when the initially selected service broker module is unable to handle the request.","Techniques are described above that allow service providers to view their networks as a collection of services and service enablers, rather than as network elements such as routers, interfaces and protocols. In particular, a database is used to maintain a current state of the services offered by the network. The network elements may include a module that proactively pushes state information relating to the network element to the database.","The foregoing description of preferred embodiments of the invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention.","For example, while a series of acts has been presented with respect to , the order of the acts may be different in other implementations consistent with principles of the invention. Also, non-dependent acts may be implemented in parallel.","No element, act, or instruction used in the description of the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such. Also, as used herein, the article \u201ca\u201d is intended to include one or more items. Where only one item is intended, the term \u201cone\u201d or similar language is used.","The scope of the invention is defined by the claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate the invention and, together with the description, explain the invention.
