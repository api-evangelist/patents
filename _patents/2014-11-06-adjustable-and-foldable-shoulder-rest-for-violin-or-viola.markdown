{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to shoulder rests for violins or violas.","A shoulder rest is an accessory device that can be attached to a violin or viola. Typically, the shoulder rest has fork-shaped clamping members or \u201cfeet\u201d for detachably mounting the shoulder rest to the sides of the back of the violin or viola. The shoulder rest spaces the instrument at a comfortable height for the musician. The shoulder rest may have a body profile that generally conforms to the natural curves of the human shoulder and clavicle.","To accommodate both instruments of different sizes and musicians' body structures and posture preferences, some shoulder rests are adjustable in height and distance between the fork-shaped clamping members.","Some examples of adjustable shoulder rests are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,474 (Kun) entitled \u201cViolin or the Like Shoulder Rest\u201d, U.S. Pat. No. 5,419,226 (Kun) entitled \u201cViolin Shoulder Rest\u201d, U.S. Pat.

Other inventive aspects may be disclosed in the detailed description and drawings.","It will be noted that throughout the appended drawings, like features are identified by like reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","30","20","40","50","20","60","70","80","82","84","90","92","90","94","96"]},"The shoulder rest  depicted in  is adjustable to increase or decrease the distance between the forks , . The shoulder rest  includes a pair of adjustment mechanisms to adjust the distance between the forks. Each adjustment mechanism in the shoulder rest of  includes a slidable end member ,  having respective pull-tab adjustable sliders ,  actuated by lifting pull tabs , . The adjustment mechanism enables the slidable end members (shoulder end member  and clavicle end member ) to slide in slots relative to the base . In this manner the end members ,  may be extended or retracted. In  the end members ,  are shown fully retracted.  shows the end members ,  partially extended. When partially or fully extended, the end members ,  are also said to be cantilevered as shown in . The slidable end members ,  have encapsulated drums ,  that rotationally support the forks as will be described in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","24","28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 and 4","b":["10","40","50","70","100","110"]},"As depicted in , the body (bridge)  is asymmetrical. Viewed from above in , the body curves laterally (i.e. bends to one side) while the width generally increases from the clavicle end toward the shoulder end, except for a rounding off at the shoulder end. Likewise, when viewed from above in , it is apparent that the slots  or slide paths are at an angle relative to each other (i.e. they are not parallel or aligned with each other). Accordingly, the tongue-shaped sliders ,  are not parallel or aligned with each other as shown in .","As illustrated in , the shoulder end member  is shorter in height than the clavicle end member . Viewed from the side in , the body  curves upwardly from the clavicle end to the shoulder end. The shoulder end is convex and the clavicle end is concave as shown in . The shoulder end member is convex to match the curvature of the convex shoulder end. The clavicle end member is concave to match the curvature of the concave clavicle end. More specifically, the first slot at the shoulder end is convex whereas the second slot at the clavicle end is concave. The sliding movement of the shoulder end member follows an arcuate generally convex path. The sliding movement of the clavicle end member follows an arcuate generally concave path. When viewed from the side in , it is apparent that these paths are at an angle relative to each other (i.e. they are not parallel or aligned).","As further illustrated in , the forks ,  are preloaded so that they clamp or grip the violin or viola with a desired gripping or clamping force. The angle of pitch of the forks determines the amount of preload. The angle of the fork changes (i.e. opens) when the forks are mounted to the violin or viola. In other words, when attached to the instrument, the angle of the forks is greater (more \u201copen\u201d) relative to their unattached posture. This angle of pitch varies as the forks are extended or retracted relative to the body.","Because the tongue-shaped sliders slide in the recessed slots, the sliders are flush with the body  as can be seen in . In other words, the top curved surfaces of the sliders of each of the end members ,  is flush with the base member  for an embellished appearance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIGS. 9-10","b":"20"},"In the embodiment illustrated in , the shoulder rest  further comprises a foam cushion or pad  attached to the instrument-facing side of the body (bridge) to provide a cushioned or padded shoulder rest.","As depicted in , the foam cushion  may optionally include a plurality of apertures, openings or holes . The openings  may be die-cut or manufactured using another technique. The foam cushion with openings provides a number of advantages. The openings make the foam cushion lighter. The openings provide more traction on the shoulder to prevent the shoulder rest from slipping on the shoulder. In other words, the openings provide an enhanced grip. The openings in the cushion also embellish the appearance of the shoulder rest. The cushion may be made of NBS, neoprene (polychloroprene) or other equivalent synthetic rubbers, sponges or foams. The openings may be elongated openings as shown in the figures. The openings may be elongated and curved, with the curvature increasing from the ends towards the middle. Other shapes and sizes of openings may be substituted.","As noted above, the shoulder rest is both adjustable and foldable.  depicts the shoulder rest with its forks ,  retracted and unfolded in an engaged (unfolded) posture for mounting or clamping to a violin or viola whereas  depicts the forks ,  extended or cantilevered. The forks are independently adjustable and independently foldable (or \u201ccollapsible\u201d).  are isometric views of the shoulder rest in the retracted and extended positions. The forks may be folded for storage or transport.  show the forks folded.","In this illustrated embodiment, the fork-shaped clamping members (or \u201cforks\u201d) ,  are asymmetric. The forks are also rotatable in this illustrated embodiment. In the illustrated embodiment, the forks are threaded onto threaded stems ,  (shown in ) that permit the forks to be raised or lowered and that also permit the forks to be rotated relative to the base. The forks can also be folded or unfolded (i.e. closed or opened).","To recap, the shoulder rest  further includes a first slidable end member for receiving a threaded stem that supports the first clamping member, the first slidable end member being slidable between a retracted position and an extended position, the first slidable end member also having an arcuate channel or slot through which the stem rotates as the clamping member is pivoted between the unfolded and folded positions. The first slidable end member is slidable within a first slot in the instrument-facing side of the bridge to extend or retract the first clamping member relative to the bridge. Likewise, the shoulder rest  further includes a second slidable end member for supporting the second clamping member, the second slidable end member being slidable between a retracted position and an extended position, the second slidable end member also having an arcuate channel through which the stem rotates as the clamping member is pivoted between the unfolded and folded positions, wherein the second slidable end member is slidable within a second slot in the instrument-facing side of the bridge to extend or retract the second clamping member relative to the bridge.","In the illustrated embodiment, there is no locking mechanism to lock the forks in the folded or unfolded postures. However, in other embodiments, there may be a locking mechanism to lock the forks in the folded or unfolded postures. Alternatively, there may be an indexing or friction fit for the fork-folding mechanism.","The shoulder rest is thus adjustable by extending or retracting the forks. The forks are also rotatable as noted above to provide further adjustability. When extended, the slidable end members and their respective forks are cantilevered. When fully extended (cantilevered) there is some lateral and\/or torsional play or tolerance to provide a further degree of adjustability. In other words, when extended (cantilevered), the slidable end members may twist to fit the instrument and\/or may twist when torque is applied to the attached shoulder rest.","The first slidable end member comprises a first protrusion shaped to engage one of a first plurality of apertures disposed in the first slot. Similarly, the second slidable end member comprises a second protrusion shaped to engage one of a second plurality of apertures disposed in the second slot.","In the illustrated embodiment, the first plurality of apertures comprises transverse grooves disposed substantially orthogonally to an axis of sliding motion of the first support member within the first slot and wherein the second plurality of apertures comprises transverse grooves disposed substantially orthogonally to an axis of sliding motion of the second support member within the second slot and wherein the protrusion is a transverse rib shaped to engage one of the transverse grooves. The transverse grooves are disposed only in an inward half of each slot in the illustrated embodiment.","In the illustrated embodiment, each of the first and second slidable end members comprises a pull-tab unlocking member that flexes when pulled away from the slot to disengage the protrusion from the aperture, the pull-tab unlocking member being elastically biased to return to an unflexed posture against the slot. In the illustrated embodiment, the pull-tab unlocking member comprises an elongated tab terminating in a curved rounded tip that curves away from the slot. The tab has a tab thickness less than a slidable end member thickness and the tab has a tab width less than a slidable end member width.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 19"],"b":["10","20","30","80","90","100","110","106","116","120","130","20","30","20","106","116","100","110","120","130"]},"The body (or bridge)  may have a chamfer  along the sides of the body as illustrated in .
