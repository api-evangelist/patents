The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to lipid-lowering therapies. In particular, the invention provides a nuclear cholesterol metabolite, 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate, that decreases lipid biosynthesis and increases cholesterol secretion and degradation, and is thus useful for the treatment and prevention of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, atherosclerosis, and conditions related to fat-accumulation and inflammation (e.g. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD, and atherosclerosis).","2. Background of the Invention","Cholesterol is used by the body for the manufacture and repair of cell membranes, and the synthesis of steroid hormones and vitamin D, and is transformed to bile acids in the liver. There are both exogenous and endogenous sources of cholesterol. The average American consumes about 450 mg of cholesterol each day and produces an additional 500 to 1,000 mg in the liver and other tissues. Another source is the 500 to 1,000 mg of biliary cholesterol that is secreted into the intestine daily; about 50 percent is reabsorbed (enterohepatic circulation).","High serum lipid levels (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) are associated with the accumulation of cholesterol in arterial walls, and can result in NAFLD and atherosclerosis. The plaques that characterize atherosclerosis inhibit blood flow and promote clot formation, and can ultimately cause death or severe disability via heart attacks and\/or stroke. A number of therapeutic agents for the treatment of hyperlipidemia have been developed and are widely prescribed by physicians. Unfortunately, only about 35% of patients are responsive to the currently available therapies.","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the United States. This condition is associated with obesity, type-II adult onset diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, and diets high in fat. The earlier stage of NAFLD, fatty liver, is potentially reversible when proper treatment steps are taken. However, left unchecked, it can progress to inflammation of liver cells (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH) which is much more difficult to treat. Without treatment, NASH can result in irreversible scarring of liver tissue (steatonecrosis), with the potential to cause cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer.","There is an ongoing need to develop agents and methodologies to decrease intracellular and serum lipid levels, and to prevent or treat disease conditions involving the inflammation caused by elevated lipid levels.","The present invention provides a novel sulfated oxysterol, 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate, with potent serum lipid lowering properties. 5-Cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate is a nuclear sterol metabolite that decreases lipid biosynthesis and increases cholesterol secretion and degradation (bile acid synthesis). The increase in cholesterol degradation and decrease in lipid synthesis can lead to lower levels of intracellular and serum lipid levels. Thus, the sulfated oxysterol is useful for preventing or treating diseases associated with elevated lipid levels, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, gallstones, cholestatic liver disease, atherosclerosis, NAFLD, NASH, etc.","It is an object of this invention to provide a substantially purified 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate having the following chemical formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"34.37mm","wi":"64.26mm","file":"US09321802-20160426-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"It is a further object of the invention to provide a lipid-lowering composition. The composition comprises 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for lowering serum lipids levels (such as cholesterol and triglyceride levels) in a patient in need thereof. The method comprises the step of administering 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate to the patient in an amount sufficient to lower serum lipid levels, e.g. cholesterol and triglyceride levels, in the patient.","The invention further provides a method to treat or prevent pathological conditions associated with high serum lipids (e.g. cholesterol and triglyceride) levels in a patient in need thereof. The method comprises the step of administering 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate to the patient in an amount sufficient to lower serum lipid levels in the patient, and to prevent or treat the pathological condition. The pathological condition is, for example, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, atherosclerosis, or NAFLD.","The invention further provides a method of preventing or treating inflammation caused by or associated with lipid accumulation, or conditions or diseases associated with lipid accumulated-inflammation in a patient in need thereof. The method comprises the step of administering 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate to the patient in an amount sufficient to prevent or treat the inflammation or the condition associated with inflammation in the patient. In one embodiment, the conditions associated with inflammation are non-alcoholic fat liver diseases and atherosclerosis.","The invention also provides a method of decreasing lipid synthesis in a patient in need thereof. The method comprises the step of administering 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate to the patient in an amount sufficient to decrease lipid synthesis in the patient.","The invention further provides a method of increasing cholesterol secretion or degradation in cells. The method comprises the step of increasing a level of 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate in the cells. The method may be carried out by exposing the cells to 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate.","Disordered lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses play important roles in the pathogenesis of many fatal diseases, including atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). The \u201ctwo-hit\u201d theory is widely accepted for explaining the occurrence and development of the diseases. The \u201cfirst hit\u201d is the initial intracellular lipid accumulation, whilst the \u201csecond hit\u201d is inflammation and injury. Therefore, decreasing intracellular lipid levels and repressing the inflammatory response is the key to developing a new generation of therapeutic agents against these devastating diseases.","Recently, we have discovered the novel nuclear regulatory oxysterol (5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate), and elucidated its metabolic pathway, and studied its role in lipid metabolism and inflammation. The oxysterol down-regulates key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis and subsequently decreases intracellular lipid levels by blocking the activation of liver oxysterol receptor (LXR)\/sterol regulatory element binding protein signaling pathway. On the other hand, oxysterol decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and secretion, and represses inflammatory response by activating peroxisome proliferation activator receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and PPAR\u03b3\/I\u03baB\/NF\u03baB signaling pathway in macrophages and hepatocytes. A large body of experimental evidence has demonstrated that the oxysterol plays an important role in both \u201chits\u201d.","Most importantly, in vivo experimental studies showed that only one administration of the oxysterol decreases serum cholesterol and triglyceride by 20\u02dc40% and significantly increases HDL. Small molecule PPAR\u03b3 agonists have been used for therapy of diabetes for a couple of decades and small molecule LXR agonists have been tested for therapy of hypercholesterolemia for couple of years. However, these agonists inevitably carry serious side effects. The new oxysterol, a naturally occurring PPAR\u03b3 agonist and LXRs antagonist, has been shown to inhibit cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis in both hepatocytes and macrophages via LXR\/SREBP and repress inflammatory responses via PPAR\u03b3\/I\u03baB\/NF\u03baB signaling pathway. Therefore, this naturally occurring oxysterol serves as a new class of medication for the treatment and the prevention of atherosclerosis, fatty liver, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases.","Both in vivo and in vitro data demonstrated that nuclear oxysterol increases nuclear PPAR\u03b3 and decreases nuclear LXR levels in hepatocytes and macrophages. The nuclear oxysterol can decrease not only intracellular lipid levels but also repress the inflammatory response. Therefore the therapeutic concept of nuclear oxysterol represents a new approach to treating and preventing fatal diseases such as atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases.","The present invention is based on the discovery of 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate (25HC3S), a novel sulfated oxysterol with potent lipid (e.g. cholesterol and triglyceride) lowering properties. The chemical structure of the sulfated oxysterol is as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"34.37mm","wi":"63.67mm","file":"US09321802-20160426-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"This sulfated oxysterol is a nuclear cholesterol metabolite that decreases cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum. The compound increases cholesterol secretion by increasing expression of cholesterol transporters in hepatocytes. The increase in cholesterol secretion and degradation ultimately leads to lower levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides. Without being bound by theory, it appears that the sulfated oxysterol is made in the mitochondrion and translocates to the nucleus of the cell, where it acts to up-regulate genes involved in cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism. 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate is thus useful for preventing or treating diseases associated with elevated cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) and triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia), such as hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, etc. This sulfated oxysterol is especially suitable for in vivo use because it is an authentic natural compound that is biosynthesized in vivo by hydroxylation and sulfation of cholesterol. Thus, 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate should have few or no toxic side effects when administered to patients. In addition, the invention provides methods of preparing and administering 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate.","Example 6 shows that 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate also inhibits inflammation. Without being bound by theory, it appears that 25HC3S acts in macrophages as a PPAR\u03b3 activator, and suppresses inflammatory responses via PPAR\u03b3\/I\u03baB\/NF\u03baB signaling pathway. 25HC3S appears to attenuate the inflammatory response by increasing I\u03baB expression and decreasing I\u03baB ubiquitination and degradation, thus exerting its effect through the PPAR\u03b3\/I\u03baB\/NFB signaling pathway. As such, this compound is also useful for treating conditions that are caused or exacerbated by inflammation, particularly inflammation caused by lipid accumulation in cells, such as arthrosclerosis and fatty liver diseases.","The compound of the invention will be provided in a substantially purified form for use in the methods of the invention. By \u201csubstantially purified\u201d we mean that the sulfated oxysterol is provided in a form that is at least about 75%, preferably at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably at least about 95% or more free from other chemical species, e.g. other macromolecules such as proteins or peptides, nucleic acids, lipids, and other cholesterol-related species (e.g. other cholesterol derivatives such as cholesterol metabolites, chemically modified forms of cholesterol such as various other hydroxylated cholesterol species, etc.). In one embodiment of the invention, the sulfated oxysterol of the invention may be isolated and purified from living cells. One embodiment of this method is described in Example 1 in the Examples section below. However, those of skill in the art will recognize that in order to generate larger quantities of the sulfated oxysterol, the compound may also be synthesized, either by synthetic chemical means, or by methods which involve the use of recombinant DNA technology (e.g. by using cloned enzymes to carry out suitable modifications of cholesterol). An exemplary synthesis scheme for 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate is as follows: A mixture of 25-hydroxycholesterol (0.1 mmol) and sulfur trioxide triethyl amine complex (0.12 mmol) in dry pyridine was stirred at room temperature for 2 hrs. The solvent was evaporated at 40\u00b0 C. under nitrogen stream, and the pellets were dissolved in 500 ul of alkalined CHOH, pH 8.0. The sodium 5-cholesten-3b, 25-diol 3-sulfate was purified by flash chromatography to afford the product as a white solid.","The methods of the invention are useful for the treatment or prevention of conditions associated with high levels of cholesterol and triglyceride (hyperlipidemia). Such conditions may be either caused or exacerbated by high cholesterol and triglyceride, and include but are not limited to hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, gallstone diseases, cholestatic liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), etc. As used herein NAFLD is intended to encompass early stages of the diseases (e.g. fat accumulation in liver cells), stages in which the fatty liver cells become inflamed (e.g. NASH or hepatitis), etc. The compound is also useful to treat inflammation or conditions caused or exacerbated by inflammation, for example, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and diabetes (e.g. type 2 adult onset diabetes). By \u201ctreat\u201d we mean that a disease condition has already developed, and the methods of the invention are used to ameliorate symptoms of the disease condition, either to stop or decrease progression of the disease, or to reverse symptoms of the disease, either partially or fully. Alternatively, by \u201cprevent\u201d we mean that the compounds of the present invention may be administered to patients prophylactically prior to the development of disease symptoms, e.g. to one who has high cholesterol but has not yet developed atherosclerosis, or to one who does not yet have high cholesterol but is at high risk for developing high cholesterol (e.g. as determined by genetic factors, family history, etc.); or to a patient diagnosed with fatty liver disease who is at risk of developing NASH or other conditions associated with high lipids, fat accumulation in cells, etc.","Those of skill in the art will recognize that the phrases \u201chigh lipid level\u201d, \u201chigh cholesterol level\u201d and \u201chigh triglyceride level\u201d generally relate to cholesterol levels in serum in the range of about 200 mg\/dl or more, and triglyceride levels in serum greater than about 150 mg\/dl. A determination of \u201chigh cholesterol\u201d or \u201chigh triglyceride\u201d is typically made by a health professional such as a physician, and the established meaning of \u201chigh\u201d levels may vary somewhat from professional to professional. Further, the precise definition may vary somewhat depending on the state of the art, e.g. on findings from studies which investigate the relationship between lipid levels and diseases. Nevertheless, those of skill in the art will be able to identify suitable candidates for administration of the sulfated oxysterol of the present invention. By \u201clowering lipid levels\u201d or \u201clowering triglyceride levels\u201d or \u201clowering cholesterol levels\u201d we mean that the level of free serum lipid\/cholesterol\/triglyceride in a patient is decreased by at least about 10% to 30%, and preferably at least about 30 to 50%, and more preferably at least about 50 to 70%, and most preferably at least about 70 to about 100%, or more, in comparison to the level of lipid in the patient prior to administration of the sulfated oxysterol. Alternatively, the extent of the decrease may be determined by comparison to similar untreated control individuals to whom the compound is not administered. Those of skill in the art are familiar with such determinations, e.g. the use of controls, or the measurement of lipid levels in the blood before and after administration of an agent that lowers lipids.","Implementation of the methods of the invention will generally involve identifying patients suffering from or at risk for developing conditions associated with high lipids, and administering the compound of the present invention in an acceptable form by an appropriate route. The exact dosage to be administered may vary depending on the age, gender, weight, and overall health status of the individual patient, as well as the precise etiology of the disease. However, in general for administration in mammals (e.g. humans), dosages in the range of from about 0.1 to about 100 \u03bcg or more of compound per kg of body weight per 24 hr., and preferably about 0.1 to about 50 \u03bcg of compound per kg of body weight per 24 hr., and more preferably about 0.1 to about 10 \u03bcg of compound per kg of body weight per 24 hr. are effective.","Administration may be oral or parenteral, including intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intradermal injection, intraperitoneal injection, etc., or by other routes (e.g. transdermal, sublingual, oral, rectal and buccal delivery, inhalation of an aerosol, etc.). In a preferred embodiment, administration is oral. Further, administration of the compound may be carried out as a single mode of therapy, or in conjunction with other therapies, e.g. other cholesterol lowering drugs, exercise and diet regimens, etc.","The compounds may be administered in the pure form or in a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation including suitable elixirs, binders, and the like (generally referred to a \u201ccarriers\u201d) or as pharmaceutically acceptable salts (e.g. alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium or lithium salts, ammonium, etc.) or other complexes. It should be understood that the pharmaceutically acceptable formulations include liquid and solid materials conventionally utilized to prepare both injectable dosage forms and solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules and aerosolized dosage forms. In addition, the compounds may be formulated with aqueous or oil based vehicles. Water may be used as the carrier for the preparation of compositions (e.g. injectable compositions), which may also include conventional buffers and agents to render the composition isotonic. Other potential additives and other materials (preferably those which are generally regarded as safe [GRAS]) include: colorants; flavorings; surfactants (TWEEN, oleic acid, etc.); solvents, stabilizers, elixirs, and binders or encapsulants (lactose, liposomes, etc). Solid diluents and excipients include lactose, starch, conventional disintegrating agents, coatings and the like. Preservatives such as methyl paraben or benzalkium chloride may also be used. Depending on the formulation, it is expected that the active composition will consist of about 1% to about 99% of the composition and the vehicular \u201ccarrier\u201d will constitute about 1% to about 99% of the composition. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may include any suitable pharmaceutically acceptable additives or adjuncts to the extent that they do not hinder or interfere with the therapeutic effect of the sulfated oxysterol.","The administration of the compound of the present invention may be intermittent, or at a gradual or continuous, constant or controlled rate to a patient. In addition, the time of day and the number of times per day that the pharmaceutical formulation is administered may vary and are best determined by a skilled practitioner such as a physician. Further, the effective dose can vary depending upon factors such as the mode of delivery, gender, age, and other conditions of the patient, as well as the extent or progression of the disease condition being treated. The compounds may be provided alone, or in combination with other medications or treatment modalities.","In addition, the compound of the invention may also be used for research purposes.","Sterol ligands play key roles in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis. The present study has identified a novel regulatory nuclear sulfated oxysterol, which is generated in mitochondria, translocates to the nucleus, and upregulates the rate of bile acid synthesis. At forty-eight hrs after infection with recombinant adenovirus encoding a mitochondria cholesterol transport protein (StarD1) in primary rat hepatocytes, bile acid synthesis increased by 5-fold. Concurrently, [C], oxysterol derivatives with retention time at 11.50 min in HPLC elution profile was dramatically increased both in the mitochondria and in the nucleus, but not in culture media. The oxysterol product could be extracted into the chloroform phase from the methanol\/water phase after sulfatase treatment, and had the same physical properties as 25-hydroxycholesterol. LC\/MS\/MS analysis showed the nuclear oxysterol with a molecular ion, m\/z 481, in the Q1 full scan spectrum, and the presence of fragment ions at m\/z 59, 80, 97, and 123 in its product scan spectrum. Thus, the nuclear oxyserol derivative can be characterized as 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate. The addition of nuclear extract from the cells overexpressing StarD1 or the addition of the purified oxysterol to primary rat hepatocytes significantly increased the rates of bile acid synthesis (>3.5 fold), suggesting this oxysterol derivative is an active regulator. These results provide evidence for a new regulatory pathway by which a novel potent regulatory nuclear sulfated oxysterol is generated in mitochondria, translocates to the nucleus, and upregulates bile acid synthesis.","Introduction","The biotransformation of cholesterol to primary bile acids occurs via two main pathways in hepatocytes (1). The \u201cneutral\u201d pathway is considered to be the major pathway at least in humans and rats (2). In this pathway the sterol nucleus is modified before the side-chain, beginning with hydroxylation of cholesterol at the 7a position. This reaction is catalyzed by cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the first and rate-limiting step of this pathway. The ability to lower plasma cholesterol levels via the pharmacological control of CYP7A1 expression represents a therapeutic approach that has been in use for the last 30 years and is still of intense research interest. Multiple negative and positive modulators of CYP7A1 transcription have been identified both in tissue culture systems and in vivo (3) and many of these modulators are oxysterols, such as hydroxy-cholesterol molecules and bile acids. They function by activating nuclear receptors, such as liver X receptor (LXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which in turn regulate the expression of regulatory genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis, such as CYP7A1 and sterol 12\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), the enzyme specific for cholic acid synthesis. Oxysterols are also key regulatory molecules for the expression of many other genes involved in the homeostasis of cholesterol, and other lipids, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, some ATP-binding cassette transporters, like the ABCA1 and ABCG8, and many others. They function by modulating the activity of either nuclear receptors or other transcriptional factors, such as the sterol regulatory binding proteins (SREBPs) (4-6). Thus, characterizing endogenous synthesized oxysterols and their mechanism of action is critical for a better understanding of lipid homeostasis. The initial step in the \u201cacidic\u201d pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). The oxysterol intermediates of the \u201cacidic\u201d pathway such as 25-, or 27-hydroxycholesterol have been shown in vitro to be potent regulators in cholesterol homeostasis (7). Increased CYP27A1 activity in peripheral tissues may both down-regulate cholesterol synthesis through the SREBP pathway, and enhance the efflux of cholesterol and its elimination via LXR (8). However, the physiological and authentic in vivo LXR ligand is unknown (9).","We have recently found that overexpression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StarD1), a protein which facilitates cholesterol transport to the mitochondria, dramatically increases cholesterol transport into mitochondria, the hydroxylation of cholesterol to oxysterol, and cholesterol catabolism to bile acids both in primary hepatocytes in culture and in vivo (10; 11). This suggests that cholesterol delivery to the mitochondria, where the enzyme CYP27A 1 is localized, is the rate-determining step for bile acid synthesis via the acidic pathway. Subsequently, StarD1 was found in isolated hepatocytes (12). Overexpression of StarD1 in vivo increases bile acid synthesis not only to the same level as overexpression of CYP7A1, but also produces a similar composition of bile acids in mouse bile in vivo (11). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that potent oxysterol molecule(s) might be generated in the mitochondria, thereby regulating bile acid synthesis, and playing an important role in maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.","To test this hypothesis, a recombinant adenovirus encoding StarD1 was used to overexpress StarD1 in primary rat hepatocytes in order to increase bile acid synthesis. In this study we present evidence for previously unappreciated sulfated oxysterols in the nucleus of cells infected with the StarD1 adenovirus. The chemical structure of the most abundant nuclear oxysterol was characterized by HPLC, Triple Quadrupole LC\/MS\/MS, enzymatic digestion, and TLC analysis and was identified as 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate. We also provide evidence for a potential function(s) of this newly identified nuclear oxysterol in cholesterol catabolism.","The abbreviations used are: CYP8B1, sterol 12\u03b1-hydroxylase; CYP27A1, cholesterol 27-hydroxylase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CYP7A1, cytochrome P450 7\u03b1-hydroxylase; FXR, farnesil X receptor; SRE, sterol regulatory element; SREBP, sterol regulatory binding protein; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A; Q-RT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription PCR.","Cell culture reagents and supplies were purchased from GIBCO BRL (Grand Island, N.Y.).

Cells were maintained in the absence of thyroid hormone. Twenty-four hrs after plating, culture medium was removed, and 2.5 ml of fresh medium was added. Cells were then infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding either the StarD1 (Ad-CMV-StarD1) or the CYP7A1 (Ad-CMV-CYP7A1) cDNAs in front of the human cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) or no cDNA, as a control virus. The viruses were allowed to incubate for at least 2 hrs in minimal culture medium with gentle shaking of the plates every 15 min. After 2 hrs of infection, unbound virus was removed, replaced with 20 ml of fresh medium, and 2.5 \u03bcCi of [C]cholesterol was added. After 48 hrs, cells were then harvested and processed for nuclei isolation as described (17) with minor modification (). Briefly, cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization in buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH at pH 7.6, 1.5 mM MgCl, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium EDTA, 1 mM EGTA) and spun at 1,000\u00d7g for 10 min.

Forty-eight hrs after infection, bile acid synthesis increased 4-fold and 7-fold respectively, as we previously reported (18). Cells infected with control virus have similar levels of bile acid synthesis as uninfected cells. To test whether overexpression of StarD1 affects the expression of LXR targeting genes following generation of the nuclear oxysterol, the regulation of CYP7A1 expression was investigated following StarD1 overexpression. CYP7A1 mRNA levels increased by 6-fold (n=3) at day 3 following StarD1 overexpression ().","The subcellular distribution of [C]-cholesterol derivatives was monitored by adding exogenous [C]cholesterol to the hepatocyte culture 2 hrs after infection and is summarized in Table 1. Approximately 50% of the total counts of [C]cholesterol\/cholesterol derivatives were found in nuclear-related fractions. The other 50% were located in other subcellular organelles including cytosol, plasma membranes, lysosomes, and mitochondria (Fractions A and B). Only a small number of counts were detected in the inner membrane fraction (Fraction E). Interestingly, the total extractable [C]cholesterol\/cholesterol derivatives in nuclear debris from StarD1-infected cells was significantly (25%) higher than those of CYP7A1-infected or control nuclear extracts (Fraction F). TLC analysis of the chloroform-extractable cholesterol derivatives found in the nuclear fraction (Fraction D) in StarD1-infected hepatocytes showed four bands, which migrated like cholesterol ester, cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol respectively (). Only cholesterol ester, cholesterol, and 27-OH cholesterol were detected in control-infected cells, with cholesterol ester and cholesterol in CYP7A1-infected cells. These results suggested that StarD1 overexpression increased translocation of cholesterol derivatives, 25-hydroxycholesterol, to the nucleus. The presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol in the nucleus following StarD1 overexpression has been confirmed by mass spectrometry\/mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) analysis (data not shown). 25-Hydroxycholesterol is a minor oxysterol that may be formed in different types of tissues by a specific enzyme that may not belong to the cytochrome P-450 family (19). Interestingly, cholesterol-derivatives in the methanol\/water phase extracted from the nuclear debris were dramatically increased in the StarD1-overexpressing cells compared with control and CYP7A1-overexpressing cells ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Distribution of [C]cholesterol derivatives in primary"},{"entry":"rat hepatocytes following StarD1 or CYPTA1 overexpression*."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["Subcellular","Non-nuclear","Nuclear"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Fraction","A","B","C","E","F"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Control","43 \u00b1 2","\u200923 \u00b1 5","47 \u00b1 3","1.0 \u00b1 0.2","7 \u00b1 3"]},{"entry":["StarD1","38 \u00b1 8","3.1 \u00b1 2","36 \u00b1 6","1.7 \u00b1 0.1","10 \u00b1 2\u2002"]},{"entry":["CYP7 A1","43 \u00b1 3","2.9 \u00b1 4","49 \u00b1 8","1.1 \u00b1 0.2","8 \u00b1 2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*[C]Cholesterol was added at 2 hrs after adenovirus infection and cells were harvested 48 hrs later.

We first performed HPLC analysis of [C]cholesterol derivatives in the methanol\/water phases from the nuclear and non-nuclear fractions.  showed the 195 nm profiles, which nonspecifically detected double bonds containing molecules, and the specific radioactivity incorporated in each fraction derived from the [C]cholesterol that had been added to the cultures after infection. The 195 nm profiles were relatively similar in the nuclear fraction (Fraction D) from cells infected either with the StarD1, CYP7A1, or null recombinant viruses, except for an extra peak with retention time of 11.51 min, which was located between glycocholic acid (10.75 min) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (12.50 min) (). This 11.50 min peak was the only fraction that contained C-labelled cholesterol derivatives and was detectable only in StarD1 overexpressing cells (). The non-nuclear fraction (Fraction A) from the StarD1 overexpressing cells contained two major [C]cholesterol derivative peaks with retention times at 5 and 11.50 min. The 11.50 min peak was not detected in cells infected with either the control or the CYP7A1 viruses ().","Further analysis of the cholesterol derivatives in the methanol\/water phases extracted from mitochondrial, nuclear fractions, and culture media following overexpression of StarD1 protein showed that two [C]cholesterol derivatives with retention times at 5.00 min and 11.5 min were found in mitochondria ( and D). Furthermore, the 11.5 min peak was present only in mitochondria and nuclei but not in the media ( and E) suggesting that a cholesterol-derived molecule should be generated in mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus. The peak with retention time at 5.00 min was found only in mitochondria and culture media, but not in the nucleus ( and F) suggesting that the molecule presented in that peak was secreted from the cells. Therefore, the cholesterol derivative with a retention time of 11.50 min in the HPLC system, which is generated in the mitochondria and translocates to the nucleus, is defined as a nuclear oxysterol, and the other as a secretory oxysterol.","To characterize the chemical structure of the nuclear oxysterol, we proceeded to purify it by HPLC using C18 and silica columns, and analyze it by enzymatic digestion, TLC, and HPLC analysis. First, to detect the potential presence of sulfate group(s) in the nuclear oxysterol molecule, the purified nuclear oxysterol was digested with sulfatase. The products were extracted with methanol\/chloroform, separated by Folch partitioning, and characterized by HPLC and TLC analysis. Following sulfatase treatment, the nuclear oxysterol products were extracted into the chloroform phase from the methanol\/water phase and show the same retention time as 25-hydroxycholesterol, but not 27-, no 24-hydroxycholesterol in our HPLC system (), and the same relative mobility as 25-hydroxycholesterol on the TLC plate (), suggesting that the nuclear oxysterol derivative is a sulfated 25-hydroxycholesterol.","To confirm the chemical structure of the nuclear oxysterol derivative, the purified nuclear sulfated oxysterol was further analyzed by LC\/MS\/MS Mass Spectrometry. After we performed LC\/MS (Q1 full scan mode, 350 to 550 atomic mass units, amu) under negative ionization mode, a prominent peak was observed at a retention time of 10.75 min in a selected ion chromatogram of mass ion at m\/z=481 as shown in . The Q1 full scan spectrum showed the peak at 10.75 min mainly contained molecule ions, m\/z 480.1 and 481.5 (). Further analysis showed the molecule ion, m\/z 480.1 did not contain a sulfate group on hydroxyl group (m\/z 97) (data not shown). However, the molecule ion, m\/z 481.5, corresponds to sulfate group 97 and cholesterol (MW 386). This molecule ion was further analyzed by LC\/MS\/MS (product scan of m\/z 481) under negative ionization mode (). The characteristic fragment ions were observed at m\/z=80(a), 97(b), 107, 123(c), 288, 465, and 59(d) in the product scan spectrum of m\/z 481 (). These observed fragment ions indicate that the nuclear oxysterol is a sulfated oxysterol with a sulfate group on 3-OH position (20) and a hydroxyl group on side chain, m\/z 59, (molecular mass 482=80 (sulfate)+16 (O)+386 (cholesterol). Combined with data from HPLC, enzymatic digestion, and TLC analysis, the nuclear oxysterol derivative can be characterized as 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate (25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate) as shown in ().","Nuclear Oxysterol Derivatives from Primary Rat Hepatocytes Overexpressing StarD1 Increase Cholesterol Uptake and Bile Acid Synthesis.","To examine the function of the newly characterized nuclear oxysterol derivative in cholesterol homeostasis, the effects of the purified oxysterol on cholesterol uptake and bile acid synthesis were determined by measurement of cholesterol and conversion of [C]cholesterol into methanol\/water-extractable [C]products in primary rat hepatocytes. The rate of cholesterol uptake was slightly higher in cells treated with nuclear extracts extracted from StarD1 overexpressing cells than those in hepatocytes treated with nuclear extracts isolated from CYP7A1 overexpressing cells or from control cells (data not shown). Similarly, rates of bile acid synthesis were significantly higher in hepatocytes treated with nuclear extracts from StarD1 overexpressing cells, and increased by 4-fold at 24 hrs after addition of the nuclear extracts. In contrast, nuclear extracts from CYP7A1 overexpressing cells did not significantly change bile acid synthetic rates compared with control nuclear extracts (). To further confirm the role of the nuclear oxysterol derivatives in bile acid biosynthesis, the purified oxysterol derivative was dissolved in nuclear extracts (methanol\/water phase) from cells infected with the control virus and added to primary rat hepatocytes. The results were very similar to those in cells directly treated with the nuclear extracts from the StarD1 overexpressing cells and in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (), providing evidence that the nuclear oxysterol is a potent regulator of bile acid synthesis.","Discussion","Evidence for the first time to identify a novel nuclear regulatory oxysterol derivative, which is generated in mitochondria, translocated to the nucleus, and upregulates bile acid synthesis, gives rise to a new hypothesis that a new regulatory transduction pathway may play an important role in maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.","The present results suggested that mitochondrial cholesterol transport proteins, such as StarD1, could serve as sensors of intracellular cholesterol levels. When cholesterol levels increase, StarD1 proteins deliver cholesterol into mitochondria where it is metabolized to 25-OH cholesterol 3-sulfate (the nuclear sulfated oxysterol). The generated nuclear oxysterol derivative is then translocated into the nucleus probably by binding and activating the nuclear oxysterol receptor(s). Without being bound by theory, it appears plausible that the nuclear sulfated oxysterol-nuclear receptor(s) complex may enter into the nuclei and regulate gene expression involved in cholesterol metabolism. A possible mechanism is proposed in .","25-Hydroxycholsterol 3-Sulfate May be a Potential Authentic Ligand of Nuclear Sterol Receptor(s).","In the presence of StarD1 protein, cholesterol enters the mitochondria where it is oxidized to 25-hydroxycholesterol and is then sulfated to the nuclear sulfated oxysterol. The present results showed that both 25-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate entered the nucleus. To date, 25-hydroxycholesterol has been believed to be the most potent regulator of gene transcription (21-23). To identify which one exhibits a more potent regulatory function, 25-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate in nuclear extracts were separated by Folch partitioning: 25-hydroxycholesterol partitions to the chloroform phase and 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate partitions to the methanol\/water phase. Interestingly, addition of the chloroform phase extracts containing 25-hydroxycholesterol to cells slightly increased the rates of bile acid synthesis (data not shown). However, the addition of methanol phase extracts dramatically increased bile acid synthesis (). Moreover, 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate is a water-soluble compound. It is thus reasonable to propose that 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate serves as a potent nuclear sterol regulators in vivo.","25-Hydroxylases (25-OHLase) and Hydroxycholesterol Sulfotransferase 2 (HST2) May be Involved in the Generation of the Potent Nuclear Sulfated Oxysterol.","StarD1 delivers cholesterol into the mitochondria and generates a novel nuclear sulfated oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulphate. This data suggests that a new pathway of cholesterol metabolism is responsible for generating this nuclear oxysterol. Our present report shows the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate in both the mitochondria and the nucleus but not in culture media, suggesting that 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate is generated in mitochondria and translocates exclusively to the nucleus. To biosynthesize this potent nuclear sterol regulator, two reactions should be involved: 25-hydroxylation and 3\u03b2-sulfation of cholesterol. It is not clear at this time whether 25-hydroxylation is catalyzed by CYP27A1 or 25-hydroxylase because 25-hydroxylase has not yet been identified in hepatocytes or in mitochondria, although it has been cloned (19). Since we did not see any cholesterol-3\u03b2-sulfate in the HPLC elution profile, we believe the first step is likely to be 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol catalyzed by 25-hydroxylase to form 25-hydroxycholesterol. Subsequently, sulfation of 25-hydroxycholesterol at the 3\u03b2 position, is catalyzed by hydroxycholesterol sulfotransferases HST2(a, b), enzymes which have recently been cloned and identified (24; 25). In addition, 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate may be glucuronidated for further catabolism and secretion via the bile as 24-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate (26). However, at the present time it is not clear that the [C]-cholesterol derivative with a retention time of 5 min is the glucuronidation product of 25-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate ().","Steroid sulfate conjugates may play an important role in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. An interesting development in recent years has been the realization that steroid sulfoconjugates play important roles in well-characterized biological effects, such as serving as potent neuroexcitatory agents, which are distinct from the well-known role of unconjugated steroids as ligands for nuclear receptors to regulate gene expression (27). Several sulfated sterols have been reported to be widely distributed in steroidogenesis tissues (26) and to circulate in plasma at concentrations ranging from 328-924 \u03bcg\/100 ml, with a blood production rate of 35-163 mg\/day (28). A similar sulfated oxysterol derivative, 24-hydroxycholeterol 3-sulfate 24-glucuronide (based on MS\/MS analysis) was reported to be in the serum and urine of children with severe cholestatic liver diseases (26). The 3-sulfate of 24-hydroxycholesterol is the major hydroxycholesterol sulfate found in meconium and infant feces (29; 30), and is most likely excreted via bile. Bile excretion of this oxysterol would be impaired in cholestasis, leading to its increased concentration of 24-hydroxycholesterol 3-sulfate in hepatocytes and conceivably leading to its glucuronidation. However, where the compound came from and what function this oxysterol plays in the cholestatic liver is still a mystery. Although high levels of the double conjugate of 24-hydroxycholesterol are an indicator of grave liver disease, and can be used as a criterion for recommending liver transplantation, the physiological role and metabolism of this compound have never been identified. Sulfated sterols have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes, e.g. regulation of cholesterol synthesis, sperm capacitation, thrombin and plasmin activities, and activation of protein kinase C isozymes (24). Furthermore, sulfated sterols can serve as a substrate for adrenal and ovarian steroidogenesis (31; 32). Sulfated sterols play an important, but unclear, role in the normal development and physiology of skin, where an epidermal sterol sulfate cycle has been described (24). The present results show that the nuclear extract containing the sulfated oxysterol and the purified nuclear sulfated oxysterol dramatically increased the rates of bile acid synthesis, strongly suggesting that the nuclear sulfated oxysterol may play an important role in cholesterol metabolism.","Activation of LXRs by oxysterols is believed to be responsible for regulation of the metabolism of several important lipids, including cholesterol and bile acids (33). The identification of an LXR response element in the promoter of the rat cholesterol CYP7A1 suggested that LXRs play an important role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis (34; 35). LXR\u03b1-deficient mice (LXR\u03b1\u2212\/\u2212) dysregulate the CYP7A1 gene and several other important lipid-associated genes (3). Studies utilizing these animals confirmed the essential function of LXR\u03b1 as a major sensor of dietary cholesterol and an activator of the bile acid synthetic pathway in mice. The finding of authentic oxysterol ligands for LXRs is one of the most important investigative methods for developing new therapeutic methods for the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. To date, there is still only indirect evidence of the important role of oxysterols, such as 24-, 25-, or 27-hydroxycholesterol, as authentic ligands in the normal regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. Soluble and nuclear oxysterol-binding proteins with a high affinity for oxysterols exist, but the physiological ligands for these proteins have not yet been defined with certainty (36). The present report, with evidence showing that a potent regulatory nuclear sulfated oxysterol that is generated in the mitochondria translocates into the nucleus, provides a new clue regarding the role of oxysterol(s) in the regulation of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the regulatory nuclear sulfated oxysterol generated in mitochondria translocates into nucleus, activates nuclear oxysterol receptor(s), and up-regulates bile acid synthesis. The nuclear sulfated oxysterol serves as a ligand of nuclear sterol receptor(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.

To further investigate the mechanism of this activity, the effect of purified 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate on gene expression of LXR-targeted cholesterol transport proteins ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG5, ABCG8, and LDLR was investigated. Purified nuclear sulfated oxysterol was added to primary hepatocytes in culture, and mRNA levels of the transport proteins were quantitated by real time RT-PCR. The primer sets and TagMan probes for detection of mRNA levels were purchased from AB Applied Biosystem (Foster City, Calif.) and the reactions were performed on an MJ Research DNA Engine Opticon instrument. The results are presented in  and show that the addition of purified nuclear oxysterol to primary hepatocytes in culture increased expression of ABCA1 (2-fold) and ABCG5 (1.6-fold), and ABCG8 (3 fold). The expression of ABCG1 is typically low in primary hepatocytes and did not change compared with control cells. The correlation of increased levels of the sulfated oxysterol in nuclei with increased levels of LXR targeting gene expression suggests that the nuclear oxysterol receptor, LXR, is activated by exposure to the sulfated oxysterol. These data do not rule out the activation of other nuclear receptor(s) as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0134"},"figref":["FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIGS. 12C and 12D"},"Abstract","Recently, a novel oxysterol, 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulfate (25HC3S) was discovered, characterized, and identified in mitochondria and nuclei of primary hepatocytes following overexpression of the cholesterol transport protein, StarD1. This oxysterol was also detected in human liver nuclei. In the present study, 25HC3S was chemically synthesized. Addition of varying concentrations of 25HC3S to HepG2 cells markedly inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis and significantly decreased microsomal cholesterol. Real time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis shows that 25HC3S strongly decreased HMG CoA reductase mRNA levels in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. In comparison, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) inhibited HMG CoA reductase mRNA levels in HepG2 cells but not in primary human hepatocytes when the cells were culture in serum-free media. Coincidentally, 25HC3S inhibited the activation of steroid response element binding protein (SREBP-1) in absence or presence of mevinolin and mevalonate, indicating that cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition occurred through blocking SREBP-1 activation, and subsequently the expression of HMG CoA reductase in the human hepatocytes. In conclusion, the presented findings indicate that 25HC3S regulates intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis via inhibiting SREBPs activation in human hepatocytes.","Introduction","The \u201cacidic\u201d pathway of bile acid biosynthesis is initiated by the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). Oxysterol intermediates of the \u201cacidic\u201d pathway such as 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) have been shown to be regulators of cholesterol homeostasis (1; 2). These oxysterols represent regulatory molecules for the expression of many other genes encoding enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and transport (3-5). In theory, increased CYP27A1 activity in peripheral tissues could both down-regulate cholesterol synthesis through generating regulatory oxysterols and the steroid response element binding proteins (SREBPs) pathway, and enhance the cellular efflux of cholesterol, i.e. its elimination, via liver oxysterol receptor, LXR (6). However, the relationship between the CYP27A1 activity and intracellular cholesterol metabolism is unknown.","Previous reports showed that overexpression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StarD1), a protein which facilitates cholesterol transport into mitochondria, dramatically increases cholesterol catabolism to bile acids both in primary hepatocytes in culture and in vivo (7; 8). These findings suggest that cholesterol delivery to the mitochondria, where the enzyme CYP27A1 is localized, is the rate-determining step for bile acid synthesis via the \u201cacidic\u201d pathway. Subsequently, StarD1 was detected in hepatocytes (9). Overexpression of StarD1 in vivo not only increases bile acid synthesis to the same level as overexpression of CYP7A1, but also produces a similar composition of bile acids in bile (8). As described in Examples 1-3, a novel oxysterol, 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulfate (25HC3S) was found and characterized in mitochondria and nuclei of primary hepatocytes following overexpression of StarD1. This oxysterol was also present in human liver nuclei (10). The results suggested that the oxysterol is synthesized in the mitochondria and tranlocated to the nuclei. Oxysteorls in nuclei should be able to play important roles in maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. However, the function of this nuclear oxysterol, 25HC3S, remains unknown.","In the present study, we chemically synthesized 25HC3S and presented evidence that this oxysterol strongly regulates HMG CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis via SREBP regulatory system in hepatocytes.","Materials and Methods","Materials:","Cell culture reagents and supplies were purchased from GIBCO BRL (Grand Island, N.Y.); [C]Cholesterol and [H]25-hydroxycholesterol ([H]25HC) from New England Nuclear (Boston, Mass.). [C]27-OH Cholesterol was prepared as previously described (11). HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.). Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Bio Whittaker (Walkersville, Md.). Tissue culture flasks were purchased from Costar Corp. (Cambridge, Mass.). The reagents for real time RT-PCR were from AB Applied Biosystem (Warrington WA1 4 SR, UK). The chemicals used in this research were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.) or Bio-Rad laboratories (Hercules, Calif.) unless otherwise specified. All solvents were obtained from Fisher (Fair Lawn, N.J.) unless otherwise indicated. The enhanced chemilluminescence (ECL) reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, N.J.). The testosterone and 27HC were obtained from Research Plus Inc. (Bayonne, N.J.). LK6 20\u00d720 cm thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were purchased from Whatman Inc. (Clifton, N.J.). Nylon membranes were purchased from Micron Separation Inc. (Westborough, Mass.).","A mixture of 25HC (402 mg, 1 mmol) and triethylamine-sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (160 mg, 1 mmol) in 5 ml of dry pyridine was stirred at room temperature for 2 hrs. After the solvent was evaporated at reduced pressure, the products were purified by HPLC using silica gel column and solvent of methylene chloride and methanol (5%) as mobile phase to afford the product as a white solid powder. The structure of the product was characterized by mass spectrum (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analysis.","Mass Spectral Analysis","The synthesized compound was analyzed by a MDS Sciex ABI 4000 Triple Quadrapole Mass Spectrometer (MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada) with a Turbo IonSpray ionization (ESI) source and the mass spectrometer was operated in negative ion modes and data were acquired using full scan mode as previously described (10).","Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","Samples were prepared for H NMR analysis as described previously (12). Briefly, each sample, 1 mg, was dissolved in 0.5 ml of Dand lyophilized to remove exchangeable protons. The residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide-d6\/DO (98:2, v\/v). NMR spectra were obtained on spectrometers operating at H frequencies of 300 MHz.","Cell Culture","HepG2 cells were grown in MEM containing non-essential amino acids, 0.03M NaHCO, 10% FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1% Pen\/Strep and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO. When cells reached at \u02dc90% confluency, the oxysterols in DMSO or in ethanol (final concentration, 0.1%) and\/or [1-C]acetate for cholesterol synthesis was added or otherwise as indicated. Microsomal and cytosol fractions were isolated from broken cells as described previously (10).","Primary human hepatocytes were purchased from an NIH-approved facility (Liver Tissue Procurement Distribution System, Univ. of Minnesota). Cells were obtained from a random sampling of males and females 18-69 yr of age. Experiments were performed as cells became available to corroborate findings in experiments conducted in HepG2 cells as previous described (13).","Determination of Cholesterol Biosynthesis by TLC and HPLC","After incubation of HepG2 cells with media containing 25HC3S for 6 hrs, cultures in 25-cm2 flasks were given 3 ml of the same fresh medium containing 5 \u03bcCi of the [1-C]acetate. After 4 hr incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the media were removed and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-saline buffer (PBS), harvested with rubber police as described, and collected in Eppendoff tubes. The cells were sedimented by centrifugation and the pellets were washed three times by resuspension and sedimentation. The pellets were resuspended in 0.3 ml of PBS. The total lipids were extracted and separated by adding 3 volume of chloroform:methanol (v\/v, 1:1). [C]Cholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol was isolated into chloroform phase and separated on TLC (tuluene:acetyl acetate, 2\/3, v\/v\/). [1-C]acetate derivatives were visualized by Image Reader, Fujifilm BAS-1800 II.","HPLC Analysis of Cholesterol Derivatives","[1-C]Acetate derivatives in the chloroform phase were analyzed by HPLC on an Ultrasphere Silica column (5\u03bc\u00d74.6 mm\u00d725 cm; Backman, USA) using HP Series 1100 solvent delivery system (Hewlett Packard) at 1.3 ml\/min flow rate. The column was equilibrated and run in a solvent system of hexane:isopropanol:glacial acetic acid (965:25:10, v\/v\/v), as the mobile phase. The effluents were collected every 0.5 min (0.65 ml per fraction) except as indicated. The counts in [C]acetate derivatives were determined by Scintillation Counting. The column was calibrated with [C]cholesterol, [H]25HC, and [C]27-hydroxycholesterol.","Determination of HMG CoA Reductase mRNA by Real-Time RT-PCR","Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells using SV Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega). Two \u03bcg of total RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis as recommended by manufacture (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green on ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The final reaction mixture contained 5 ng of cDNA, 100 nM of each primer, 10 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7SYBR\u00ae Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and RNase-free water to complete the reaction mixture volume to 20 \u03bcl. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The PCR was carried out for 40 cycles at 95\u00b0 C. for 15 s and 60\u00b0 C. for 1 min. The fluorescence was read during the reaction, allowing a continuous monitoring of the amount of PCR product. The data was normalized to internal control-\u03b2-actin or GAPDH mRNA. The sequences of primers for HMG CoA reductase used in real-time PCR are ACCTTTCCAGAGCAAGCACATT (SEQ ID NO: 1) (Forward) and AGGACCTAAAATTGCCATTCCA (SEQ ID NO: 2) (Reverse).","Western Blot Analysis","Microsomal proteins (80 \u03bcg) were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide denaturing gel according to the method of Laemmli (14). Following SDS-PAGE (Hoefer Vertical Slab Gel Unit; Heofer, San Francisco, Calif.), proteins were electrophoretically transferred overnight (4\u00b0 C.) to Immobilon-P membranes using a Hoefer Trans Blot Electrophoretic Transfer cell. The membranes were then blocked for 90 minutes (25\u00b0 C.) in blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween, 5% non-fat dry milk). Proteins were then incubated for 90 minutes (25\u00b0 C.) or overnight (4\u00b0 C.) with a rabbit polyclonal IgG (1:2500-1:20,000) against human SREBP-1, SREBP-2, or HMG CoA reductase. After washing, a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG-Horse-radish peroxidase conjugate, 1:2500) was added to the blocking solution (25\u00b0 C., 90 minutes). Protein bands were detected using the Amersham ECL plus Kit.","Results","Chemical synthesis of the nuclear oxysterol, 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-Sulfate To study the role that 25HC3S may play in cellular cholesterol homeostasis, this oxysterol was chemically synthesized. Using a modified triethylamine-sulfur trioxide complex protocol as described in Methods, the nuclear oxysterol was successfully synthesized as outlined in . MS analysis of the synthesized compound shows the same molecular mass ion, m\/z 481 as the \u201cauthentic\u201d nuclear oxysterol (). H NMR analysis shows that the proton resonance at C3 with multiple small (1.5 Hz) splits near 3.65 ppm in the spectrum of 25-OH cholesterol (starting material) () is shifted to 4.20 ppm in the product spectrum () as indicated, which confirms that HSO group is added at the C3 position of 25-OH cholesterol. HPLC analysis shows the same retention time of the synthesized oxysterol as the authentic nuclear oxysterol (data not shown). Combined with the results from the MS analysis, it is concluded that the synthesized molecule is 5-cholesten-3\u03b2, 25-diol 3-sulphate (25HC3S). The results also confirmed the structure of the nuclear oxysterol as previously reported (10 and Examples 1-3).","25HC3S Inhibits Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Decreases Cholesterol Levels in Microsomal Fractions","To examine the effects of 25HC3S on cholesterol biosynthesis, the rates of cholesterol synthesis were determined by adding [1-C]acetate following the addition of varying concentration of 25HC3S to HepG2 cells in culture.  summarizes the effects of 25HC3S on cholesterol biosynthesis. After incubation of the cells in the media containing 25HC3S for 6 hrs and [C]acetate for additional 4 hrs, total lipids were extracted and partitioned. Neutral lipids in the chloroform phases including [C]acetate derivatives were analyzed by TLC and HPLC, TLC analysis shows that [C]cholesterol ether, [C]cholesterol, and [C]25HC were synthesized but no detectable [C]27HC (). Free [C]cholesterol was found to be significantly decreased following addition of 25HC3S while the other labeled sterols did not significantly change. The decreases were concentration dependent (). The decreased amounts of [C]cholesterol bands on the TLC were confirmed by HPLC analysis as shown in . The results from three experiments are summarized in .","To study the distribution of intracellular cholesterol following the addition of 25HC3S, microsomal, nuclear, and cytosol fractions were isolated and total lipids from each fraction were extracted with chloroform\/methanol\/water. The cholesterol concentration in each fraction was determined by HPLC after cholesterol oxidase treatment which converts sterols to 3-oxo-\u03b24 derivatives. As shown in , 25HC3S significantly decreased cholesterol levels in the microsomal fraction (left panels) as well as 25HC (right panels) but not in cytosol and nuclear fractions (data not shown). The decreases in cholesterol concentration were dose dependent as indicated in . It was also observed that no 25HC could be detected in the fractions from cells treated with 25HC3S. In contrast, dose dependent levels of 25-hydroxycholeterol could be detected in the fractions treated with 25HC as shown in  (right panels). These results suggest that 25HC3S directly inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis and decreases cholesterol levels in microsomal fractions and not through its degradation to be 25HC.","The Nuclear Oxysterol Inhibits Cholesterol Biosynthesis by Decreasing HMG CoA Reductase mRNA Levels","To investigate how 25HC3S inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis, total mRNA were isolated from HepG2 cells following incubation in 10% FBS fresh media containing different concentrations of 25HC3S (). The mRNA levels of HMG CoA reductase were determined by real time RT-PCR. As shown in , there was concentration dependent decreases in HMG CoA reductase mRNA following the addition of 25HC3S to the cells in culture. The addition of 25HC3S to HepG2 cells also lead to a marked decrease in the levels of HMG CoA reductase protein ( and D). Western blot analysis shows that 50% of its protein level was decreased in a concentration dependent following the addition of 25HC3S to culture media ( and D).","To compare with 25HC, mRNA levels of HMG CoA reductase in 25HC or 25HC3S-treated HepG2 cells were analyzed by real time RT-PCR. Both of the compounds can inhibit HMG CoA reductase in a similar fashion as shown in . To further distinguish whether 25HC3S inhibits HMG CoA reductase expression via lipids uptake in the culture media, HepG2 cells were incubated in media containing lipid-depleted serum for 2 hrs, which increases expression of HMG CoA reductase by four-fold as previously reported (15). Cells were incubated for another 6 hrs following the addition of 25HC3S. Real time RT-PCR analysis shows that 25HC3S still strongly inhibits HMG CoA reductase mRNA levels (). Interestingly, 25HC shows much more potent inhibition of the reductase mRNA in lipid-depleted media as compared to cells cultured in medium containing FBS (). Under these conditions, 25HC is more potent inhibition than 25HC3S on HMG CoA reductase mRNA levels. The result of inhibition of HMG CoA reductase by 25HC is consistent with previous report (16; 17). To confirm its physiological role that 25HC3S plays in the cholesterol biosynthesis, primary human hepatocytes (PHH) cultured in serum-free media were used. Surprisingly, 25HC did not significantly affect the levels of HMG CoA reductase mRNA (\u02dc15% at 25 mM). In contract, 25HC3S inhibited HMG CoA reductase mRNA at a similar level (\u02dc75%) as that in HepG2 cells (). HPLC analysis showed that the increasing levels of 25HC in the cells are concentration dependent (), indicating that 25HC can still enter to the cells under this culture condition as in FBS containing media. These results suggest that 25HC3S and 25HC inhibit HMG CoA reductase mRNA by different mechanisms.","The Nuclear Oxysterol Inhibits HMG CoA Reductase Expression by Inhibition of Both SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 Activation","It has been well documented that HMG CoA reductase gene expression is regulated by SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 (18). When SREBPs are activated, the cholesterol biosynthesis will increase (19). To study whether SREBP regulatory system is involved in the inhibition of HMG CoA reductase mRNA levels and inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by 25HC3S, total cellular protein was extracted from HepG2 cells treated with 25HC3S or 25HC at different concentration (). The precursor and mature forms of SREBPs were determined by Western blot analysis. As expected, the decreases of the mature forms of SREBP-1 and the increases of the precursor form of SREBP-1 following addition of 25HC3S and 25HC were dose dependent (). However, the mature form of SREBP-2 only slightly decreased (). It was observed that the activation of SREBP-1 was much more sensitive to the treatment with 25HC and 25HC3S than that of SREBP-2. The inhibition of SREBP-1 maturation fits the decrease in HMG CoA reductase mRNA, at 3 \u03bcM of 25HC or 12 \u03bcM of 25HC3S, 85% of the mRNA of HMG CoA reductase and SREBP1 was inhibited. To confirm the mechanism, HepG2 cells were incubated in media containing 50 \u03bcM of mevinolin and 0.5 \u03bcM of mevalonate. Under this condition, SREBPs and HMG CoA expressions are upregulated. Following the treatment with 25HC or 25HC3S, SREBPs activation in the cells was determined by Western blot as described above. As shown in , 25HC3S shows more potent inhibition on SREBP-1 activation than 25HC. Thus, the nuclear oxysterol, 25HC3S, is most likely to inhibit the activation of SREBP-1 and subsequently inhibits the expression HMG CoA reductase.","The current study shows that the chemically synthesized oxysterol, 25HC3S as well as 25HC, inhibits the cholesterol biosynthesis and the expression of the key enzyme, HMG CoA reductase. Unlike 25HC, 25HC3S inhibits this expression in primary human hepatocytes as well as HepG2. 25HC3S was found in the human liver nuclei and its levels were dramatically increased following overexpression of mitochondrial cholesterol delivery protein, StarD1, in primary rat hepatocytes, indicating that 25HC3S is most likely synthesized in the mitochondria and translocated to the nuclei for the regulation of gene expression involved in cholesterol homeostasis (10). The present results provided evidence that the oxysterol, 25HC3S, plays an important role in maintenance of the intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, and suggested that the StarD1 protein may serve as a sensor of intracellular cholesterol levels. When cholesterol levels are too high in the cells, StarD1 protein may deliver cholesterol to mitochondria where cholesterol is converted to be potent regulatory oxysterols such as 25HC, 27HC, and 25HC3S. Those oxysterols play important roles in maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis.","Theoretically, the added oxysterols can be metabolized after they enter into cells: 25HC can be sulfated by hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) to be sulfated 25HC or sulfated 25HC can be degraded by sulfatase to be 25HC. Thus, which one serves as a potent regulator in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis is questionable. Our HPLC analysis data shows that no 25HC was generated following addition of 25HC3S up to 50 \u03bcM (, left panels) suggesting that 25HC3S was not degraded during the culture time. In contrast, the peak of 25HC increased following the addition of the 25HC and the increasing is dose dependent (, right panels). Although the results can not rule out the possibility that a small portion of the oxysterol was converted to be the sulfated 25HC, there is no evidence that 25HC works as the sulfated form at present.","25HC3S and 25HC inhibit cholesterol synthesis by two different mechanisms, both involving the proteins that control sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), membrane-bound transcription factors that activate genes encoding enyzymes of lipids biosynthesis. In sterol-depleted cells, SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) escorts its bound SREBP to the Golgi apparatus where the SREBP is processed sequentially by two membrane-embedded proteases. The NH-terminal domain released by the process can enter the nucleus where it activates transcription of the gene encoding HMG CoA reductase and more than 30 other genes whose products are necessary for lipid synthesis (18). When 25HC is delivered to cells in ethanol or when cholesterol is delivered in LDL, SCAP becomes trapped in the ER. The bound-SREBP is no longer carried to the Golgi apparatus, and the NH2-terminal domain can not enter the nucleus (20). As a result, transcription of the lipid biosynthetic genes declines. Retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the ER is mediated by the sterol-induced binding of SCAP to Insigs (Insig-1 and Insig-2) in the ER membrane (20; 21). When mixtures of cholesterol and 25HC are added to cultured cells, SCAP is induced to bind to Insig 1 and Insig-2, and thus can not transport SREBPs to the Golgi body (3) and to be activated. J. L. Goldstein laboratory provided evidence that cholesterol interacts with SCAP directly by inducing it to bind to Insigs, whereas 25HC works indirectly through a putative 25HC sensor protein that elicits SCAP Insig binding (3). However, what the 25HC sensor protein is unknown.","The present study showed that 25HC strongly inhibits HMG CoA reductase in the presence of the lipids depleted serum both in HepG2 () (\u02dc90%), similar inhibits as 25HS3S does in the presence of serum (\u02dc70%), but weakly inhibits in PHH when the cells were cultured in serum free media () (\u02dc15%). These results suggest that PHH does not express 25-hydroxycholesteorl sensor protein(s) under this culture system. However, 25HC3S can inhibit the enzyme expression to similar levels either presence or absence of serum or lipids depleted serum in both hepG2 and PHH indicating that 25HC3S can directly regulate the gene expression. The major reason could be that 25HC3S is much more hydrophilic than 25-hydroxycholeterol and is water soluble, which makes the molecule freely self-transport after this molecule enters the cells.","The oxysterol, 25HC3S, inhibits the cholesterol biosynthesis through inhibiting the activation of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, and subsequently inhibit the expression HMG CoA reductase in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. Based on the microarray data from transgenic and knockout mice, both SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 activation stimulate HMG CoA reductase by 30 folds and 38 folds, respectively (18). SREBP-1 also strongly stimulates fatty acid synthase but not SREBP-2 (18). However, it is not clear whether SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 are directly mediated by 25HC3S to regulate the expression regulation of the key enzyme, HMG CoA. Our results clearly show that 25HC3S as well as 25HC are much more potent in inhibiting SREBP-1 activation than SREBP-2. We believe that 25HC3S inhibits SREBP-1 activation and subsequently inhibits HMG CoA reductase resulting in the decline of cholesterol biosynthesis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.

As can be seen, administration of the nuclear oxysterol resulted in a significant decrease in the level of cholesterol detected in microsomal fractions of the HepG2 cells, when compared to the control (25HC3S concentration=0).","Administration to female mice (20-25 g weight) were was by peritoneal injection once with or without 72 \u03bcg of the nuclear oxysterol in 100 \u03bcl of 0.9% NaCl containing 3 \u03bcl of ethanol. Twelve hrs following the injection, blood was harvested for analysis of triglycerides and cholesterol. The results are presented in , which shows that injection of the nuclear oxysterol decreased triglycerides in serum by 40% (n=12, p<0.01) and decreased cholesterol levels by 15%. Further, injection of the nuclear oxysterol did not increase the activities of alkaline phosphotase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) in sera suggesting that the nuclear oxysterol is non-toxic (data not shown).","To test the effect of diet on cholesterol levels, mice were provided with either a normal or high cholesterol diet for 8 days, and treated with the nuclear oxysterol as described above. Liver tissues were collected for pathohistochemistry studies (Sudan IV staining) and the results showed that administration of the oxysterol significantly decreased triglyceride levels in liver tissues of mice that were fed normally and also of mice that were fed a high cholesterol diet (data not shown).","This study demonstrates that this natural nuclear oxysterol, 25HC3S, could serve as a potent drug for the treatment and prevention of hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia, and related diseases such as atherosclerosis.","The nuclear orphan receptor PPAR\u03b3 is particularly important in regulating inflammatory responses in macrophages. Activation of PPAR\u03b3 represses key inflammatory response gene expressions. However, the regulation of PPAR\u03b3 activation is obscure. Recently, a new cholesterol metabolite, 25-hydroxycholesterol-3-sulfate (25HC3S), was identified as a potent regulatory molecule of lipid metabolism. This Example explores the effect of 25HC3S and its precursor, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) on PPAR\u03b3 activation and inflammatory responses. Addition of 25HC3S to human macrophages markedly increased nuclear PPAR\u03b3, cytosol I\u03baB, and decreased nuclear NF\u03baB protein levels. PPAR\u03b3 response element reporter gene assays showed that 25HC3S significantly increased luciferase activities. NF\u03baB-dependent promoter reporter gene assays showed that 25HC3S suppressed TNF\u03b1-induced luciferase activities only when co-transfected with pCMX-PPAR\u03b3 plasmid in H441 cells. In addition, 25HC3S decreased LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expressions and releases. In the PPAR\u03b3-specific siRNA transfected macrophages, 25HC3S failed to increase I\u03baB and to suppress TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression. In contrast to 25HC3S, its precursor 25HC, a known LXR ligand, decreased nuclear PPAR\u03b3, cytosol I\u03baB, while increasing nuclear NF\u03baB protein levels in the presence of LPS and TNF\u03b1. This demonstrates that 25HC3S acts in macrophages as a PPAR\u03b3 activator, and suppresses inflammatory response via PPAR\u03b3\/I\u03baB\/NF\u03baB signaling pathway.","Macrophages are the key cellular players in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. In the early stage of atherosclerosis, macrophages in arterial walls may accumulate lipids. These lipid-loaded macrophages, termed foam cells, are characteristic of a reversible early cellular phase of atherosclerotic lesions. Progressive lipid accumulation leads to further escalation of inflammatory responses and infiltration of inflammatory cells [1]. Through this process, early cellular lesions are transformed to late, fibrous atherosclerotic plaques. Physiological or pharmacological maneuvers that reduce macrophage lipids and inflammatory responses may be effective in preventing or reversing atherosclerosis.","Nuclear orphan receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes to affect processes as diverse as reproduction, inflammation, development, and general metabolism [2]. Nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferation activator receptors (PPARs), which play major roles in the regulation of lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory process, are implicated in the control of diverse diseases such as type II diabetes and atherosclerosis, and are believed to be ideal targets for therapeutic management strategies for many metabolic disorders [3-8]. Activation of PPAR\u03b3 leads to the formation of heterodimers with RXRs. The heterodimers bind to DNA-specific sequences called peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) and lead to up- or down-regulation of transcriptional activity of target genes [9]. Several natural compounds such as fatty acids, PGD2-derivatives, eicosanoids have been reported to act on PPAR\u03b3 [10-13]. However, their affinities with PPAR\u03b3 protein are low [14-16]. Thus, natural ligands for PPAR\u03b3 and the regulating mechanisms of its activation are yet to be elucidated.","Oxygenated cholesterols, oxysterols, play an important role in maintenance of lipid homeostasis [17]. Recently, we identified a novel oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol-3 sulfate (25HC3S), that accumulates in hepatocyte nuclei following overexpression of the mitochondrial cholesterol delivery protein, StarD1 [18-20]. Macrophages are able to synthesize this oxysterol [21]. This oxysterol appears to be synthesized from 25HC by sterol sulfotransferase 2B1 (SULT2B1) [22]. Of note is that overexpression of SULT2B1 impairs the response of liver oxysterol receptor LXR to multiple oxysterol ligands [23].","Furthermore, the addition of 25HC3S to primary hepatocytes down-regulates expression of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and decreases lipid biosynthesis by inactivating the LXR\/SREBP-1 signaling pathway in hepatocytes and macrophages [21,24]. Several studies show that inflammation is closely associated with disordered lipid metabolism [25,26]. Infection and inflammation induce the acute-phase response (APR), leading to multiple alterations in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. APR increases plasma triglyceride levels, de novo hepatic fatty acid synthesis, and suppression of fatty acid oxidation [27]. The molecular mechanisms during the APR involve coordinated changes in several nuclear orphan receptors, including PPARs, LXRs, and RXRs [27,28]. PPAR\u03b3 as well as LXRs are lipid-activated transcription factors and reciprocally regulate inflammation and lipid metabolism [3,29]. The processes by which these events occur are poorly understood. Cholesterol metabolites 25HC and 25HC3S have been shown to be the potent regulators involved in lipids metabolism via LXRs\/SREBPs signaling pathway [21,24]. It is thus possible that they are able to regulate inflammatory response through PPAR\u03b3 signaling pathway.","Data presented in this Example demonstrates that 25HC3S is a potent down-regulator while 25HC is an up-regulator of inflammatory responses. Evidence is provided that their effects on the inflammatory response are mediated via activation of the PPAR\u03b3\/I\u03baB\/NF\u03baB signaling pathway in macrophages. These findings imply a new signaling pathway for the interaction between inflammatory response and lipid metabolism.","Materials and Methods","Cell culture reagents and supplies were purchased from GIBCO BRL (Grand Island, N.Y.); the reagents for real time RT-PCR were obtained from AB Applied Biosystems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.).

After incubating for 1 hr, the wells were washed and incubated with primary PPAR antibody which recognizes the accessible epitope on PPAR protein upon PPRE binding. The peroxidase-labeled second antibody was added and incubated for 1 hr. The reaction was stopped and absorbance was read at 450 nm in a spectrophotometer.","Transfection and Promoter Reporter Gene-Luciferase Assays","H441 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. When cell density reached 90-95%, the cells were transfected with an expression plasmid as indicated using a lipid-based FuGENE HD transfection reagent according to the manufacture (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind.).

Transfections were carried out in triplicate for each sample, and each experiment was repeated three times.","Detection of Intracellular Distribution of PPAR\u03b3 in THP-1 Derived Macrophages","THP-1 derived macrophages were cultured on coverslips in six-well plates and treated with different concentrations of 25HC and 25HC3S for 4 hrs. The cells on coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C., and then rinsed three times with PBS at room temperature. They were then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% of TritonX-100 for 3 min and washed with PBS before blocking by incubation with 5% of normal goat serum in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0 C.

Where indicated, data were subjected to t-test or ANOVA analysis and determined to be significantly different at p<0.05.","Results","25HC3S Administration Increases Nuclear PPAR\u03b3 Levels in Macrophages","To examine the effect of 25HC3S and its precursor 25HC on PPAR\u03b3 activation, total nuclear proteins were extracted and nuclear PPAR\u03b3 levels were determined by western blot analysis. As shown in , addition of 25HC3S to the macrophages led to significant concentration\u2014(, upper panels) and time\u2014(data not shown) dependent increases in nuclear PPAR\u03b3 protein levels. To confirm the increasing 52 kDa band was PPAR\u03b3 protein, an artificial PPAR\u03b3 ligand, rosiglitazone, was used as positive control and a specific antagonist, T0070907, as negative control (). As shown in , 25HC3S and rosiglitazone substantially increased nuclear PPAR\u03b3 levels (Lane R) while T0070907 decreased the level (Lane T). In contrast, 25HC decreased PPAR\u03b3 levels (middle figures of ). It was noticed that the increases or decreases in the nuclear PPAR\u03b3 levels occurred only in the early stages, less than 4 hrs (data not shown). Summaries of the concentration-dependent increases or decreases after normalization to nuclear protein lamin are shown in the lower panel of . These results suggest that 25HC3S functions as a PPAR\u03b3 agonist and 25HC as an antagonist. To further confirm that 25HC3S binds with the same molecule as the artificial antagonist, a competitive assay was performed. In the presence of the antagonist T0070907, 25HC3S failed to increase the nuclear PPAR\u03b3 levels to its maxima. However, the levels of inhibition could be partially reversed following increasing concentration of 25HC3S as shown in the top panel of . In contrast, rosiglitazone increased nuclear PPAR\u03b3 levels and the increased levels could be significantly inhibited by the presence of 25HC as shown in the middle panel of . These results suggested that 25HC3S\/T0070907 and 25HC\/rosiglitazone are competitive and they bind with the same molecule, PPAR\u03b3. Real time RT-PCR analysis showed that neither 25HC nor 25HC3S was able to change PPAR\u03b3 mRNA levels significantly (data not shown), suggesting these oxysterols have no effect on its transcriptional regulation.","Double immunofluorescence studies using DAPI for the nuclear marker together with the PPAR\u03b3 antibody showed that PPAR\u03b3 proteins were widely distributed in the cytosols and nuclei of the macrophages (): compared with DMSO, administration of 25HC3S increased the nuclear PPAR\u03b3 fluorescence intensities; administration of the antagonist T0070907 decreased the intensity, and blunted 25HC3S stimulation. The results imply that 25HC3S increases PPAR\u03b3 levels in the nuclei by increasing nuclear translocation.","25HC3S Addition Increases PPAR\u03b3-Response Transcriptional Activities and Represses Inflammatory Responses","To study the transcriptional activities of the nuclear extracts from 25HC3S-treated macrophages, PPAR\u03b3 responsive elements (PPRE) immobilized ELISA and PPRE reporter gene assay were carried out as shown in . ELISA assay showed that addition of 25HC3S significantly increased the PPRE-binding activities of the nuclear extracts, which is concentration-dependent (p<0.01) (). PPRE reporter gene assays were performed in H441 cells because our preliminary experiments showed that these cells had the best transfection efficiency and highest reciferase activities (data not shown). At 25 \u03bcM of 25HC3S, the activity reached to a similar levels as that induced by the PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone. In the presence of the antagonist T0070907, 25HC3S failed (p<0.01) to increase PPAR\u03b3 reporter gene activities with co-overexpression of ACOX-PPRE reporter and PPAR\u03b3 genes (). Interestingly, in the presence of T0070907, the lower concentrations of rosiglitazone failed to stimulate the reporter gene activity (p<0.01) but the higher concentrations still could increase the activities as shown in . The results suggested that 25HC3S activates PPAR\u03b3 by binding with different motif and rosiglitazone binds with the same motif of the molecule as T0070907 or with different affinities. Addition of 25HC3S suppresses LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 expressions and releases in macrophages. Addition of LPS substantially increased IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels by 55-fold and significantly increased TNF\u03b1 by 2-fold as previously reported [32,33]. Addition of 25HC3S suppressed LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels by 2-fold while 25HC increased its levels by 2-fold ( and B). However, both 25HC3S and 25HC repressed LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 mRNA levels by two and four folds, respectively ( and B). It was noticed that 25HC was significantly stronger than 25HC3S in suppressing LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 expression (p<0.05). The suppressions of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 expression by 25HC3S could significantly be blunted in the presence of artificial PPAR\u03b3 antagonist T0070907 (p<0.05) as shown in . These results suggested that 25HC3S inhibits LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 expression by PPAR\u03b3 signaling pathway.","Consistently, 25HC3S represses the LPS-induced releases of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in the macrophages. Addition of LPS increased TNF\u03b1 release by 50-fold (data not shown) and increased IL-1\u03b2 releases by 10-fold (, Lanes C and L), which was similar with previous reports [32,33]. Interestingly, addition of 25HC3S significantly decreased LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 release, but 25HC increased IL-\u03b2 release (p<0.05), which are concentration-dependent manner as shown in .","PPAR\u03b3 is Involved in 25HC3S-Mediated Suppression of Inflammatory Responses via NF\u03baB","TNF\u03b1 can activate I\u03baB kinase, which phosphorylates I\u03baB followed by its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. In the absence of TNF\u03b1 25HC3S treatment decreased (p<0.05) but 25HC increased nuclear NF\u03baB levels (Left panels in ). In the presence of TNF\u03b1, 25HC3S failed to decrease, but 25HC still significantly increased its nuclear NF\u03baB levels (Right panels in ). In its inactive form, NF\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by members of the I\u03baBs. When I\u03baBs are phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, NF\u03baB will be activated and enter nuclei. Thus, the results imply that the decreases\/increases in the nuclear NF\u03baB by these oxysterols are related with I\u03baB degradation.","To investigate whether the NF\u03baB regulation is PPAR\u03b3 dependent, H441 cells were transfected with pNF\u03baB dependent reporter gene-Luc expression plasmid alone or co-transfected with PPAR\u03b3 expression plasmid. In the absence of PPAR\u03b3 expression plasmid, TNF\u03b1 induced the reporter gene expression by 10-fold and 25HC3S failed to suppress its induction as shown in left panel of . In the co-transfected cells, the presence of PPAR\u03b3 expression, TNF\u03b1 still induced the reporter gene expression by 10-fold but 25HC3S reduced its induction by 50% (Right panel of ). Furthermore, in the presence of PPAR\u03b3 antagonist, the suppression was blunted (Right panel of ). The results suggested that the suppression of TNF\u03b1-induced NF\u03baB dependent reporter gene expression by 25HC3S requires the presence of PPAR\u03b3 protein.","To confirm that the suppression of LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 and IL-\u03b2 expression is PPAR\u03b3 dependent, specific siRNAs were used to knock-down PPAR\u03b3. Following transfection of the recombinant plasmid encoding specific siRNAs for 48 hrs, about 45% of the cells were viable and harvested. About 90% of PPAR\u03b3 protein levels were suppressed and their levels were not changed in the presence of 12 \u03bcM of 25HC3S as shown in . Consistently, 25HC3S significantly increased I\u03baB mRNA levels by 2.5 folds, and in the presence of TNF\u03b1, 25HC3S increased the levels by 6 folds, which can be abolished by PPAR\u03b3 specific siRNA (). As expected, LPS stimulated TNF\u03b1 by 40 folds and IL-1\u03b2 expression by 12 folds, and 12 \u03bcM of 25HC3S significantly suppressed LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 (), IL-1\u03b2 (), and NF\u03baB () expression (p<0.05). However, in the siRNA-expressed cells, 25HC3S failed in suppressing these expressions (). These results suggest that the 25HC3S induces repression of nuclear NF\u03baB levels and subsequently decreases TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression through PPAR\u03b3 induced I\u03baB expression.","To further confirm that 25HC3S\/25HC regulates inflammatory responses through I\u03baB\/NF\u03baB signaling pathway, the effects of these two oxysterols on I\u03baB expression were examined. When the macrophages were treated with 25HC3S, the expression I\u03baB at protein and mRNA levels were significantly increased (). Western blot analysis showed that 25HC3S increased and 25HC decreased I\u03baB protein levels (Upper panel of ). When treated with 25HC, the mRNA level had no significantly changed (p>0.05 by ANOVA analysis) () but the protein levels were significantly concentration-dependent decreased (p<0.05 by ANOVA analysis) (Lower panel of ), indicating 25HC increases I\u03baB protein degradation. In the presence of TNF\u03b1, 25HC3S increased I\u03baB protein levels more than those in the absence (Middle panel, ), but in the presence of PPAR\u03b3 antagonist T0070907, 25HC3S failed to increase its levels (data not shown). These results indicated that PPAR\u03b3\/I\u03baB\/NF\u03baB signaling pathway is involved in 25HC3S\/25HC regulated inflammatory responses.","Discussion","Previous reports show that 25HC and 25HC3S serve as ligands, agonist and antagonist, respectively of LXR nuclear receptor [21, 24]. In the present study, we have shown that 25HC3S, increases nuclear PPAR\u03b3, cytosol I\u03baB, and decreases nuclear NF?B protein levels; increases PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activities and I\u03baB expression; subsequently inhibits the TNF\u03b1 and LPS-induced inflammatory factor expressions and releases in human THP-1 derived macrophages. In contrast, its precursor 25HC, a known LXR ligand, basically has an opposite function. Thus, the present results provide strong evidence that 25HC and 25HC3S not only coordinately regulate lipid metabolism by LXR\/SREBP-1 [21,24], but also inflammatory responses by PPAR\u03b3 I\u03baB\/NF\u03baB signaling pathway [46]. The role of oxysterols including 25HC in inflammation is controversial. The nuclear receptors LXR and PPAR\u03b3 regulate inflammation in different ways and respond to distinct signaling pathways [3]. PPARs and LXRs both exert positive and negative control over the expression of a range of metabolic and inflammatory genes. Although LXRs as well as PPAR\u03b3 can transrepress several inflammatory genes in a similar manner, comparative DNA-microarray studies have identified overlapping, but distinct, subsets of genes that are repressed by ligand binding [34-37]. Why these nuclear receptors use parallel molecular mechanisms to negatively regulate similar but distinct gene subsets in the same cell type remains an open and intriguing question [38, 39]. In our previous publication, we showed that 25HC is a potent agonist of LXR as others previously described, but 25HC3S is a potent antagonist [21]. In the present study we have shown that 25HC is a potent PPAR\u03b3 antagonist and 25HC3S is a potent agonist. Thus, both of the oxysterols can regulate inflammatory responses but via two different pathways. 25HC can suppress inflammatory response via LXR signaling pathway but stimulate the response via PPAR\u03b3 pathway; 25HC3S can suppress inflammatory response via PPAR\u03b3 pathway but may interfere in a different direction by the LXR pathway. Several laboratories found that oxysterols including 25HC can activate LXRs, subsequently repress a set of inflammatory genes after LPS and cytokines stimulation [40, 41]. However, many other studies found that oxysterols including 25HC induce inflammation and oxidation in different kinds of cells. For example, 25HC substantially increased the IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression and secretion induced by LPS in human monocyte-derived macrophages. 25HC is also a potent inducer of MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2 and IL-8 secretion in vitro [41, 42]. 25HC treatments result in a significant increase in NF\u03baB transcriptional activity, not only by affecting the I\u03baB degradation and the translocation of p65\/NF\u03baB to the nucleus, but also by regulating the p65\/NF\u03baB transactivation [43]. Oxysterols also induce inflammation and oxidation through inducing slight mitochondrial dysfunctions and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) [43]. Previous study showed that PPAR\u03b3 agonists increase LXR and ABCA1 mRNA levels following incubation with the agonists for 24 hrs [44]. It was assumed that PPAR\u03b3 regulates inflammatory response through LXR pathway. However, if the cells were incubated with the agonists for short times (less than 6 hrs), the results were completely different [21]. Previous studies have shown that 25HC3S decreases LXR activities and its targeting gene expressions in macrophages. In contrast, LXR ligand, 25HC, increases nuclear LXR levels following short incubation time, subsequently increases LXR targeting gene expressions, inclusive of ABCA1\/G1 and SREBP-1 mRNAs by 5-50-fold in 6 hrs. Furthermore, 25HC3S blocked the stimulation of target gene expressions induced by 25HC or artificial LXR agonist. It was concluded that 25HC3S activates PPAR\u03b3 and modulates inflammatory response through PPAR\u03b3 not LXR signaling pathway in the macrophages. The present studies provide a new clue of the role that oxysterols and oxysterol sulfation may play in inflammation regulation via activation\/inactivation of the nuclear orphan receptors such as LXRs and PPARs.","Previous studies have shown that PPAR\u03b3 suppresses target gene expression of NFB, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and signal transducers and activator of transcription (STATs) in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines and TLR ligands [45]. The mechanisms involved in the repressive effects of PPAR\u03b3 have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, it has been found that 25HC3S increases PPAR\u03b3 and decreases NFB protein levels in nuclei (); suppresses the expression of TNF-induced NFB dependent reporter gene, which is PPAR\u03b3-dependent (); induces IB expression (); and inhibits IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 expression (). It is possible that 25HC3S activates PPAR\u03b3, which induces I\u03baB expression and inhibits I\u03baB degradation by suppressing of TNF expression. I\u03baB protein inhibits inflammatory responses by binding and inactivating NFB. Meanwhile, the activated PPAR\u03b3 inhibits TNF\u03b1 expression, which directly decreases IB ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, 25HC3S attenuates the inflammatory response by increasing I\u03baB expression and decreasing IB ubiquitination and degradation through PPAR\u03b3\/IB\/NFB signaling pathway as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
