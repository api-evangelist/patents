The Government has certain rights in this invention.","None","This disclosure generally relates to simulation of radar detection behavior and more particularly to simulation of radar detection behavior using simulated Swerling and other models for target echo signals.","It is useful and important, in radar system design to know or estimate the detection capability and behavior of the radar system before a complete system design can proceed. An important aspect of the radar system's capability is in the determination of the efficacy of certain signal processing procedures, particularly the procedure known as \u201cintegration\u201d, both coherent and non-coherent integrations. The purpose of integration is to build up the value of a signal compared to the accompanying internal noise fluctuations, so that the presence of a target echo may be detected. In addition to target echo detection, it is also important to determine the properties of the signal processing algorithms that the radar system utilizes. Thus, there is a need for ways to determine the target echo detection efficacy and the properties of a radar system's signal processing algorithms through the use of simulated target echo signals so that the radar system's design and signal processing algorithms can be tested during the design stage of the radar system without physically realizing the radar system in a field testing environment.","A method for determining target echo detection efficacy and properties of a radar system's signal processing algorithms through the use of simulated target echo signals is disclosed according to an implementation of the present disclosure. The method comprises generating simulated a noise complex envelope sequence representing a radar system's internal fluctuation noise; generating a simulated radar target echo signal complex envelope pulse sequence; and adding the simulated noise complex envelope sequence to the simulated radar target echo signal complex envelope pulse sequence, thereby producing a simulated noisy radar target echo signal complex envelope sequence. The simulated noisy radar target echo signal complex envelope sequence is then inputted to the radar system's signal processing algorithm and the output is analyzed to determine the signal processing algorithm's target echo detection efficacy and properties. The simulated noisy radar target echo signal complex envelope sequence provides realistic testing of the signal processing algorithm because the target echo signal is accompanied by the inevitable radar system internal fluctuation noise.","According to another implementation of the present disclosure, a method for simulating radar target echo signal is disclosed. The method comprises generating a simulated noise complex envelope sequence; generating a simulated radar target echo signal complex envelope pulse sequence; and adding the simulated noise complex envelope sequence to the simulated radar target echo signal complex envelope pulse sequence, thereby producing a noise-corrupted simulated signal complex envelope sequence.","All drawings are schematic and are not intended to show any dimensions to scale.","This description of the preferred embodiments is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, which are to be considered part of the entire written description of this invention.","In determining target echo detection efficacy and properties of a radar system's signal processing algorithms through the use of simulated target echo signals, an important aspect is generating simulated radar target echoes that are realistic such that the signal processing algorithm can be tested using conditions that are as realistic as possible.","The signal processing algorithm can be provided in a signal processor or as a computer program loaded on a machine-readable storage medium. Thus, the signal processing algorithm for a radar system can be tested without an actual radar system by inputting the simulated target echo or echoes accompanied by the inevitable radar system internal fluctuation noise.","Since a radar system will inevitably be faced with various types of targets, it is desirable that the various types of radar targets be used in a simulation to determine appropriate design parameters. According to the present disclosure, simulating radar target echoes is performed at the level of complex envelope. This provides a simulated echo signal that is realistic because in the real world, noise get added to radar target echo signals at the complex echo level before envelope extraction by the radar system's signal processor. This disclosure describes how that can be done for almost any type of target echo fluctuation.","Referring to the flow chart  shown in , a method for determining target echo detection efficacy of a signal processing algorithm of a radar system is disclosed. The method comprises generating simulated a noise complex envelope sequence representing a radar system's internal fluctuation noise (see block ); generating a simulated radar target echo signal complex envelope pulse sequence (see block ); and adding the simulated noise complex envelope sequence to the simulated radar target echo signal complex envelope pulse sequence, thereby producing a simulated noisy radar target echo signal complex envelope sequence (see block ). The simulated noisy radar target echo signal complex envelope sequence is then inputted to the radar system's signal processing algorithm (see block ) and the output is analyzed to determine the signal processing algorithm's target echo detection efficacy and properties (see block ). The simulated noisy radar target echo signal complex envelope sequence provides realistic testing of the signal processing algorithm because the target echo signal is accompanied by the inevitable radar system internal fluctuation noise.","In the present disclosure, emphasis is placed on the simulation of the traditional four Swerling models for radar cross section (RCS) fluctuations (i.e. target echo) and on the general chi-square type of RCS fluctuation. These models can be exactly simulated, with noise added properly, because the chi-square type of fluctuation, with an integral number of duo-degrees of freedom, arises out of complex Gaussian random variables that describe the complex envelopes. The simulation is done by starting with a number of complex Gaussian processes, adding the complex noise envelopes, and then adding the appropriate number of squares of the complex noise and signal mixtures.","The cases of non-integral duo-degrees of freedom and of arbitrary cross section fluctuations must be treated differently. The process consists of starting with a sequence of RCS values and taking the square root of these values to produce a sequence of amplitude values. These are then multiplied by the sine and cosine of an arbitrary angle to produce simulated signal complex envelopes. Complex Gaussian noise with zero mean and appropriate variance is added to the simulated signal complex envelope to produce the complex envelope of signal plus noise. The envelope of the complex envelope sums then produces the amplitude for subsequent noncoherent processing. Because of arbitrariness of the signal phase, one must be cautious in any processing before envelope extraction. However, the process is suitable for pulse to pulse coherent processing where initial signal phase is unimportant. For example, a Doppler shift may be imposed on the signal phases before adding the complex envelopes.","The final type of simulation considered is that of target motion (about the center of gravity) characterized by sinusoidal motion (or with a combination of sinusoids). Such motion is characteristic of precession and nutation. By treating these motions as having random starting phase (which is quite reasonable physically), the echo complex envelope is easily described, and fairly arbitrary motion can be simulated by starting with the complex covariance matrix, factoring it by a Cholesky decomposition, and using one of the factors to transform a sequence having uncorrelated elements into a sequence having the desired motions.","Of the four Swerling models, simulation of the Swerling II model is the simplest. The pulse-to-pulse fluctuations are statistically independent and their amplitudes have a Rayleigh probability density function. This means that the powers, i.e., squared amplitudes, have an exponential probability density function. The object here is to simulate such a variation at the complex envelope level, so that system noise (zero mean, Gaussian) can be added properly.","Any process that has a Rayleigh amplitude probability density function can arise only from a complex envelope process that is Gaussian whose real and imaginary parts have zero mean, equal variances and are statistically independent. Thus, the complex envelope process is the sum of two statistically independent, zero mean, Gaussian processes, one representing noise with variance \u03c3and the other representing the fluctuating signal with variance \u03c3. The signal-to-noise (power) ratio (SNR) is simply the ratio of these two variances.\n\nSNR=\u03c3\/\u03c3\u2003\u2003(2.1.1)\n","Some symbology is now required.\n\n()=noise complex envelope\n\n=()+()\n\nx(t) is commonly called the \u201cI\u201d component and x(t) is commonly called the \u201cQ\u201d component.

The {tilde over (y)}(t) are statistically independent, zero mean, Gaussian random variables with variance (2.1.4).\n","In all discussion to follow, the nature of y(t) may change, depending on the signal fluctuation model for the target echo signal. But the noise {tilde over (x)}(t) always has independent pulse-to-pulse fluctuations, regardless of the target fluctuation model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sub":["i ","c","i","s","i","c","i","s","i"]},"Continuing with the Swerling II model for target echo signal fluctuation, we refer to . The Swerling II model requires that, in each sequence of complex envelopes,\n\n(), 1, 2 . . . , N \u2003\u2003(2.1.6)\n\nthe terms are statistically independent Gaussian random variables as described above. This model has been described as the \u201cnoise-in-noise\u201d model. The Gaussian random variables may be created, in a simulation program, by the appropriate MATLAB program or by appropriate algebraic transformation of a sequence of pairs of uniformly distributed, statistically independent, random variables.\n","Next we consider the Swerling I model for target echo fluctuation. For the Swerling I model, we must create signal complex envelopes that show constancy in amplitude over N pulses, but vary over a group of N pulses in each group. Referring to , and the equation (2.1.2), we may index each block of N pulses with the index k:\n\nK=1, 2 . . . , M \u2003\u2003(2.2.1)\n\nwhere M is the number of groups or blocks, each block having N signal pulses that are all the same. So we may show this by writing the signal as: {tilde over (y)}(t)\n\n()=1, 2, . . . , 1, 2, . . . , M \u2003\u2003(2.2.2)\n\nwhere M is the number of blocks. As k varies, the \u00e3are chosen from a complex Gaussian process with zero mean and variance \u03c3.\n","Noncoherent integration takes place over a block of N pulse echoes and each noncoherent integration result is the test statistic that is applied to a threshold to get (or not get) a target detection. In any simulation, a large number of such threshold applications is made in order to get statistics on detection probability. That is, M must be a large number, because M is the number of Monte Carlo replications.","Next we consider the Swerling IV model target echo fluctuation. The Swerling IV fluctuation has statistical independence from pulse-to-pulse over the group of N pulses. In this case, however, the pulse-to-pulse fluctuations have a gamma (unnormalized chi-square) probability density function with four degrees of freedom or two duo-degrees of freedom in the power or squared amplitude. A different way of saying this is that the squared amplitude, or power, is the sum of two statistically independent exponentially distributed random variables. Each of these components can be looked at as a Rayleigh variate in its amplitude or envelope. The complex envelope of each component is a zero mean complex Gaussian random variable whose variance is one half of the total variance. The simulation of such a target echo, with noise, is more involved than in the case of Swerling I and II models.","There are at least three ways in which this simulation may be accomplished. If the noise was not being included in the simulated target echo signals, all of the methods would produce the same result for the chi-square (i.e., gamma) fluctuation of squared envelope. The present disclosure describes the ways for simulating the signal and the noise and combining the two to produce simulated target echo complex envelope that realistically simulates signal plus noise. The combining of the simulated signal and simulated noise takes place at the level of complex envelope.","Next we address simulating the Swerling III and Swerling IV models. The Swerling III and Swerling IV amplitude values are the square roots of a random variable that has a gamma (unnormalized chi-square) probability density function. Such a probability density has two parameters: (a) Number of degrees of freedom, and (b) Scale parameter. The gamma density can be formed from the sum of a number of squares of real Gaussian, zero mean, random variables that have the same variance. The number of degrees of freedom is the number of Gaussian random variables whose squares are the terms in the sum. It is of interest to see just how this sum operates.","Let",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03b3","M"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munder":{"mover":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"M"},"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["Z","k"],"mn":"2"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"2.3","mo":"\u2062","mi":".1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["k ","M "],"sup":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"P","msub":{"mi":["\u03b3","M"]}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"u"}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":"u","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"\/","mn":"2"}},"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"u"},"mo":"\/","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"2"}}}}},{"msup":[{"mn":"2","mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"\/","mn":"2"}},{"mi":["\u03c3","M"]}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u0393","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"\/","mn":"2"}}}}]}},{"mi":"u","mo":"\u2265","mn":"0"},{"mi":"\u03c3","mo":">","mn":"0"}],"mo":[",",","]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"2.3","mo":"\u2062","mi":".2"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"2.8em","height":"2.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"]},{"mrow":[{"mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"u","mo":"<","mn":"0"}],"mo":","}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]}]}}}},"The Swerling III and IV cases have target fluctuations that are gamma distributed with each term having 4 degrees of freedom or, as often stated, 2 duo-degrees of freedom.

Instead, we shall have to fall back on a general method of constructing the real and imaginary parts when we have a statistical description of the cross section or empirically measured cross sequences. This general method is treated below.","Before that is done, however, examine the simulations of a random fluctuation that does not fit into any of the \u201cblock correlated\u201d models described above. It must be remembered that the block correlated models were introduced as approximations to more general fluctuation than any of those described by the Swerling models. The more general Swerling, or \u201cchi-square\u201d, models that have an integral value for k, the \u201cper-pulse duo degrees of freedom\u201d, can be simulated as described so far in this report. However, other forms of fluctuation cannot be simulated by means of underlying Gaussian complex envelopes. Among them are the cases of non-integral values of k, as mentioned above. In all cases, whatever model one uses for cross section fluctuations, even those that are empirically based must be somehow reduced to a model of complex envelope fluctuations. This is necessary if the addition of noise is to be made properly. That is, noise is added to the signal at the complex envelope, if any nonlinear \u201cmixing\u201d of signal and noise is to be avoided.","(A Model Showing \u201cPartial Coherence\u201d)\u2014The term \u201cpartial coherence\u201d has been applied to those fluctuations that may exhibit pulse-to-pulse fluctuations that have some phase \u201ccoherence\u201d. Then some \u201cbuild-up\u201d of signal-to-noise ratio may be obtained by coherent integration; i.e., pulse-to-pulse addition of complex envelope or addition where the phases are included. One important purpose for this model is to determine the benefits, if any, of pulse-to-pulse coherent integration. The value of such integration, compared to noncoherent integration, is dependent on the steadiness or regularity of the pulse-to-pulse phase progression. This requires a knowledge of the pulse-to-pulse complex envelope progression.","As far as modeling of target fluctuation is concerned, it is the intrinsic variation that matters and that is what we want to model. It is not enough to describe the complex envelope variation in terms of its autocorrelation function. In order to simulate radar target echo, it is necessary to produce the pulse-to-pulse statistical probability density function. In order to determine, analytically that probability density function, description of the autocorrelation function is not enough. The underlying probability density function must be known or assumed in order to simulate the process.","(A General Complex Envelope)\u2014The assumption made here is that complex envelope is the sum of a deterministic term and a randomly varying term:\n\n()=()+(), 1, 2, . . . , \u2003\u2003(5.1.1)\n","where {tilde over (x)}(t) is a zero mean, wide sense stationary, Gaussian random process with autocorrelation function R(\u03c4). {tilde over (m)}(t) is the deterministically varying part of the complex envelope. {tilde over (m)}(t) is taken to describe the deterministic fluctuation intrinsic to the body and not due to any translational motion of its center of gravity. For example, {tilde over (m)}(t) might be taken to describe a sinusoidal or other regular variation of the body's orientation with respect to the radar. This is illustrated in . All quantities are complex envelopes. {tilde over (m)}(t) is a constant if there is no deterministic variation. The frequency characteristic of the shaping filter is proportional to the power density spectrum of {tilde over (x)}(t). {tilde over (Z)}(t) is a Gaussian sequence with statistically independent terms.","The fluctuating component {tilde over (x)}(t) has an autocorrelation function given by R(\u03c4), \u03c4=kT. This may be produced as indicated in , with a shaping filter whose input is a complex white Gaussian sequence {tilde over (Z)}(t) with statistically independent elements. (This is the same as saying \u201cwhite\u201d). The value of its variance is considered below. The transfer function H(f) has a squared magnitude proportional to the Fourier transform of R(kT). The phase of the transfer function is arbitrary. The detailed design of such a filter is a well-known procedure and will not be discussed here. However, it is important to discuss signal-to-noise ratios and this is done below.","The deterministic component {tilde over (m)}(t) may take on many forms. The simplest form is that of a constant.\n\n()=for all \u2003\u2003(5.1.2)\n\nThe next most simple form is that in which the variation is sinusoidal:\n\n()=|| exp () \u2003\u2003(5.1.3)\n","The equation (5.1.3) does not refer to any translational motion. It has only to do with the target variation around its center of gravity. For example, {tilde over (m)}(t) could describe changes in reflectivity as a result of spinning and precession. In such a case, there may be more than one frequency component. Any translational motion would be superposed on {tilde over (m)}(t). The framework of the equation (5.1.1) can be made to include the translational motion of the target by enlarging the meaning of {tilde over (m)}(t) to include the range variation caused by center of gravity motion.","(Arbitrary and Empirical Cross Sections)\u2014The problem in specifying RCS fluctuations lies in the necessity to create or simulate radar echoes together with the system noise that inevitably accompanies such echoes. At the level of observed cross section, the noise is nonlinearly \u201cmixed\u201d with echo signal and cannot then be separated. If one knows or can create RCS values and does not have information concerning complex envelope, the noise can be introduced to the echo signal by the method described below. The approach is equally applicable to the cases:\n\n","As one may see from the equation (5.1.1), our interest lies in the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation, implying that our concern is with pulse-to-pulse operations, such as pulse-to-pulse integration (coherent and\/or noncoherent). Actual pulse shapes, such as occur after pulse compression, are not of importance in the simulations considered in this report. The times of interest are iT, multiples of the repetition period T (or any other set of discrete time instants).","As we have done earlier, we denote the sequence of signal complex envelopes by\n\n(), \u2003\u2003(6.0.1)\n\nThe RCS represented by this complex envelope is proportional to\n\n|{tilde over (y)}(t)|. \u2003\u2003(6.0.2)\n\nWe denote the RCS by B(t), so we may replace the equation (6.0.2) by B(t) such that\n\nB(t)\u02dc|{tilde over (y)}(t)|. \u2003\u2003(6.0.3)\n\nWe may write the equation (6.0.1) as\n\n()=()+(). \u2003\u2003(6.0.4)\n\nThen\n\n()=()+(), \u2003\u2003(6.0.5)\n\nwhere we have replaced the proportionality in the equation (6.0.3) by the equality in the equation (6.0.5).

An example is the application of the complex envelope of signal plus noise to a bank of Doppler filters on the discrete time equivalent.

In this instance, the phase progression is applied to the signal complex envelope that has no phase progression, just the phase characteristics of its intrinsic fluctuation.\n","(Range Glint)\u2014The addition of range glint to the simulated radar echo can be made in a straightforward manner, although it may not, at first, seem possible. Range glint refers to the apparent change in range of a target of small range extent. Ordinarily if a target echo has a range extent smaller than the nominal range resolution of the wave-form, it is treated as a point scatterer. This is the basis\u2014small size\u2014that is the basis of all the target models treated here. However, no real radar target is a single point scatterer. A real radar target will consist of a number of scattering points whose relative range locations, sizes, electrical properties, etc., are generally unknown. In fact, because of multiple reflections on or in the target, the electrical length is frequently greater than the projected physical length. As the target changes its orientation with respect to the radar, these scattering points, or \u201cscattering centers\u201d, change relative positions, amplitudes and phases. The composite response, after any form of single pulse filtering (e.g., pulse compression) shows a maximum return that varies from pulse to pulse. This phenomenon is the \u201crange glint\u201d.","At any given range sampling point, the value of the echo will vary in amplitude and phase caused by the range glint. We treat the echo as a point return in our simulation. Therefore, at the point in time at which we are looking at the echo and noise, there is another perturbation arising from glint. However, this perturbation is not additive. It is multiplicative. Therefore, the effect is imposed on the signal complex envelope as a multiplication, as is the signal phase progression shown in .  illustrates the process of modeling the range glint characteristics, which is simply an extension of . Now the question arises as to the nature of the glint complex envelope. There is very little information about this although there has been some work in estimating the extent of radar glint. (See, for example, J. H. Dunn et al., \u201cPhenomena of scintillation noise in radar tracking systems\u201d, Proc. IRE, vol. 47, pp. 855-863, May 1959, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). Range glint is recognized as a random process and some information has been gathered experimentally. Dunn, et al. give a value of 0.8\u00d7object length for the rms value of the range glint variation. On the other hand, Kharilas gives a value of 0.35 L, where Lis the radial extent of the target. (See P. J. Kahrilas, Electronic Scanning Radar Systems (ESRS) Design Handbook, Dedham, Mass.: Artech House, Inc., p. 234 (1975)). Barton gives the value L\/3 (see D. K. Barton and H. R. Ward, Handbook of Radar Measurement, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall Inc. 1969; Section 6.1), which is essentially the same as that given by Kharilas quoted above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 11","br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{},{},{}],"i":["t","t","a","t","t"],"sub":["i","o","v","i","g","i","g","i"]},"If range glint is to be modeled as a random process, we need to know the probability density function of the glint. The first probability density function of range glint has been determined by Howard and Lewis (D. D. Howard and B. L. Lewis, \u201cTracking radar external range noise measurement and analysis\u201d, Naval Res. Lab. Rpt 4602, Aug. 31, 1955) and also reported by Barton and Ward. It is well approximated by a Gaussian curve. Of course, the first probability density function is insufficient to describe the process. In the absence of other information, I propose modeling the range glint process as a stationary complex Gaussian process with zero mean and statistically independent from pulse to pulse. The standard deviation of the process (same as the rms value) is to be taken as 0.35 times the physical length. Admittedly, this assumption of statistical independence is purely a guess, since I could find nothing in the literature concerning this aspect.","(Other Target Fluctuations)\u2014The set of possible target fluctuations is very large. A few of these have been so far treated in this report. In all of the models, the target has been treated as a point reflector. To consider range extended targets is beyond the scope of this except for consideration of those range extended targets whose fluctuations can be treated in terms of an equivalent point target fluctuation. An example is a target exhibiting precession and mutation with the radar range resolution interval being larger than the target's range extent. To go deeply into the subject of range extended targets is beyond the scope of this report. However, for those cases where the target may be considered as a point reflector there is one general type of fluctuation that can be simulated fairly easily; that is the case where the complex envelope fluctuation process is a wide sense stationary random process and is therefore described by its autocorrelation function having a single argument. The autocorrelation function in this case is the sum of two terms:\n\n|m|+R(\u03c4) \u2003\u2003(8.0.1)\n\nwhere m is the mean value of the complex envelope process {tilde over (y)}(t), and R(\u03c4) is the autocovariance function. The process description is not yet complete because the probability density function is not specified. Therefore, when only the autocorrelation function is given, it is common to assume that the echo sequence is a sample function of a stationary complex Gaussian process. The particular type of fluctuation that is treated here is one that can be described as the sum of a number of sinusoids with random, uncorrelated, amplitudes and initial phases. Such a type of fluctuation is a good model for such periodicities as precession and mutation.\n","Let's consider, first, a motion consisting of a single sinusoid.

These have been simulated in complex envelope so that bandpass noise could be properly added to the signal. Adding noise to the radar target echo signal at complex envelope level is preferred because that results in a more realistic noisy radar target echo signal. In the case of the Swerling targets I, II, III, IV and block correlated, the complex envelope of target echo has real and imaginary parts that are themselves Gaussian processes. Noise would be added coherently to the Gaussian complex signal envelopes and the sums would be squared and added in the appropriate fashion to get envelopes that may now be treated noncoherently, e.g., noncoherent integration.","The methods so described can be applied to any generalized chi-square cross section fluctuation with an integral number of duo-degrees of freedom. RCS fluctuations with a non-integral number of duo degrees of freedom cannot be obtained with underlying Gaussian complex envelopes; one must fall back on the general method of constructing the complex envelope when only the amplitude process is known. This is done by taking the square root of the RCS versus time, splitting the result into two parts, and multiplying by the cosine and by the sine of an arbitrary phase angle.","Such an addition of arbitrary signal phase is an expression of ignorance. Since the phase fluctuation is unknown, it is ignored and an artificial phase fluctuation is imposed. Therefore, it is preferred that, in this case, such artificially created complex envelopes be used only to get the proper insertion of noise for subsequent noncoherent operation, such as noncoherent integration and tracking. An additional perturbation that can be modeled is \u201crange glint\u201d. Range glint arises from the varying amplitudes and phases of the scattering centers of the target as it changes its orientation with respect to the radar. This effect is noted even for objects that have small range extent compared to nominal range resolution of the radar. Unlike the conventional knowledge disclosed in the literature, in which range glint is taken as additive noise, in the present disclosure range glint is modeled as a modulation or multiplicative process. Thus, the inventor has modeled range glint as a multiplicative process shown in . The present disclosure also provides a short section on simulating other target fluctuations. In particular, an outline of simulating a motion consisting of a mean value plus sinusoidal motion consisting of a number of fixed frequency components but having random starting phases is shown. Random amplitudes may also be considered. Such motions are characteristic of precession and mutation.","Although the invention has been described in terms of exemplary embodiments, it is not limited thereto.
