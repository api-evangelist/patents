title: System for controlled printing of a signature using web-based imaging
abstract: A controlled image including a predetermined graphic symbol, for example a signature on a check or other document, is produced in a web-based imaging environment. From a client program, for example a user's browser, a source service is accessed and dynamically generates under interactive control of the client program a printable version of the controlled image including the predetermined graphic symbol, which references a particular symbol set, for example a font. The printable version is referenced from a composition associated with a user's identity, e.g., an imaging store. A destination service representing a production device is accessed from the client program and then retrieves the printable version. Only if the destination service contains the particular symbol set will the controlled image be produced including the signature or other predetermined graphic symbol. Otherwise the image can be optionally produced including a substitute symbol, e.g., “VOID.”

No. 09\/924,058 entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD AND PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR MULTIUSER PROFILE OPERATIONS AND GROUP COMPOSITION STORE\u201d filed Aug. 8, 2001, the disclosures of which are all hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The invention relates to a system for printing of an image in a distributed computing environment, and more particularly to a system for controlled printing of a signature in a web-based imaging environment.","Prior art methods exist for controlled printing of signatures or related symbols, such that the image of the signature is not revealed except by printing or display of the signature at an appropriate printing or other final destination device. Existing methods use a signature font, characters from which are embedded by a special application, which are printed to devices using operating system specific drivers. These methods are cumbersome and inflexible in a network printing environment. Needed are more flexible and efficient improved methods for controlled printing of signatures and related predetermined graphic symbols in a distributed computing environment.","The present invention is directed to a system and method for printing, producing, and\/or displaying in a distributed computing environment, such as a network, of a controlled image including a predetermined graphic symbol, for example a signature on a check or other document. From a client program, for example a user's browser, a source service is accessed and dynamically generates under interactive control of the client program a printable version of the controlled image including the predetermined graphic symbol, which references a particular symbol set, for example a font. The printable version is referenced from a composition associated with a user's identity, e.g., an imaging store. A destination service representing a production device is accessed from the client program and then retrieves the printable version. Only if the destination service contains the particular symbol set will the controlled image be produced including the signature or other predetermined graphic symbol. Otherwise the image can be produced optionally through a substitute symbol set, such as one which generates the word \u201cVOID.\u201d","In some embodiments of the present invention, an accessed destination service requests a preview version of the image from the imaging store, and provides an executable content that is displayed at the client program (browser) including user selectable options specific to the production service (e.g., printer) represented by the accessed destination service and a dynamically changing image of the preview version in the context of the capabilities specific to the production device as selected by the user through the content provided in the browser display. In the latter case, if the accessed destination service does not contain the predetermined symbol set, the displayed or printed image cannot include the controlled signature but can instead display a \u201cVOID\u201d message. If the accessed destination service is an appropriate destination service containing the predetermined symbol set, the controlled signature can be displayed. Alternatively, the appropriate destination service can either display the printable image without the controlled signature, or a \u201cVOID\u201d message, or a recognizable proxy symbol signifying the presence of the predetermined symbol set without revealing the actual signature.","The following terms and acronyms are used throughout the Detailed Description:","\u201cAPI\u201d. An application programming interface (API) is a library of programmatic methods provided by a system of some kind (an example is a web-based imaging system, as in the present invention) that enables client programs (web application content operating within the browser is one example) to interact with that system. One method of creating an API is to create a library. For example, in JAVA\u2122, a library (conventionally called a jar file) is created by defining a class or classes, compiling the class or classes, and grouping the class or classes into a library. For example, the following class could be created:\n\n","That class would then be compiled with the command:\n\n","NOTE: Programs are typically stored in text files, which are \u201ccompiled\u201d in order to create \u201cobject files\u201d which contain the executable (or interpretable) instructions. In this case, the program is contained in the file BaseConversionAPI.java. The act of compiling creates a file named \u201cBaseConversionAPI.class\u201d containing instructions for a specific computing architecture (in this case the JAVA\u2122 Virtual Machine) corresponding to the program.","Next in this example, a Jar file would be created:\n\n","This command creates a \u201clibrary\u201d file containing the BaseConversionAPI class. This last step is not absolutely required. In some instances, API's are provided as simply files containing executable instructions (such as the BaseConversionAPI.class file).","References regarding the creation of API's:\n\n","Note that the API's to network services (graphic store, composition store, and user profile store, all to be discussed below) would be created to be accessible through a remote invocation technology such as CORBA, JAVA\u2122-RMI, DCOM\u2122, RPC, or SOAP. A wide variety of references are available that describe how API's can be created to be accessible through a remote invocation technology, such as one of the technologies noted above.","\u201cClient-Server\u201d. A model of interaction in a distributed system in which a program at one site sends a request to a program at another site and waits for a response. The requesting program is called the \u201cclient,\u201d and the program which responds to the request is called the \u201cserver.\u201d In the context of the World Wide Web (discussed below), the client is a \u201cWeb browser\u201d (or simply \u201cbrowser\u201d) which runs on the computer of a user; the program which responds to browser requests by serving Web pages, or other types of Web content, is commonly referred to as a \u201cWeb server.\u201d","\u201cComposition.\u201d Composition, also referred to as a \u201cgraphics composition,\u201d comprises a file with links to graphic data serviced as a single unit, i.e., a graphic. The file also usually includes information on the placement of those graphics on a sequence of canvases. It describes how to combine one or more graphics from one or more sources onto a sequence of canvasses, in a variety of different ways. The use of compositions allows multiple compositions to reference a graphic in a graphic store without having to duplicate the graphic.","\u201cComposition store\u201d. Composition store refers to a service (ideally implemented as a network service) that stores and provides access to imaging composition(s) that can be accessed by the user or web services. In this context, providing \u201caccess\u201d includes providing methods for building compositions, modifying compositions, and accessing them piecemeal. For example, a set of methods available for execution via the composition store might include the methods Get a Composition, Create a Composition, Delete a Composition, and Modify a Composition.","\u201cContent.\u201d A set of executable instructions that is served by a server to a client and that is intended to be executed by the client so as to provide the client with certain functionality. Web content refers to content that is meant to be executed by operation of a Web browser. Web content, therefore, may non-exhaustively include one or more of the following: HTML code, SGML code, XML code, XSL code, CSS code, JAVA\u2122 applet, JavaScript\u2122 and C-\u201cSharp\u201d code.","\u201cExchange infrastructure.\u201d An exchange infrastructure is a collection of services distributed throughout a network that store imaging data associated with a particular user through a user profile.","\u201cFirewall.\u201d A firewall filters out unwanted communication packets in one or more directions. By way of example, in one implementation of a firewall, requests from inside a firewall may be made to access data on the outside of the firewall, and responses to such requests are typically permitted. Communications initiated from outside the firewall to devices inside of the firewall are typically not permitted. Generally, the firewall may be implemented by a firewall proxy server that allows devices inside the firewall to pass HTTP requests to web servers outside the firewall. Obviously, other protocols may be used to implement communication through the firewall.","\u201cGeneric access instructions.\u201d A generic access instruction refers to an executable instruction that is intended to cause the executing device to generate generic access requests in order to access a set of target graphic data. These instructions call methods provided by, for example, an imaging extension, but are executing within a JVM\/JAVA\u2122 or similar environment (which the imaging extension is part of). Methods provided by the environment in which the program is executed are typically called an \u201cApplication Programming Interface\u201d (API). Note that a generic access instruction does not include the location of the target graphic data. Typically, the target graphic data is pre-selected (generally by a user) and its location is determined from information that is maintained locally within the executing device.","For purposes of this application, the term \u201cgeneric access instruction\u201d refers to an executable instruction that is intended to cause the executing device to generate generic access requests in order to access a set of target data. A generic access instruction, however, does not include the location of the target data itself and neither does the generic access requests. Importantly, the target data is pre-selected (typically by a user) and its location is determined from information that is maintained locally within the executing computer or otherwise associated with the user. For this reason, the target data for a particular computer is said to be \u201cassociated\u201d with that computer or more specifically with that user. Thus, for example, the target data that is associated with computer \u201cA\u201d is the data that computer \u201cA\u201d will access in response to a generic access instruction. The target data that is associated with computer \u201cB\u201d is the data that computer \u201cB\u201d will access in response to the identical generic access instruction.","Furthermore, in the case wherein the target data represents an image, that image is referred to herein as the \u201ctarget image.\u201d In this simplified example, it will be assumed that all generic access instructions specified by the system wide standard mentioned above are for accessing data that describes an image.","\u201cGraphic data.\u201d Graphic data refers to digital data capable of being represented as two dimensional graphics, such as a Portable Document Format (\u201cPDF\u201d) file or a Joint Photographic Experts Group (\u201cJPEG\u201d) file.","\u201cGraphic store.\u201d Graphic store refers to a network service or a storage device for storing graphics data that can be accessed by the user or other network services. The graphic store preferably accepts the graphic data in multiple standard file formats, and the graphic data is converted into these file formats when necessary depending on the implementation.","\u201cHyperlink.\u201d A navigational link from one document to another, from one portion (or component) of a document to another, or to a Web resource, such as a JAVA\u2122 applet. Typically, a hyperlink is displayed as a highlighted word or phrase that can be selected by clicking on it using a mouse to jump to the associated document or document portion or to retrieve a particular resource.","\u201cHypertext System.\u201d A computer-based informational system in which documents (and possibly other types of data entities) are linked together via hyperlinks to form a user-navigable \u201cweb.\u201d","\u201cHTML\u201d (HyperText Markup Language). A standard coding convention and set of codes for attaching presentation and linking attributes to informational content within documents. (HTML 2.0 is currently the primary standard used for generating Web documents.) During a document authoring stage, the HTML codes (referred to as \u201ctags\u201d) are embedded within the informational content of the document. When the Web document (or HTML document) is subsequently transferred from a Web server to a browser, the codes are interpreted by the browser and used to display the document. Additionally in specifying how the Web browser is to display the document, HTML tags can be used to create links to other Web documents (commonly referred to as \u201chyperlinks\u201d). For more information on HTML, see for example Ian S. Graham, The HTML Source Book, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1995 (ISBN 0471-11894-4).","\u201cHTTP\u201d (HyperText Transport Protocol). The standard World Wide Web client-server protocol used for the exchange of information (such as HTML documents, and client requests for such documents) between a browser and a Web server. HTTP includes a number of different types of messages which can be sent from the client to the server to request different types of server actions. For example, a \u201cGET\u201d message, which has the format GET <URL>, causes the server to return the document or file located at the specified URL.","\u201cImaging composition.\u201d An imaging composition comprises links to imaging data serviced as a single unit.","\u201cImaging data.\u201d Imaging data refers to digital data capable of being represented as two dimensional graphics, such as a Portable Document Format (\u201cPDF\u201d) file or a Joint Photographic Experts Group (\u201cJPEG\u201d) file.","\u201cImaging data store.\u201d Imaging data store refers to a network service or a storage device for storing imaging data that can be accessed by the user or other network services. The imaging data store preferably accepts the imaging data in multiple standard file formats, and the imaging data is converted into these file formats when necessary depending on the implementation.","\u201cInternet.\u201d A collection of interconnected or disconnected networks (public and\/or private) that are linked together by a set of standard protocols (such as TCP\/IP and HTTP) to form a global, distributed network. (While this term is intended to refer to what is now commonly known as the Internet, it is also intended to encompass variations which may be made in the future, including changes and additions to existing standard protocols.)","\u201cPDA\u201d (Personal Digital Assistant). A small hand-held computer used, for example, to write notes, track appointments, send email and browse the web with generally with far less storage capacity than a desktop computer.","\u201cPersonal imaging repository.\u201d A personal imaging repository is a conceptual term describing the exchange infrastructure used to exchange graphics composition and graphics data with web services. Users are associated with their graphics data through user profiles. It should be noted that the personal imaging repository  can represent any type or combination of data storage devices.","\u201cURL\u201d (Uniform Resource Locator). A unique address which fully specifies the location of a file or other resource on the Internet or a network. The general format of a URL is protocol: \/\/machine address: port\/path\/filename.","\u201cUser Information.\u201d User information is identification and security information used in accessing graphics composition(s) and graphics data associated with a particular user profile. It is preferably accessed either directly or indirectly through methods provided by an extension component integrated into the web browser.","\u201cUser Interface.\u201d The junction between a user and a computer program providing commands or menus through which a user communicates with a program. For example, in the client-server model defined above, the server usually generates and delivers to a client a user interface for communicating with a program operating on or controlled by the server device. Where the server is a web server, the user interface is a web page. The web page when displayed by the client device presents a user with controls for selecting options, issuing commands, and entering text. The controls displayed can take many forms. They may include push-buttons, radio buttons, text boxes, scroll bars, or pull-down menus accessible using a keyboard and\/or a pointing device such as a mouse connected to a client device. In a non-graphical environment, the controls may include command lines allowing the user to enter textual commands.","\u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d (\u201cWeb\u201d). Used herein to refer generally to both (i) a distributed collection of interlinked, user-viewable hypertext documents (commonly referred to as Web documents or Web pages) that are accessible via the Internet, and (ii) the client and server software components which provide user access to such documents using standardized Internet protocols. Currently, the primary standard protocol for allowing applications to locate and acquire Web documents is HTTP, and the Web pages are encoded using HTML. However, the terms \u201cWeb\u201d and \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d are intended to encompass WAP and WML for mobile phone web browsers, as well as other current and future markup languages and transport protocols which may be used in place of (or in addition to) HTML and HTTP.","\u201cWeb Site.\u201d A computer system that serves informational content over a network using the standard protocols of the World Wide Web. Typically, a Web site corresponds to a particular Internet domain name, such as \u201cHP.com,\u201d and includes the content associated with a particular organization. As used herein, the term is generally intended to encompass both (i) the hardware\/software server components that serve the informational content over the network, and (ii) the \u201cback end\u201d hardware\/software components, including any non-standard or specialized components, that interact with the server components to perform services for Web site users. Importantly, a Web Site can have additional functionality, for example, a Web site may have the ability to print documents, scan documents, etc.","\u201cWeb service.\u201d A web service is intended to refer to a service that is provided (at least in part) by a web server. But a web service is a broader concept than a web server. In this regard, a \u201cWeb server\u201d is a program that, using the client\/server model and the World Wide Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), serves the files that form Web pages to Web users (whose computers contain HTTP clients that forward their requests). Every computer on the Internet that contains a Web site must have a Web server program. The most popular Web servers currently are Microsoft's Internet Information Server (Internet Information Server), which comes with the Windows NT server; Netscape FastTrack\u2122 and Enterprise\u2122 servers; and Apache, a Web server for UNIX-based operating systems. Other Web servers include Novell's Web Server for users of its NetWare\u2122 operating system and IBM's family of Lotus Domino servers, primarily for IBM's OS\/390\u2122 and AS\/400\u2122 customers.","Web servers often come as part of a larger package of Internet- and intranet-related programs for serving e-mail, downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol files, and building and publishing Web pages. This larger package is referred to as the web service. Parameters for a Web server include how well it works with various operating systems and other servers, its ability to handle server-side programming, and publishing, search engines, and site building tools in the package.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","16","51","10","10","52","55","24","32","34","30","10","10","51","55","51","55","16","24","34","30","10","32","16","34","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["34","34","152","154","10","152","154","152","34","152","10","152","10","16","16","12","154","34"]},"In some embodiments of the present invention, source service  generates a set of data representing a printable version of a target image, which includes a controlled symbol referring to a predetermined symbol set.

Any other destination service  not containing the predetermined symbol set, including for example destination services accessible through imaging service , can print or display at most only a proxy symbol in place of the controlled symbol, when printing or displaying the image.

Check writing source service  typically has knowledge of but does not actually contain the predetermined symbol set. A destination service can produce or display the controlled signature accurately only if the destination service contains this predetermined symbol set. Any destination service not containing the predetermined symbol set is prevented from producing or displaying the controlled signature, but in some embodiments can produce or display a substitute graphic symbol not visually recognizable as the controlled signature. This is accomplished conventionally through the process of font substitution, in which a destination service lacking the predetermined referenced signature font or other predetermined symbol set automatically defaults to a substitute font, which it then uses to produce or display a substitute graphic symbol representing the controlled signature. In some embodiments, when the destination service attempts to produce the controlled signature using a substitute, the printed signature image will convey a message that the check is void. This occurs, for example, if the graphic symbols making up the controlled signature are interpreted in the substitute font as the characters \u201cV,\u201d \u201cO,\u201d \u201cI,\u201d \u201cD,\u201d thus spelling out the message \u201cVOID.\u201d It will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that other substitution techniques are possible.

Executable content  has minimal visible attributes, for example displaying simply a \u201cplease wait\u201d message. Executable content  then adds the printable version of check  to a graphic store at block  and references the printable version of check  from a designated composition in imaging store  at block . In some embodiments, the printable version of check  is represented by a graphic referenced by a default composition in a personal imaging repository, which is accessed by executable content  through imaging extension  indirectly managed by client program . The printable version of check  need not be stored in a particular or even in a single physical location, but can be stored at distributed physical locations within network  that are logically accessible from a personal imaging repository. Moreover, the printable version of check  can entirely or in part be nonexistent or only hypothetically existent (i.e., virtual) prior to being dynamically generated in response to a request initiated by a client program. Conversely, the printable version of check  can be dynamically generated entirely or in part by addressing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that references preexisting data.

The cycle repeats through blocks  and  until user  terminates the process at block , prints without the signature, or succeeds in accessing appropriate destination service  and printing the image complete with the signature.","As suggested above, various graphic and imaging stores, source and destination services, and\/or other functionality involved in certain embodiments and implementations of the present invention need not be localized either individually or collectively, but can be distributed throughout network . Conversely, in some embodiments certain functionalities can be combined or integrated. Illustratively a source service can be combined with a destination service, for example appropriate destination service , onto a common server machine. Similarly, in some embodiments source service and\/or destination service can run on the same PC with client program .","Broadly stated, the present invention is directed to a system and method for printing, producing, and\/or display of a controlled image represented by a set of data in a distributed computing environment such as a network. The image, representing for example a check or other document, includes a predetermined graphic symbol, which can represent a signature or other symbol of authentication, which references a predetermined symbol set such as a signature font. Alternatively, the predetermined graphic symbol can represent a string of characters, as found for example in codes. This set of data is dynamically generated by a source service such as a web-based check writing service at the request of the client program, and graphically reflects that the signature is void, but also includes information referencing the signature along with information authenticating the signature. When this set of data is accessed generally by web-based imaging applications, such as destination services representing printing, display, or other production devices, it appears to represent a void signature. However, when this set of data is accessed by a web-based imaging application containing the referenced symbol set, the actual signature is mapped onto the displayed and\/or printed image. The web-based imaging application determines this by requesting the predetermined graphic symbol individually in its symbol form (versus in the form of general two dimensional graphics).","Embodiments of the present invention provide for image generation, display, production, and storage in distributed parts of a network under remote indirect control from a client program such as a web browser through executable content accessed from distributed source and destination web services and operating through an imaging extension of the web browser. In particular the various distributed web services through the client imaging extension access an imaging store associated with a particular user ID, which can also be distributed through the network and which references a particular stored controlled image from a particular composition stored in a composition store of the imaging store. The set of image data is referenced to the imaging store after generation, and can then be accessed by destination services, including an appropriate destination service containing the predetermined symbol set and having the capability to print or produce the controlled image accurately including the signature. Alternatively, any combination of said services, clients, and imaging stores can run on a single host machine.","In some embodiments of the present invention, an accessed destination service requests a preview version of the image from the imaging store, and provides an executable content that is displayed at the client program (browser) including user selectable options specific to the production service (e.g., printer) represented by the accessed destination service and a dynamically changing image of the preview version in the context of the capabilities specific to the production device as selected by the user through the content provided in the browser display. In the latter case, if the accessed destination service does not contain the predetermined symbol set, the displayed or printed image cannot include the controlled signature but can instead display a \u201cVOID\u201d message. If the accessed destination service is an appropriate destination service containing the predetermined symbol set, the controlled signature can be displayed. Alternatively, the appropriate destination service can either display the printable image without the controlled signature, or a \u201cVOID\u201d message, or a recognizable proxy symbol signifying the presence of the predetermined symbol set without revealing the actual signature.","The system and method provide printing from a web application that is independent of the configuration of the operating system. In addition, since the print destination server can return with specific print content that relates to a selected device, the present invention allows a preview of the print job in the context of the devices and\/or services offered by the print destination server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["10","12","514","516","518","12","16","522","16","18","526","16","522","526","18","522"]},"Although the preceding description defines the user profile broadly, it should be understood that in the present embodiment each user has one personal imaging repository. A personal imaging repository will not typically be associated with groups\u2014it will typically be associated only with individuals, but could optionally allow several individuals to use the same repository. This personal imaging repository is defined by all the information and services that are relevant to performing imaging operations for the particular user. The \u201croot\u201d of a user's personal imaging repository is one or more user profiles, which are associated with the user through one or more sets of user information. The present invention is directed to implementing the concept of allowing a user's information to follow him\/her around, i.e., be accessible from a variety of different locations, both inside a firewall and outside of the firewall, as well as from a variety of different machines.","Imaging extension  is configured to respond to the execution of generic access instructions from web application content  by generating\/mapping these generic instructions to corresponding imaging client-specific commands of imaging client . However, this will happen only if user information  (containing references to the user's profiles) is available to imaging extension , to access the user's personal imaging repository .","Imaging extension  can be regarded and implemented as an application programming interface (API). The API used for imaging extension  is preferably structured in accordance with a system wide standard. The generic access instructions for example from web application content , when executed, can cause imaging extension API calls to be issued to the API in order to access the user's personal imaging repository  via imaging client-specific instructions. It will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that there are other ways (both hardware and software) to implement this same functionality. Embodiments of the present invention are not limited to any one way. In essence, imaging extension  provides means for accessing user information  and for providing an opaque interface between web application content  executing in browser  and personal imaging repository  and other functionalities of imaging client . An example implementation of the imaging extension will be discussed in more detail below.","In operation, browser  initially accesses a web site and using appropriate request commands (HTTP for the current generation of browsers), downloads web application content  therefrom, which includes a set of executable instructions intended to be executed in browser  to provide browser  with predetermined functionality. These executable instructions comprise generic access instructions (see definition above), which are system wide instructions expressed in some language (i.e., JAVA\u2122), that call the resources of an imaging extension API to access the user's personal imaging repository  to perform web imaging operations. Such generic access instructions can be, by way of example but not by way of limitation, JAVA\u2122, JavaScript\u2122, and C-sharp instructions. A system wide standard preferably manifested as an API or set of APIs typically specifies \u201cgeneric access instructions,\u201d \u201cgeneric access requests,\u201d and \u201ctarget graphics.\u201d","A variety of functionality can be provided by web application content  including, for example, executable instructions for imaging client  to display target graphics, i.e., show available graphics on the accessed web site. Another web application content can include executable instructions for displaying a print button, and if the print button is clicked, causing imaging client  to generate a print job that describes a graphic in the personal imaging repository  of the user and to transmit the print job, for example, to printer . A web application content can also provide a preview of the target graphic. Accordingly, web application content  refers to a set of executable instructions that are downloaded into browser  to perform a service requested by the user.","Browser  executes web application content , whether it is HTML interpreted and\/or executed by browser  into marks displayed on a user's display, or JAVA\u2122 and JavaScript\u2122 or some other appropriate language. As previously noted, web application content  contains executable instructions that use the API provided by imaging extension  to indirectly access the user's personal imaging repository . For example, the executable instructions of the web application content can obtain an opaque access to the information from the user's profile (in order to specify the user's personal imaging repository) by interacting with a user profile store service (not shown).","In the discussion herein, the term \u201copaque reference\u201d is used. An \u201copaque reference\u201d is a reference that does not expose information about an underlying resource. The possessor of an opaque reference is unable to determine anything about the resource from the opaque reference or to modify the opaque reference so as to alter which resource is being referenced. (In contrast, if a URL is provided, for example, \u201chttp:\/\/www.hp.com\u201d, it would be fairly straightforward for the web application content to modify the URL to refer to a different resource, for example, \u201chttp:\/\/www.other.com\u201d.)","The executable instructions of web application content  perform this access to obtain an opaque reference to the user's composition store  and graphic store . The web application content can further use the API provided by imaging extension  to add a new graphic to graphic store  via opaque reference.","Imaging extension  is configured to prevent web application content  (i.e., the executable instructions from web service ), from directly accessing arbitrary services and the user's personal imaging repository . In essence, web application content  uses imaging extension  as a gateway to access everything in the user's personal imaging repository , including the information in the user profile.","This restricted access imposed on web application content  can be implemented using a variety of methods. The designer can implement the API for imaging extension  such that the API only accepts references from web application content  that were previously provided thereto by imaging extension . In essence, web application content  is then unable to supply references arbitrarily when calling the API provided by imaging extension . Web application content  running on imaging client , in order to communicate with imaging client resources and with user's personal imaging repository , must first obtain opaque references using the API of imaging extension . For example, if web application content  wants to access graphic store , web application content  is required to call a method (provided by the API of the imaging extension ) that provides an opaque reference to graphic store . This reference can then be used in subsequent calls by web application content  to the API of imaging extension .","One approach to accomplishing this restriction is to create a session. For example, an imaging extension API for a particular operation might comprise:\n\n","Accordingly, web application content  is required to call the imaging extension API to first create a session by calling CreateParticularOperationSession, which returns a SessionID. This SessionID is subsequently used to refer to the particular session. Next, web application content  calls the PerformOperation in the imaging extension API with particular input and the SessionID. Web application content  can perform a variety of manipulations, but cannot directly access parameters and operations which are \u201cassociated\u201d with the SessionID, because the association is accomplished in a way that is \u201copaque\u201d to the client. The imaging extension API and that API alone knows how to use the SessionID to determine\/map to imaging client parameters. Often, the SessionID will be a reference such as a pointer to a data structure containing information relevant to the session. This data structure can contain parameters and other pertinent information. When web application content  has completed its operation, web application content  calls DeleteParticularOperationSession in the imaging extension API with the SessionID as a parameter. This instructs the imaging extension API to free whatever resources (such as memory) are associated with the session. Note that if web application content  changes the SessionID, that will not allow web application content  to obtain restricted parameters, but will only confuse imaging extension  with the changed previously unseen SessionID.","The API provided by imaging extension  is typically implemented as a library of methods that provide controlled access to an API provided by the network services participating in user's personal imaging repository . This API is implemented to invoke the API provided by the user profile store, composition store , and graphic store . The API provided by imaging extension  is generally not accessed through remote invocation technology, although remote invocation technology can be implemented to access the APIs provided by the network services participating in the user's personal imaging repository . The API provided by imaging extension  is not an exact replication of APIs provided by the user profile store, composition store, and graphic store, since this API provides controlled access to those network services through (among other techniques) opaque references.","From the above description, it can be seen that web application content  is prevented from using the API provided by imaging extension  to access arbitrary services. The key to this restriction is that web application content  cannot supply the addresses for these arbitrary services. Web application content  can only refer to services through opaque references provided by the imaging extension API (not exposing the actual reference\/URL to web application content ). For example, web application content  can use the API to obtain a list of opaque references to available compositions. This list of opaque references instead would map to the real references\/URLs in imaging extension , alone. Thus, in subsequently referring to these compositions, web application content  cannot supply a URL (which might be one of its own creation), because that created URL cannot map within imaging extension  to real resources. Instead, web application content  is required to use only references provided to it by the API, which make sense only in the context of the current session with that API. This restriction can be relaxed in circumstances where web application content  provides references to resources available from the same network service in which web application content  originated. This is permitted, because web application content  already has a measure of access to the web service from which it originated (either when originally generated or subsequently), thus not acquiring any special access not already available to web application content .","Browser  uses web application content  that is provided by web server . When the user selects \u201cprint\u201d in the web application content, web application content  among other things directs browser  to the print destination. Although one client machine  and two server machines ,  are shown as examples, a broader implementation can involve multiple server machines to which client machine  has access and can communicate. For better readability, a single client machine, server, production device, e.g., printer, or application has been and will be referred to and shown herein. However, it should be understood by showing only one or by the use of \u201ca\u201d that what is meant is \u201cone or more\u201d. For example, although a single printer has been and will be described and shown, this printer may actually be a plurality of printers forming a printing resource. In such a situation, it is understood that the present inventive concepts apply.","First server machine  includes first server . When browser  is directed to first server  addressed by a unique Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d), first content  is served by the first server to browser . Each content  is preconfigured with specific instructions depending on the type of service the server machine represents. Similarly, second server machine  includes a second server  with a second content . Generally, the contents ,  are different, because the services and\/or access to devices provided by the servers are different. In , first server machine  is connected to single printing device , whereas second server machine  serves multiple printing devices . Consequently, first content  and second content  are different from one another, each including separate instructions to browser .","Although it is shown that the servers represent only printing devices in this example, the server can represent other services. For example, the server can be an auction web site, such as ebay.com, which makes an auction page for the user when a graphic file is printed to the web site, or a check writing service. In embodiments of the present invention, the user can \u201cprint\u201d to any one of many services. As a result, the use of the word \u201cprint\u201d is intended to have a broad definition, which can be applied to many available devices or services. Whatever the services and\/or device the servers provide, the content can include the instructions needed for the configuration. It is advantageous that a personal imaging repository  be implemented according to the present invention, to store data that can be accessed by these servers.","In the present embodiment, personal imaging repository  includes composition store  for storing composition(s) of the imaging data that are serviced as a single unit and an graphic store , i.e., digital memory, for storing the imaging data. An imaging composition generally comprises links to the imaging data (also known as graphics), which can be located at another service or services. Accordingly, composition store  stores only the imaging compositions. Graphic store , on the other hand, is any imaging data store located on any computer that contains the graphics. More specifically, each web service can have its own graphic store  available to the public.","For example, at some earlier time a user can print an article from a web service site, resulting in an imaging composition being created and stored in the user's composition store . The imaging composition contains only the link to the graphic for this article stored for example on first web service site . Consequently, the graphic for the article is not in the graphic store  located on client machine . Rather, the graphic is stored in a graphic store  located on web service site . Users will have a graphic store  that belongs to their user identification, where they can store imaging data, which is graphic store  shown in client machine . As a result, the term \u201cpersonal imaging repository\u201d  is a conceptual term for an exchange infrastructure between the imaging data and the available web services on Internet . Similarly, the term \u201cweb\u201d denotes millions of distinct servers that comprise the web. However, the web does not actually do anything itself. In embodiments of the present invention, the servers serving composition store  and graphic store  are physical implementations of the personal imaging repository as a concept.","It should be noted that personal imaging repository  can represent any type of data storage device. In fact, the data storage device of personal imaging repository  does not necessarily have to be located with client machine . Personal imaging repository  can be located, for example, on another machine or segmented and distributed among multiple machines, which client machine  can access through Internet . Although it is frequently advantageous to include personal imaging repository  with client machine , this can change as data rates become faster and the popularity of personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d) devices increases. These alternative implementations are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5B"],"b":["560","562","564","566","568","566","570","572","574","566","574","574","562","564","570","574","562","564","570","570","572","572"]},"In operation, a first user  initially accesses system  with a login name and password. Once first user  has accessed system , the first user then also has access to the personal imaging repository  that is linked to this first user's login name. Similarly, if a second user  logs in with a login name and password, the second user has access to system , including the personal imaging repository  that belongs to this second user's login name. In this implementation, users can access system  and their personal imaging repository  from any computers that have a browser and Internet access. As a result of the flexibility of the Internet, it is possible for users to access system  and their personal imaging repository  using a standard PDA and\/or wireless web phone.","Web application content  can be used by the users through a browser  that is located on client machine . Similar to the previous implementation, web application content  is provided through web server . Browser  also contains extension  for accessing user information ,  that associate the different user profiles assigned to users ,  with their respective personal imaging repositories. User information is different from a user profile. User information references one or more user profiles associated with a particular user. As shown, each user profile has its own user information. Alternatively, the user information can also contain information for two or more user profiles. These other variations are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention.","Users can access a variety of servers on the Internet for the printing of the target data from web application content . In this example, there is first server  and second server . First server  provides first print content  representing single printing device , and second server  provides second print content  representing a plurality of printing devices .","Upon the user selecting PRINT or PRINT PREVIEW from web application content , web application content  first directs browser  to request a specific URL, which references a web page located on web server . Shown as an example in , a user creates a document using web application content , and from web application content  the user can elect to PRINT the document (i.e., the target data).","In response to receiving the request for the web page specified by the aforementioned URL, web server  constructs an imaging data of the target data. An imaging data refers to the printed output of the target data, which does not necessarily look the same as the target data, depending on the behavior of web application content . This step of constructing an imaging data may not be necessary, and depends on the implementation and configuration of the print destination. For example, if sending a graphic file to the earlier example of an auction site for making an auction page with the graphic file, an imaging data might not have to be generated. Instead, print destination server ,  can accept the target data without further modification for compatibility. However, since it is hard to foresee what type of graphic files the web site will accept, the exemplary method is implemented with the intermediate step of constructing imaging data to guarantee uniformity and compatibility. Formats for the imaging data include JPEG, Graphics Interchange Format (\u201cGIF\u201d), Portable Network Graphics Format, Tagged Image File Format (\u201cTIFF\u201d), PDF and Microsoft Windows bitmap format (\u201cBMP\u201d).","After web server  constructs the imaging data for the target data, web application content  transfers the imaging data to personal imaging repository . It is then determined whether personal imaging repository  is located on client machine  or on store server . If personal imaging repository  is located on the client machine , the imaging data is saved to personal imaging repository  without further connection. If, however, personal image repository  is located on store server , client machine  will connect to store server . It is then determined whether the connection is successful before a timeout, and client machine  will keep trying to connect to store server  until a timeout or successful connection occurs. Once the connection with store server  is successful, client machine  transfers the imaging data to store server  for storage in personal imaging repository .","After the imaging data is stored in personal imaging repository , web application content  directs browser  to the server indicated by print destination , which will be referred to as print destination server . It is next determined whether print destination server  is available for printing. An error message is sent to browser  if the print destination server  is not available. If, on the other hand, print destination server  is available, it will respond to browser  by returning a print content , which will be displayed on browser  for user configuration. Print content  is generally a web page that is designed according to the services that this print destination provides. Furthermore, there are a number of ways to implement print content , depending on the services available. For example, print content  can be configured to display a list of imaging data stored in personal imaging repository . In this scenario, print content  accesses personal imaging repository  to obtain the list for display to the user. The above described variations are contemplated and should be considered within the scope of the present invention.","As an example, if print destination server ,  represents multiple printing devices, a page of the print application content may contain all the printing devices ,  that are available for user selection. From this page of the print content the user selects a printing device, and another page is returned to the user with the imaging data and the configurations that are available for this particular printing device. Through the print content, the user is able to print or print preview the imaging data according to the configurations of printing devices . In the auction site example, users can preview the auction page that they configured before posting onto the auction list. As shown, the print content can be returned with multiple pages depending on the need of the services provided by the print destination server.","Once the user-selected configuration is finalized, the user can then select to PRINT or PRINT PREVIEW from print content . Print content  accesses the imaging data from personal imaging repository , and transfers the imaging data with the specified user configuration to print destination server , through which the imaging data is printed or displayed according to the specified configurations including selected printing device . At the end, the print content can return a status page to indicate successful output at the printing device.","Personal imaging repository  is an example of the notion of \u201cidentity.\u201d The user has a network \u201cidentity\u201d through which he\/she is represented. Personal imaging repository  contains information associated with the user's identity. The foregoing description addresses a computing environment in which imaging extension  is used to make user information available to web content ,  downloaded into browser . Imaging extension  makes information associated with the user's identity available. The primary purpose of imaging extension  is to provide access to information that is identified by user specific information , . In essence, this is a client-side approach to identifying user information.","Although it is possible to extend browsers on Windows operating systems, it becomes harder to do this for newer devices like PDAs. Consequently, it is desirable to support the notion of identity without requiring the browser to be extended. Alternatively, a server-side approach to identifying user information is possible. This can be accomplished by moving the logic normally present in web content ,  running within browser  into web server , . Rather than web content ,  accessing services specific to the user, web server ,  directly accesses services specific to the user. In other words, the identity technology is server side instead of client side.","When using server side identity technology, because browser  no longer provides information regarding a user's identity, an \u201cauthentication website\u201d can be used to provide such information. In such an arrangement, web content ,  redirects browser  to the authentication website, which determines the identity of the user and then redirects browser  back to the web content ,  with the user identity, including the location of the user's profile. For this purpose, it is assumed that all web imaging destinations have information regarding the authentication server. Once the user's identity is determined (i.e., the location of the user's profile is known), then web imaging destination can interact directly with services specific to the user, without intervention of imaging extension ."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
