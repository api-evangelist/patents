title: Method and system for generating an echocardiogram report
abstract: An echocardiogram report generation method and system are disclosed for creating a complete medical report describing an echocardiogram without dictation, transcription or typing. The report is tailored to describe an individual patient and generated in complete grammatically complex sentences in response to the user's input with a text report that is complete and understandable for a primary care physician. The method and system provides the user the parallel options of an anatomical structure approach and a disease-specific approach in order to amplify the description of the echocardiogram in specific areas and give a more meaningful report. The echo report generated by the method and system creates a table of measurements and calculations in compact form, omitting any data fields not used. The method and system guides the user through the various areas of the heart which merit comment on the report and provides clear color coded segments of the heart muscle and provides several heart segment classifications so that the user can use his favored classification scheme. Diagnostic possibilities are provided for inclusion in the report conclusions.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a computer software product for generation of a medical report. More particularly, the present invention is related to the generation of a medical report describing an echocardiogram.","The echocardiogram is a well-known diagnostic procedure that uses ultrasound to take moving pictures of the heart. It is estimated that there are over ten million echocardiograms performed annually in the United States. Among other things, the echocardiogram allows measurements of the chambers of the heart and the appearance and motion of the heart. A large amount of detailed information must be reviewed and evaluated by the interpreting physician, sometimes called an echocardiographer. Echocardiogram reports (hereinafter \u201cecho reports\u201d) are typically arranged by the different anatomical structures in the heart such as chambers or valves. On the basis of this anatomical structure approach, the echocardiographer may identify a particular condition. The echo report is then dictated or hand-written before being typed and returned to the interpreting physician for review and signature. Only then is the echo report, which must be complete and understandable, sent to the primary care physician who ordered the report. Aside from the loss of time and money in this process, the echocardiographer must review and approve a report without the benefit of the echocardiogram images in front of him for review.","In addition to the large amount of information that must be reviewed and evaluated by the echocardiographer, there are differences in opinion among echocardiographers as to the number of segments appropriate for classification of the heart muscle. For example, some use a sixteen-segment classification and others use a fifteen-segment classification.","Aside from differences in preferred classification of the heart muscle segments, the number of measurements actually taken on a particular patient is usually less than the possible number of measurements. It is also true that some areas of the heart cannot be visualized well in every patient. What this means is that many data fields may be empty and make a report longer than necessary and require additional time on the part of the evaluation physician to dictate an explanation for the missing items.","Although there have been attempts to generate echo reports by computer software, there is a need for a method or system that allows the user, having identified a specific condition by an anatomical based approach to cross reference and compare other options by a condition or disease based approach. Likewise, there is a need for a method or system which gives the user the ability to create an echo report with minimal interaction and to edit the elements of the report as selections are made or to generate a report in grammatically correct sentences that is complete and understandable for the primary care physician.","What is also needed is a method or system that can quickly and easily guide the user through the various areas of the heart with color-coded diagrams of the various segments of the heart which merit comment on the report. Likewise, what is needed is a method or system that can be easily installed in a doctor's personal computer (\u201cPC\u201d) or laptop and is suitable for both general cardiologists and echocardiographers.","The present invention is directed to a computer readable storage method and system allowing a physician to create a complete and well-organized medical report describing an echocardiogram (an echo report) without dictation, transcription or typing. The inventive method and system quickly and easily guides the doctor through the various areas of the heart which merit comment on the echo report. The inventive method and system allows the physician to create an echo report with minimal interaction and without the need to enter any measurements. However, any measurements entered by the technician can be corrected by the physician if needed.","The inventive method and system provides clear color-coded diagrams of the various named segments of the heart muscle. As there is a lack of unanimity among echocardiographers as to whether a fifteen-segment classification or a sixteen-segment classification is preferable, this invention provides each, as well as a third classification so the user can choose whichever classification scheme is desired.","In addition to the standard anatomical-based approach by which traditional echo reports are structured, the inventive method and system provides a parallel disease or condition specific section with a separate set of tabbed pages or interfaces each devoted to a specific disease entity. Thus the user, having identified the presence of a certain condition by a standard anatomical-based approach, may, if desired, shift to a specific disease-oriented page and be presented with a set of options reminding the user of all of the various possible echo findings in that disease. This gives the user the option to amplify the description of the echo in certain specific areas and give a more meaningful echo report","The inventive method and system provides a list of normal values for certain measurements of artificial heart valve functions, important to the interpretation of artificial heart valve echo studies, and also provides diagrammatic prompts to aid in the interpretation of certain Doppler echo measurements that are infrequently made but important in certain cases.","The inventive method and system collects diagnostic possibilities based on the descriptive choices made by the user and presents a list of these diagnoses, which list can be amended from a predetermined list of common cardiac conditions or with free text additions. ICD-9 codes for each diagnosis are added automatically, eliminating the time consuming and expensive stage of coding the diagnosis.","The invention is compatible with a Windows\u00ae based operating system and can be installed and used on a PC in a physician's office or in a hospital. The invention operates by controlling Microsoft Word\u00ae as its word processing output and uses Microsoft Access\u00ae as a database. The invention will also operate with Windows\u00ae 98SE and Windows\u00ae XP. It can utilize Word\u00ae 2000 or later and likewise can utilize Access\u00ae 2000 or later.","Although mainly intended for use in a PC, the invention is easily adaptable to a larger echocardiogram-processing package or can be built into an echocardiogram machine.","The invention provides graphic user interfaces (herein referred to as \u201cscreen pages\u201d or \u201cscreens\u201d) for use with any mouse-type pointing device or equally effective in a touch-screen computer, totally eliminating any mouse motion. The various sections of the echo report are shown \u201clive\u201d on the graphic user interface in the form of text in text boxes as the user's input occurs. This input is editable by the user at any stage if there are any nuances that need to be recorded. At the end of the user interface is another blank text box for additional free-text comments. In addition, a user can customize a number of check boxes with statements unique to that user which will be displayed each time the user initiates or logs in to the inventive system.","It is an object of this invention that the echo report includes a table of measurements and calculations on an individual patient, which table shall be compact and only include those measurements taken on that patient and omitting any unused data fields. In practice each patient will normally have only five to ten measurements out of a possible fifty.","It is an object of this invention that an echo report to describe an individual patient is created in complete sentences including complex sentences grammatically tailored by the software in response to the user's input.","The invention will create a final echo report instantly, allow its review immediately on the computer screen, and allow the immediate finalization of the echo report either with an electronic signature or an on-the-spot hard copy. The final product will be an ordinary Word\u00ae document, which can be sent electronically to a patient's chart or referring doctor's office.","It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a computer-implemented method of generating a medical report from an echocardiogram for a patient, comprising the steps of: creating at least one database comprising echocardiogram measurements for at least one patient; providing a user with a prompting graphical user interface to log in and gain access to said database and the echocardiogram measurements for a patient; providing the user with a start-up graphical user interface for display of echocardiogram measurements for the patient, said start-up graphical user interface having a plurality of tabbed anatomical-based graphical user interfaces pertaining to specific anatomical parts of a human heart for entry of a diagnosis by the user pertaining to any of said anatomical parts of the human heart based upon the echocardiogram measurements for the patient available in said data base;
