title: Revenue optimization for customers or customer subsets
abstract: Disclosed are various embodiments for determining discounts that optimize revenue for customers or customer subsets. Transaction records that are associated with a customer and a merchant are obtained. Each transaction record identifies a corresponding purchase of a quantity of one of multiple items by the customer from the merchant at a corresponding unit purchase price. A normalized unit purchase price is generated for each transaction record by normalizing the respective unit purchase price relative to a respective unit retail price at the time of purchase. A demand curve is generated for the customer for the items based at least in part on the transaction records and the normalized unit purchase prices. The demand curve identifies a quantity of units that the customer is predicted to purchase at a range of normalized unit purchase prices.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under grant No. 0923704 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The concept of unit elasticity in econometrics relates to changes in willingness of the seller to supply items and in the willingness of the buyer to consume items as price of the items change. Thus, if the price of an item decreases, a buyer may be willing to consume more units of the item. Conversely, if the price of the item increases, the buyer may be willing to consume fewer units of the item. By contrast, a seller of the item may be willing to supply more units of the item when the price increases and fewer units of the item when the price decreases.","The present disclosure relates to optimizing revenue to merchants for customers or subsets of customers. The purchasing behavior of customers may depend not only on price, but also on whether the price reflects a discount. Some customers may be much more likely to buy an item that is on sale versus an item that is being sold at full retail price. Other customers, by contrast, may be relatively insensitive to discounting. Such purchasing behavior patterns may be observed among customers who are similar in some way. Further, a purchasing behavior pattern may be consistent for a customer over a wide range of items from the merchant, regardless of absolute price. For example, a customer who is likely to buy a compact disc at 50% off retail may also be likely to buy a high-end stereo at 50% off retail, even though the discounted prices may differ by orders of magnitude.","Various embodiments of the present disclosure may be employed to determine pricing and\/or discounting to be offered to a customer or subset of customers in order to optimize revenue for a merchant. To this end, the econometric concept of a unit elasticity point may be applied at the level of individual merchants and customers. In various embodiments, a supply curve for the merchant and a demand curve for the customer(s) are generated, and the point of intersection corresponds to the unit elasticity point. The unit elasticity point is the point that optimizes revenue based on the willingness of a merchant to sell at that price and the willingness of a customer to buy at that price. The supply and demand curves may be computed for a portfolio of products using a normalized unit pricing structure whereby sales prices are normalized relative to the full retail prices of the items. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments. The networked environment  includes one or more computing devices  in data communication with one or more computing devices  and one or more client computing devices  by way of a network . The network  includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks.","The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example, a plurality of computing devices  together may comprise a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device  is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores  as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store , for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and\/or functional entities described below.","The components executed on the computing device , for example, include a revenue optimization service , a data import service , a data preprocessing service , and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The revenue optimization service  is executed to process various data to generate data models. The data models are employed by the revenue optimization service  to predict optimal pricing for items with the goal of maximizing revenue to the merchant. As used herein, the term \u201citem\u201d may refer to products, goods, services, software downloads, and\/or any other item that may be purchased, rented, licensed, etc. for a price.","The data import service  is executed to import various externally provided data from the computing devices  for use by the revenue optimization service  and\/or the data preprocessing service . The data preprocessing service  is an optional service that may be executed to preprocess data for use by the revenue optimization service . To this end, the data preprocessing service  may preprocess data to generate data models, normalized prices, etc. that may be used by the revenue optimization service  to predict the optimal pricing. Such preprocessing by the data preprocessing service  may occur, for example, during nights, weekends, or other times in advance of obtaining price optimization requests from clients.","The data stored in the data store  includes, for example, client data , customer records , transaction records , normalized transaction data , one or more client supply curves , one or more client demand curves , and potentially other data. The client data  includes various data relating to a client, such as a merchant, retailer, restaurant, vendor, etc. The client data  may include, for example, a client configuration , a client identifier , an industry segment identifier , data exchange preferences , and\/or other data. The client configuration  may include various parameters that control functionality and options for the client. The client identifier  corresponds to a unique identifier for the client.","The industry segment identifier  identifies an industry segment that is associated with the client. The industry segment identifier  may correspond to a standardized code for classifying business establishments under a system such as, e.g., the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, or another system. The data exchange preferences  determine whether data derived from transaction records  of the client may be shared with other clients. Such exchanges may, for example, be limited to related clients (e.g., subsidiaries, etc.), clients within an industry, clients having the same customers, and so on. The data exchange preferences  may also determine whether data derived from other clients may be used in computing data models for optimizing revenue. Such retrieved data may be industry aggregate, customer aggregate within a family of clients, customer aggregate within an industry segment, customer aggregate with no limitations, and so on.","The customer records  include information that is related to customers of the client, other than the transaction records . The customer records  may include a customer identifier , a persistent identifier , one or more demographic attributes , a customer value , privacy preferences , and\/or other data. The customer identifier  uniquely identifies the customer among other customers of the client. The persistent identifier , if present, uniquely identifies the customer among customers of multiple clients in the system. For example, a customer may have different customer identifiers  for two different merchants but the same persistent identifier  for both merchants.","The demographic attributes  include various attributes that may be associated with the customer, such as address, geographic area, zip code, neighborhood classification, age, gender, family status, income, and so on. The customer value  may represent a value of the customer to the client. For example, a long-time customer of the client who makes many purchases may have a relatively higher customer value  than a new customer who has made one purchase. The privacy preferences  of the customer may indicate, for example, who can contact the customer, who can use the data associated with the customer, and so on. In the privacy preferences , a customer may allow no data use and\/or contact, data use and\/or contact by the client only, data use and\/or contact by clients within the same client family, data use and\/or contact by any clients of the system, and\/or other settings.","The transaction records  correspond to records of purchases, rentals, licenses, and\/or other transactions between a customer and a client. Although the term \u201cpurchase\u201d is used herein, it is understood to encompass similar types of transactions, which could include rentals, licenses, etc. Each transaction record  may include, for example, a gross purchase amount , a net purchase amount , one or more items purchased , a customer identifier , a client identifier , a date\/time  of the transaction, and\/or other data. The gross purchase amount  represents a purchase amount (e.g., full retail price) before any discount amount has been subtracted. The net purchase amount  represents the purchase price actually paid by the customer after all applicable discounts.","The items purchased  identifies the item(s) purchased by the customer through the transaction. The item(s) may be identified by a stock keeping unit (SKU) or other identifier. In some embodiments, each purchase of a quantity of a different item within a transaction may be reflected in a respective transaction record . The customer identifier  may include a customer identifier  of the customer in the transaction for the client. The customer identifier  may also include a persistent identifier  associated with the customer. The client identifier  corresponds to a client identifier  of the client in the transaction. The date\/time  corresponds to the time when the transaction occurred or was processed.","The normalized transaction data  refers to data generated from the transaction records  that normalizes the net purchase amount  of the transaction record  relative to the gross purchase amount . In one embodiment, the normalized unit purchase price in the normalized transaction data  corresponds to a standardized percent of retail. As a non-limiting example, where there is no discount and the net purchase amount  equals the gross purchase amount , the normalized unit purchase price may be 1.00. As another non-limiting example, where there is a 25% discount, the gross purchase amount  is $100, and the net purchase amount  is $75, the normalized unit purchase price may be 0.75.","The client supply curve  corresponds to a quantity of items that a client is willing to supply at a range of normalized unit purchase prices. In one embodiment, the client supply curve  may be determined from the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"E","mrow":{"mi":["x","y"],"mo":","}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"x","mn":"2"},{"mi":"x","mn":"1"}],"mo":"-"},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"x","mn":"1"},{"mi":"x","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\/","mn":"2"}]}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"y","mn":"2"},{"mi":"y","mn":"1"}],"mo":"-"},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"y","mn":"1"},{"mi":"y","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\/","mn":"2"}]}}],"mo":"\/"}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":"1 ","b":["142","142"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"E","mrow":{"mi":["x","y"],"mo":","}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"x","mn":"2"},{"mi":"x","mn":"1"}],"mo":"-"},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"x","mn":"1"},{"mi":"x","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\/","mn":"2"}]}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"y","mn":"2"},{"mi":"y","mn":"1"}],"mo":"-"},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"y","mn":"1"},{"mi":"y","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\/","mn":"2"}]}}],"mo":"\/"}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":"1 "},"The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements.

Also, various data is stored in a data store that is accessible to the computing device . The components executed on the computing device , for example, include an external data provider  and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The external data provider  is executed to supply data to the data import service  that may be used in generating the client data , the customer records , the transaction records , and\/or other data. In various embodiments, the external data provider  may be controlled by the client or an entity other than the entity controlling the computing device .","The client computing device  is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client computing device  may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, set-top boxes, music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, electronic book readers, or other devices with like capability.

The client application  is executed to issue commands and\/or configure the operation of the revenue optimization service . Additionally, the client application  may be configured to render a visual display on the display  to visualize the results provided by the revenue optimization service. To this end, the client application  may comprise a user interface. In one embodiment, the client application  includes a browser that is executed to access and render network pages, such as web pages, or other network content served up by the computing device  and\/or other servers.

It is understood that in other embodiments of the networked environment , the client computing device  may also include the functionality shown in computing device .","Referring next to , shown is a diagram  illustrating the intersections of a supply curve S with demand curves Dand Das employed by a revenue optimization service  () executed in a computing device  () in the networked environment  () according to various embodiments. The diagram  is shown with quantity on the x-axis and price on the y-axis, as is the convention with such graphs in the field of economics. The supply curve S corresponds to the client supply curve  (), which shows a quantity of items that a client is willing to supply at a range of normalized unit purchase prices. The demand curves Dand Dcorrespond to client demand curves  () for any of the customers of the client, where the demand curve Dprecedes demand curve Din time.","The revenue optimization service  is configured to establish the consumption of the customer by examining the actual price and quantity at which items are purchased.

To begin, a merchant (referred to herein as a \u201cclient\u201d) transfers transaction records  to the computing device  via the data import service  or by upload through the client application  over the network . Additional data may be imported by the data import service  from one or more external data providers  over the network . The data import service  and\/or the data preprocessing service  may establish the record structure within the data store  and\/or generate other data in the data store .","The client initiates a profile optimization request to determine an optimized discount for an item or group of items. The profile optimization request is sent from the client application  to the revenue optimization service . A set of transaction records  is determined for a customer or subset of customers for transactions occurring within an observed time period. The transaction records  may relate to one item or all items in a portfolio of items offered for sale by the client.","In various embodiments, the revenue optimization service  may determine whether the set of transaction records  is statistically sufficient. If not sufficient, the set of transaction records  may be augmented to include other transaction records  from other merchants within the same industry segment as the client. Sufficiency may be determined based, for example, on whether the quantity of transaction records  meets a minimum threshold, whether the quantity of unique items described by the transaction records  meets a minimum threshold, and\/or on other criteria. The set of transaction records  may also be augmented to include other transaction records  associated with other customers of the client that have similar characteristics to the customer or subset of customers.","The revenue optimization service  generates or obtains a normalized unit purchase price for each of the transaction records  by normalizing the respective unit purchase price (i.e., the net purchase amounts ) relative to a respective unit retail price at a time of purchase (i.e., the gross purchase amounts ).
