{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Conventional enterprise software systems receive, generate and store data related to many aspects of a business enterprise. In some implementations, this data may relate to marketing, sales, customer relations, supplier relations, inventory, human resources, and\/or finances. Reporting tools are commonly used to collect and present enterprise data in a coherent manner. Reporting tools may therefore facilitate and improve business enterprise decision-making.","Reporting tools typically allow a user to create a report specification. A report specification defines the layout of report elements (e.g., sections, tables, columns, rows, header, footer, etc.) and the data which is to populate the report elements. When a report is requested, the tools generate a populated report based on stored enterprise data and the report specification. If the relevant data changes, a subsequently-generated report will include the changed data.","For most users, the reporting interface is the primary, if not exclusive, interface to the stored enterprise data. It would be beneficial to leverage this well-known and well-used reporting metaphor to provide mechanisms for modifying the stored enterprise data.","The following description is provided to enable any person in the art to make and use the described embodiments and sets forth the best mode contemplated for carrying out some embodiments. Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"Report  includes sections  and .

Accordingly, the \u201cYear\u201d dimension is the context of cell .","Section  includes table , which in turn includes column  and column . Table  is nested within section  and within section . Accordingly, the context of table  (and of columns  and ) includes the \u201cYear\u201d dimension of section  and the \u201cCity\u201d dimension of section .","Each illustrated element of report template  can generally be referred to as a contextual report element because the data which is to populate each element is dependent upon the context(s) associated with each element. Some embodiments may employ other report elements that are or will be known in the art. Contextual report elements are not limited to the types and arrangements shown in .","Report template  also includes submission controls ,  and . Submission control  is associated with the context of section , submission control  is associated with the context of section , and submission control  is associated with the context of table .

Specifically, table A includes Sales, Revenue data for New York in 2008, and table B includes Sales, Revenue data for Chicago in 2008. The data may be populated upon generation of report  and\/or by a user who has input the data into one or more fields.","Report  includes submission controls , A, B, A, A, B and B associated with similarly-numbered ones of submission controls ,  and . As described above, each submission control is associated with a same service and various report elements of report  are associated with respective input parameters (i.e., Sales, City and Year) of the service. As also described above, the specific data passed to the service upon selection of one of submission controls , A, B, A, A, B and B depends on the context in which the selected control resides.","For example, selection of any one of submission controls A, A, B and B invokes the associated service and passes the associated year (2008), the one associated city (New York or Chicago) and the one associated salesperson (Bill, John, Jill or Joe) as input parameters to the service. In contrast, selection of submission controls A invokes the service with the associated year (2008), the associated city (New York) and all associated sales (Bill, John) as input parameters. Lastly, selection of submission control  invokes the associated service and passes the associated year (2008), all cities (New York and Chicago) and all sales per city as input parameters to the service.

The user has also entered a name \u201cUpdate Budget Limit\u201d to associate with the selected write back service.","The write back service is associated with the current contextual report specification at  upon selection of OK button . Moreover, a named instance (i.e., named \u201cUpdate Budget Limit\u201d) of the write back service is created and associated with the report specification at . The named service instance may be stored in repository .  shows the created named service instance within panel , as well as its associated input parameters (e.g., determined from the Catalog of Web Services ).","At , an element of a report section is associated with an input parameter of the named instance of the service. The element is associated with a data dimension and with a context of the report section.  illustrates selection of the Country column of table  at .

Window  also displays the input parameters of each named service instance and their parameter types. In some embodiments, window  does not display those service instances of panel  which are already associated with another block of the report specification, or which are associated with parameter types that are each incompatible with the selected report element (e.g., a list parameter in a case that the selected element is a free cell). In the present example, the selected report element (i.e., Country column ) is mapped to the input parameter \u201cCountry\u201d of the \u201cUpdate Budget Limit\u201d service instance.","Next, at , it is determined whether more input parameters of the created named service instance are to be associated with report elements. If so, flow cycles between  and  as additional report elements are associated with (i.e., mapped to) respective input parameters. For example,  illustrate two of such cycles. Particularly,  illustrate the association of Year cell  with the Year input parameter of the named service instance, and the association of the Limit column  of table  with the Limit input parameter of the named service instance. According to some embodiments, input parameter types that are incompatible with a selected report element may be unselectable (e.g., greyed out).","Flow proceeds to  once the determination at  is negative. A submission control of the report specification is associated with the named service instance at . For example,  illustrates right-clicking on the Update Limit buttons  of table  and selection of the \u201cBind Cell to Form\u201d context menu option. Unlike selection of the same menu option with respect to the other report elements, selection of the \u201cBind Cell to Form\u201d menu option with respect to a button results in display of window  of . Window  allows association of the selected buttons with the named service instance \u201cUpdate Budget Limit\u201d.","Accordingly, selection of an \u201cUpdate Limit\u201d button of a particular row of table  will cause invocation of the named service instance, with the Year of Year cell , the Country specified in the particular row, and the Limit specified in the particular row as input parameters. According to some embodiments, a similar button might be placed in the area above table  and also associated with the named service instance as described above. Selection of such a button will cause invocation of the named service instance, with the Year of Year cell , each Country of table , and the Limit associated with each country as input parameters. Therefore, although both invocations utilize the same input parameter-to-report element bindings, the context in which the submission control resides may determine the type of data passed to the service. The associations of process  may be stored in the current report specification as metadata relating to each block of the report specification.  is a flow diagram of process  to generate a report output based on such a report specification according to some embodiments.","A contextual report specification is identified at . For example, browsing client  may access UI portal  and request a report, and a report specification associated with the report may be identified at  in response. The identified report specification is associated with a write back service and specifies a report structure hierarchy including an element associated with an input parameter of the service. Accordingly, the identified report specification may comprise a report specification generated according to process , but embodiments are not limited thereto.","Next, at , data is determined corresponding to elements of the report structure hierarchy. As is known in the art, report engine  may determine data from data sources  with which to populate contextual report elements based on the identified specification. In some embodiments, data is determined at  for the report element associated with an input parameter of the write back service.","A script is generated at  to invoke the write back service. The script may comprise any code (e.g., Javascript) that is executable by a suitable execution engine. The script is executable to invoke the write back service, and to include contents of the above-mentioned report element as an input parameter of the write back service. Generation of the script is based on the report specification which, as described with respect to process , specifies associations between the various input parameters of the write back service and the report elements, as well as a submission control of the report that is associated with the write back service.","A report output is generated at  based on the report structure hierarchy, the determined data, and the generated script. More specifically, the physical layout of the report elements may be generated based on the hierarchy, the data may be used to populate the elements, and the script may be placed in a suitable portion of the report output (e.g., at the end).
