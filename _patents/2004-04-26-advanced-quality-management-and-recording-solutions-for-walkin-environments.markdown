Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to capturing, storing, and retrieving synchronized voice, screen and video interactions, in general and to advanced methods for recording interactions for Customer Experience Management (CEM) and for quality management (QM) purposes, in particular.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","A major portion of the interaction between a modern business and its customers are conducted via the Call Center or Contact Center. These somewhat overlapping terms relate to a business unit which manages and maintains interactions with the business' customers and prospects, whether via means of phone in the case of the Call Center and\/or through computer-based media such as e-mail, web chat, collaborative browsing, shared whiteboards, Voice over IP (VOIP), etc. These electronic media have transformed the Call Center into a Contact Center handling not only traditional phone calls, but also complete multimedia contacts. Recording digital voice, data and sometimes video is common practice in Call Centers and Contact Centers as well as in trading floors and in bank branches. Such recordings are typically used for compliance purposes, when such recording of the interactions is required by law or other means of regulation, risk management, limiting the businesses' legal exposure due to false allegations regarding the content of the interaction or for quality assurance using the re-creation of the interaction to evaluate an agent's performance. Current systems are focused on recording phone calls such as Voice, VoIP and computer based interactions with customers such as e-mails, chat sessions, collaborative browsing and the like, but are failing to address the recording of the most common interactions, those done in walk-in environments where the customer has a frontal, face-to-face, interaction with a representative. This solution refers to any kind of frontal, face to face point of sale or service from service centers through branch banks, fast food counters and the like. Present systems do not provide the ability to use a recording device in a walk-in environment. The basis for a recording of an interaction includes an identified beginning and end. Phone call, email handling and web collaboration sessions all have a defined beginning and end that can be identified easily. Furthermore, most technological logging platforms enable the capturing of interactions and thus are able to provide additional information about the interaction. In frontal center there are no means of reporting of beginning and end of interactions, nor the ability to gain additional information about the interaction that would enable one to associate this \u201cadditional information\u201d to it and to act on it. In referring to \u201cadditional information\u201d we refer to information such as indication concerning the customer's identity, how long the customer has been waiting in line to be served, what service the customer intended to discuss when reaching the agent, and the like. Such information is readily available and commonly used in recording phone calls and can be obtained by CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) information or CDR\/SMDR (Call Detail Reporting\/Station Message Details Recording) connectivity. The walk-in environment is inherently characterized by people seeking service that come and leave according to a queue and there is no enabling platform for the communication. Additional aspect of the problem is the fact that the interaction in a walk-in environment has a visual aspect, which currently does not typically exist in remote communications discussed above. The visual, face-to-face interaction between agents and customers or others is important in this environment and therefore should be recorded too. The present solution deals with the described problems by solving the obstacles presented, providing a method for face-to-face recording, storing and retrieval, organization will be able to provide solutions to enforce quality management, exercise business analytic techniques and as direct consequence enhance quality of services in its remote branches. The accurate assessment of the quality of the agent's performance is quite important. The person skilled in the art will therefore appreciate that there is therefore a need for a simple new and novel method for capturing and analyzing Walk-in, face-to-face interaction for quality management purposes.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel method and system for capturing, logging and retrieving face-to-face (frontal) interactions for the purpose of further analysis, by overcoming known technological obstacles characterizing the commonly known \u201cWalk-in\u201d environments.","In accordance with the present invention, there is thus provided a system for capturing face-to-face interaction comprising interaction capturing and storage unit, microphones (wired or wireless) devices located near the parties interacting and optionally one (or more) video camera. The system interaction capture and storage unit further comprises of at least a voice capture, storage and retrieval component and optionally a screen capture and storage component for screen shot and screen events interaction capturing, storing and retrieval, video capture and storage component for capturing, storing and retrieval of the visual streaming video interaction. In addition a database component in which information regarding the interaction is stored for later analysis is required, non-limiting example is interaction information to be evaluated by team leaders and supervisors. The database holds additional metadata related to the interaction and any information gathered from external source, non-limiting example is information gathered from a 3party such as from Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application, Queue Management System, Work Force Management Application and the like. The database component can be an SQL database with drivers used to gather this data from surrounding databases and components and insert this data into the database.","In accordance with the present invention a variation system would be a system in which the capture and storage elements are separated and interconnected over a LAN\/WAN or any other IP based network. In such an implementation the capture component is located at the location at which the interaction takes place. The storage component can either be located at the same location or be centralized at another location covering multiple walk-in environments (branches). The transfer of content (voice, screen or other media) from the capture component to the storage component can either be based on proprietary protocols such as but not limiting to a unique packaging of RTP packets for the voice or based on standard protocols such as H.323 for VoIP.","In accordance with the present invention, there is also provided a method for collecting or generating information in a CTI less or CDR feed less \u201cwalk-in\u201d environment for separating the media stream into interactions representing independent customer interactions and for generating additional data known as metadata describing the call. The metadata typically, provides additional data to describe the interactions entry in the database of recorded interactions enabling fast location of a specific interaction and to derive recording decisions and flagging of interactions based on this data (a non-limiting example is a random or rule based selection of interaction to be recorded or flagged for the purpose of quality management).","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for capturing, storing and retrieving face-to-face interactions in walk-in environments for the purpose of further analysis, the apparatus comprising a device for capturing and storing at least one face to face interaction captured in the presence of the parties to the interaction; and a database for storing data and metadata information associated with the face-to-face interaction captured. The device for capturing the at least one interaction comprises a microphone for obtaining interaction audio and for generating signals representative of the interaction audio and for relaying the signals representative of the interaction audio to a telephone line; a device connected between the microphone and a telephone line for gain and impedance matching and for detecting an on-hook state and an off-hook state of a telephone handset associated with the telephone line; and a voice capture and storage unit connected to the telephone line for capturing voice represented by the analog signals and for storing the captured voice. The voice capture and storage unit can further comprise a voice operated switch for minimizing interference when no interaction recording is taking place and for triggering energy-driven voice recording. The apparatus can further comprise a digital unit connected between the microphone and the telephone line for converting analog signals representative of the interaction audio to digital signals and for transmitting the converted digital signals to the telephone line in a pre-defined time slot when an associated telephone handset is in on-hook state, and for discarding the converted digital signals or mixing the converted digital signals with digital signals from the telephone handset when the associated telephone handset is in off-hook state. The apparatus can further comprise a camera having pan-tilt-zoom adjustment actuators and controlled by a camera selector mechanism and linked to an on-line pant-tilt-zoom adjustment control mechanism, installed in pre-defined locations configured to provide visual covering of a physical service location holding a potentially recordable interaction; a list of physical service locations associated with the camera; and a camera selector mechanism for determining the status of the camera and for selecting a camera to cover the physical service location. The apparatus further comprises a pan-tilt-zoom parameter associated with the physical service location for providing a pan-tilt-zoom adjustment parameter value. The pan-tilt-zoom parameter comprises the spatial definition of the physical service location. The pan-tilt-zoom adjustment parameter comprises the movement required to change the camera's position, tilt or pan to allow capture of the at least one physical service location. The camera selector can de-assign the camera from the physical service location. The device for capturing and storing comprises a frequency division multiplexing unit for receiving signals representing interaction data from the interaction input device and for multiplexing the input signals and for transmitting the multiplexed signals to a capture and storage unit.","The device for capturing and storing can further comprise a computing device having two input channels for receiving interaction video from one or more cameras and for relaying the interaction video from the two cameras to a processor unit. The device for capturing and storing can also comprise a voice sampler data device associated with an interaction participant for identifying the interaction participant by comparing the captured voice of the participant with the voice sampler data. The device for capturing and storing can also comprises a volume detector device located at an interaction location and for detecting the presence of an interaction participant and the absence of an interaction participant. The detecting the presence or the absence of an interaction participant, provides interaction beginning determination and interaction termination determination. The apparatus further comprises an audio content analyzer applied to a recording plurality of interactions for segmenting the recording plurality of interactions into separate interactions or segments. The audio content analyzer identifies a verbal phrase or word characteristic to the beginning portion of an interaction or segment, said verbal phrase or word is defined as the beginning of the interaction or segment. The audio content analyzer identifies a verbal phrase or word characteristic to the ending portion of an interaction or segment, said verbal phrase or word is defined as the termination point of the interaction or segment.","The device for capturing and storing can also comprise an audio content analyzer applied to a recording of an interaction for identifying the interaction participants; an audio processing unit connected to the interaction input device for generating a digital representation of the voices of the interaction participants; and an audio filtering unit applied to the recording of the interaction for eliminating the ambient noise from the interaction recording.","The device for capturing and storing can also comprise a first audio input device associated with a customer service representative for capturing a first interaction audio data generated during a face-to-face interaction; a second audio input device associated with a customer for capturing a second interaction audio data generated during a face-to-face interaction; and a computing device for receiving the interaction audio data captured by the first and second audio input devices, and for identifying the interaction participants by comparing the first and second interaction audio data generated during a face-to-face interaction with previously stored audio files. The computing device further comprises an audio processor for generating a representation for the audio relayed from the first and second audio input devices to be compared with previous audio files representative of the audio files generated previously by the participants.","The device for capturing and storing can also comprise two cameras installed at an interaction location having pan-tilt-zoom movement capabilities and linked to a pan-tilt-zoom adjustment controller for providing visual covering of the interaction area and for locating an object in the interaction location space and for tracking an object in the interaction location space; and one or more microphones installed at the interaction location for audio covering of the interaction area. The two cameras installed at an interaction location are connected to an object location and microphone controller unit for directing said cameras to a predetermined service location. The object location and microphone controller unit comprises a visual object locator and movement monitor for locating an object within the service location and for tracking said object within the service location and for controlling the capture of audio and video of an interaction associated with said object. The object location and microphone controller unit comprises a service location file, a camera location file and a microphone location file. The object location and microphone controller unit can comprise a camera controller for controlling said cameras, a microphone controller for controlling said microphone, and a microphone selector to select a microphone located adjacent or within the service location.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for metadata gathering in walk-in environments, the method comprising determining the beginning and ending of an interaction associated with a face-to-face interaction; and generating and storing data or metadata information associated with the face-to-face interaction captured. The method further comprises the steps of obtaining interaction audio by one or more microphones; generating signals representing the interaction audio; feeding the signals representing the interaction audio to a telephone line; detecting an on-hook state and an off-hook state of a telephone handset associated with the telephone line by an active unit installed between the at least one microphone and the telephone line; and relaying the signals from the active unit through the telephone line to a voice capture and storage unit. The voice capturing and voice storage is triggered by a voice operated switch associated with the voice capturing and storage unit. The method further comprises the steps of converting the analog signals representing interaction audio to digital signals by a digital unit connected between the at least one microphone and the telephone line; transmitting the converted digital signals to the telephone line in a pre-defined time slot; when the telephone handset associated with the telephone line in an on-hook state. The method further comprises the step of discarding the converted digital signals or mixing the converted digital signals with digital signals from the telephone handset when the telephone handset associated with the telephone line is in an off-hook state. The method further comprises the steps of obtaining a list of physical service positions associated with one or more camera; selecting a camera not in use and not out of order for the required record-on-demand task; loading pan-tilt-zoom parameters pertaining to the physical service position; and re-directing the spatially the view of the camera to the physical service position by the operation of the pan-tilt-zoom adjustment actuators. The method further comprises the steps of locating and selecting an in-use camera suitable for the performance of the recording-on-demand; and re-directing the view of the located camera toward the required physical service position through the operation of the pan-tilt-zoom actuators. The method further comprises the steps of relaying signals representing interaction data from one or more interaction input device to a frequency division multiplexing unit; and multiplexing the signals representing interaction data into a combined signal wherein signals associated with a specific interaction input device are characterized by being modulated into a pre-defined frequency band. The method further comprises the step of relaying two or more signals representing interaction video from two or more cameras via two or more input channels into a processing unit. The method further comprises the steps of searching a pre-recorded voice sample bank for the presence of a pre-recorded voice sample matching the interaction participant voice sample; matching the pre-recorded voice sample to the interaction participant voice sample; and obtaining the details of the interaction participant associated with the pre-recorded voice sample. The method further comprises the step of sampling interaction audio obtained by one or more microphones to obtain an interaction participant voice sample. The voice sample bank is preferably generated dynamically during the performance of an interaction consequent to the extraction of interaction audio associated with the interaction participant and by the integration of interaction participant-specific customer relationship management information.","The method further comprises the steps of detecting the presence and the absence of an interaction participant at a service location; and submitting a command to begin an interaction recording in accordance with the presence or absence of the interaction participant. The method can further comprise the steps of receiving a captured stream of interaction audio; identifying verbal phrases or words where the phrases and the words are characterized by the location thereof in the beginning portion of an interaction; identifying verbal phrases or words where the phrases and the words are characterized by the location thereof in the terminating portion of an interaction; and segmenting the recorded stream of the interaction audio into distinct separate identifiable interactions based on the characteristics of the identified verbal phrases. The method can also further comprise the step of identifying an interaction participant by determining who is the customer service representative from a previously provided voice file and the customer as the non-customer service representation or from the content of the interaction; generating a digital representation of the voice of the interaction participant; and eliminating ambient noise from the interaction recording consequent to the selective separation of the identified interaction participant voice. Finally, the method can comprise the steps of locating an object in an interaction location space by one or more cameras; tracking the located object in the interaction location space by the one or more camera; and generating microphone activation commands for the one or more microphone based on the tracked object location data provided by the at least one camera.","The present invention is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/488,686 which was the national stage International Application No. PCT\/IL02\/007412, filed 5 Sep. 2002, which claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/317,150 filed Sep. 6, 2001. The present invention disclosed a new methods and system for capturing, storing, retrieving face-to-face interactions for the purpose of quality management in Walk-in environment.","The proposed solution utilizes a set of recording and information gathering methods and systems, for creating a system solution for walk-in environments that will enable organizations to record retrieve and evaluate the frontal interactions with their customers. Such face-to-face interactions might be interactions that customers experience on a daily bases such as in fast food counters, banking, point of sale and the like.","The present invention will be understood and appreciated from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawing of  which is a high-level diagram solution for walk-in centers is shown. The system  describes a process flow, starting from the face-to-face interaction between parties and ending in an application that benefit from all the recorded, processed and analyzed information. The agent  and the customer  are representing the parties engaged in the interaction . Interaction  is candidate for further capture and evaluation. Interaction , in the context of the present embodiment, is any stream of information exchanged between the parties during face-to-face communication session whether voice captured by microphones, computer information captured by screen shots from the agent's workstation or visual gestures captured by video from cameras. The system includes interaction capture and storage unit  which includes at least one voice capture and storage component  for voice interaction capturing, storing and retrieval as a non-limiting example NiceLog by NICE Systems Ltd. of R'annana, Israel, and optionally one or more screen capture and storage components  for screen shot and screen events interaction capturing, storing and retrieval such as a non limiting example NiceScreen by NICE Systems Ltd. of Raanana, Israel, one or more video capture and storage component  for capturing, storing and retrieval of the visual streaming video interaction coming from one, or more, video camera , a non-limiting example such as NiceVision by NICE Systems Ltd., and a database component  in which information regarding the interaction is stored for later query and analysis as non-limiting example NicCLS by NICE Systems Ltd. of Raanana, Israel. A variant or alternative solution for the purpose of branch recording is where the capture and storage elements are separated and interconnected over a LAN\/WAN or any other IP based local area or wide area network or other network. In such an implementation the capture component is located at the location at which the interaction takes place. Capture can be performed directly from the LAN\/WAN. The storage component, which includes the database component , can either be located at the same location or be centralized at another location covering multiple walk-in environments or branches. The transfer of content voice, screen or other media from the capture component to the storage component can either be based on proprietary protocols such as a unique packaging of RTP packets for the voice or based on standard protocols such as H.323 for VoIP and the like. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the recording of the interaction can be performed directly from the packets transferred over the LAN\/WAN by directly capturing the packets and recording such packets to a recording device.","In order to capture the voice, two or more audio recording devices \u2032, \u2033, such as omni-directional microphones, are installed such as to be directed to both side of the interaction, or to the agent , and the customer , respectively. Alternately, a single bi-directional or omni-directional microphone may be used. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that any number of microphone devices may be used to capture the interaction, although for cost considerations one or two microphones would be the preferred embodiment. Once captured voice, screen and video recordings are stored in an Interaction capture and storage unit , the information is stored in a database  and may either be recreated for purposes such as dispute resolution or be further evaluated by team leaders and supervisors  using for example by the NiceUniverse application suite by NICE Systems Ltd. of Raanana, Israel. The suggested solution enables capturing of the interaction with microphones \u2032, \u2033 and video cameras  located in the walk-in service center. It should be noted that the video , voice  and the screen  capture and storage components are synchronized by continuously synchronizing their clocks using any time synchronization method for example by using as a non limiting example the NTP\u2014Network Time Protocol or IRIG-B.","The capture of the interaction and its transfer to the interaction capture and storage unit  would typically require a personal computer or like computing device to be located at the location of capture. Such solution is provided in call centers. This personal computer is ordinarily equipped with a connection to the microphones \u2032, \u2033 and coverts the voice recorded into digital data via a modem device (not shown) and transfers the same to the voice capture and storage units , . In cases where the walk-in center representatives are not equipped with personal computers or like devices, the deployment of a walk-in center interaction capture system would be prohibitive since a new computer would have to be supplied to each representative. In addition, additional wiring installation would have to be installed normally at a significant cost.","Referring now to  showing the transfer of interaction audio from an interaction location to a voice capture and storage unit utilizing a telephone line. The present invention provides a simple and cheap solution that is shown in  by providing an active analog\/digital unit  for relaying the capture of the interaction on existing telephone lines to the voice capture and storage unit . By using the device , an interaction can be captured and recorded without the need for new wiring, or new computer platforms to be installed at the walk-in center. For example, the installation and wiring of category  cables within some walk-in environments could be cost prohibitive and likewise the purchase of a new computer to every representative providing service, especially where telephones and telephone lines already exist.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["32","34","36","40","42","52","40","40","44","46","48","32","36","36","36","32","34","52","40","32","34","52","32","34","40","48","40","36","44","32","34","40","36","36","36","36","32","34","36","36","42","46","40","52","52","36","32","34","32","34","36","36","32","34","36","44","40","40","32","34","40","32","34","36","36","36","32","34","32","34","36"]},"Businesses operating in walk-in environments are often required or forced to visually record specific interactions \u201con-demand\u201d. Diverse reasons exist that necessitate the recording of a specific type of transactions or of the recording of transactions involving specific customers. Typically such reasons involve unlawful or extreme behavior from the part of the interaction participants. For example, a recording-on-demand could be initiated in order to verify the conduct of a transaction where a suspicion of potentially fraudulent behavior exists. A similar requirement could arise in case of potentially threatening, violent and malicious behavior. Even in ordinary settings recording of the interaction environment can be helpful for quality management and review of the interactions performed.","Providing effective visual recordings of an interaction requires the deployment of an at least one video camera in positions for which a potential recording-on-demand could be initiated. The massive deployment of separate dedicated video cameras in every potential \u201crecording-on-demand\u201d (ROD) position is substantially wasteful both financially and operatively.","To enable an ROD suitable environment one or more video cameras are deployed that can cover positions which would necessitate recording. In most walk-in environments security cameras can be connected to the system of the present invention to offer coverage without additional installations. One camera can be positioned to cover more than one representative or customer to conserve on purchase and installation costs. Referring now to  that shows the components in the execution of the recording-on-demand (ROD) option during a face-to-face interaction and the components operative in controlling the pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movement actuators of the video cameras.  includes a first video camera , a second video camera , a third video camera , and a camera control unit . One omni-directional or PTZ camera can replace a number or all of the cameras located within the space to be controlled or viewed. The number of PTZ cameras to be used depends on the area to be viewed and controlled. A single camera can be sufficient where the area to be monitored is small. In addition, panoramic cameras can be used in addition or as a replacement to regular cameras. Such panoramic cameras can be PTZ cameras or regular cameras and may provide directional as well as spatial information. One non-limiting example of a PZT camera is an elbex PTZ EXC90 dome camera, manufactured by Elbex, Sweden. The camera control unit  includes a cameras list , a camera locator , a camera selector , a camera PTZ parameters controller , a user interface , and service locations list . The cameras list  includes a set of camera records for the video cameras , , . The camera records include camera status , camera location data , and a set of PTZ parameter values . For a readier understanding of the system a first service location  and a second service location  are shown in the drawing under discussion where each service location is associated with a face-face interaction. The video cameras , ,  are installed at pre-planned and pre-defined physical locations around the service locations ,  such that one or more of the cameras , ,  is capable of covering one or more service locations , . As noted above previously installed security cameras can be used in the context of thew present invention. The cameras , ,  include the controllable pant-zoom-tilt (PTZ) adjustment actuators , , , respectively. The physical locations of the of cameras , ,  in conjunction with the use of PTZ adjustment actuators , ,  form a combined field-of-view that could substantially cover visually the entire set of service locations , , which are potentially required to be recorded on-demand. The pant-tilt-zoom (PTZ) adjustment actuators , ,  could be operated either automatically or manually where the manual operation is performed by a user via the user interface . For each video camera , , , the system maintains a service locations list  that the cameras , ,  are able to cover. Each entry in the service locations list  is associated with a suitable set of PTZ parameters . The PTZ parameters include the spatial definition of each service location , . When a record-on-demand (ROD) request is issued for a specific service location ,  the camera locator  locates all the cameras that can potentially cover the required location. Next, the camera selector  will process the set of located cameras in order to select one of the operationally available cameras (the status  of which is both \u201cnot-in-use\u201d and \u201cnot-out-of-order\u201d) for the required task through the operation of the camera selector . The operation of the camera selector  could be based on any of the known selection algorithms. Typically an algorithm would be used that minimizes future blocking potential. If the entire set of the cameras that are capable of covering the required service location ,  are in current use then the system instructs one of the currently operating cameras to terminate its current task and re-directs the camera to the required task. When an available and capable camera is selected for the task, the PTZ parameters  pertaining to the required service location ,  are loaded and the camera's view is spatially re-directed to the service location by suitably operating the PTZ actuators , ,  via the camera PTZ parameters controller . When the camera turns toward the required service location a visual recording of the covered location is initiated. If no camera is available then interaction audio data could be recorded exclusively. The system automatically polls the set of cameras , ,  until a suitable camera is located or a suitable camera is made available by de-assigning the camera from a current task. Consequently, the PTZ parameters  pertaining to the required service location ,  are loaded and the camera is re-assigned to the required task. PTZ parameters are determined according to the physical PTZ values provided by the camera. Each PTZ camera can provide the physical parameters of its position and the position of its lenses. The combined parameters provided by the PTZ camera provide accurate three dimensional spatial information allowing the system using the camera name (or other identifying means such as PCT name, MAC address extension and the like) to associate a service location with a camera. Likewise, the camera can be provided with physical parameters which will be associated with spatial location at the service locations. As noted above, the system can use either a single camera or an arrays of cameras. The cameras may be bi directional or omni-directional, limited focus or panoramic. The camera or cameras may provide directional information from their physical orientation during use. Spatial coordinates can also be extracted from microphones (not shown) located in the area of the service location ,  or there about. For example, one or more microphones may be attached to the ceiling above the service location , . When sound is received by said microphones, the input signal is provided to the camera control unit  wherein a voice controller unit (not shown) identifies the intensity of the audio signal. In case a number of microphones are installed the voice controller unit can transfer the camera PZT parameters controller  with the service location for which the video cameras , ,  should be directed too as is described above by the cameras locator , camera selector  and the camera control unit . If one or more omni-directional microphones are installed the voice controller unit extrapolates the audio received and if an audio input from a particular service area is above a predetermined threshold then the spatial information of the audio source or the service location to be viewed is transferred to the camera control unit  so as to turn one or more cameras to the audio source so video feed can be captured with respect to the audio received which exceed predetermined threshold. The threshold may be the audio level or other aspects of the audio, such as stress in the voice captured over the audio feed, said stress to be detected by an audio analysis computer program (not shown). Additional examples of audio analysis which can be used are further detailed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/056,049 titled VIDEO AND AUDIO CONTENT ANALYSIS SYSTEM filed 30 Jan. 2001 reference to which is hereby made. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a single or few cameras can be used in conjunction with a number of microphones whereby the cameras are directed towards service areas according to the result of the audio analysis. Thus, if the audio analysis suggests that a customer or a representative raise their voices, or speak about gifts, or illegal issues, the one or more cameras may be directed towards said service area to capture a video feed of the interaction. Such use of microphones reduces the need of a human operator to control the audio captured. The camera's view is spatially re-directed to the physical service location ,  by suitable operation of the PTZ adjustment actuators , ,  in accordance with the PTZ parameter values . Such values can include the movement values necessary to view and capture a physical service location , . When the camera turns toward the required physical service location ,  the visual recording of the covered position is initiated. Note should be taken that in a manner similar to a typical recording-on-demand application, not all the users are capable of initiating and performing video recording simultaneously. The proposed solution enables a reduction in the required number of cameras due to the fact that service locations in walk-in environments are typically located in close proximity and therefore a single camera could be located such as to be able potentially to cover a plurality of service locations with different PTZ settings for each location. In order to decrease the probability of blocking additional cameras could be employed. A selective recording mode could be implemented in which the recording decision is taken by a rule engine instead of a user. The proposed solution could be operative in any other application requiring the sharing of cameras and camera resource management. Note should be taken that although on the drawing under discussion only a limited number of cameras and service locations are shown it would readily understood that in a realistic environment a plurality of cameras could be used covering a plurality of service locations.","In many walk-in environments, a many-to-one relationship exists between the number of business representatives (or service positions if applicable) and the number of computing platforms. The configuration where every interaction capture device or every pair of interaction capture devices is connected to a dedicated computing platform that converts the voice into a data stream and transfers said voice to a logging unit over a network is not feasible in an environment with a many-to-one relationship between the representatives and the computers. Hard-wiring each voice capture device or each pair of voice capture devices to an input of a voice logger is structurally complicated and could entail prohibitive costs due to the need for the extensive wiring installation.","Referring now to  a proposed solution for the transfer of interaction data from multiple sources to a single computing platform is described.  shows a first interaction capture device , a second interaction capture device , a third interaction capture device , a frequency division multiplexing unit , and a computing platform . The interaction capture devices , ,  could be video input devices, such as video cameras, audio input devices, such as microphones or any other device that could capture interaction data in diverse format during the performance of a face-to-face interaction. The interaction data captured by the devices , ,  is relayed to the frequency division multiplexing unit . The unit  multiplexes the interaction data into low-frequency, low-bandwidth signals where the data from the various input devices is characterized by the specific frequency range assigned thereto. Next, the unit  feeds the combined signals to signal to the computing platform  for capture, de-multiplexing and separate storage in accordance with the frequency range values of the combined signal.","Referring now to  that describes an alternative solution for the transfer of interaction data from multiple sources to a single computing platform.  shows a first interaction capture device , a second interaction capture device , a third interaction capture device , a first transfer channel , a second transfer channel , a third transfer channel , and a computing platform . The computing platform  includes a multiple input interface .

The interaction data captured by the devices , ,  is relayed via the associated transfer channels , ,  respectively to the multiple input interface  of the computing device . The multiple interface device  could be associated with a multi-channel input unit, such as for example a SoundBlaster.","One of the major challenges in a walk-in face-to-face interaction environment is the lack of the CTI or CDR feed. This is limiting not only since it is needed to separate the stream into interactions representing independent customer interactions but also since the data describing the call is required for other uses. This data, referred to as metadata can include the agents name or specific ID, the customer name or specific ID, an account number, the department or service the interaction is related to, various flags such as to indicate if a transaction was completed or if the case has been closed in addition to the beginning and end time of the interaction. This is the type of information one usually receives from the CTI link in telephony centric interaction but is not available in this environment due to the fact that an interaction-enabling platform, such as telephony switch, is not required.","The metadata is typically used for three uses: a) to determine the beginning and end of the interaction, b) to provide additional data to describe the interactions entry in the database of recorded interactions for enabling fast location of a specific interaction, and c) to drive recording decisions and flagging of interactions based on this data.","Referring back to  the solutions proposed to overcome these three obstacles, regarding the determination of beginning and end of recording will be set forth next. The use of (a) what can be defined as \u201cBlock Of Time\u201d recording, were time intervals are predefined for the interaction capture and storage unit  to record all interactions taking place at that particular time periods. (b) Screen event driven recording can define the start or end of recording based on an event\/action made in the application running on the agent's desktop which is typical or representative of the start or end of an interaction or of a part or interaction which is of interest. Non-limiting examples are launching of a new customer screen in the CRM application, agent opening a new customer file, or inviting next customer in line by clicking on the \u201cNext\u201d button in the queue management system application, or whenever a discount of more then $100 is entered into a CRM application's designated data field, or whenever a specific screen is loaded then start recording. Screen activity is captured by screen capture and storage component . The screen event capturing agent action is fully described in co-pending PCT patent application serial number PCT\/IL02\/00197 titled A METHOD FOR CAPTURING, ANALYZING AND RECORDING THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ACTIVITIES filed 12 Mar. 2002, and in PCT patent application serial number PCT\/IL02\/00796 titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CAPTURING BROWSER SESSIONS AND USER ACTIONS filed 24 Aug. 2001 both are incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, by correlating the screen events with voice content analysis one can reach a higher level of accuracy for example by identifying the end of the interaction by the agent saying \u201cnext\u201d and at a near time closing the customer's file in the CRM application. (c) Selective recording based on real time video content analysis is another solution for determining start and stop sessions as well as the complete identification of the parties interacted. An example of using face recognition algorithm is explained in detail in VIDEO AND AUDIO CONTENT ANALYSIS SYSTEM, which is incorporated herein by reference, detailed of application stated below. Algorithm running for example on NICE propriety hardware\/firmware DSP's based boards or on (OTS) Off-The-Shelf board uploaded with known in the art other face recognition algorithms. As mentioned earlier the video, agent screen and voice are time synchronized and as such the start and end of interaction is deterministic. Frame presence detection defines a video frame to trigger recording whenever a person is detected (co-exist) for more then x seconds, when video frame empty then stop recording (similar to energy level detection in Voice recording). Frame content manipulations are inherent in NICE VISION Product of NICE Systems Ltd. Example of capabilities of object\/people video content-based detection can be found in co-pending U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/354,209 titled ALARM SYSTEM BASED ON VIDEO ANALYSIS, filed 6 Feb. 2002 which is incorporated herein by reference. As mentioned the video signal capturing & storing component  recording is triggered selectively using face recognition for example recording pre-defined customers such as VIP customers, or only customers that their pictures are already stored in organization database  or any type of recording (total and\/or selective) according to the service provider preferences. Preferably any pre-determined content of video can be used to identify start\/stop the recording of frontal interaction. Coverage of video content analysis is described in details in co-pending US patent application titled: VIDEO AND AUDIO CONTENT ANALYSIS SYSTEM, Ser. No. 10\/056,049 dated Jan. 30, 2001 stating the real-time capabilities based on video content analysis done using Digital Signal Processing (DSP\/s) which is incorporated herein by reference. (d) The use of ROD (Record On Demand) is another solution for determining, or in this particular case manually controlling the start and end of interaction\/recording. With ROD the agent can start and stop recording according based on his needs. For example whenever a deal is taking place he will record it for compliance needs, but he will not record when the customer only came to ask a question. The actual trigger of the recording can either be performed by a physical switch connecting and disconnecting the microphones from the capture device or by a software application running on the agent's computation device. (e) Total Recording is a straightforward solution to mean, record and store all calls during working hours of the service center, preferably if work force management system exists on site it can be integrated as to provide all agent's working periods and brake offs. NICE SYSTEMS Ltd. integration with Blue Pumpkin Software Inc. of Sunnyvale Calif. is a non-limiting example of using working hours information to calibrate scheduled based recording. (f) API Level integration with host applications in the computing system is another example of providing control capabilities on when start and end recording is set. Several capabilities can be achieved setting start and stop API commands, setting routing calls command and the like. Non-limiting example is the provider of CRM, Siebel Systems, Inc. of San Mateo, Calif., certified Integration with NICE SYSTEMS that consequently provided recording capabilities embedded within Siebel's Customer Relationship Management solution applications. Using ActiveX components or other means of command delivery, information can be inserted into the scripts of any host application the agent uses it in order that when he begins handling the customer the recording is started and when the handling ends it is stopped. (g) Integration with Queue Management Systems is a genuine solution for triggering and automatically controlling the start and stop recording. Queue management systems commonly control the flow of customer through walk-in environments. By integrating with such systems one can know when a new customer is assigned to an agent and the agent's position. Hence, by integrating with the queue management system we can understand when the interaction begins and if next one in queue deduces that previous interaction has ended. By deducting this we can trigger start and stop recording based on the status the queue management system holds for the agent. An example of a Queue Management System would be solutions (hardware and software) by Q-MATIC Corporation of Neongatan 8 S-43153 Molndal, Sweden. It will be evident to the person skilled in the art that any combination of the above options (a) to (g) is contemplated by the present invention.","It would be readily understood that a usable, analyzable, re-creatable interaction recording should have a precisely identifiable beginning point and termination point. Where enabling platforms are utilized for the interaction sessions, such as telephone networks, data communication networks, facsimile devices, and the like, a well-defined and easily identifiable staring point and termination point is readily recognizable. In walk-in environments there are no available means for reporting and storing information concerning the beginning point and the termination point of the interaction since currently, walk-in environments are characterized by a substantially continuous stream of customers entering to seek the services provided. As a result, interactions conducted at a service point are easily \u201cmerged\u201d one into the other. Customers access the service point positions according to a waiting queue and leave the service points immediately after the completion of their business. In addition, since typically there is no enabling platform associated with a walk-in environment service point, determining and storing the beginning and the end of a customer-specific interaction is extremely problematic.","Referring now to  that shows a proposed solution for the identification of the beginning point and the termination point of a face-to-face interaction within walk-in environments. The solution is to install a simple volume detector or like apparatus, which will detect that the customer has approached the CSR and has left. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that like apparatuses can also be used in the context of the present invention.  shows a service location  in a walk-in environment, a volume detector , and a computing platform . The location  could be a service counter, and the like, where a face-to-face interaction is taking place between a CSR  and a customer . In order to identify the beginning point and the termination point of the interaction the volume detector  is utilized. The detector  could be an alarm system element which is installed in the close proximity of the service location , such that the option for the detection of the presence or non-presence of the customer  is available. One such detector  is the Visionic Hardwired Motion detector manufactured by Visonic, Tel Aviv, Israel. When the customer  approaches the customer service representative (CSR) , stops near the service counter in front of the representative  or sits down in front of the representative , a customer presence detector  installed in the shelf volume detector  will detect the presence of the customer . The detection signal  will in turn trigger an electrical signal for the activation of an interaction status activation relay  installed in the shelf volume detector  in a pre-defined manner. An open state of the relay  could either indicate the presence of a customer  or alternatively the open state of the relay  could indicate non-presence of the customer . When the relay  is activated the state of the relay  is modified either from open state to closed state or from closed state to open state. A signal signifying a change in the state of the relay  is transmitted to the computing platform  and recognized by a main control module (not shown) installed therein. Subsequently, the control module (not shown) will load and activate an interaction start module  installed in the computer platform  by sending a \u201cstart interaction\u201d command utilizing, for example, a proprietary Application Programming Interface (API) instruction. Note should be taken that the \u201cstart interaction\u201d command is not identical to a \u201cstart interaction recording command\u201d. The start interaction command will be associated with additional available information, such as start time, agent name, and the like. The main control module will check whether the interaction  should or should not be recorded by examining the pre-defined criteria held by an interaction recording program (not shown) or examining the recording control parameters stored in recording control parameters file  in the computing platform . In accordance with the results of the examination the interaction  will be either recorded following the activation of the recording program (not shown) by the interaction recording activator  or the interaction  could be conducted without being recorded. The customer  will leave the point of service at the termination of the interaction . The volume detector  will detect the leaving of the customer  and the arrival of a next customer. Accordingly, the state of the relay  will be modified. The relay  state change will be recognized by the main control module and as a result a \u201cstop interaction\u201d command is issued to the interaction termination module  utilizing a proprietary API instruction. Note should be taken that the termination of the interaction  does not necessary effect the termination of a recording. The recoding is typically continues for a limited period of time (typically for a few seconds) in order to enable capturing the CSR  wrap up time as a screen event. The wrap up time is defined as the point whereat the CSR  finishes updating the interaction with finalizing information in the CRM system.","Referring now to  that shows the elements operative in the off-line use of an audio content analyzer in order to segment a stream of interaction recordings to the constituent interactions therein. The segmentation is performed in order to determine the beginning and end of each interaction or each other segment such as a party speaking, a wait period, a non-customer interaction and the like. An interaction can be defined as the exchange of information between two persons. A segment can be defined as a part of an interaction to include a segment where one party only speaks and the like. The drawing under discussion shows an interaction recordings database or storage , an off-line interaction processor , and an interaction processor scheduler . The off-line interaction processor  includes a word spotter module , a word\/phrase locator , a word\/phrase inserter , a recording segmenter , an interaction segment beginning\/termination point updater , and a word\/phrase dictionary . The dictionary  includes a start-type words\/phrases group , and a termination-type words\/phrases group . The proposed solution requires that the entire stream of the interactions be recorded for at least a limited period. The limited period should include at least one full segment or interaction. Note should be taken that although some portions of all the interactions are recorded this alternative solution applies to selective recording environments as well as for total recording environments. The execution of the off-line interaction processing is controlled by the interaction processor scheduler  where the operative parameters are submitted by a user via a user interface . At a pre-defined point in time the scheduler  will activate and run the off-line interaction processor . The pre-defined moment in time can be an hourly schedule, or a predetermined event or time. The processor  will sequentially scan the interaction recordings database or storage . The interaction recordings database or storage  can be a short term memory, a transient memory device, a storage media such as a disk or any other media capable of holding the interaction stream from the capture until it is processed or discarded. The processor  will activate the audio content analyzer  in order to identify phrases appearing in the interaction recordings that are characterized by being used typically by the interaction participants near the beginning point and near the termination point of an interaction. Thus, such phrases and words will be located in the beginning portion and in the terminating portion of an interaction. For example, phrases commonly used at the beginning of an interaction, are \u201chello my name is John, how may I help you?\u201d, \u201chow may I help you?\u201d, \u201cwhat is your account number?\u201d and the like. For example, phrases and words commonly used at the termination of an interaction are \u201cgoodbye\u201d, \u201cthank you for your time\u201d, \u201cThank you for paying a visit to our store\u201d or \u201cfeel free to pay us a visit in the future\u201d, and the like. The word\/phrase dictionary  holds two groups of phrases and words. The first group  includes a list of phrases and words typically used at the beginning portion of an interaction while the second group  includes a list of phrases and words typically used at the termination portion of an interaction. Note should be taken that the measure of accuracy of the interaction segmentation process will depend directly on the size and content of the phrase\/word dictionary . Preferably, but not necessarily, two processing passes are applied to the interaction recordings . In the first pass the process utilizes the word\/phrase locator  that will attempt to locate the common phrases\/words from the two word\/phrase groups ,  in the interaction recordings stream . The operation of the word\/phrase locator  effects the matching of the common phrases with the phrases\/words spotted in the recording . When a match is made, the common phrase\/word is inserted into the recordings  by the word\/phrase inserter . Subsequent to the completion of the first pass, the second pass is performed in which the recording segmenter  is executed. The responsibility of the segmenter  is in the segmentation of the recordings  into the constituent interactions by utilizing the previously inserted common phrases\/words indicating a beginning point and the common phrases indicating a termination point in the audio stream as markers defining the limits of the interactions. The segmenter  will use the first beginning phrase\/word mark that comes after an ending phrase\/word mark and mark it as the interaction start and use the last ending phrase\/word mark before another start phrase and set it as the interaction ending point. After the completion of the second pass the recordings  should be segmented into a number of separate, distinct and identifiable interactions. It will be readily appreciated that a single pass using a single dictionary is also contemplated by the present invention. A single dictionary may include both the words and phrases and a single pass can be used to conduct both tests. In addition, a single pass can also be made to conduct any one of these tests and if such test is successful then a second pass is not required. Next the interaction will be updated by the interaction segment start\/termination point updater . The updater  will determine and update the interaction's beginning point in time and the interaction's termination point in time. The information will be available later for the interaction management examiners or other users that desire to query for a specific interaction.","To conserve storage space, recordings processed can be optionally deleted and discarded wither automatically according to predetermined parameters or manually by an administrator of the system. For example, at a later point in time, typically selected by a user (not shown) of the system, the system will execute a process that will scan the interaction recordings . Based on the details of the recorded interaction, said details can include words\/phrases identified in the recording, or details external to the recording such as the time and date recorded or length or the like, the system will determine which of the interaction recordings should be deleted. When the deletion process is completed only the interactions which were initially defined to be recorded will remain in the database . The non-recordable interactions will be deleted by an independent auto-deletion mechanism (not shown). Thus, a stream of interaction is separated into separate segments constituting interactions or other segments recorded in a walk-in environment or where no other external indication of the beginning and end of an interaction or segment is provided.","Referring back to  recording of silence can be avoided using either VOX activity detection for determine microphones activity or by using, later discussed in detail, video content to detect customer present in the (ROI) Region Of Interest covered by camera or either using screen and computer information to determine agent activity for example whether agent is logged off, and the like scenarios. The different algorithms are parts of the respective components , ,  constituting the interaction capture and storage units . Agents can also avoid recording if they turn off their microphones when they are not working.","Several alternative solutions directed for determining the beginning point and the termination point of the interaction  were described herein above. Now to the second obstacle, namely the problem of generating the metadata for describing the interactions entry in the database of recorded interactions, for the purpose of enabling fast query on the location of a specific interaction as well as to drive recording or interaction flagging decisions and for further analysis purposes. Metadata collection is one of the major challenges in Walk-in face-to-face recording environments characterized by the lack of the CTI or CDR\/SMDR feed. This is limiting not only because it is needed to separate the interactions, previously discussed, but also because the data describing the call is required for other uses. This data, referred to as metadata can include the agents name or specific ID, the customer name or specific ID, an account number, the department or service the interaction is related to, various flags such as if a transaction was completed in the interaction or if the case has been closed, in addition to the beginning and end time of the interaction. This is the type of information one usually receives from the CTI link in telephony centric interaction but it is not available in this kind of frontal interaction based environment due to the fact that an interaction-enabling platform, such as telephony switch, is not required. As mentioned the metadata is typically used for defining the beginning and end of the interaction. It is also used for providing additional data to describe the interactions entry in the database of recorded interactions to enable fast location of a specific interaction. And, finally to drive recording decisions and flagging of interactions based on this data. An example for recording decisions is random or rule-based selection of interactions to be recorded or flagged for the purposes of quality management. A typical selection rule could be two interactions per agent per week, or one customer service interaction and one sales interaction per agent per day and one interaction per visiting customer per month. As the start and end of interaction was described in detail in the previous paragraph, the remaining metadata gathering of interaction's related information is accomplished using the following methods. (a) By logging the agent network login for example Novell or Microsoft login or supplying the agent an application to log-into the system, it is possible to ascertain which agent is using the specific position recorded on a specific channel and thus associate the agent name with the recording. (b) Again, as before capturing data on the agent's screen or from an application running on the computing device, either by integrating API commands and controls into the scripts of the application or by using screen analysis as shown in PCT co-pending patent application serial number PCT\/IL02\/00197 titled A METHOD FOR CAPTURING, ANALYZING AND RECORDING THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ACTIVITIES filed Mar. 12, 2002 and in PCT co-pending patent application serial number PCT\/IL02\/00796 titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CAPTURING BROWSER SESSIONS AND USER ACTIONS filed Aug. 24, 2001 both are incorporated herein by reference. When provided in real time this can be used for real-time triggering of recording based on the data provided but more important it may be used to extract metadata from an existing application and store it in the database component . (c) By adding a DTMF generator and a keypad to the microphone mixer and\/or amplifier enabling the agent or customer, to key-in information to be associated with the call such as customer ID or commands such as start or stop recording and the like. The DTMF detection function, which is a known in the art algorithm and typically exists in digital voice loggers, is then used for recognizing the DTMF digits generated command or data and then the command is either executed or data is stored and related to the recording as metadata.","In addition, the system may be coupled and share resources with a traditional telephony environment recording and quality management solution for example: NiceLog, NiceCLS and NiceUniverse by NICE Systems Ltd. of Raanana, Israel. In such an implantation where two recording solutions co-exists part of the recording resources for voice and screen are allocated for recording of phone lines part for frontal face-to-face capturing device recording and events and additional information for these lines, are gathered through CTI integration. In such an environment one can then recreate all interactions related to a specific data element such as all interactions both phone and frontal of a specific customer. This can include, for example, the check-in and checkout of a hotel guest in conjunction with his calls to the room service line.","An analyzer engine which is preferably a stand-alone application, which reads the data, most preferably including both events and content, performs logic actions on the captured data is able to assess the performance of the agent. The controlling operator of the analyzer engine, such as a supervisor for example, can optionally predefine reports to see the results.","Automatic QM (quality management) should help the supervisor to do more than simply enter information into forms, but rather should actually perform at least part of the evaluation automatically.","Optionally, a manual score from the supervisor may also optionally be added to the automatic score. There may also optionally be a weighting configured, in order to assign different weights to the automatic and manual assessments.","When the accuracy of the automatic QM scores reaches a relatively high level, for example after the analysis application has been adjustably configured for a particular business, the new system may optionally at least reduce significantly the human resources for quality management. Therefore, the analyzer engine more preferably automatically analyzes the quality of the performance of the agent, optionally and most preferably according to one or more business rules. As previously described, such analysis may optionally include statistical analyses, such as the number of times a \u201cbackspace\u201d key is pressed for example; the period of time required to perform a particular business process and\/or other software system related process, such as closure for example; and any other type of analysis of the screen events and\/or associated content. Statistical analysis may also optionally be performed with regard to the raw data.","Due to the fact that face-to-face interactions may take place in environments with relatively high levels of noise there is a need to address the issue of audio quality and to provide improvement of the audio quality. In some environments simply using a multi-directional microphone will be sufficient. However, in environments with significant levels of ambient noise and interferences from neighboring positions a solution must be given to enable a reasonable level of understandability of the recorded voice. Solutions can be divided into three kinds: (1) Solutions external to the capture and recording apparatus, these kind of solutions include solutions for ambient noise reduction that are known in the art and use specialized microphones or microphone arrays with noise canceling functions. (2) Solutions within the capture and recording apparatus, which include noise reduction functions, performed in the capture and logging platform either during playback or during preprocessing of the input signal as shown in co-pending PCT patent application serial number PCT\/IL02\/00593 titled METHOD, APPARATUS AND SYSTEM FOR CAPTURING AND ANALYZING INTERACTION BASED CONTENT filed Jul. 18, 2002 incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, as part of the audio classification process in the pre-processing stage described in detailed in this co-pending PCT patent application FIG. 4, filtering of background elements such as music, keyboards clicks and the like is discussed. (3) Another solution uses both (1) and (2) solutions from above\u2014the external and the internal noise reduction. It offers a split between capture and recording apparatus and the environment external to this apparatus. This would include any combination of solutions presented in (1) and (2) for example a solution in which two directional microphones are pointed towards the customer and agent respectively, their signal enter the capture and logging platform where the sound common to both is detected and negated from both signals. Then both signals are mixed and recorded. They can also remain separated and be mixed only upon recreation of the voice-playback. Another example of a solution like this is one in which the two microphones are mixed\/summed electronically using an electronic audio mixer and enter the capture and logging platform. In addition, an ambient signal is received by an additional multi-directional microphone located in the environment and enters the capture and logging platform. In the capture and logging platform the ambient noise is negated from the mixed agent\/customer signal before recording or during playback.","Referring to  that shows an alternative solution for the elimination of noise. The solution involves the utilization of an audio content analyzer and various Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques for audio manipulation.  includes a first audio input device , a second audio input device , and a computing device . The first audio input device  is associated with a CSR while the second audio input device  is associated with a customer. Interaction audio data generated during a face-to-face interaction is captured by the devices ,  and transferred to the computing device . The computing device  includes a voice sample file  for the CSR, a voice sample file  for the customer, an audio processor , and an interaction recording . The audio processor  includes an audio content analyzer , a voice-specific digital representation builder , a voice recognizer , and an audio filtering section . The audio content analyzer  is used for the recognition of the interaction participants. At the start of an interaction the relevant participants will be identified. The real-time audio analysis will be performed and an audio digital representation will be created for the identified speaker due to the fact that in certain cases the identity of the CSR is known in advance. An example of such an environment is one in which each CSR has its own unique login code used when logging in into the system. Another participant identifier could be a video content analyzer (not shown) that provides the identity of the CSR by utilizing face recognition techniques, and the like. A walk-in center operative in such an environment will maintain a voice sample file  for each of the respective CSRs. The voice sample file  should include the commonly used phrases\/words during the interaction, such as, for example, the word \u201chello\u201d, the phrase \u201chow may I help you\u201d, and the like. The system will collect sufficient voice samples for the creation of a digital representation of the participant voice. The system will use the digital representation in order to filter and refine the contents of the audio recording, such that ideally it will hold the audio data generated by the voice of two or more interaction participants. The rest is discarded as ambient noise or environmental interferences. The process will run on-line during the interaction recording in a specifically designed and developed audio processor  implemented on the computing platform . Audio input devices ,  capture the audio of both customer and CSR, and the voice-specific digital representation builder  generates digital representations for the audio relayed from the audio input devices , . The audio processor  operates in conjunction with the pre-defined voice sample files ,  or as a stand alone process that addresses the two audio inputs only. The audio processor  further includes an audio filtering section  to eliminate the ambient noise from the interaction recording  leaving only the voice of the relevant participants.","In some instances it is beneficial to record video in the walk-in environment non-limiting examples of the advantages of using synchronized video recording on site were mentioned before as part of the solutions for determining start and end of interaction and for visually identifying of parties. In cases in which a single video camera is positioned to record each service position the implementation of playback is straightforward, i.e. playing back the video stream recorded at the same time or with a certain fixed bias from the period defined as the beginning and end of the service interactions, determined as previously discussed in \u201cframe presence detection\u201d. Other optional implementation instances would include an implementation in which two cameras are used per position, directed at the agent and customer, respectively. In this case at the point of replay the user can determine which video stream should be replayed or alternatively, have both play in a split screen. Another implementation instance would be an environment in which a strict one-to-one or many-to-one relationship between cameras and positions does not exist. In such an environment the users playing back the recording selects which video source is played back with the voice and optionally screen recording. It should be noted that the video and voice are synchronized by continuously synchronizing the clocks of the video capture & storage system with the Voice and Screen capture platform using any time synchronization method non limiting example are NTP Network Time Protocol, IRIG-B or the like. In cases where one lacks camera per position, one camera can be redirected to an active station based on interaction presence indication. Meaning that in scenarios where fewer cameras than positions exist the camera can be adaptively redirected (using camera PTZ\u2014Pan, Tilt, Zoom) to the active position. Note that cameras can be remotely controlled, same as in the case of multimedia remote recording vicinities.","The systems described above can operate in conjunction with all other elements and product applicable to traditional voice recording and quality management solution such as remote playback and monitoring capabilities non-limiting examples of such products are Executive Connect by NICE Systems Ltd. of Raanana, Israel. Agent eLearning solutions\u2014such as KnowDev by Knowlagent Inc, Alpharetta, Ga. This invention method and system is advantageous over existing solutions in the sense that it provides a solution for quality management of frontal face-to-face service environments.","Quality management forms are evaluation forms filled by supervisors, evaluating the agent skills and the agent quality of service. Such forms will be correlated with the content data item during the analysis to deduce certain results. The quality management form can be automatically filled by the system in response to actions taken by the agent and\/or fields filled by the agent or interactions captured. 1) Other interactions include any future prospective interaction types as long as an appropriate capture method and processing method is implemented. Such can be dynamic content, data received from external sources such as the customer or other businesses, and any like or additional interactions. Still referring to , the interaction content is captured and further used by the interaction and storage unit  in order to provide the option of handling directly the original content. Optionally previously stored, absorbed content analysis results are being used as input information to an ongoing content analysis process. For example, the behavioral pattern of an agent and\/or a customer may be updated due to the previously stored content extracted recurrent behavioral pattern. The various types of interactions may be re-assessed in light of previous interactions and interactions associated therewith. The output of the analysis can be tuned by setting thresholds, or by combing results of one or more analysis methods, thus filtering selective results with greater probability of success. This enables companies to enhance their quality and get more information on their customer's satisfaction and to propose quality management solutions to cover its branches, offering the diverse type of traditional recording solutions whether it is total, selective, ROD, screen event triggered recording and the like for frontal service environments, executive tools to enable remote access to monitor and listen to interaction in the frontal service environments and when couple this solution with traditional telephony solution, yield full coverage on customer experience for better analysis.","The quality management device  evaluates the skills of the agent in identifying and understanding of the idea provided during an interaction. The quality management process may be accomplished manually when supervisors making evaluations using evaluation forms that contain questions regarding ideas identification with their respective weight enter such evaluations to the QM module . For example, supervisor may playback the interaction, checking that the idea description provided by an agent comports the actual idea provided by the customer. Score can be Yes, No, N\/A or weighted combo box (grades 1 to 10). The Automatic QM module  can also perform quality management automatically. The Automatic QM module comprises pre-defined rule and action engines that fill the idea section of the evaluation forms automatically (without human intervention). Using screens events capturing, any information entered into the idea description fields generates event. Thus, the moment an idea is entered, the agent receives a scoring automatically.","The automatic QM (quality management) system of analyzer engine  according to the present invention should help the supervisor to do more than simply enter information into forms, but rather should actually perform at least part of the evaluation automatically. Optionally, a manual score from the supervisor may also optionally be added to the automatic score. There may also optionally be a weighting configured, in order to assign different weights to the automatic and manual assessments.","In order to provide an efficient solution for the quality management of interactions in a walk-in environment the operating CSR associated with the interaction should be identified. The identification of the CSR is extremely important since the usability of a recording of an interaction depends substantially on the known identity of the CSR. The identity of the CSR is vital to the capability of querying the interaction recording and to recreating the course of the interaction at a later point in time. In some walk-in environments it is highly problematic to associate an interaction with a CSR since complex procedures involving integration with and access to external sub-systems are required. The inherent complexity of the task is due typically to the non-availability of CTI information in walk-in environments.","Referring to  associating a CSR and\/or a customer with a face-to-face interaction involves the identification of one or more speakers participating in an interaction.  shows a walk-in environment in which a face-to-face interaction  is taking place, and an interaction capture and storage unit  captures and handles the interaction. The face-to-face interaction  utilizes a first interaction capture device , such as a microphone, and a second interaction capture device , such as a microphone. The first interaction capture device  is associated with a CSR while the second interaction capture device  is associated with a customer or a non-CSR person. The first device  and the second device  receive the voices of the CSR and the customer respectively during the interaction. The voices are encoded into electrical signals and are transferred to the interaction capture and storage unit . The unit  includes a set of data structures and an interaction recording program . The data structures include recording control parameters file , a customer voice sample bank , a CSR voice sample bank , a CSR information table , a customer information table , and an interaction recording . The set of data structures can comprise one or any of the above mentioned data structures. Said data structures can be located in a single or many files on one or more storage media device or temporary memory devices. The interaction recording program  preferably comprise a recording control parameter handler , a CSR identifier , a customer identifier , a CSR data handler , a customer data handler , a CSR voice sample , a customer voice sampler , an audio content analyzer , an interaction recording activator , and a user interface. Each one of the modules noted above can be implemented in a single or many computer program in one or more modules operating various functions to enable the execution of the program which will associate between an interaction and a CSR.","Still referring to  the identification of the CSR and optionally the identity of the customer are established via the utilization of the audio content analyzer . A walk-in center running the system would maintain the CSR voice sample bank  and optionally the customer voice sample bank . Alternatively, such voice banks can be located remotely to the walk-in environment and maintained by a third party. The CSR voice sample bank  is a set of voice samples associated with a set of respective CSRs while the customer voice sample bank  is a set of voice samples associated with a set of respective customers. Both the CSR voice samples and the customer voice samples contain a set of common words and phrases, such as for example, \u201cHello\u201d, \u201cHow can I help you\u201d, and the like, typically used during an interaction . The voice samples stored in the voice sample bank  and the voice sample bank . The banks ,  are used in alternative operational modes where the mode is determined in accordance with the type of the environment. In a selective recording environment the recordings are initiated by information kept in the recording control parameters file . Such information could include the CSR's name. The recording program determines in accordance with the control parameters file  whether an interaction  should or should not be recorded. When the system detects the beginning of an interaction  it examines whether interaction  complies with the pre-defined recording control parameters  stored in the recording control parameters file . Where the compliance criterion is satisfied the system will trigger a start-recording command. The interaction audio obtained by the interaction capture device  associated with the CSR is utilized in order to determine the identity of the CSR providing the service. Based on the pre-defined information held by the recording control parameters in the recording control parameters file  it is determined whether the interaction  should or should not be recorded. Consequent to the start of the interaction  the CSR voice sampler  samples the audio acquired by the CSR's interaction capture device . The audio content analyzer  processes the acquired samples using real-time audio analysis techniques. The system performs a search-and-compare operation involving the CSR voice sample bank  and the voice sample acquired from the CSR's microphone by the CSR voice sampler . When a matching voice sample is found in the voice sample bank the CSR data handler  obtains the details of the CSR associated with the matched voice sample from the CSR information table . The details are associated with the existing information provided by the system, such as start time, for example. Following the addition of the CSR details from the CSR information table  the system proceeds to the verification of interaction recording in accordance with the existing information. If the data signifies the recording of the interaction  then the system issues a start recording command to the interaction recording activator  which activates in turn the recording of the interaction . The recording of the interaction  effects the insertion of interaction data obtained from the interaction capture devices ,  into the interaction recording .","In a total recording environment all the interactions are recorded. As a result, the recording program performs no recording option-verifications and no recording-control parameters are held by the system. The lack of recording-control parameters makes the examination and proper re-creation of the conduct and management of an interaction highly problematic. A possible solution involves the off-line execution of a process that regards a stream of recordings of the interactions as input data. The process activates an audio content analyzer that applies audio content analysis on the stream of interactions. The start time and termination time of the process is determined by the user. Thus, for example, the start point in time could be fixed at midnight, and the termination point in time could be set at dawn in order to prevent heavy processing loads on the computer system of the service center during periods characterized by a plurality of interactions. During the execution the audio content analyzer compares and attempts to match interaction audio with one of the voice samples stored in the voice sample bank. When a match is found, the interaction database is updated with the obtained details of the CSR. Consequent to the termination of the process the recordings of the interactions in the interactions database are marked with the identity and the details of the CSR to be used by the interaction information examiners for subsequent playback, examination, auditing, investigation, compliance checking, and the like.","While the majority of face-to-face interactions take place in spatially static manner, some specialized interactions could take place across a set of dynamically changing locations where the interaction participants desire to move or required to be moving during the performance of several distinct interactions and even during a single interaction. Some interactions could be spatially disconnected from the service points or could even be spatially disconnected from the service center. For example, a CSR could be required to conduct an interaction that is external to a physical structure housing the walk-in environment by addressing passing potential customers or potential customers entering the building. A CSR could be further required to conduct a spatially dynamic interaction, where the participants include customers walking within the internal space of the building, in order to offer certain services, goods, and the like. The recording of a spatially dynamic interaction is problematic for several reasons. These interactions could involve frequent place changes between interactions and even during a single interaction. Thus, the use of wired microphones will be non-operative. Although the CSR would be able to use a wireless microphone, it would unreasonable to request from the customers to wear a microphone when passing the shop entrance, entering the door or walking around the building. The utilization of a single microphone presents considerable difficulties when attempts are made to capture the voices of all the interaction participants with an adequate audio quality.","In a walk-in environment an interaction may take place between a CSR and a customer not over a predetermined counter. Such interaction can take place in another location, such as on the store floor, or next to an item to be purchased, or in a waiting area. Such interaction will not be typically captured. Referring now to  showing a proposed solution to the problem of capturing interaction data from a spatially dynamic interaction. The solution involves the combined use of a technology that enables the location of an object in a space and a technology for voice capturing.  shows a first video camera , a second video camera , a third video camera , a first microphone , a second microphone , a third microphone , a service location , and an object location monitoring and microphone controller unit . The number of cameras and microphones shown as well as the type of these capture devices is made for the purpose of illustration and not limitation. Additional capture devices can be added or distributed along the area intended to be covered for capture of interactions. The service location  includes a first visual object  and a second visual object . The object location monitoring and microphone controller unit  includes a physical service location data file  to store location data of service locations, a camera location and PTZ data file  to store video camera location and PTZ adjustment parameters, a microphone location data file  to store the locations of the microphones, a visual object locator and movement monitor  to locate a visual object in the service location space and to monitor the movements of the located object, a camera controller  to control the operation and the PTZ movements of the cameras, a microphone controller  to control the operation of the microphones, and a microphone selector  to select one or more microphones in accordance with the location of one or more objects. The cameras , ,  are deployed such that the location of the cameras , ,  in conjunction with PTZ adjustment actuators (not shown) enables the covering every position associated with the service location  that potentially could be required to be covered. For each camera , ,  the system maintains a list of physical service locations  characterized by the capability of the cameras , ,  to cover such locations in conjunction with PTZ parameters used for the operation of PTZ adjustment actuators (not shown). In addition, a set of microphones , ,  is installed in order to form a net of scattered audio acquiring devices capable of covering the entire space of the service location  in which the face-to-face interaction takes place. A specific camera is used to locate a visual object (, ) in the interaction location space. Once the object (, ) is located the system uses data supplied by the cameras , ,  to generate commands to one or more microphones , ,  that can cover the area in which the object ,  began to operate. Since the referenced object ,  is typically a human being it is to be assumed that the object ,  will move within the interaction location space or the service location . In order to ensure that the interaction will be recorded in its entirety the object ,  will be tracked by one or more cameras , ,  continuously. The set of cameras , ,  are configured such that overlapping areas are formed that are covered by more than one camera. The creation of the overlapping areas ensures that a moving object ,  will be permanently tracked as long as within the boundaries of the pre-defined recordable space. The interaction video could be captured via a single ceiling-mounted microphone placed exactly above the participants. If the position data generated by the cameras , ,  indicate that a single microphone is not sufficient for capturing the interaction audio then the system will use several microphones , ,  for forming a virtual beam. The virtual beam will capture the audio from the entire interaction area or service location . In such a case it is likely that ambient noise will be captured alongside the interaction audio. In order to overcome the problem of the ambient noise the system will perform summation of the inputs coming from each microphone. The summed data will be manipulated by DSP techniques such as to keep the relevant interaction data while eliminating the ambient noise.","The person skilled in the art will appreciate that what has been shown is not limited to the description above.
