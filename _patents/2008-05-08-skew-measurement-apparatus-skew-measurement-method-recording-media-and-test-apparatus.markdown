Technical Field","The present invention relates to a skew measurement apparatus, a skew measurement method, a recording medium, and a test apparatus. In particular, the present invention relates to a skew measurement apparatus, a skew measurement method, a recording medium, and a test apparatus for measuring skew of a plurality of signal under measurement using a digital comparator such as a voltage comparator.","2. Related Art","Skew refers to the timing difference between a plurality of signals output from a plurality of signal sources. Conventional skew measurement methods use a time interval analyzer or a frequency counter to statistically estimate the skew. For example, Wavecrest Corp., Jitter Analysis Clock Solutions, 1998 discloses an exemplary skew measurement using a time interval analyzer. As another skew measurement example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,127,018 discloses a technique for obtaining instantaneous phases of clock signals under measurement and obtaining the clock skew from the initial phase difference between these instantaneous phases.","The clock skew measurement method using the time interval analyzer, however, has dead time after each single measurement during which another measurement cannot be performed, and therefore a long sampling time is required to achieve the desired measurement accuracy. Since waveform measurement accuracy of approximately 8 bits is required to accurately calculate the initial phase of the instantaneous phase of the clock signal under measurement using the analysis technique disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,127,018, this technique cannot be applied to a semiconductor test apparatus that samples a waveform with a 1-bit comparator.","Therefore, it is an object of an aspect of the innovations herein to provide a skew measurement apparatus, a skew measurement method, a recording medium, and a test apparatus, which are capable of overcoming the above drawbacks accompanying the related art. The above and other objects can be achieved by combinations described in the independent claims. The dependent claims define further advantageous and exemplary combinations of the innovations herein.","According to a first aspect related to the innovations herein, one exemplary skew measurement apparatus may include a skew measurement apparatus, including sampling sections that each sample one of a plurality of signals under measurement having a cycle T, a waveform reconfiguring section that shapes a reconfigured waveform having the cycle T by rearranging ordinal ranks of sample values of the signal under measurement sampled by each sampling section, a distribution generating section that generates a timing distribution of edges in the reconfigured waveform of each signal under measurement, and a skew calculating section that calculates skew between the signals under measurement being compared based on the timing distribution of each signal under measurement. The sampling sections may each sample the corresponding signal under measurement having the cycle T a certain number of times N while the signal under measurement repeats for M cycles, where M and N are coprime. The waveform reconfiguring section may rearrange initial ordinal ranks k of the sample values sampled by the sampling sections to have reconfigured ordinal ranks i by inputting the initial ordinal ranks k into an expression i=k\u00b7M mod N, where k is expressed by integers from 0 to N\u22121, and may use these rearranged sample values to shape the reconfigured waveform having the cycle T.","The skew calculating section may calculate the skew as a difference between expected values of the timing distributions of the signals under measurement being compared or to be a minimum difference or a maximum difference between timing distribution ends of the signals under measurement being compared. The distribution generating section may include a unit-interval waveform generating section that generates a plurality of unit-interval waveforms by dividing the reconfigured waveform into a plurality of unit intervals, an aggregate value calculating section that calculates an aggregate value at each phase in each of the plurality of unit-interval waveforms by adding together the sample values at the same phase of each unit-interval waveform, and a difference calculating section that calculates a difference between each pair of aggregate values at adjacent phases. The distribution generating section may generate the timing distribution based on the differences calculated by the difference calculating sections.","The distribution generating section may further include a waveform inverting section that inverts the unit-interval waveforms generated by the unit-interval waveform generating section, and the aggregate value calculating section may add the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms having rising edges to the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms having falling edges that are inverted by the waveform inverting section, or may add the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms having falling edges to the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms having rising edges that are inverted by the waveform inverting section. The skew measurement apparatus may further include a prescribed bit unit-interval waveform group selecting section that selects the unit-interval waveforms generated by the unit-interval waveform generating section at prescribed bit intervals in the signal under measurement, and the aggregate value calculating section may add together the sample values of each unit-interval waveform in the group selected by the prescribed bit unit-interval waveform group selecting section. The aggregate value calculating section may add together the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms having rising edges or the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms having falling edges.","The skew measurement apparatus may further include an identical data sequence unit-interval waveform group selecting section that selects, from among the unit-interval waveforms generated by the unit-interval waveform generating section, a group of unit-interval waveforms having identical data sequences in the signal under measurement immediately prior thereto, and the aggregate value calculating section may add together the sample values of each unit-interval waveform in the group selected by the identical data sequence unit-interval waveform group selecting section. The skew measurement apparatus may further include a prescribed bit unit-interval waveform group selecting section that selects the unit-interval waveforms generated by the unit-interval waveform generating section at prescribed bit intervals in each signal under measurement, and the aggregate value calculating section may add the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms having rising edges to the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms having falling edges that are inverted by the waveform inverting section in the group of unit-interval waveforms selected by the prescribed bit unit-interval waveform group selecting section.","The configurations described above can be adopted in a similar manner to provide a skew measurement method, a recording medium storing thereon a program used by the skew measurement apparatus, and a test apparatus that supplies a test signal to a device under test to test the device under test. The test apparatus may further include a skew notification section that that provides notification concerning the skew calculated by the skew calculating section, which is the skew between the signals under measurement, and a frequency characteristic adjusting section that adjusts a frequency characteristic of the test signal to decrease the skew according to the skew as notified by the skew notification section.","The summary clause does not necessarily describe all necessary features of the embodiments of the present invention. The present invention may also be a sub-combination of the features described above. The above and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description of the embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Hereinafter, some embodiments of the present invention will be described. The embodiments do not limit the invention according to the claims, and all the combinations of the features described in the embodiments are not necessarily essential to means provided by aspects of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","10","20","10","20"]},"As shown in , the skew measurement apparatus  is provided with a plurality of sampling sections  and a plurality of skew evaluating section , and may also be provided with a memory . The skew measurement apparatus  may be provided with a number of sampling sections equal to the number of signal under measurement. The skew evaluating section  includes a waveform processing section  and a skew calculating section . The skew evaluating section  may include a plurality of waveform processing sections . The skew evaluating section  may include a number of waveform processing sections  equal to the number of sampling sections .","The following describes the skew measurement apparatus  as having two sampling sections  and two waveform processing sections , but the skew measurement apparatus  is not limited to this configuration. In the present embodiment, one of the sampling sections  receives the signal under measurement  and the other sampling section  receives the signal under measurement . One of the waveform processing sections  may correspond to one of the sampling sections , and the other waveform processing section  may correspond to the other sampling section .","The sampling sections  sample the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement  having a cycle T. The sampling sections  may sample the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement  having the cycle T a certain number of times N while the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement  repeat for M cycles, where M and N are coprime. The following describes one of the sampling sections  receiving the signal under measurement , but the sampling section  that receives the signal under measurement  can sample the signal under measurement  in the same manner. The sampling section  samples the input signal under measurement  with a sampling cycle Ts, based on a strobe timing , for example, to shape an input waveform X[k] of the input signal under measurement . Here, k represents the ordinal rank of the sample values sampled by the sampling section , and may be an integer from 0 to N\u22121. The integer k represents the initial sampling ordinal rank and the value of k in the input waveform X[k] increases in the sampled order.","The sampling section  is an AD converter or a voltage comparator (sometimes referred to hereinafter as an \u201cADC\u201d), for example. The sampling section  may be a digital comparator or a waveform digitizer. The resolution of the ADC is 1 bit or 1.6 bits, for example. When the ADC with a 1-bit resolution is used, the sample values of the input waveform X[k] may be expressed by binary logic values, such as 0 and 1. When the ADC with a 1.6-bit resolution is used, the sample values of the input waveform X[k] may be expressed by three values. The sampling section  is not limited to sampling the signal under measurement  only while the signal under measurement  having the cycle T is repeating for M cycles. For example, the sampling section  may sample the signal under measurement  while the signal under measurement  is repeating for 5M cycles.","The memory  may store sampling results and the like of the sampling section . For example, the memory  stores sample values of the input waveforms X[k] corresponding to the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement  respectively, obtained by the sampling section  sampling the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement , in association with k indicating the initial ordinal rank with an integer from 0 to N\u22121.","The skew evaluating section  calculates an edge timing distribution for each of the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement , and outputs the skew between the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement . The skew evaluating section  may output the deterministic skew. The skew evaluating section  may obtain the skew between the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement  by reading the input waveforms X[k] corresponding to the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement  that are stored in the memory .","Upon receiving the input waveform X[k] acquired from the memory , the waveform processing section  outputs the statistical value of the edge timing distribution of the signal under measurement , for example. If the input waveform X[k] of the signal under measurement  is input, the waveform processing section  outputs the statistical value of the edge timing distribution of the signal under measurement  in the same manner as signal under measurement . The waveform processing section  has a waveform reconfiguring section , a distribution generating section , and a statistical value calculating section .","The waveform reconfiguring section  rearranges the order of the sample values of the input waveform X[k] sampled by the sampling section  to shape a reconfigured waveform X[i] having a cycle T. Here, i represents the rearranged ordinal rank. The relationship between the rearranged ordinal rank i and the initial ordinal rank k is shown by Expression 1, and i may be an integer from 0 to N\u22121. When M is expressed by M=nN+1, where n is any natural number, the rearranging process described above can be omitted since i=k.\n\n=()mod \u2003\u2003Expression 1\n","When the signal under measurement  or the signal under measurement  has the cycle T and M and N are coprime, the sampling section  can sample the signal under measurement  or the signal under measurement  with a cycle Te that is shorter than a sampling cycle Ts. This effective sampling cycle Te is shown by Expression 2. Hereinafter, the effective sampling cycle Te is sometimes referred to as an \u201cequivalent sampling time interval\u201d.\n\n\u2003\u2003Expression 2\n","The distribution generating section  generates a timing distribution of the edges in the reconfigured waveform X[i]. This distribution is sometimes referred to hereinafter as an \u201cedge timing distribution,\u201d and the edge timing distribution is an example of the timing distribution. The edge timing distribution may be a PDF of the timing of each edge in the signal under measurement .","The statistical value calculating section  calculates the statistical value of the edge timing distribution. The statistical value calculating section  may calculate an expected value of the edge timing distribution and a distribution width of the edge timing distribution as the statistical value. Here, the expected value may be an average value. The distribution width may be an indicator of the range of the data variation, such as a variance, a standard deviation, a quartile deviation, an RMS value, a peak-to-peak value, or a half width. In the present embodiment, the phrase \u201cdistribution ends\u201d refers to both ends of the distribution width, which are the minimum value and the maximum value of the edge timing distribution, for example. The distribution ends may be obtained using the average value of the edge timing distribution and the distribution width of the standard deviation or the like.","The skew calculating section  may calculate the skew between the signal under measurement  and the signal under measurement  being compared based on the edge timing distributions of each of these signals. The skew calculating section  may output the skew as the difference between the expected value of the edge timing distribution of the signal under measurement  and the expected value of the edge timing distribution of the signal under measurement . The skew calculating section  may calculate the difference between the distribution ends of the edge timing distribution of the signal under measurement  and the distribution ends of the edge timing distribution of the signal under measurement  and output the difference between the minimum values or the difference between the maximum values of the distribution ends as the skew.","The skew measurement apparatus  may be hardware or may be software that causes a processor, not shown, to execute a process. The processor may be a CPU or a computer controlling the process. The functions of the elements included in the skew evaluating section  are not strictly separated. For example, the statistical value calculating section  may have the functions of the distribution generating section  and the skew calculating section  may have the functions of the waveform processing section .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["140","140","142","144","146","144","202","208","210","204","206","140","10","140","20"],"sub":["S","S"]},"Upon receiving the reconfigured waveform X[i] from the waveform reconfiguring section , the unit-interval waveform generating section  divides X[i] into a prescribed number of unit intervals Tu to generate a plurality of unit-interval waveforms X[m]. The unit-interval waveform generating section  desirably divides the reconfigured waveform X[i] such that each unit-interval waveform X[m] has an edge roughly in the center.","Here, the coefficient Lu and the bit period Tb, which represents the bit time interval of the signal under measurement , are used to express Tu as Tu=Lu\u00b7Tb. If Lu=1, for example, Tu may be equal to the bit period Tb representing the bit time interval of the signal under measurement , and Tu is desirably chosen to be a value such that Tu\/Te is equal to a positive integer. It is desirable that Lu be a positive integer. The ordinal rank of a certain unit-interval waveform X[m] in the plurality of unit-interval waveforms X[m] is represented by p. For example, the number Nu of unit-interval waveforms X[m] included in the sampled signal under measurement  is used to express p as an integer from 1 to Nu. The number Nu may be greater than N, depending on the sampling period of the signal under measurement .","The ordinal rank of the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms X[m] is represented by m. Hereinafter, m is sometimes referred to as the \u201cordinal rank after division\u201d. The relation between the ordinal rank after division m and the reconfigured ordinal rank i is shown by Expression 3. In Expression 3, Tu\/Te represents the number of sample values included in each unit-interval waveform X[m]. The ordinal rank after division m is represented by an integer from 0 to (Tu\/Te)\u22121.\n\nmod()=mod()\u2003\u2003Expression 3\n","The unit-interval waveform group selecting section  may generate a unit-interval waveform group by selecting unit-interval waveforms X[m] having a prescribed feature from among the plurality of unit-interval waveforms X[m] generated by the unit-interval waveform generating section  dividing the reconfigured waveform X[i]. For example, the unit-interval waveform group selecting section  selects only the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having a rising edge or only the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having a falling edge. If the ADC with a 1-bit resolution is used, the unit-interval waveform group selecting section  may select the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having a rising edge by selecting only the unit-interval waveforms X[m] in which the first sample value is logic L. In the same manner, the unit-interval waveform group selecting section  may select the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having a falling edge by selecting only the unit-interval waveforms X[m] in which the first sample value is logic H.","The waveform inverting section  may invert the unit-interval waveforms X[m] generated by the unit-interval waveform generating section . By doing this, the waveform inverting section  can invert the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having falling edges to be unit-interval waveforms X[m] having rising edges. It should be noted that the edge timing of the edges in the unit-interval waveforms X[m] does not change even when the unit-interval waveform group selecting section  inverts the unit-interval waveforms X[m].","The aggregate value calculating section  adds the sample values of identical phases in the plurality of unit-interval waveforms X[m] to obtain an aggregate value for each phase. For example, the aggregate value calculating section  may calculate the aggregate value at each ordinal rank after division m for each unit-interval waveform X[m] by adding together the sample values at each of the ordinal ranks after division m, which has a relation to the reconfigured ordinal ranks i as expressed by m=i mod (N\u00b7Tu\/T), included in the unit-interval waveform X[m]. The aggregate value calculating section  may add the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having rising edges and the inverted sample values of the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having falling edges that are inverted by the waveform inverting section . The aggregate value calculating section  may instead add the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having falling edges and the inverted sample values of the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having rising edges that are inverted by the waveform inverting section .","The aggregate value calculating section  may instead add only the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having rising edges, or may add only the sample values of the unit-interval waveforms X[m] having falling edges. For example, the skew of the rising edges and of the falling edges is different if the signal under measurement  is a clock signal with a duty ratio other than 50%. Even if the signal under measurement  is such a signal, the skew measurement apparatus  described above can accurately measure both the skew of the falling edges and the skew of the rising edges respectively.","The difference calculating section  calculates the difference between two aggregate values in adjacent phases. For example, the difference calculating section  calculates the difference between aggregate values having adjacent ordinal ranks after division m for the aggregate value at each ordinal rank after division m in the plurality of unit-interval waveforms X[m]. The distribution generating section  generates the timing distribution based on the differences calculated by the difference calculating section . For example, the distribution generating section  may generate the edge timing distribution in which the differences calculated by the difference calculating section  are associated with the ordinal rank after division m.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["146","146","144","146","302","304","302"]},"The distribution width calculating section  may calculate the distribution width of the edge timing distribution. By doing this, the distribution width calculating section  can calculate the width of the fluctuation of the edge timing distribution on the time axis. The distribution width calculating section  may have a standard deviation calculating section , a maximum value calculating section , a minimum value calculating section , and a peak-to-peak calculating section . The standard deviation calculating section  calculates the standard deviation of the edge timing distribution, as an example of the distribution width. The maximum value calculating section  calculates the maximum value of the edge timing distribution, as an example of the distribution width. The minimum value calculating section  calculates the minimum value of the edge timing distribution, as an example of the distribution width. The peak-to-peak calculating section  may calculate the peak-to-peak value, which is an example of the distribution width. The peak-to-peak calculating section  may calculate the peak-to-peak value by subtracting the minimum value calculated by the minimum value calculating section  from the maximum value calculated by the maximum value calculating section .","By adopting the configuration described above, the waveform processing section  can generate the edge timing of the signal under measurement  based on the sampled input waveform X[k]. The waveform processing section  can also calculate the statistical value of the edge timing distribution by calculating the statistical value of the generated edge timing distribution.
