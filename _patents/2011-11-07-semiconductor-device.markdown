Field of the Invention","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relates to a method for fabricating a semiconductor device, and, more particularly, to a high-voltage semiconductor device.","2. Description of Related Art","In general, integrated, circuits each including more than one high-voltage transistors arrayed on a chip along with low-voltage circuits are widely used in diverse electrical application fields. Among the high-voltage semiconductor devices which hold significant positions in the integrated circuits are an extended drain MOS (EDMOS) transistor and a laterally double diffused MOS (LDMOS) transistor.","It is well known that resistivity or specific on resistance RSP should be decreased in order to improve an operation characteristic of a high-voltage semiconductor devise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , the conventional EDMOS transistor includes a P-type first well  and an N-type second well  formed over a substrate  with a device isolation layer  formed therein to contact each other, a gate electrode  simultaneously crossing the P-type first well  and the N-type second well  over the substrate , a gate insulation layer  interposed between the gate electrode  and the substrate , an N-type source region  formed over the P-type first well  on one side of the gate electrode , an N-type drain region  formed over the N-type second well  on another side of the gate electrode , and a P-type pickup region  formed over the P-type first well .","In an EDMOS transistor having the above structure, a specific on resistance RSP is defined as a multiplication of an on resistance RON by a half-pitch HP, which is the length of the transistor, by the width W of the transistor (RSP=RON\u00d7HP\u00d7w). Herein, the half-pitch HP is defined as a distance from the N-type source region  to the N-type drain region , and the on resistance RON is defined as a summation of a channel resistance RCH of a channel region C, an accumulation resistance RACC of an accumulation region A, a drift resistance RDRIFT of a drift region D, and other resistances REST of the other regions (RON=RCH+RACC+RDRIFT+REXT).","However, a conventional semiconductor device characteristic has its channel resistance RCH increasing in direct proportion to an of channel length. For this reason, when the effective channel length increases, the channel resistance RCH increases as well to thereby increase the specific on resistance RSP.","In particular, the P-type first well  and the N-type second well  for a high-voltage semiconductor device are formed by sequentially performing an ion implantation process and a thermal treatment for activating implanted impurities. However, since the P-type first well  and the N-type second well  have different conductive types, an increase in the effective channel length originating from the lateral diffusion of the impurities implanted during the thermal treatment function as a direct cause for deteriorated on resistance RON. To be specific, due to the difference in the lateral diffusion speeds of the impurities implanted into the P-type first well  and the N-type second well  during the thermal treatment for forming the -type first well  and the N-type second well , the position of the interface between the P-type first well  and the N-type second well  moves toward the ft type second well  from a predetermined position to thereby increase the effective channel length. As the effective channel length increases, the on resistance RON characteristic is deteriorated, which is problematic.","The deterioration in the on resistance RON caused by the lateral, diffusion is accelerated during a subsequent thermal treatment, and not only the EDMOS transistor but also an LDMOS transistor have the same problem or deteriorated on resistance RON caused by the lateral diffusion.","An embodiment of the present invention devised to resolve the above problems of conventional technology is directed to a high-voltage semiconductor device that can reduce a specific on resistance RSP.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention can be understood by the following description, and become apparent with reference to the embodiments of the present invention. Also, it is obvious to those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains that the objects and advantages of the present invention can be realized by the means as claimed and combinations thereof.","In accordance with en embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor device includes: a first conductive-type first well and a second conductive-type second well configured over a substrate to contact each other; a second conductive-type anti-diffusion region configured in an interface where the first conductive-type first well contacts the second conductive-type second well over the substrate; and a gate electrode configured to simultaneously cross the first conductive-type first well, the second conductive-type anti-diffusion region, and the second conductive-type second well over the substrate.","The second conductive-type anti-diffusion region may be formed over the first conductive-type first well to contact the interface where the first conductive-type first well contacts the second conductive-type second well. An impurity doping concentration of the second conductive-type anti-diffusion region may be higher than impurity doping concentrations of the first conductive-type first well and the second conductive-type second well.","The semiconductor device further includes: a device isolation layer configured over the substrate; a second conductive-type source region configured over the first conductive-type first well to be arrayed at one end of one side of the gate electrode; and a second conductive-type drain region configured over the second conductive-type second well to be spaced apart from one end of another side of the gate electrode by a predetermined distance.","The second conductive-type anti-diffusion region may be fully depleted based on a voltage supplied to the second conductive-type drain region. The device isolation layer positioned between the gate electrode and the second conductive-type drain region may be partially overlapped with a lower portion of the gate electrode.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor device includes: a second conductive-type deep well configured over a substrate; a first conductive-type well configured over the second conductive-type deep well; a second conductive-type anti-diffusion region configured in the second conductive-type deep well to contact a sidewall of the first conductive-type well; and a gate electrode configured to simultaneously cross the first conductive-type well, the second conductive-type anti-diffusion region, and the second conductive-type deep well over the substrate.","An impurity doping concentration of the anti-diffusion region may be higher than impurity doping concentrations of the second conductive-type deep well and the first conductive-type well.","The semiconductor device may further include: a device isolation layer configured over the substrate; a second conductive-type source region configured over the first conductive-type well to be arrayed at one end of one side of the gate electrode; and a second conductive-type drain region configured over the second conductive-type deep well to be spaced apart from one end of another side of the gate electrode by a predetermined distance.","The second conductive-type anti-diffusion region may be fully depleted based on a voltage supplied to the second conductive-type drain region.
