{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many mobile computing devices, such as mobile phones, are configured to utilize a variety of context-aware applications in order to provide dynamic feedback to users. As used herein, the term \u201ccontext-aware\u201d refers to a capability of certain applications or programs implemented on mobile computing devices to detect, or sense, the changing environment and react appropriately. Such context-aware applications often rely on continuous or frequent sensing of users' context. A user's context may include, for example, information such as a location, a transportation mode, a group state of the user, or a work state of the user, among others. However, acquiring contextual information can be expensive on battery-operated mobile devices, since the sensing of the user's context may consume a large amount of battery power.","The following presents a simplified summary of the innovation in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the claimed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key nor critical elements of the claimed subject matter nor delineate the scope of the subject innovation. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the claimed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","An embodiment provides a method for rule-based context acquisition. The method includes accepting a request for target context from an application at a context acquisition system and identifying context rules relating to the target context using a rule-based inference cache. The method also includes determining an inferred value of the target context based on previously-acquired contexts and the context rules. If the inferred value of the target context cannot be determined based on the previously-acquired contexts and the context rules, the method further includes executing a first step of a sensing plan for acquiring an inferred value of the target context using a rule-based acquisition planner, wherein first step is determined based on the context rules or a cost, or any combination thereof. The method also includes executing any of a number of subsequent steps of the sensing plan until the inferred value of the target context is obtained, wherein each of the subsequent steps is individually determined based on the context rules, the cost, or a result of a previous step of the sensing plan, or any combinations thereof.","Another embodiment provides a system for rule-based context acquisition. The system includes a rule-based inference cache configured to accept a request for target context from an application and identify context rules relating to the target context, wherein the context rules are stored within the rule-based inference cache. The system also includes a rule-based acquisition planner configured to execute a first step of a sensing plan for acquiring an inferred value of the target context, wherein the first step is determined based on the context rules or a cost, or any combination thereof. The rule-based acquisition planner is further configured to execute a second step of the sensing plan, wherein the second step is determined based on the context rules, the cost, or a result of the first step of the sensing plan, or any combinations thereof.","In addition, another embodiment provides one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media for storing computer-readable instructions. The computer-readable instructions provide a rule-based context acquisition system when executed by one or more processing devices. The computer-readable instructions include code configured to accept a request for target context from an application and attempt to determine an inferred value of the target context according to context rules relating to the target context using a rule-based inference cache. The computer-readable instructions also include code configured to develop and execute each of a number of steps of a sensing plan using a rule-based acquisition planner if the inferred value is not determined according to the context rules.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form; these concepts are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The same numbers are used throughout the disclosure and figures to reference like components and features.

A user of a computing device may authorize the context acquisition system to determine the contextual information. In various embodiments, the contextual information may be in the form of a binary value, i.e., true or false. For example, if a particular context relates to whether a user is driving, the value of the context is true if it is determined that the user is driving. Otherwise, the value of the context is false. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the contextual information may be in the form of real values.","The contextual information may include a specific target context requested by a particular context-aware application. The target context may be determined by the context acquisition system using a rule-based inference cache and a rule-based acquisition planner. The rule-based inference cache may be used to identify context rules relating to the specific target context, wherein the context rules may be combined into a logical expression tree that defines the inference procedure for determining the value of the particular target context. The context rules may include, for example, logical expressions that are used to determine whether a user is outside based on a number of other conditions, such as whether the user is driving, at home, or in a meeting. In various embodiments, the context rules may be general, e.g., whether a user is talking on the phone, or specific, e.g., whether a particular user is talking on the phone with a particular contact, depending on the particular target context. The rule-based inference cache may also include a context rule miner configured to create the context rules that are utilized by the context acquisition system. Moreover, the rule-based acquisition planner may be used to determine and execute a sensing plan for obtaining an inferred value of the target context. The inferred value may be based on both the context rules and sensed context obtained from any of a number of possible sensing procedures.","As a preliminary matter, some of the figures describe concepts in the context of one or more structural components, variously referred to as functionality, modules, features, elements, etc. The various components shown in the figures can be implemented in any manner, for example, by software, hardware (e.g., discreet logic components, etc.), firmware, and so on, or any combination of these implementations.

Such components may include a rule-based inference cache , a context rule miner , a rule-based acquisition planner , a classifier storage module , and a raw sensor data cache , among others. The rule-based inference cache  may be used to attempt to infer desired contextual information based on context rules. The context rules may include logical expressions that are used to define the value of a particular target context, such as, for example, whether a user is driving, outside, inside, at home, or in a meeting.","Context rules may be derived using any of a number of data mining algorithms, such as an association rule mining algorithm. For example, in some embodiments, the Apriori algorithm may be utilized to determine context rules using association rule mining techniques. Furthermore, such context rules may be created by the context rule miner  based on context history, wherein the context history may include sensing data from previous instances of the context acquisition procedure. Moreover, the context rules may also be created by the context rule miner  in response to input from a developer of the context acquisition system  or, in some embodiments, in response to direct input from a user of the computing system .","The context acquisition system  may rely on input from the context-aware applications  in order to generate the context rules within the context rule miner . For example, in various embodiments, a \u201cput function\u201d  may be used to populate context history within the context acquisition system .

If the exact value of the target context is identified within the rule-based inference cache , it may be automatically returned to the context-aware application . However, if the exact value of the target context is not found within the rule-based inference cache , the rule-based inference cache  may directly query the context rule miner  to determine whether appropriate context rules are available for acquiring the target context, as indicated by the arrow . Moreover, the rule-based inference cache  may also forward the request for the target context to the rule-based acquisition planner , as indicated by the arrow .","The rule-based acquisition planner  may develop a plan for acquiring the specific target context based on the context history and the available sensors within the computing system. The rule-based acquisition planner  may be communicably coupled to the context rule miner  and may communicate with the context rule miner  in order to obtain context rules relating to the target context, as indicated by the arrow .

In some embodiments, the sensing plan may be sent to the classifier storage module , as indicated by the arrow , in order to identify corresponding classifiers for each sensing procedure specified by the sensing plan. For example, the classifier specified by the sensing plan may be an \u201cIs Walking\u201d classifier  or an \u201cIs At Home\u201d classifier .

The raw sensor data cache  may determine whether the result of the requested sensing procedure is already contained within the cache . If the result of the requested sensing procedure is found, the result may be returned to the rule-based acquisition planner  and used to determine the next step of the sensing plan. However, if the result of the requested sensing procedure is not found, the computing system  may utilize any of a variety of sensors to obtain the contextual information relating to the specific classifier. For example, if the Is Walking classifier  has been specified by the rule-based acquisition planner , the accelerometer or global positioning system (GPS) may be probed to deduce whether a user of the computing system  is walking. As another example, if the Is At Home classifier  has been specified, the microphone, GPS, or accelerometer may be probed to deduce whether the user of the computing system  is at home. Moreover, in various embodiments, the classifier storage module  or the raw sensor data cache , or both, may be included within the rule-based acquisition planner .","In various embodiments, once the value of the target context has been determined by the context acquisition system , the value may be returned to the context-aware application  that initiated the get function .

Each logical expression tree may include a combination of multiple related context rules .

The AND operator  may indicate that positive, or \u201ctrue,\u201d results for both of two possible values establish a positive, or true, result for the AND operation. For example, a \u201cDriving: False\u201d context value  and a \u201cWalking: False\u201d context value  constitute a positive result for the AND operation.

Therefore, if one of the possible context values branching from the OR operator  is true, it may be verified that the Indoor: True target context value  is also true. For example, if an Indoor: True context value  is true, it follows that the Indoor: True target context value  is true. Moreover, it may be inferred that, if an \u201cAt Home: True\u201d context value , an \u201cIn Meeting: True\u201d context value , or an \u201cIn Office: True\u201d context value  is true, the Indoor: True target context value  is also true. This inference may be based on the fact that it is either highly unlikely or impossible that a user may be at home, in a meeting, or in their office and be outside at the same time. Therefore, the user may be inferred to be indoors. Furthermore, the user may also be inferred to be indoors if the user is neither driving nor walking, or is neither alone nor walking.","In various embodiments, the AND\/OR tree  may be tailored to the specific personal and environmental characteristics of each user.

Moreover, the rule-based acquisition planner may continue to generate a next step of the sensing plan until the inferred value is determined. Once the inferred value is obtained, it may be output to the application that initiated the instance of the method .","In some embodiments, two sequential steps, e.g., the first step and the second step, of the sensing plan may be considered to be concurrent, or co-occurring, if the steps are executed within a specified window of time. The specified window of time may be referred to as a \u201cbasket size.\u201d The basket size may be dynamically altered according to the specific target context, or according to the specific sensing procedures specified by the steps. For example, it may be inferred that a user is walking if the user was walking within the last five minutes. However, it may not be inferred that a user is talking on the phone because the user was talking on the phone within the last five minutes.","In various embodiments, the rule-based acquisition planner
