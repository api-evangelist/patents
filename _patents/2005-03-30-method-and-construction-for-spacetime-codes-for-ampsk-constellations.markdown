title: Method and construction for space-time codes for AM-PSK constellations
abstract: Space-time codes are developed for multi-radii AM-PSK constellations. Further, a “super-unified” space-time code construction is developed that incorporates multi-radii AM-PSK codes with the Lu-Kumar unified codes. The multi-radii space-time codes achieve the rate-diversity tradeoff—that is, the codes transmits information at the maximum rate possible for the given signaling constellation and the achieved transmit diversity level.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to PSK-modulated space-time codes, and more particularly, to the method and construction of space-time codes for AM-PSK constellations.","2. Description of the Related Art","Recent advances in coding theory include space-time codes which provide diversity in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems over fading channels with channel coding across a small number of transmit antennas. For wireless communication systems, a number of challenges arise from the harsh RF propagation environment characterized by channel fading and co-channel interference (CCI). Channel fading can be attributed to diffuse and specular multipath, while CCI arises from reuse of radio resources. Interleaved coded modulation on the transmit side of the system and multiple antennas on the receive side are standard methods used in wireless communication systems to combat time-varying fading and to mitigate interference. Both are examples of diversity techniques.","Simple transmit diversity schemes (in which, for example, a delayed replica of the transmitted signal is retransmitted through a second, spatially-independent antenna and the two signals are coherently combined at the receiver by a channel equalizer) have also been considered within the wireless communications industry as a method to combat multipath fading. From a coding perspective, such transmit diversity schemes amount to repetition codes and encourage consideration of more sophisticated code designs. Information-theoretic studies have demonstrated that the capacity of multi-antenna systems significantly exceeds that of conventional single-antenna systems for fading channels. The challenge of designing channel codes for high capacity multi-antenna systems has led to the development of \u201cspace-time codes,\u201d in which coding is performed across the spatial dimension (e.g, antenna channels) as well as time.","Space-time codes are designed for MIMO communication systems that employ multiple transmit antennas to achieve spatial diversity. The modulated code words are often presented as complex-values M\u00d7T matrices in which the (m,t)-th entry srepresents the discrete baseband signal transmitted from the m-th transmit antenna at time t. The initial work on space-time codes by Guey et al. and Tarokh et al. showed that the transmit diversity achieved by a space-time code is equal to the minimum rank among the set of matrices produced as differences between distinct modulated code words. There is a tradeoff between achievable transmission rate and achievable transmit diversity level for space-time codes. Full-rank space-time codes can achieve transmission rates no greater than one symbol per transmission interval. For rank d space-time codes, the maximum transmission rate is M\u2212d+1 symbols per transmission interval. Equivalently, the size of an M\u00d7T rank-d space-time code cannot exceed q, where q is the size of the signaling constellation. Codes meeting this upper limit are referred to as maximal.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,678,263, Hammons and El Gamal developed the so-called binary rank criteria that allowed, for the first time, the algebraic design of space-time codes achieving maximal spatial diversity of all orders. The binary rank criteria for BPSK- and QPSK-modulated space-time codes are based on the observation that the difference between two modulated code words will be of full rank, as a matrix over the complex field C, whenever a certain binary projection of the difference matrix is of full rank over the binary field GF(2). From the binary rank criteria, Hammons and El Gamal developed the general Stacking Construction for full-diversity space-time codes, examples of which include block codes derived from Galois fields\/rings and rate 1\/M convolutional codes of optimal d. The binary rank criteria showed that the algebraically-designed, full-rank, BPSK-modulated space-time codes could be lifted to full-rank, QPSK-modulated space-time codes. In particular, Hammons and El Gamal showed that, if the linear binary codes A and B produce full-rank space-time codes when BPSK modulated, then the quaternary code C=A+2B produces a full-rank space-time code under QPSK modulation. They referred to this construction as the Dyadic Construction.","Building on the Hammons-El Gamal framework, Liu et al. showed how the same techniques could be extended to 4-QAM constellations. Thereafter, Lu and Kumar developed a generalization of that framework applicable to both the 4-QAM and the general 2-PSK cases. They showed that the Dyadic Construction extends to 2-PSK modulation in the natural way\u2014i.e., if the linear binary codes A, A, . . . , Aproduce full-rank space-time codes under BPSK modulation, then the 2-ary code",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"m","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mn":"2","mi":"i"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["A","i"]}}}}}},"br":{},"sup":["m","m","m"]},"Dual radii AM-PSK constellations offer potential significant advantages over conventional PSK constellations. For example, Belzer et al. show that the 8-ary AM-PSK constellation consisting of two PQSK rings in a star configuration provides significantly higher capacity on partially coherent AWGN, Rayleigh, and Rician fading channels. However, nothing in the prior art teaches the development of general space-time code constructions for AM-PSK constellations or the unification of such constructions with the Lu-Kumar space-time codes for PSK and QAM constellations. Accordingly, it would be desirable to be able to utilize space-time code constructions for AM-PSK constellations, especially such codes that are optimal with respect to the rate-diversity tradeoff.","In accordance with the present invention, space-time codes are developed for multi-radii AM-PSK constellations. Further, a \u201csuper-unified\u201d space-time code construction is developed that incorporates multi-radii AM-PSK codes with the Lu-Kumar unified codes. The multi-radii space-time codes achieve the rate-diversity tradeoff\u2014that is, the codes transmits information at the maximum rate possible for the given signaling constellation and the achieved transmit diversity level.","Throughout the drawing figures, like reference numerals will be understood to refer to like parts and components.","Referring to , by way of an example, a conventional digital cellular Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DSCDMA) base-station-to-mobile-station (or forward) link  is shown using a conventional convolutional encoder and Viterbi decoder.  also illustrates the mobile-station-to-base-station (or reverse) link.","At the transmit end, the system  in  comprises a data segmentation and framing module  where user information bits are assembled into fixed length frames from transmit data blocks . The N bits per frame are input to the base station's convolutional encoder  of rate r, which produces N\/r code symbols at the input of the channel interleaver . The channel interleaver  performs pseudo-random shuffling of code symbols, and outputs the re-arranged symbols to the spread spectrum modulator . The spread spectrum modulator  uses a user-specific transmit PN-code generator  to produce a spread spectrum signal which is carried on a RF carrier to the transmitter , where a high power amplifier coupled to the transmit antenna  radiates the signal to the base station. The techniques of spread spectrum modulation and RF transmission are well known art to one familiar with spread spectrum communications systems.","The signal received at the mobile station antenna  is amplified in the RF receiver  and demodulated by the spread spectrum demodulator , which uses the same PN-code generator  as used by the base station transmitter to de-spread the signal. The demodulated symbols are de-interleaved by the channel de-interleaver  and input to the Viterbi decoder . The decoded information bits are reconstructed using data block reconstruction  into receive data blocks  and forwarded to the data terminal equipment at the receive end.","With reference to , a digital cellular base-station-to-mobile-station link is shown to illustrate the implementation of space-time encoding and decoding in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. While CDMA system is used as an example, one familiar with the art would consider the present invention applicable to other types of wireless systems, which can employ other types of multiple access methods such as frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), and hybrid methods.","Transmit data blocks  from the data terminal equipment are segmented and framed  into fixed frame length and applied to the mobile's channel space-time encoder . The output from a channel encoder  is fed to the space-time formatter  which determines the parsing (allocation and presentation order) of the coded symbols to the various transmit antennas , , . The spatial formatter output is applied to the spread spectrum modulator  which uses a user specific PN-code generator  to create spread spectrum signals, carried on a RF carrier via base RF transmitter , to the mobile station transmitter. The transmitter, with high power amplifier coupled to the Transmit antenna, radiates the signals via separate transmit antennas to the mobile station.","The signal received at one or more mobile station antenna(s)  is amplified in the mobile RF receiver  and demodulated in a phase shift keying demodulator , which uses the same PN-code generator  as used by the base station transmitter, to de-spread the signal. The demodulated symbols are processed at space-time decoder  by the space-time de-formatter  and input to the channel decoder . The decoded information bits are reconstructed  into receive data blocks  and forwarded to the data terminal equipment at the receive end. Depending on the space-time code used, the de-formatter  and the decoder  can be grouped in a single maximum likelihood receiver.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["90","92","94","90","96","58","98","100","102","102","102","104","106"],"i":["a","b","c"]},"With continued reference to , the source generates k information symbols from a discrete alphabet X on the path  which are encoded by an error control code C by the space-time encoder . The space-time encoder  produces code words of length N over the symbol alphabet Y. The encoded symbols are mapped by the modulators , , , and so on, onto constellation points from a discrete, complex-valued signaling constellation for transmission across the channel. The modulated radio frequency signals for all of the L transmit antennas , , , and so on, are transmitted at the same time to the receiver space-time demodulator . The space-time channel decoder  decodes the signals to the received data path . As shown, the receiver provides M receive antennas to collect the incoming transmissions. The received baseband signals are subsequently decoded by the space-time decoder .","The present invention is concerned primarily with the design of space-time codes rather than the signal processing required to decode them. In most cases, the decoding employs known signal processing for maximum likelihood detection.","In the following discussion, notation is established and certain key ideas of the Lu-Kumar approach, upon which the novel space-time code constructions of the present invention are built, are explained. Following the discussion of the Lu-Kumar approach, new constructions of space-time codes for dual-radii and multi-radii AM-PSK constellations, in accordance with the present invention, are described. In addition, the novel AM-PSK constructions of the present invention are extended to produce a generalized AM-PSK code construction framework that includes the unified Lu-Kumar construction.","Let C be a code of length MT, with M=T, over the discrete alphabet \u03a9. The codewords of C are presented as M\u00d7T matrices in which the (m,t)-th entry a\u2208\u03a9 represents the information symbol that is modulated and transmitted from the m-th transmit antenna at transmission interval t. If all of the modulated code word matrices have rank at least d over C, then the space-time code is called an M\u00d7T rank-d code. In the special case that all of the modulated code words are of full rank M, the space-time code is called an M\u00d7T full-rank code.","There is a tradeoff between achievable transmission rate and achievable transmit diversity level for space-time codes. Full-rank space-time codes can achieve transmission rates no greater than one symbol per transmission interval. For rank d space-time codes, the maximum transmission rate is M\u2212d+1 symbols per transmission interval. Equivalently, the size of an M\u00d7T rank-d space-time code cannot exceed q, where q is the size of the signaling constellation \u03a9. Codes meeting this upper limit are referred to as maximal.","The work of Lu and Kumar established a general mathematical framework for the method of algebraic space-time code design initiated by Hammons and El Gamal in which the rank of modulated code words over the field C is inferred from the rank of their projections as matrices over the binary field F. The Lu-Kumar framework makes use of the ring Z[\u03b8] of algebraic integers associated with a primitive complex root of unity \u03b8.","The 2-PSK constellation consists of the points s=\u03b8, a\u2208Z={0,1,2, . . . , 2\u2032\u22121}, where \u03b8 is a complex, primitive 2-th root of unity. The connection between modulated space-time codes, with entries from Z[\u03b8]\u2282C, and binary codes over the field F={0,1} is through the isomorphism Z[\u03b8]\/(1\u2212\u03b8)\u2245F. The function \u03bc:Z[\u03b8]\u2192F denotes the corresponding projection modulo 1\u2212\u03b8. The set of M\u00d7T matrices over an alphabet \u03a9 is denoted by \u03a9. When A=[a] is a matrix with integer entries, \u03b8is written for the matrix whose (i,j)-th entry is \u03b8. For matrices A and B, the matrix A\u2299B is their Hermitian (i.e., componentwise) product.","The following propositions present the core technical facts underlying the Lu-Kumar approach to space-time code design over Z[\u03b8]. The first two results highlight key elementary properties of the ring Z[\u03b8]. The following two results are the Lu-Kumar generalization of the Hammons-El Gamal binary rank criteria.","Proposition 1\u2014Let \u03b8 be a complex, primitive 2-th root of unity.

In the new dual-radii and multi-radii space-time code constructions, the underlying AM-PSK constellations are determined by the algebraic integers used as the basis for the signaling. -are constellation diagrams for representative 8-ary, 16-ary, 32-ary, and 64-ary cases. When the constellation is normalized to unit average energy, the Euclidean distance between the closest constellation points can be used as a convenient figure-of-merit to judge the relative efficiency of the constellation.  provides a list of representative AM-PSK constellations corresponding to the constellation diagrams of -. In the case of the multi-radii constructions, the examples are for the special case \u2208=\u2208= . . . =\u2208=\u03bd, for which r=2\u03bd+1. Improvements in the normalized minimum distance should be expected if the \u2208are chosen without restriction.","For comparison with these representative AM-PSK examples, the normalized minimum distances for 2-PSK are as follows: 1.4142 for QPSK, 0.7654 for 8-PSK, 0.3902 for 16-PSK, 0.1960 for 32-PSK, and 0.0981 for 64-PSK. For 4-QAM, the corresponding normalized minimum distances are 1.4142 for 4-QAM (QPSK), 0.6325 for 16-QAM, and 0.3086 for 64-QAM. One sees that, for the moderate and intermediate constellation sizes, the new AM-PSK space-time codes fill a useful gap not covered by the Lu-Kumar unified construction.","Incorporation of the Lu-Kumar Unified Framework","The Lu-Kumar unified space-time code construction generalizes the basic 2-PSK dyadic construction to produce space-time codes for 2-PAM, 4-QAM, and other exotic higher-order constellations, by proper choice of design parameters. Remarkably, these codes achieve the rate-diversity tradeoff. The Lu-Kumar unified construction may be extended to an even more general construction that includes the novel multi-radii 2-PSK codes of the present invention (plus their generalization to other constellations). In general, the space-time codes produced by the novel \u201csuper-unified\u201d construction of the present invention also achieve the rate-diversity tradeoff. For ease of presentation, the unification results are described in two parts. First, the simpler dual-radii case is discussed, followed by a discussion of the general multi-radii case.","A.

As a corollary to Theorem 12, there is again the Special A construction in which one or more of the binary matrices Aare derived as functions of the nonbinary matrices C.

The Lu-Kumar unified space-time code construction extended the Hammons-El Gamal dyadic construction for QPSK-modulated space-time codes to provide codes achieving the rate-diversity tradeoff for all 2-PSK and 4-QAM signaling constellations. Applicant herein has used the Lu-Kumar framework to design novel space-time codes that achieve the rate-diversity tradeoff for multi-radii AM-PSK constellations, which fill a useful gap not covered by the Lu-Kumar unified construction. Applicant has also developed a novel, \u201csuper-unified,\u201d space-time code construction that unites both the Lu-Kumar unified codes and the new multi-radii AM-PSK codes in a single novel framework providing optimal space-time codes.","The AM-PSK constellations consisting of two or more rings of PSK modulation are of interest to communication systems requiring higher spectral efficiency than typical PSK-modulated systems and less stringent transmitter-receiver linearity requirements than typical QAM-modulated systems. One major aspect of the present invention provides optimal space-time code constructions that can be used with these modulation formats by MIMO communications systems to achieve higher transmission rates and greater reliability over wireless channels Another major aspect of the present invention provides a generalized AM-PSK code construction that is also optimal with respect to the rate-diversity tradeoff and provides through choice of parameters optimal codes for PAM, PSK, QAM, and multi-radii PSK modulation formats. This generalized construction enables a flexible MIMO communication system that can adapt its choice of modulation to meet system demands and channel capabilities while still providing optimal space-time coding."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The various aspects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will be more readily comprehended from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the appended drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 4","i":["a","d "],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 4"],"i":["a","d.
