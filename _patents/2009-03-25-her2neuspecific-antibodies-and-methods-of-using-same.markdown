No. 61\/041,649, filed Apr. 2, 2008, which application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This application includes one or more Sequence Listings pursuant to 37 C.F.R. 1.821 et seq., which are disclosed in both paper and computer-readable media, and which paper and computer-readable disclosures are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to novel 4D5 antibodies that specifically bind HER2\/neu, and particularly novel chimeric 4D5 antibodies to HER2\/neu, which have reduced glycosylation and altered effector functions as compared to known 4D5 antibodies. The invention also relates to methods of using the antibodies and compositions comprising them in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, and infectious disease.","2. Description of the Related Art","HER2\/neu and HER2\/neu Receptors","Cellular growth and differentiation processes involve growth factors that exert their actions through specific receptors such as the tyrosine kinases. The binding of ligand to a tyrosine kinase receptor triggers a cascade of events that eventually lead to cellular proliferation and differentiation. (Carpenter et al. (1979) Biochem. 48:193-216; Sachs et al. (1987) Cancer Res. 47:1981-8196). Tyrosine kinase receptors can be classified into several groups on the basis of sequence similarity and distinct features. One such family is the ErbB or epidermal growth factor receptor family, which includes multiple receptors known as HER-1 (also known as erbB-1 or EGFR), HER-2 or HER2\/neu (also known as erbB-2, c-neu, or p185), HER-3 (also known as erbB-3), and HER-4 (also known as erbB-4). (See, e.g., Carpenter et al., supra; Semba et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 82: 6497-6501; Coussens et al. (1985) Science, 230:1130-1139, Bargmann et al. (1986) Cell 45:649-657; Kraus et al. (1989) PNAS 86: 9193-9197; Carraway et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:14303-14306; and Plowman et al. (1993) Nature 366: 473-475; Tzahar et al. (1994) Biol. Chem. 269: 25226-25233).","The ErbB receptors play important roles in propagating signals regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis, both in normal developmental processes and in human tumorigenesis. (Slamon et al. (1989) Science 244:707-712). For example, the activation of erbB receptors is coupled to and stimulates downstream MAPK-Erk1\/2 and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PIK)\/AKT growth and survival pathways. The deregulation of these pathways in cancer has been linked to disease progression and refractoriness to therapy. (Fukazawa et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271:14554-14559; Tzahar et al. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16:5276-5287; Lange et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:31308-31316; Olayioye et al. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol. 18:5042-5051; Hackel et al. (1999) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 11:184-189). Activation of PIK\/AKT promotes cell survival and enhanced tumor aggressiveness, and AKT2 was reported to be activated and overexpressed in HER2\/neu-overexpressing breast cancers. (Shak (1999) Semin. Oncol. Suppl 12:71-77; Huang et al. (2000) Clinical Cancer Res. 7:2166-2174; Bacus et al. (2002) Oncogene 21:3532-3540).","Signaling by the ErbB family of receptors is initiated by ligand binding which triggers homo- or hetero-receptor dimerization, reciprocal tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails, and activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways. (Citri et al. (2003) Exp. Cell Res. 284:54). The availability of ligands that bind to and activate the ErbB receptors is mediated by various metalloproteases, such as the ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) family of zinc-dependent metalloproteases, which catalyze cell surface ectodomain shedding of specific proteins. (See Chang and Werb (2001) Trends in Cell Biology 11:537-543; Moss and Lambert (2002) Essays in Biochemistry 38:141-153; Seals and Courtneidge (2003) Genes and Development 17:7-30). Specifically, the ADAM family has been shown to cleave ligands responsible for activating the ErbB receptors, such as APP and Notch. (Blobel (2005) Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:32-43).","An important member of the ErbB family, HER2\/neu, is a 185 kDa receptor protein that was originally identified as the product of the transforming gene from neuroblastomas of chemically treated rats. HER2\/neu has been extensively investigated because of its role in several human carcinomas and in mammalian development. (Hynes and Stern (1994) Biochim et Biophys. Acta 1198:165-184; and Dougall et al. (1994) Oncogene 9:2109-2123; Lee et al. (1995) Nature 378:394-398). The human HER2\/neu gene and HER2\/neu protein are described in Semba et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 82:6497-6501 and Yamamoto et al. (1986) Nature 319:230-234, and the sequence is available in GenBank as accession number X03363. HER2\/neu comprises four domains: an extracellular domain to which ligand binds; a lipophilic transmembrane domain; a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; and a carboxyl-terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated. (Plowman et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 90:1746-1750). The sequence of the HER2\/neu extracellular (ECD) domain was described by Franklin et al. (2004) Cancer Cell. 5(4):317-328, and is available in Protein DataBank Record 1S78 (2004).","HER2\/neu functions as a growth factor receptor and is often expressed by tumors such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer and lung cancer. HER2\/neu is overexpressed in 25-30% of human breast and ovarian cancers, and is associated with aggressive clinical progression and poor prognosis in these patients. (Slamon et al. (1987) Science 235:177-182; Slamon et al. (1989) Science 244:707-712). Overexpression of HER2\/neu has also been observed in other carcinomas including carcinomas of the stomach, endometrium, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, pancreas and bladder. (See, e.g., King et al. (1985) Science 229:974; McCann et al. (1990) Cancer 65:88-92; Yonemura et al. (1991) Cancer Research 51:1034).","Activation of HER2\/neu has been correlated with reduced clinical responsiveness to hormone therapy in breast cancer patients. (Wright et. al. (1989) Cancer Res. 49:2087-2090; Kurokawa & Arteaga (2001) Clin. Cancer Res. 7:4436s-42s, 4411s-4412s). Indeed, HER2\/neu expression is sufficient to convey anti-estrogen resistance. (Benz et. al. (1993) Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 24:85-95). HER2\/neu, as well as HER-3, also appears to be involved in the onset of hormone resistance in prostate cancer patients. Approximately one-third of prostate cancer patients receive hormone therapy treatment aimed at disrupting the action of testicular and adrenal androgens. As with breast cancer, resistance is inevitable. Recent data suggests that signals emanating from HER2\/neu and HER-3 induce a \u201chormone-refractory\u201d state. (Mellinghoff et. al. (2004) Cancer Cell 6:517-527).","Several truncated and spliced versions of HER2\/neu are known. For example, a truncated ECD located in the perinuclear cytoplasm of some gastric carcinoma cells is produced by an alternative transcript generated by use of a polyadenylation signal within an intron. (Yamamoto et al. (1986) Nature 319:230-234; and Scott et al. (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:2247-2257). No particular therapeutic, diagnostic or research utility has been ascribed to this truncated ECD polypeptide. The ECD of HER2\/neu can also be proteolytically shed from breast carcinoma cells in culture, and is found in the serum of some cancer patients where it is may be a serum marker of metastatic breast cancer and overall poor prognosis. (Petch et al. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:2973-2982; Leitzel et al. (1992) J. Clin. Oncol. 10:1436-1443; Scott et al. (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:2247-2257; and Lee and Maihle (1998) Oncogene 16:3243-3252). In some HER2\/neu overexpressing tumor cells, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), a well-known metalloprotease activator, activates metalloproteases such as ADAM10 and ADAM15 to cleave the HER2\/neu receptor into two parts: a truncated membrane-associated receptor known as p95, and a soluble ECD known as p105 or ECD105. (See, e.g., Molina et al. (2001) Cancer Res. 61:4744-4749; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004\/0247602). Loss of the ECD renders the p95 receptor a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, which can deliver growth and survival signals to cancer cells. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,541,214).","Studies have shown that in HER2\/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells, treatment with antibodies specific to HER2\/neu in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cisplatin, doxoubicin, taxol) elicits a higher cytotoxic response than treatment with chemotherapy alone. (Hancock et al. (1991) Cancer Res. 51:4575-4580; Arteaga et al. (1994) Cancer 54:3758-3765; Pietras et al. (1994) Oncogene 9:1829-1838). One possible mechanism by which HER2\/neu antibodies might enhance response to chemotherapeutic agents is through the modulation of HER2\/neu protein expression or by interfering with DNA repair. (Stancovski et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 88:8691-8695; Bacus et al. (1992) Cell Growth & Diff. 3:401-411; Bacus et al. (1993) Cancer Res. 53:5251-5261; Klapper et al. (1997) Oncogene 14:2099-2109; Klapper et al. (2000) Cancer Res. 60:3384-3388; Arteaga et al. (2001) J Clinical Oncology 19(18s):32s-40s).","A number of monoclonal antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting HER-1 or HER2\/neu have been developed. For example, a murine monoclonal antibody known as 4D5 recognizes an extracellular epitope (amino acids 529 to 627) in the cysteine-rich II domain of HER2\/neu that resides very close to the transmembrane region. Treatment of breast cancer cells with 4D5 partially blocks NDF\/heregulin activation of HER2\/neu-HER-3 complexes, as measured by receptor phosphorylation assays. (Carter et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 89:4285-4289; Sliwkowski et al. (1999) Sem. in Oncol. 26:60-70; Ye et al. (1999) Oncogene 18:731-738; Vogel et al. (2001) Oncology 61(suppl 2):37-42; Vogel et al. (2002) Journal of Clinical Oncology 20(3):719-726; Fujimoto-Ouchi et al. (2002) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 49:211-216). Administration of 4D5 to humans, however, was a clinical failure because patients quickly developed HAMA responses, so humanized forms were developed. The sequence and crystal structure of humanized antibody 4D5 have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,297, Carter et al., supra, and Eigenbrot et al. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 229:969-95.","A humanized form of 4D5 known as trastuzumab (sold as Herceptin\u00ae by Genentech, Inc.) was developed and approved for treating cancers involving the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2\/neu, including breast cancer. (Cobleigh et al. (1999) J. Clin. Oncol. 17:2639-2648). Trastuzumab inhibits the APMA-mediated cleavage of HER2\/neu into the ECD and p95 portions in vitro, and is believed to work in vitro through different mechanisms, including the possible inhibition of HER2\/neu shedding. (Pegram et al. (1998) Journal of Clinical Oncology 16(8):2659-2671; Baselga et al. (2001) Seminars in Oncology 28(5)(suppl. 16):4-11; Baselga et al. however, such as cardiotoxicity and development of HAHA responses in some patients.","Thus, there is still a need for new or improved forms of HER2\/neu antibodies for use in cancer therapies, for example 4D5 antibodies having increasing affinity or specificity, reduced potential for HAMA or HAHA responses, altered effector functions, and the like.","Fc Receptors","The interaction of antibody-antigen complexes with cells of the immune system results in a wide array of responses, ranging from effector functions such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, mast cell degranulation, and phagocytosis to immunomodulatory signals such as regulating lymphocyte proliferation and antibody secretion. All these interactions are initiated through the binding of the Fc domain of antibodies or immune complexes to Fc receptors, which are specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells. The diversity of cellular responses triggered by antibodies and immune complexes results from the structural heterogeneity of Fc receptors. Fc receptors share structurally related ligand binding domains which presumably mediate intracellular signaling.","The Fc receptors, members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily of proteins, are surface glycoproteins that can bind the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules. Each member of the family recognizes immunoglobulins of one or more isotypes through a recognition domain on the \u03b1 chain of the Fc receptor. Fc receptors are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin subtypes. Fc receptors for IgG are referred to as \u201cFc\u03b3R,\u201d for IgE as \u201cF\u03b5R,\u201d and for IgA as \u201cFc\u03b1R.\u201d Different accessory cells bear Fc receptors for antibodies of different isotype, and the isotype of the antibody determines which accessory cells will be engaged in a given response (Billadeau et al. (2002) J. Clin. Investigat. 2(109):161-81; Gerber et al. (2001) Microbes Infection 3:131-139; Ravetch et al. (2001) Annu. Rev. Immunol 19:275-90; Ravetch et al.

There are four known Fc\u03b3Rs, designated Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RII (CD32), Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), and Fc\u03b3RIV. The receptors are encoded by distinct genes; however, the extensive homology between the family members suggest they arose from a common progenitor perhaps by gene duplication.","Both activating and inhibitory signals are transduced through the Fc\u03b3Rs following ligation. These diametrically opposing functions result from structural differences among the different receptor isoforms. Two distinct domains within the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the receptor called immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs (ITAMs) or immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (ITIMS) account for the different responses. The recruitment of different cytoplasmic enzymes to these structures dictates the outcome of the Fc\u03b3R-mediated cellular responses. ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R complexes include Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIV, whereas ITIM-containing complexes only include Fc\u03b3RIIB.","Fc\u03b3RI displays high affinity for the antibody constant region and restricted isotype specificity (Hulett and Hogarth (1994) Adv Immunol 57:1-127). Fc\u03b3RII proteins are 40 KDa integral membrane glycoproteins which bind only the complexed IgG due to a low affinity for monomeric Ig (106 M-1). This receptor is the most widely expressed Fc\u03b3R, present on all hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and platelets. Fc\u03b3RII has only two immunoglobulin-like regions in its immunoglobulin binding chain and hence a much lower affinity for IgG than Fc\u03b3RI. There are three known human Fc\u03b3RII genes (Fc\u03b3RII-A, Fc\u03b3RII-B, Fc\u03b3RII-C), all of which bind IgG in aggregates or immune complexes. Human neutrophils express the Fc\u03b3RIIA gene. The Fc\u03b3RIIB gene is expressed on B lymphocytes; its extracellular domain is 96% identical to Fc\u03b3RIIA and binds IgG complexes in an indistinguishable manner.","Distinct differences within the cytoplasmic domains of Fc\u03b3RII-A and Fc\u03b3RII-B create two functionally heterogenous responses to receptor ligation. The Fc\u03b3RII-A isoform initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell activation such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst, whereas the Fc\u03b3RII-B isoform initiates inhibitory signals, e.g., inhibiting B-cell activation. Fc\u03b3RIIA clustering via immune complexes or specific antibody cross-linking serves to aggregate ITAMs along with receptor-associated kinases which facilitate ITAM phosphorylation. ITAM phosphorylation serves as a docking site for Syk kinase, activation of which results in activation of downstream substrates (e.g., PI3K). Cellular activation leads to release of proinflammatory mediators. When co-ligated or co-aggregated along with an activating Fc\u03b3R having an ITAM, such as Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b5RI, the ITIM in Fc\u03b3RIIB becomes phosphorylated and recruits the SH2 domain of the src homology 2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP), which in turn is phosphorylated and associates with Shc (Ott (2002) J. Immunol 162(9):4430-4439; Yamanshi et al. (1997) Cell 88:205; Carpino et al. (1997) Cell 88:197). SHIP hydrolyzes phosphoinositol messengers released as a consequence of ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R-mediated tyrosine kinase activation, consequently preventing the influx of intracellular Ca++, and dampening cellular responsiveness to Fc\u03b3R ligation. Thus, B cell activation, B cell proliferation and antibody secretion is aborted, and Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis is down-regulated (Tridandapani et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277(7):5082-89).","Specifically, coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIA with Fc\u03b3RIIB results in down-regulation of phosphorylation of Akt, which is a serine-threonine kinase that is involved in cellular regulation and serves to suppress apoptosis, and coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB with the high affinity IgE receptor Fc\u03b5RI in mast cells leads to inhibition of antigen-induced degranulation, calcium mobilization, and cytokine production (Long (1999) Annu Rev. Immunol 17:875; Metcalfe et al. (1997) Physiol. Rev. 77:1033). Coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and the B-cell receptor (BCR) leads to inhibition of BCR-mediated signaling, and inhibition of cell cycle progression and cellular survival. Although numerous effector functions of Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling are mediated through SHIP, recently it has been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated B cells from SHIP deficient mice exhibit significant Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of calcium mobilization, Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, and Erk and Akt phosphorylation (Brauweiler et al. (2001) Journal of Immunology 167(1): 204-211).","The size of Fc\u03b3RIII ranges between 40 and 80 kDa in mouse and man, due to heterogeneity within this class. Two human genes encode two transcripts, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, an integral membrane glycoprotein, and Fc\u03b3RIIIB, a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-linked version. One murine gene encodes an Fc\u03b3RIII homologous to the membrane spanning human Fc\u03b3RIIIA. The Fc\u03b3RIII shares structural characteristics with each of the other two Fc\u03b3Rs. Like Fc\u03b3RII, Fc\u03b3RIII binds IgG with low affinity and contains the corresponding two extracellular Ig-like domains. Fc\u03b3RIIIA is expressed in macrophages, mast cells, and is the lone Fc\u03b3R in NK cells. The GPI-linked Fc\u03b3RIIIB is currently known to be expressed only in human neutrophils.","Fc\u03b3RIV (also known as mFcRIV) requires association of the FcR gamma-chain for optimal expression and function on myeloid cells; its signaling potential is also enhanced by a cytoplasmic \u201cYEEP\u201d motif that recruits the adaptor molecule Crk-L and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase. Fc\u03b3RIV preferentially binds immunoglobulin E antibodies of the b allotype (IgEb) as well as IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies. Ligation of Fc\u03b3RIV by antigen-IgEb immune complexes promotes macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, presentation of antigen to T cells, production of proinflammatory cytokines and the late phase of cutaneous allergic reactions (Hirano et al. (2007) Nature Immunology 8:762-771). Fc\u03b3RIV is a recently identified receptor, conserved in all mammalian species with intermediate affinity and restricted subclass specificity (Nimmerjahn et al. (2005) Immunity 23:41-51; Mechetina et al. (2002) Immunogenetics 54:463-468; Davis et al. (2002) Immunol Rev 190:23-36). FcRIII and FcRIV are physiologically important activation FcRs for mediating inflammatory disease triggered by cytotoxic antibodies or pathogenic immune complexes. FcRIV is found on dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils.","Despite all such advances, a need remains for anti-HER2\/neu antibodies that possess therapeutic use in the treatment of autoimmunity, cancer, inflammatory disease, and\/or transplantation, and exhibit improved ability to mediate effector function from the Fc receptors. The present invention is directed to this and other needs.","Embodiments of the invention provide various polypeptides, for example a polypeptide comprising an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, a polypeptide comprising an immunoglobulin light chain having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, and a polypeptide comprising a chimeric 4D5 immunoglobulin light chain comprising an N65S substitution.

The specific sites of attachment usually have a characteristic sequence of amino acids, referred to as a \u201cglycosylation site sequence.\u201d The glycosylation site sequence for N-linked glycosylation is: Asn-X-Ser\/Thr, where X can be any of the conventional amino acids other than proline. The Fc region of human IgG has two N-linked glycosylation sites, one in each of the Cdomains, at the asparagine at position 297 (Asn 297).","As used herein, the term \u201cHAMA response\u201d refers to the Human Anti-Mouse Antibody response, which is a deleterious immunogenic response that occurs when a human immune system recognizes a murine antibody as foreign and attacks it. A HAMA response can cause toxic shock or death. Chimeric and humanized antibodies reduce the likelihood of a HAMA response by decreasing the non-human portions of administered antibodies, but there is still potential for a Human Anti-Human Antibody response (\u201cHAHA response\u201d) immune response to such antibodies.","The terms \u201cheavy chain,\u201d \u201clight chain\u201d (\u201cCL\u201d), \u201clight chain variable region\u201d (\u201cVL\u201d), \u201cheavy chain variable region\u201d (\u201cVH\u201d), \u201cframework region\u201d (\u201cFR\u201d), \u201cheavy chain constant domain (\u201cCH\u201d), \u201clight chain constant domain (\u201cCL\u201d) refer to domains in naturally occurring immunoglobulins and the corresponding domains of synthetic (e.g., recombinant) binding proteins (e.g., humanized antibodies). The basic structural unit of naturally occurring immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG) is a tetramer having two light chains and two heavy chains. Usually naturally occurring immunoglobulin is expressed as a glycoprotein of about 150 KDa, although IgG can also be produced in a non-glycosylated form. The amino-terminal (\u201cN\u201d) portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal (\u201cC\u201d) portion of each chain defines a constant region, with light chains having a single constant domain and heavy chains usually having three constant domains and a hinge region. Thus, the structure of the light chains of a naturally occurring IgG molecule is N-VL-CL-C and the structure of IgG heavy chains is N-VH-CH1-H-CH2-CH3-C (where H is the hinge region). The variable regions of an IgG molecule consists of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which contain the residues in contact with antigen and non-CDR segments, referred to as framework segments, which maintain the structure and determine the positioning of the CDR loops. Thus, the VL and VH domains have the structure N-FR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4-C.","As used herein, the term \u201cheterologous\u201d nucleic acid denotes DNA, RNA, etc. that is introduced into a host cell.

In general terms, humanization of a non-human antibody involves substituting the CDR sequences from non-human immunoglobulin Vand Vregions into human framework regions. Further, as used herein, \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies may comprise additional substitutions and mutations in the CDR and\/or framework regions introduced to increase affinity or for other purposes. For example, substitution of nonhuman framework residues in the human sequence can increase affinity. The resulting variable domains have non-human CDR sequences and framework sequences derived from human antibody framework sequence(s) or a human consensus sequence. A variety of different human framework regions may be used singly or in combination as a basis for a humanized antibody.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmunomodulatory agent\u201d and variations thereof refer to an agent that modulates a host's immune system. In certain embodiments, an immunomodulatory agent is an immunosuppressant agent.

one embodiment, a variant 4D5 heavy chain has a modification in the Fc region, and is encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8 or comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9, or is encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10 or comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11, or is encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 or comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 13. Preferably, the antibodies comprise a heavy chain encoded by a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 10, and SEQ ID NO: 12, or comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 11, and SEQ ID NO: 13.","In one embodiment, an anti-HER2\/neu antibody comprises an immunoglobulin light chain having a N65S modification in the Vregion, and an immunoglobulin heavy chain having a modified Fc region. Preferably, an anti-HER2\/neu antibody comprises a light chain having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, and a heavy chain having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 11, and SEQ ID NO: 13. In some embodiments, a polypeptide of the invention further comprises a light chain constant domain fused to a light chain variable domain, which in some embodiments comprises at least SEQ ID NO: 4. In other embodiments, the antibody is modified, a fragment, or a modified fragment.","Chimeric 4D5 antibodies were constructed in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention, to enhance binding to activating low-affinity Fc receptors, and to not alter, or only minimally increase, binding to the low-affinity inhibitor receptor CD32B (Fc\u03b3RII-B). The antibodies include the following wild-type and Fc-optimized antibodies:\n\n","A comparison of the heavy chain sequences of the ch4D5-wild-type Fc and the Fc-optimized variants ch4D5-FcMT1, ch4D5-FcMT2, and ch4D5-FcMT3 is shown in . The CDRs are indicated with black bars shown underneath the pertinent residues.","Polypeptides (especially antibodies) contemplated by the present invention may comprise all or part of any amino acid sequence of the present invention. For example, in one embodiment a polypeptide comprises a murine 4D5 immunoglobulin light chain having an N65S substitution, and in another embodiment a polypeptide comprises a murine 4D5 immunoglobulin heavy chain variant. In another embodiment, a polypeptide comprises an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, or an immunoglobulin light chain having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another embodiment, the polypeptide comprises a variant Fc domain, or an immunoglobulin heavy chain having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 11, or SEQ ID NO: 13, or a 4D5 immunoglobulin heavy chain comprising F243L, R292P, and Y300L substitutions.","Polypeptides (especially antibodies) contemplated by the present invention may be in a complex with one another or with other non-immunoglobulin polypeptides (e.g., enzymes, hormones, structural proteins, etc.). For example, an embodiment may provide a polypeptide complex comprising two polypeptides, wherein one of said polypeptides comprises a heavy chain, and the other polypeptide comprises a variant light chain, or wherein both polypeptides comprise the same sequences. Complexing can be mediated by any suitable technique, including by dimerization\/multimerization at a dimerization\/multimerization domain such as those described herein or covalent interactions (such as through a disulfide linkage) (which in some contexts is part of a dimerization domain, for example a dimerization domain may contain a leucine zipper sequence and a cysteine). In another embodiment, a composition may comprise polypeptides and\/or polynucleotides of the invention, for example a composition may comprise a plurality of any of the polypeptides described herein. A composition comprising a polynucleotide or polypeptide may be in the form of a kit or an article of manufacture (optionally packaged with instructions, buffers, etc.).","It is also contemplated that polypeptide variants (and in particular antibody variants) can be prepared. The polypeptide variants may possess sequence modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions and\/or additions) at desired positions within their amino acid sequences relative to the native amino acid sequence. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that amino acid changes may alter post-translational processes of the antibody or polypeptide, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites or altering the membrane anchoring characteristics. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody and polypeptide variants are Fc region variants.","Variants may have the same or altered activity as compared to a native antibody or polypeptide. For example, it may be desirable that the variant have the same activity, but be modified in a manner so that it is more stable or has a longer half-life in vivo, for example by conjugating the antibody with albumin or a salvage receptor binding epitope, as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277. Or, for example, it may be desirable that an antibody have an increased binding affinity to antigen, but the same effector function as a native antibody, or it may be desirable that an antibody have the same binding affinity to antigen, but a decreased effector function. Activity may be tested by, e.g., using in vitro assays such as ELISA assays, surface plasmon resonance assays, radiolabeled protein binding assays (RIA), or immunoprecipitation assays.","Substantial modifications in function or immunological identity may be accomplished by selecting modifications that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the modification, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Scanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence, for example as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science 244:1081-1085. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small, neutral amino acids, such as alanine, glycine, serine, and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it is the most common amino acid, is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions, and because it eliminates the side-chain beyond the beta-carbon and is less likely to alter the main-chain conformation of the variant. If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of variant, an isoteric amino acid can be used. Further, any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody or polypeptide may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. However, in certain circumstances, particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody or polypeptide to improve its stability.","B1. Fc Domain Variants","The polypeptides of the present invention may have variant Fc domains. Modification of the Fc domain normally leads to an altered phenotype, for example altered serum half-life, altered stability, altered susceptibility to cellular enzymes or altered effector function. It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, so as to enhance the effectiveness of the antibody in treating cancer, for example. Reduction or elimination of effector function is desirable in certain cases, for example in the case of antibodies whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism, but not killing of the cells bearing a target antigen. Increased effector function is generally desirable when directed to undesirable cells, such as tumor and foreign cells, where the Fc\u03b3Rs are expressed at low levels, for example, tumor specific B cells with low levels of Fc\u03b3RIIB (e.g., non-Hodgkins lymphoma, CLL, and Burkitt's lymphoma). In said embodiments, molecules of the invention with conferred or altered effector function activity are useful for the treatment and\/or prevention of a disease, disorder or infection where an enhanced efficacy of effector function activity is desired.","In certain embodiments, the molecules of the invention comprise one or more modifications to the amino acids of the Fc domain, which reduce the affinity and avidity of the Fc region and, thus, the molecule of the invention, for one or more Fc\u03b3R receptors. In other embodiments, the molecules of the invention comprise one or more modifications to the amino acids of the Fc region, which increase the affinity and avidity of the Fc region and, thus, the molecule of the invention, for one or more Fc\u03b3R receptors. In other embodiments, the molecules comprise a variant Fc domain wherein said variant confers or mediates increased ADCC activity and\/or an increased binding to Fc\u03b3RIIA, relative to a molecule comprising no Fc domain or comprising a wild-type Fc domain. In alternate embodiments, the molecules comprise a variant Fc domain wherein said variant confers or mediates decreased ADCC activity (or other effector function) and\/or an increased binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB, relative to a molecule comprising no Fc domain or comprising a wild-type Fc domain.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region, which variant Fc region does not show a detectable binding to any Fc\u03b3R, relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild-type Fc region. In other embodiments, the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region, which variant Fc region only binds a single Fc\u03b3R, preferably one of Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB, or Fc\u03b3RIIIA.","The polypeptides of the present invention may comprise altered affinities for an activating and\/or inhibitory Fc\u03b3 receptor. In one embodiment, the antibody or polypeptide comprises a variant Fc region that has increased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA, relative to a comparable molecule with a wild-type Fc region. In another embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention comprise a variant Fc region, which has decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and increased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA, relative to a comparable molecule with a wild-type Fc region. In yet another embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention comprise a variant Fc region that has decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA, relative to a comparable molecule with a wild-type Fc region. In still another embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention comprise a variant Fc region, which has unchanged affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and decreased (or increased) affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA, relative to a comparable molecule with a wild-type Fc region.","In certain embodiments, the invention encompasses immunoglobulins comprising a variant Fc region with an altered affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA such that the immunoglobulin has an enhanced effector function, e.g., antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Non-limiting examples of effector cell functions include antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent phagocytosis, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, cell binding, rosetting, C1q binding, and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity.","In a preferred embodiment, the alteration in affinity or effector function is at least 2-fold, preferably at least 4-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 6-fold, at least 7-fold, at least 8-fold, at least 9-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 50-fold, or at least 100-fold, relative to a comparable molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region. In other embodiments of the invention, the variant Fc region immunospecifically binds one or more FcRs with at least 65%, preferably at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 225%, or 250% greater affinity relative to a molecule comprising a wild-type Fc region. Such measurements can be in vivo or in vitro assays, and in a preferred embodiment are in vitro assays such as ELISA or surface plasmon resonance assays.","In different embodiments, the molecules comprise a variant Fc domain wherein said variant agonizes at least one activity of an Fc\u03b3R receptor, or antagonizes at least one activity of an Fc\u03b3R receptor. In a preferred embodiment, the molecules comprise a variant that agonizes (or antagonizes) one or more activities of Fc\u03b3RIIB, for example, B cell receptor-mediated signaling, activation of B cells, B cell proliferation, antibody production, intracellular calcium influx of B cells, cell cycle progression, Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI signaling, phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIB, SHIP recruitment, SHIP phosphorylation and association with Shc, or activity of one or more downstream molecules (e.g., MAP kinase, JNK, p38, or Akt) in the Fc\u03b3RIIB signal transduction pathway. In another embodiment, the molecules comprise a variant that agonizes (or antagonizes) one or more activities of Fc\u03b5RI, for example, mast cell activation, calcium mobilization, degranulation, cytokine production, or serotonin release.","In certain embodiments, the molecules comprise an Fc domain comprising domains or regions from two or more IgG isotypes (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4). The various IgG isotypes exhibit differing physical and functional properties including serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc\u03b3R binding affinities and effector function activities (e.g. ADCC, CDC, etc.) due to differences in the amino acid sequences of their hinge and\/or Fc domains, for example as described in Flesch and Neppert (1999) J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 14:141-156; Chappel et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 33:25124-25131; Chappel et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 88:9036-9040; Br\u00fcggemann et al. (1987) J. Exp. Med 166:1351-1361. This type of variant Fc domain may be used alone, or in combination with an amino acid modification, to affect Fc-mediated effector function and\/or binding activity. In combination, the amino acid modification and IgG hinge\/Fc region may display similar functionality (e.g., increased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIA) and may act additively or, more preferably, synergistically to modify the effector functionality in the molecule of the invention, relative to a molecule of the invention comprising a wild-type Fc region. In other embodiments, the amino acid modification and IgG Fc region may display opposite functionality (e.g., increased and decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIA, respectively) and may act to selectively temper or reduce a specific functionality in the molecule of the invention, relative to a molecule of the invention not comprising an Fc region or comprising a wild-type Fc region of the same isotype.","In a preferred specific embodiment, the molecules comprise a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild-type Fc region, such that said molecule has an altered affinity for an FcR, provided that said variant Fc region does not have a substitution at positions that make a direct contact with Fc\u03b3R based on crystallographic and structural analysis of Fc-FcR interactions such as those disclosed by Sondermann et al. (2000) Nature 406:267-273. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with Fc\u03b3R are amino acid residues 234-239 (hinge region), amino acid residues 265-269 (B\/C loop), amino acid residues 297-299 (C\u2032\/E loop), and amino acid residues 327-332 (F\/G loop). In some embodiments, the molecules of the invention comprise variant Fc regions comprise modification of at least one residue that does not make a direct contact with an Fc\u03b3R based on structural and crystallographic analysis, e.g., is not within the Fc-Fc\u03b3R binding site.","Variant Fc domains are well known in the art, and any known Fc variant may be used in the present invention to confer or modify the effector function exhibited by a molecule of the invention comprising an Fc domain (or portion thereof) as functionally assayed, e.g., in an NK dependent or macrophage dependent assay. For example, Fc domain variants identified as altering effector function are disclosed in the Antibody Engineering Technology Art, and any suitable variant disclosed therein may be used in the present molecules.","In certain embodiments, the molecules comprise a variant Fc region, having one or more amino acid modifications in one or more regions, which modification(s) alter (relative to a wild-type Fc region) the Ratio of Affinities of the variant Fc region to an activating Fc\u03b3R (such as Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIIA) relative to an inhibiting Fc\u03b3R (such as Fc\u03b3RIIB):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0186"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["Ratio","of","Affinities"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":["Wild","Type","to","Variant","Change","in","Affinity","to","Fc","\u03b3"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":"-"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":["R","Activating"]}},{"mi":["Wild","Type","to","Variant","Change","in","Affinity","to","Fc","\u03b3"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":"-"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":["R","Inhibiting"]}}]}}}}},"Where an Fc variant has a Ratio of Affinities greater than 1, the methods of the invention have particular use in providing a therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a disease, disorder, or infection, or the amelioration of a symptom thereof, where an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function (e.g., ADCC) mediated by Fc\u03b3R is desired, e.g., cancer or infectious disease.

function can be modified by techniques such as those described in the Antibody Engineering Technology Art, or by other means. For example, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region, resulting in the generation of a homodimeric antibody that may have improved internalization capability and\/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and ADCC. See Caron et al. (1992) J. Exp Med. 176:1191-1195; and B. Shopes (1992) J. Immunol 148:2918-2922. Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al. (1993) Cancer Research 53:2560-2565. Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. Stevenson et al. (1989) Anti-Cancer Drug Design 3:219-230.","B2. Sequence Modifications","Generally, sequence modifications may be the substitution, deletion, or addition of one or more residues in the antibody or polypeptide that results in a change in the amino acid sequence as compared to the native sequence. Guidance in determining which amino acid residue may be inserted, substituted or deleted without adversely affecting the desired activity may be found by comparing the sequence of the antibody or polypeptide with that of homologous known protein molecules and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology. The variation allowed may be determined by systematically making insertions, deletions or substitutions of amino acids in the sequence and testing the resulting variants for activity exhibited by the full-length or mature native sequence.","Amino acid substitutions may involve the conservative or non-conservative substitution of one or more residues. Such substitutions are well-known in the art, for example a conservative substitution entails replacing an amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and\/or chemical properties, such as the replacement of a leucine with a serine. Non-conservative substitutions generally entail replacing an amino acid with another amino acid having different structural and\/or chemical properties, for example an acidic amino acid (e.g., Glu or Asp) may be replaced with a basic amino acid (e.g., Lys or Asn).","A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g., a humanized or human antibody), in order to obtain a variant antibody having improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site, the antibody variants thus generated are displayed on phage, and the phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g., binding affinity). In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and its antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.","The modification may also involve the incorporation (e.g., by substitution or addition) of unnatural amino acids, for example by methods such as those described in, e.g., Wang et al. (2002) Chem. Comm. 1:1-11; Wang et al. (2001) Science 292:498-500; and van Hest et al. (2001) Chem. Comm. 19:1897-1904. Alternative strategies focus on the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of amino acyl-tRNA, as described in, e.g., Tang et al. (2001) J. Am. Chem. 123(44):11089-11090; and Kiick et al. (2001) FEBS Lett. 505(3):465.","In a preferred embodiment, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid residues have been modified. Additionally or alternatively, such modifications may be characterized as having no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 modified amino acid residues. In a particularly preferred embodiment, at least 1 but no more than 10 residues have been modified. Additionally or alternatively, such modifications may be characterized as having no more than 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2 modified amino acid residues. The modifications may be all substitutions, all deletions, all additions, or any combination of substitutions, deletions, or additions.","Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants may be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, restriction selection mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.","B3. Other Modifications","The polypeptide variants (especially antibody variants) of the present invention include analogs and derivatives that are modified, e.g., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its epitope binding immunospecificity. For example, but not by way of limitation, the derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular antibody unit or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnatural amino acids.","The antibodies and polypeptides may be modified by introducing one or more glycosylation sites into the antibodies, deleting one or more glycosylation sites from the antibodies, or shifting an existing glycosylation site on the antibodies, preferably without altering the desired functionality of the antibodies, e.g., binding activity. Glycosylation sites may be introduced into, or deleted from, the variable and\/or constant region of the antibodies, by methods known in the art. For example, a glycosylation site may be introduced into an antibody of the invention by modifying or mutating an amino acid sequence of the antibody so that the desired sequence (e.g., Asn-X-Thr\/Ser) is obtained, and a glycosylation site may be shifted by modifying position 296 in the Fc region, so that position 296 and not position 297 is glycosylated. Methods of modifying the carbohydrate content (glycosylation) of proteins are well known in the art, for example as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,472,511 and 6,218,149; U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20030115614 and 20020028486; EP 0359096 B1; and WO 03\/035835.","In some embodiments, molecules of the invention are engineered to comprise an altered glycosylation pattern or an altered glycoform. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, enhancing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method known to one skilled in the art, for example by using engineered or variant expression strains, by co-expression with one or more enzymes, for example, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), by expressing an antibody of the invention in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms, or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the antibody has been expressed and purified. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art, and include but are not limited to those described in, e.g., Okazaki et al. (2004) JMB 336:1239-1249; Shinkawa et al.

(Princeton, N.J.); and GlycoMAb\u2122 glycosylation engineering technology available from GLYCART biotechnology AG (Zurich, Switzerland).","B4. Polypeptide Conjugates","The polypeptides of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to heterologous polypeptides or portions thereof to generate fusion proteins. Preferably, the polypeptide of the present invention (especially an antibody) is fused to at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids of the heterologous polypeptide to generate a desired fusion protein. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences. Polypeptides of the present invention may also be attached to solid supports or semi-solid matrices, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such supports and matrices include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, agarose beads, acrylamide beads, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene. Attachment may be accomplished, for example, by methods described in Methods in Enzymology, 44 (1976).","The antibodies and polypeptides may be conjugated to a therapeutic agent in order to modify a given biological response, affect (e.g., increase) the serum half-life of the therapeutic agent, or target the therapeutic agent to a particular subset of cells. They may also be fused to marker sequences (e.g., a hexa-histidine peptide or a \u201cflag\u201d tag) to facilitate purification. Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moieties to antibodies are well known; see, e.g., Hellstrom et al., \u201cAntibodies For Drug Delivery\u201d, in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd ed., Robinson et al. (eds.), 1987, pp. 623-53, Marcel Dekker, Inc.).","Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling, and\/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \u201cDNA shuffling\u201d). DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of molecules of the invention (e.g., antibodies with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates). Antibodies and polypeptides of the invention, or their encoding nucleic acids, may be further altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. One or more portions of a polynucleotide encoding a molecule of the invention, may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.","B5. Fragments","The invention additionally provides antibody and other polypeptide fragments. Such fragments may be truncated at the N-terminus or C-terminus, or may lack internal residues, for example, when compared with a full length native antibody or protein. Certain fragments may lack amino acid residues that are not essential for a desired biological activity. These fragments may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. Desired peptide fragments may be chemically synthesized. An alternative approach involves generating antibody or polypeptide fragments by enzymatic digestion, e.g., by treating the protein with an enzyme known to cleave proteins at sites defined by particular amino acid residues, or by digesting the DNA with suitable restriction enzymes and isolating the desired fragment. Yet another suitable technique involves isolating and amplifying a DNA fragment encoding a desired antibody or polypeptide fragment, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 primers in the PCR. Preferably, antibody and polypeptide fragments share at least one biological and\/or immunological activity with the native antibody or polypeptide disclosed herein.","In some embodiments, a polypeptide of the invention further comprises a dimerization domain, which can comprise a dimerization sequence, and\/or sequence comprising one or more cysteine residues. In some embodiments, the dimerization domain will be located between an antibody heavy chain or light chain variable domain and at least a portion of a viral coat protein, and one or more disulfide bond and\/or a single dimerization sequence may be present in the dimerization domain to provide for bivalent display. In some embodiments, heavy chains of a F(ab)will dimerize at a dimerization domain not including a hinge region. The dimerization domain may comprise a leucine zipper sequence.","In another embodiment, the polypeptide fragments of the present invention comprise an amino acid sequence of at least 5 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 15 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 25 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 30 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 40 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 50 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 60 contiguous amino residues, at least 70 contiguous amino acid residues, at least contiguous 80 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 90 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 100 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 125 amino acid residues, at least 150 contiguous amino acid residues, at least contiguous 175 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 200 amino acid residues, or at least contiguous 250 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of another polypeptide. In a specific embodiment, a fragment of a polypeptide retains at least one function of the polypeptide.","B6. Diabodies and DARTs","Diabodies and dual affinity retargeting reagents (\u201cDARTs\u201d) are also provided by the present invention. The diabodies and DARTs comprise antigen binding domains generally derived from the antibodies and polypeptides of the invention. The design and construction of diabodies and DARTs is described in, for example, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/019,051 filed on Jan. 4, 2008 and 60\/945,523 filed on Jun. 21, 2007; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/409,339 filed on Apr. 17, 2006; Marvin et al. (2005) Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 26:649-658; Olafsen et al. (2004) Prot. Engr. Des. Sel. 17:21-27; Holliger et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 90:6444-6448. Each polypeptide chain of a diabody molecule comprises a Vdomain and a Vdomain, from the same or different antibodies, which are covalently linked such that the domains are constrained from self assembly. Interaction of two of the polypeptide chains will produce two V-Vpairings, forming two epitope binding sites, i.e., a bivalent molecule. Neither the Vor Vdomain is constrained to any position within the polypeptide chain, nor are the domains restricted in their relative positions to one another; the only restriction is that a complementary polypeptide chain be available in order to form functional diabody. The domains may be separated by a peptide linker, and the polypeptide chains may be engineered to comprise at least one cysteine residue on each chain, so that interchain disulfide bonds may be formed to stabilize the diabody.","Where the Vand Vdomains are derived from the same antibody, the two complementary polypeptide chains may be identical, resulting in a bivalent monospecific antibody, or may be different, resulting in a bivalent bispecific antibody (e.g., one that binds ton two different epitopes on the same antigen). Where the Vand Vdomains are derived from antibodies specific for different antigens, formation of a functional bispecific diabody requires the interaction of two different polypeptide chains, i.e., formation of a heterodimer. In a particular embodiment, at least one epitope binding site of the diabody is specific for an antigen on a particular cell, such as a B-cell or T-cell, a phagocytotic cell, a natural killer (NK) cell or a dendritic cell.","In various embodiments, one or more of the polypeptide chains of the diabody comprises an Fc domain. Fc domains in the polypeptide chains of the diabody molecules preferentially dimerize, resulting in the formation of a diabody molecule that exhibits immunoglobulin-like properties, e.g., Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions. Fc comprising diabodies may be dimers, e.g., comprised of two polypeptide chains, each comprising a Vdomain, a Vdomain and an Fc domain. In various embodiments, one or more of the polypeptide chains of the diabody comprises a hinge domain, which may be derived from any immunoglobulin isotype or allotype including IgA, IgD, IgG, IgE and IgM. In preferred embodiments, the hinge domain is derived from IgG, wherein the IgG isotype is IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4, or an allotype thereof. The hinge domain may be engineered into a polypeptide chain in any position relative to other domains or portions of the chain, and in certain circumstances may be engineered together with an Fc domain such that the diabody molecule comprises a hinge-Fc domain.","In other embodiments, diabody molecules comprising Fc domains may be tetramers, which may comprise two \u201cheavier\u201d polypeptide chains (i.e. a polypeptide chain comprising a V, a Vand an Fc domain), and two \u201clighter\u201d polypeptide chains (i.e., a polypeptide chain comprising a Vand a V). Such lighter and heavier chains may interact to form a monomer, and interact via their unpaired Fc domains to form an Ig-like molecule, which may be a DART molecule. Such an Ig-like diabody is tetravalent and may be monospecific, bispecific or tetraspecific. The Ig-like DART species has unique properties, because its domains may be designed to bind to the same epitope (so as to form a tetravalent, mono-epitope specific Ig-like DART capable of binding four identical antigen molecules), or to different epitopes or antigens. For example, its domains may be designed to bind to two epitopes of the same antigen (so as to form a tetravalent, mono-antigen specific, bi-epitope specific Ig-like DART), or to epitopes of different antigen molecules so as to form a tetravalent Ig-like DART having a pair of binding sites specific for a first antigen and a second pair of binding sites specific for a second antigen). Hybrid molecules having combinations of such attributes can be readily produced.","Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, the diabody molecules of the invention exhibit enhanced therapeutic efficacy relative to therapeutic antibodies known in the art, in part, due to the ability of diabody to immunospecifically bind a target cell which expresses a particular antigen (e.g., Fc\u03b3R) at reduced levels, for example, by virtue of the ability of the diabody to remain on the target cell longer due to an improved avidity of the diabody-epitope interaction. Thus, the diabodies of the invention have particular utility in treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder, such as cancer, in a sub-population, wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population.","Due to their increased valency, low dissociation rates and rapid clearance from the circulation (for diabodies of small size, at or below \u02dc50 kDa), diabody molecules known in the art have also shown particular use in the filed of tumor imaging. (Fitzgerald et al. (1997) Protein Eng. 10:1221). Of particular importance is the cross linking of differing cells, for example the cross linking of cytotoxic T cells to tumor cells. (Staerz et al. (1985) Nature 314:628-631; Holliger et al. (1996) Protein Eng. 9:299-305). Diabody epitope binding domains may also be directed to a surface determinant of any immune effector cell such as CD3, CD16, CD32, or CD64, which are expressed on T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells or other mononuclear cells. In many studies, diabody binding to effector cell determinants, e.g., Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R), was also found to activate the effector cell. (Holliger et al. (1996) Protein Eng. 9:299-305; Holliger et al. (1999) Cancer Res. 59:2909-2916). Normally, effector cell activation is triggered by the binding of an antigen bound antibody to an effector cell via Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction; thus, in this regard, diabody molecules of the invention may exhibit Ig-like functionality independent of whether they comprise an Fc domain. By cross-linking tumor and effector cells, the diabody not only brings the effector cell within the proximity of the tumor cells but leads to effective tumor killing. Cao and Lam (2003) Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 55:171-97.","The diabody molecules of the present invention can be produced using a variety of methods, including de novo protein synthesis and recombinant expression of nucleic acids encoding the binding proteins. The desired nucleic acid sequences can be produced by recombinant methods (e.g., PCR mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant of the desired polynucleotide) or by solid-phase DNA synthesis. Preferably recombinant expression methods are used. In one aspect, the invention provides a polynucleotide that comprises a sequence encoding a CD16A Vand\/or V; in another aspect, the invention provides a polynucleotide that comprises a sequence encoding a CD32B Vand\/or V. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a variety of nucleic acid sequences encode each immunoglobulin amino acid sequence, and the present invention includes all nucleic acids encoding the binding proteins described herein.","B7. Production of Antibodies","The antibodies of the preferred embodiments of the invention may be produced or obtained in any of a variety of ways. For example, such antibodies may be obtained from plasma, synthetically, recombinantly or transgenically, via cell (e.g., hybridoma culture), etc. The production of synthetic proteins has been described in, e.g., Dawson et al. (2000) Ann. Rev Biochem. 69:923-960; Wilken et al. (1998) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 9(4):412-426; and Kochendoerfer et al. (1999) Curr. Opin. Chem.

Phage display technology can also be used to increase the affinity of an antibody for its antigen. The technology, referred to as affinity maturation, employs mutagenesis or CDR walking and re-selection using the cognate antigen to identify antibodies that bind with higher affinity to the antigen when compared with the initial or parental antibody. See, e.g., Glaser et al. (1992) J. Immunology 149:3903; Wu et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 95:6037; Yelton et al. (1995) J. Immunology 155:1994; Schier et al. (1996) J. Mol. Bio. 263:551.","Monoclonal antibodies may be made by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, hybridoma methods as described in, e.g., Kohler et al. (1975) Nature 256:495, Kozbor et al. (1983) Immunology Today 4:72, or Cole et al. (1985) Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96, or recombinant DNA methods as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567, or the antibodies may be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) Nature 352:624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597, for example. Various procedures well known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to an antigen of interest. For example, various host animals can be immunized by injection with an antigen of interest or derivative thereof, including but not limited to rabbits, sheep, goats, dogs, mice, rats, and guinea pigs, and after allowing for an immunological response, the antibodies can be identified from the sera of the immunized animals.","Bispecific antibodies may also be made, for example through the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities, followed by purification of the desired molecule using affinity chromatography, as described by Milstein et al. (1983) Nature 305:537-39, WO 93\/08829, Traunecker et al. (1991) EMBO J. 10:3655-59. In a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences, for example to a heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C, and Cregions. The nucleic acids encoding these fusions may be inserted into the same or different expression vectors, and are expressed in a suitable host organism.","Fully human antibodies (also referred to as completely human antibodies) may be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. An overview of this technology for producing human antibodies is described in, for example, Lonberg and Huszar (1995) Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,425. Fully human antibodies can also be produced using other techniques known in the art, including phage display libraries, as described by Hoogenboom and Winter (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 227:381 and Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:581. Fully human antibodies may also be obtained commercially from, for example, Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.). Fully human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope may be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope, as described by, e.g., Jespers et al. (1994) Biotechnology 12:899-903.","The present invention also includes polynucleotides that encode the molecules of the invention, including the polypeptides and antibodies, as well as vectors comprising the polynucleotides, and host cells comprising the vectors. The polynucleotides encoding the molecules of the invention may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art, for example, recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. In one embodiment, human libraries or any other libraries available in the art, can be screened by standard techniques known in the art, to clone the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention.","B8. Characterization of Antibodies","The antibodies of the present invention may be characterized in a variety of ways. In particular, antibodies of the invention may be assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to an antigen, e.g., HER2\/neu, or, where the molecule comprises an Fc domain (or portion thereof) for the ability to exhibit Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions, i.e. specific binding of an Fc domain (or portion thereof) to an Fc\u03b3R. Such an assay may be performed in solution (e.g., Houghten (1992) Bio\/Techniques 13:412-421), on beads (Lam (1991) Nature 354:82-84), on chips (Fodor (1993) Nature 364:555-556), on bacteria (U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), on spores (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,698; 5,403,484; and 5,223,409), on plasmids (Cull et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 89:1865-1869) or on phage (Scott and Smith (1990) Science 249:386-390; Devlin (1990) Science 249:404-406; Cwirla et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 87:6378-6382; and Felici (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:301-310). Molecules that have been identified to immunospecifically bind to an antigen can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for the antigen.","Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding, cross-reactivity, and Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunochromatographic assays, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A immunoassays, etc. (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., 2008, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology).","Binding affinity for a target antigen is typically measured or determined by standard antibody-antigen assays, such as Biacore competitive assays, saturation assays, or immunoassays such as ELISA or RIA.","Preferably, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), using any of the techniques known to those skilled in the art, is used for immunological or functional based assays to characterize molecules of the invention. Flow sorters are capable of rapidly examining a large number of individual cells that have been bound, e.g., opsonized, by molecules of the invention (e.g., 10-100 million cells per hour). Additionally, specific parameters used for optimization of antibody behavior, include but are not limited to, antigen concentration, kinetic competition time, or FACS stringency, each of which may be varied in order to select for antibody molecules which exhibit specific binding properties. Flow cytometers for sorting and examining biological cells are well known in the art. Known flow cytometers are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,347,935; 5,464,581; 5,483,469; 5,602,039; 5,643,796; and 6,211,477. Other known flow cytometers are the FACS Vantage\u2122 system sold by Becton Dickinson and Company, and the COPAS\u2122 system sold by Union Biometrica.","Surface plasmon resonance-based assays may be used to characterize the kinetic parameters of an antigen-binding domain or Fc-Fc\u03b3R binding. Any method known to those skilled in the art may be used, for example the technology described in, e.g., Dong et al. (2002) Review in Mol. Biotech. 82:303-323; Mullet et al. (2000) Methods 22:77-91; Rich et al. (2000) Current Opinion in Biotechnology 11:54-61; Fivash et al. (1998) Current Opinion in Biotechnology 9:97-101; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,373,577; 6,289,286; 5,322,798; 5,341,215; and 6,268,125. The data is used to plot binding curves and determine rate constants, for example, K, K, and the apparent equilibrium binding constant K, for example as described in, e.g., Myszka (1997) Current Opinion in Biotechnology 8:50-57; O'Shannessy et al. (1996) Analytical Biochemistry 236:275-283; Morton et al. (1995) Analytical Biochemistry 227:176-185; Fisher et al.

In preferred embodiments, the kinetic parameters determined using an SPR analysis may be used as a predictive measure of how a molecule will function in a functional assay, e.g., ADCC.","Characterization of binding to Fc\u03b3R by molecules comprising an Fc domain (or portion thereof) and\/or comprising epitope binding domain specific for an Fc\u03b3R may be performed according to the methods described in the Antibody Engineering Technology Art. Assays for effector cell functions are well-known, for example as described in Abdul-Majid et al. (2002) Scand. J. Immunol. 55:70-81; Perussia et al. (2000) Methods Mol. Biol. 121:179-192; Lehmann et al. (2000) J. Immunol. Methods 243(1-2):229-242; Ding et al. (1998) Immunity 8:403-411; Baggiolini et al.

Med. 172:231-237.","For example, assays for Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis may be conducted using human monocytes, by measuring the ability of THP-1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) by methods previously described in Tridandapani et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:20480-20487, or using an antibody-dependent opsonophagocytosis assay (ADCP) as described by Bedzyk et al. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264(3):1565-1569. Standard methods known to those skilled in the art may be used to characterize the binding of C1q and mediation of complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) by molecules of the invention comprising Fc domains (or portions thereof). For example, to determine C1q binding, a C1q binding ELISA may be performed, and to assess complement activation, a complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay may be performed, e.g., as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al. (1996) J. Immunol. Methods 202:163.","In another embodiment, the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc\u03b3R-mediated ADCC activity in effector cells, e.g., natural killer cells, using any of the standard methods known to those skilled in the art and described in, e.g., Weng et al. (2003) J. Clin. Oncol. 21:3940-3947; Perussia et al. (2000) Methods Mol. Biol. 121:179-192; Ding et al. (1998) Immunity 8:403-411. In a specific preferred embodiment, a time resolved fluorimetric assay is used for measuring ADCC activity against fluorescently-labeled target cells, as described in, e.g., Blomberg et al. (1996) Journal of Immunological Methods 193:199-206. Target cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention include, but are not limited to, breast cancer cell lines, e.g., SK-BR-3 with ATCC accession number HTB-30 (Tremp et al. (1976) Cancer Res. 33-41); B-lymphocytes; cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma, e.g., Raji cells with ATCC accession number CCL-86 (Epstein et al. (1965) J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 34:231-240), and Daudi cells with ATCC accession number CCL-213 (Klein et al. (1968) Cancer Res. 28:1300-1310). The target cells must be recognized by the antigen binding site of the molecule to be assayed. Preferably, the effector cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention are peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that are preferably purified from normal human blood, using standard methods known to one skilled in the art, e.g., using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation.","The administration of the compositions (e.g., antibodies and polypeptides) of the present invention may be for a \u201cprophylactic\u201d or \u201ctherapeutic\u201d purpose, or alternatively can be used for diagnostic purposes. The compositions of the present invention are said to be administered for a \u201ctherapeutic\u201d purpose if the amount administered is physiologically significant to provide a therapy for an actual manifestation of the disease. When provided therapeutically, the compound is preferably provided at (or shortly after) the identification of a symptom of actual disease. The therapeutic administration of the compound serves to attenuate the severity of such disease or to reverse its progress. The compositions of the present invention are said to be administered for a \u201cprophylactic\u201d purpose if the amount administered is physiologically significant to provide a therapy for a potential disease or condition. When provided prophylactically, the compound is preferably provided in advance of any symptom thereof. The prophylactic administration of the compound serves to prevent or attenuate any subsequent advance or recurrence of the disease.","Providing a therapy or \u201ctreating\u201d refers to any indicia of success in the treatment or amelioration of an injury, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement, remission, diminishing of symptoms or making the injury, pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient, slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline, making the final point of degeneration less debilitating, or improving a patient's physical or mental well-being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters, including the results of a physical examination, neuropsychiatric exams, and\/or a psychiatric evaluation.","Preferred subjects for treatment include animals, most preferably mammalian species such as humans or other primates, and domestic animals such as dogs, cats and the like, subject to disease and other pathological conditions. A \u201cpatient\u201d refers to a subject, preferably mammalian (including human).","Certain embodiments of the present invention relate to pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more therapeutic agents, and methods of administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more therapeutic agents, which are capable of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic treatment of disorders. The term \u201ctherapeutic agent\u201d refers to any agent having a therapeutic effect to prophylactically or therapeutically treat a disorder. Exemplary therapeutic agents include the antibodies and polypeptides of the present invention, as well as other therapeutic agents that may be administered in combination with, or conjugated to, an antibody or polypeptide. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic agent is an antibody of the present invention, and preferably is an antibody fragment, a diabody, an Ig-like DART, or a fusion protein.","The molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment and\/or prevention of a disease, disorder or infection where an effector cell function (e.g., ADCC) mediated by Fc\u03b3R is desired (e.g., cancer, infectious disease). For example, molecules of the invention may bind a cell surface antigen and an Fc\u03b3R (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA) on an immune effector cell (e.g., NK cell), stimulating an effector function (e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc.) against said cell. In some embodiments, the antibodies and polypeptides of the invention are especially suited for the treatment of cancers. The efficacy of standard monoclonal antibody therapy depends on the Fc\u03b3R polymorphism of the subject. Carton et al. (2002) Blood 99:754-758; Weng et al. (2003) J Clin Oncol. 21(21):3940-3947. These receptors are expressed on the surface of the effector cells and mediate ADCC. High affinity alleles improve the effector cells' ability to mediate ADCC. The antibodies and polypeptides of the invention may comprise a variant Fc domain that exhibits enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3R (relative to a wild type Fc domain) on effector cells, thus providing better immunotherapy reagents for patients regardless of their Fc\u03b3R polymorphism.","For diagnostic purposes, the antibodies or polypeptides may be coupled to a detectable substance, so that they can be used, for example, to monitor the development or progression of a disease, disorder or infection. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, beta-galactosidase, etc.), prosthetic groups (e.g., avidin\/biotin), fluorescent materials (e.g., umbelliferone, fluorescein, or phycoerythrin), luminescent materials (e.g., luminol), bioluminescent materials (e.g., luciferase or aequorin), radioactive materials (e.g., carbon-14, manganese-54, strontium-85 or zinc-65), positron emitting metals, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the molecules of the invention or indirectly through an intermediate (e.g., a linker), using techniques known in the art.","C1. Treatable Disorders","Exemplary disorders that may be treated by various embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to, proliferative disorders, cell proliferative disorders, and cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders, and infectious diseases. In various embodiments, the invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules (antibodies or polypeptides) which bind to a disease antigen. For example, molecules of the invention are particularly useful for the prevention, inhibition, reduction of growth or regression of primary tumors, metastasis of cancer cells, and infectious diseases. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, molecules of the invention mediate effector function resulting in tumor clearance, tumor reduction or a combination thereof. In alternate embodiments, diabodies of the invention mediate therapeutic activity by cross-linking of cell surface antigens and\/or receptors and enhanced apoptosis or negative growth regulatory signaling.","Antibodies with a decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and an increased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA may lead to an enhanced activating response upon Fc\u03b3R binding and thus have therapeutic efficacy for treating and\/or preventing cancer.

Other exemplary cancers are cancers of additional hematopoietic cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes, such as basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes, dendritic cells, platelets, erythrocytes and natural killer cells.","In some embodiments, the cancer to be treated is breast cancer, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, adrenal carcinoma, or non-small cell lung cancer. In some embodiments, the cancer is breast cancer or prostate cancer. In some embodiments, the cancer is a cancer in which HER2\/neu is overexpressed. In a specific embodiment, an antibody or polypeptide of the invention inhibits or reduces the growth of cancer cells by at least 99%, at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 45%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 35%, at least 30%, at least 25%, at least 20%, or at least 10% relative to the growth of cancer cells in the absence of the antibody or polypeptide of the invention.","Antibodies with an increased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB and a decreased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA and\/or Fc\u03b3RIIA may lead to a diminished activating response upon Fc\u03b3R binding and thus have therapeutic efficacy for treating and\/or preventing inflammation and autoimmune disease. Examples of autoimmune disorders that may be treated by the methods herein include, but are not limited to, alopecia areata, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune Addison's disease, autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Behcet's disease, bullous pemphigoid, cardiomyopathy, celiac sprue-dermatitis, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Churg-Strauss syndrome, cicatrical pemphigoid, CREST syndrome, cold agglutinin disease, Crohn's disease, discoid lupus, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, fibromyalgia-fibromyositis, glomerulonephritis, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barre, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), IgA neuropathy, juvenile arthritis, lichen planus, lupus erythematosus, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, mixed connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus vulgaris, pernicious anemia, polyarteritis nodosa, polychrondritis, polyglandular syndromes, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, primary agammaglobulinemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Raynauld's phenomenon, Reiter's syndrome, Rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, stiff-man syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, takayasu arteritis, temporal arteristis\/giant cell arteritis, type 1 or immune-mediated diabetes mellitus, ulcerative colitis, uveitis, vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis, vitiligo, and Wegener's granulomatosis.","Non-limiting examples of inflammatory disorders treatable by the methods herein include immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs), which are inflammatory conditions caused and sustained by an antigen-specific, pathological immune response.

Formulations","The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated according to known methods for preparing pharmaceutically useful compositions, and may include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and\/or an excipient. The compositions can be in any suitable form, for example tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders, to name just a few non-limiting alternatives. Such compositions may be prepared by any known method, for example by admixing the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s) under sterile conditions.","The active ingredients can also be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art. The physical and chemical characteristics of the compositions of the invention may be modified or optimized according to the skill in the art, depending on the mode of administration and the particular disease or disorder to be treated. The compositions may be provided in unit dosage form, a sealed container, or as part of a kit, which may include instructions for use and\/or a plurality of unit dosage forms.","In particular embodiments, the therapeutic agents can be incorporated into a composition, by, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or fusion protein, receptor-mediated endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu and Wu (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. In another particular embodiment, the therapeutic agents are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted, e.g., with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject.","Preferably, the therapeutic agent is supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, more preferably at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, or at least 75 mg. The lyophilized powder should be stored at between 2 and 8\u00b0 C. in its original container and the molecules should be parenterally administered within 12 hours, preferably within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, the therapeutic agents are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the therapeutic agent. Preferably, the liquid form is supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 1 mg\/ml, more preferably at least 2.5 mg\/ml, at least 5 mg\/ml, at least 8 mg\/ml, at least 10 mg\/ml, at least 15 mg\/kg, at least 25 mg\/ml, at least 50 mg\/ml, at least 100 mg\/ml, at least 150 mg\/ml, at least 200 mg\/ml of the molecules.","C3. Kits","The compositions may also be included in a kit. The kit can include, in non-limiting aspects, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutic agent, instructions for administration and\/or other components. In preferred embodiments, the kit can include a composition ready for administration. Containers of the kits can include a bottle, dispenser, package, compartment, or other types of containers, into which a component may be placed. The container can include indicia on its surface. The indicia, for example, can be a word, a phrase, an abbreviation, a picture, or a symbol. The containers can dispense a pre-determined amount of the component (e.g. compositions of the present invention). The composition can be dispensed in a spray, an aerosol, or in a liquid form or semi-solid form. The containers can have spray, pump, or squeeze mechanisms. In certain aspects, the kit can include a syringe for administering the compositions of the present invention.","Where there is more than one component in the kit (they may be packaged together), the kit also will generally contain a second, third or other additional containers into which the additional components may be separately placed. The kits of the present invention also can include a container housing the components in close confinement for commercial sale. Such containers may include injection or blow-molded plastic containers into which the desired bottles, dispensers, or packages are retained. A kit can also include instructions for employing the kit components as well the use of any other compositions, compounds, agents, active ingredients, or objects not included in the kit. Instructions may include variations that can be implemented. The instructions can include an explanation of how to apply, use, and maintain the products or compositions, for example.","C4. Administration and Dosage","A variety of administration routes for the compositions of the present invention are available. The particular mode selected will depend, of course, upon the particular therapeutic agent selected, whether the administration is for prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of disease, the severity of the medical disorder being treated and dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of this invention may be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable, and produces effective levels of the active compounds without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Such modes of administration include, but are not limited to, oral, buccal, sublingual, inhalation, mucosal, rectal, intranasal, topical, ocular, periocular, intraocular, transdermal, subcutaneous, intra-arterial, intravenous, intramuscular, parenteral, or infusion methodologies. In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.","As used herein, the term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means the total amount of each active component of the pharmaceutical composition or method that is sufficient to show a meaningful patient benefit, i.e., healing or amelioration of chronic conditions, a reduction in symptoms, an increase in rate of healing of such conditions, or a detectable change in the levels of a substance in the treated or surrounding tissue. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially, or simultaneously.","The dosage schedule and amounts effective for therapeutic and prophylactic uses, i.e., the \u201cdosing regimen\u201d, will depend upon a variety of factors, including the stage of the disease or condition, the severity of the disease or condition, the general state of the patient's health, the patient's physical status, age and the like. Therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of the compositions may be determined by standard pharmaceutical, pharmacological, and toxicological procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals. For example, numerous methods of determining ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50 percent of the population) and LD(the dose lethal of 50 percent of the population) exist. The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio ED\/LD. Compositions exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays or animal studies may be used in formulating a range of dosages for human use. The dosage is preferably within a range of concentrations that includes the EDwith little or no toxicity, and may vary within this range depending on the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.","The dosage regimen also takes into consideration pharmacokinetics parameters well known in the art, i.e., the rate of absorption, bioavailability, metabolism, clearance, and the like (see, e.g., Hidalgo-Aragones (1996) J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 58:611-617; Groning (1996) Pharmazie 51:337-341; Fotherby (1996) Contraception 54:59-69; Johnson (1995) J. Pharm. Sci. 84:1144-1146; Rohatagi (1995) Pharmazie 50:610-613; Brophy (1983) Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 24:103-108; the latest Remington, supra). The state of the art allows the clinician to determine the dosage regimen for each individual patient, therapeutic agent and disease or condition treated. Single or multiple administrations of the compositions of the present invention can be administered depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the patient. The duration of prophylactic and therapeutic treatment will vary depending on the particular disease or condition being treated. Some diseases lend themselves to acute treatment whereas others require long-term therapy. If administration is not on a daily basis, for example if injections are given every few days, every few weeks, or every few months, then more therapeutic agent may be included in each administration, so that daily release of the agent is adequate to meet therapeutic needs.","In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic agents of the invention are administered in metronomic dosing regimens, either by continuous infusion or frequent administration without extended rest periods. Such metronomic administration can involve dosing at constant intervals without rest periods. Typically the therapeutic agents, in particular cytotoxic agents, are used at lower doses. Such dosing regimens encompass the chronic daily administration of relatively low doses for extended periods of time, which can minimize toxic side effects and eliminate rest periods. Kamat et al. (2007) Cancer Research 67:281-88. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agents are delivered by chronic low-dose or continuous infusion ranging from about 24 hours to about 2 days, to about 1 week, to about 2 weeks, to about 3 weeks to about 1 month to about 2 months, to about 3 months, to about 4 months, to about 5 months, to about 6 months. The scheduling of such dose regimens can be optimized by the skilled oncologist.","For antibodies encompassed by the invention, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.0001 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.0001 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 2 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 1 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.75 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg to 0.25 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.15 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.10 mg\/kg, 0.001 to 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.01 to 0.25 mg\/kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. The dosage and frequency of administration may be reduced or altered by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation. In one embodiment, the dosage of the antibodies administered to a patient are 0.01 mg to 1000 mg\/day, when used as single agent therapy. In another embodiment the antibodies are used in combination with other therapeutic compositions and the dosage administered to a patient are lower than when said molecules are used as a single agent therapy. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with antibodies in the range of between about 0.1 to 30 mg\/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks.","C5. Combination Therapies","The invention further encompasses administering the antibodies or polypeptides of the invention in combination with other therapies known to those skilled in the art for the treatment or prevention of cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammation, or infectious disease, including but not limited to, current standard and experimental chemotherapies, hormonal therapies, biological therapies, immunotherapies, radiation therapies, or surgery. In some embodiments, the antibodies or polypeptides of the invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more therapeutic agents known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and\/or prevention of cancer, autoimmune disease, infectious disease or intoxication.","As used herein, the term \u201ccombination\u201d refers to the use of more than one therapeutic agent. The use of the term \u201ccombination\u201d does not restrict the order in which therapeutic agents are administered to a subject with a disorder, nor does it mean that the agents are administered at exactly the same time, but rather it is meant that an antibody or polypeptide of the invention and the other agent are administered to a mammal in a sequence and within a time interval such that the antibody or polypeptide of the invention can act together with the other agent to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example, each therapeutic agent (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy or biological therapy) may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time; however, if not administered at the same time, they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Each therapeutic agent can be administered separately, in any appropriate form and by any suitable route, e.g., one by the oral route and one parenterally.","In various embodiments, a first therapeutic agent can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), concomitantly with, or subsequent to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of a second (or subsequent) therapeutic agent to a subject with a disorder. In preferred embodiments, two or more agents are administered within the same patient visit, or no more than 12 hours apart, no more than 24 hours apart, or no more than 48 hours apart.","In certain embodiments, the therapeutic agents are cyclically administered to a subject. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first agent for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second agent and\/or third agent for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies, avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and\/or improves the efficacy of the treatment. Exemplary cycles are about once every week, about once every 10 days, about once every two weeks, and about once every three weeks. Each cycle can comprise at least 1 week of rest, at least 2 weeks of rest, at least 3 weeks of rest. The number of cycles administered is from about 1 to about 12 cycles, more typically from about 2 to about 10 cycles, and more typically from about 2 to about 8 cycles.","In an embodiment for the treatment of a cell proliferative disorder, an antibody or polypeptide of the present invention is conjugated to, or administered in combination with, another therapeutic agent, such as, but not limited to, an alkylating agent (e.g., mechlorethamine or cisplatin), angiogenesis inhibitor, anthracycline (e.g., daunorubicin\/daunomycin or doxorubicin), antibiotic (e.g., dactinomycin, bleomycin, or anthramycin), antibody (e.g., an anti-VEGF antibody such as bevacizumab (sold as AVASTIN\u00ae by Genentech, Inc.), an anti-EGFR antibody such as panitumumab (sold as VECTIBIX\u2122 by Amgen, Inc.), or an anti-integrin antibody such as natalizumab (sold as TYSABRI\u00ae by Biogen Idec and Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)), an antimetabolite (e.g., methotrexate or 5-fluorouracil), an anti-mitotic agent (e.g., vincristine or paclitaxel), a cytotoxin (e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent), a hormone therapy agent (e.g., a selective estrogen receptor modulator (e.g., tamoxifen or raloxifene), aromatase inhibitor, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue, progestational agent, adrenocorticosteroid, estrogen, androgen, anti-estrogen agent, androgen receptor blocking agent, 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, adrenal production inhibitor, etc.), a matrix metalloprotease inhibitor, a radioactive element (e.g., alpha-emitters, gamma-emitters, etc.), or any other chemotherapeutic agent.","Non-limiting examples of suitable angiogenesis inhibitors include ABT-627; angiostatin (plasminogen fragment); angiozyme; antiangiogenic antithrombin III; Bay 12-9566; benefin; bevacizumab; BMS-275291; bisphosphonates; cartilage-derived inhibitor (CDI); CAI; CD59 complement fragment; CEP-7055; Col 3; combretastatin A-4; endostatin (collagen XVIII fragment); farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTI); fibronectin fragment; gro-beta; halofuginone; heparinases; heparin hexasaccharide fragment; HMV833; human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG); IM-862; interferon alpha\/beta\/gamma; interferon inducible protein (IP-10); interleukin-12; kringle 5 (plasminogen fragment); marimastat; metalloproteinase inhibitors (TIMPs); 2-methoxyestradiol; MMI 270 (CGS 27023A); MoAb IMC-1C11; neovastat; NM-3; panzem; PI-88; placental ribonuclease inhibitor; plasminogen activator inhibitor; platelet factor-4 (PF4); prinomastat; prolactin 16 kDa fragment; proliferin-related protein (PRP); PTK 787\/ZK 222594; retinoids; solimastat; squalamine; SS 3304; SU 5416; SU6668; SU11248; tetrahydrocortisol-S; tetrathiomolybdate; thalidomide; thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1); TNP-470; transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b); vasculostatin; vasostatin (calreticulin fragment); ZD6126; and ZD 6474.","Non-limiting examples of additional antibodies for the treatment of a cell proliferative disorder include antibodies to 17-1A, \u03b1v\u03b2, AFP, CD3, CD18, CD20, CD22, CD33, CD44, CD52, CEA, CTLA-4, DNA-associated proteins, EGF receptor, Ep-CAM, GD2-ganglioside, gp IIIb\/IIIa, gp72, HER2, HLA-DR 10 beta, HLA-DR antigen, IgE, ganglioside GD3, MUC-1, nuC242, PEM antigen, SK-1 antigen, tumor antigen CA125, tumor antigen MUC1, VEGF, and VEGF-receptor.","In a different embodiment, an antibody or polypeptide of the present invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutic agent or agents for the treatment of an inflammatory disorder, such as, but not limited to, antibodies, anticholingeric agents, beta-agonists, methyl xanthines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, celecoxib or diclofenac), and steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids, dexamethasone, cortisones, prednisone or eicosanoids).

The additional antibodies may be any suitable antibody for the treatment of an autoimmune disorder, and non-limiting examples include antibodies to a4b7 integrin receptor, CBL antigen, CD2, CD4, CD23, CD40, CD80, FcRI, Gamma Interferon, IL-8, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, ICE interleukin-1 beta, P38MAP kinase, and TNF.","In still another embodiment, an antibody or polypeptide of the present invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutic agent or agents for the treatment of an infectious disease, such as, but not limited to, an antibiotic, anti-fungal, or anti-viral agent. Antibiotics that can be used in combination with the molecules of the invention include, but are not limited to, 2,4 diaminopyrimidines (e.g., brodimoprim), aminoglycosides (e.g., apramycin, neomycin, or spectinomycin), amphenicols (e.g., chloramphenicol), amphomycins, ansamycins (e.g., rifamide and rifampin), bacitracins, carbacephems (e.g., loracarbef), carbapenems (e.g., biapenem and imipenem), cephalosporins (e.g., cephalexin or cefadroxil), cephamycins (e.g., cefbuperazone, cefmetazole, and cefminox), clarithromycins, erythromycins, lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin and lincomycin), macrolides (e.g., tobramycin), monobactams (e.g., carumonam), nitrofurans (e.g., furaltadone, and furazolium chloride), oxacephems (e.g., flomoxef and moxalactam), penicillins, quinolones (e.g., ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin), sulfonamides (e.g., benzylsulfamide, and sulfacytine), sulfones (e.g., diathymosulfone, glucosulfone sodium, and solasulfone), and tetracyclines (e.g., apicycline and chlortetracycline).","Antifungal agents that can be used in combination with the molecules of the invention include, but are not limited to, amphotericin B, butoconazole, ciclopirox, clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole, flucytosine, griseofuldin, haloprogrin, intrathecal, itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, naftifine, nystatin, terbinafine, terconazole, tioconazole, and undecylenate.

Demonstration of Therapeutic Utility","The pharmaceutical compositions, prophylactic, or therapeutic agents of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, in a cell culture system, and in an animal model organism, such as a rodent animal model system, for the desired therapeutic activity prior to use in humans. For example, assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific pharmaceutical composition is desired, include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise contacted with a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, and the effect of such composition upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective prophylactic or therapeutic molecule(s) for each individual patient. In various specific embodiments, in vitro assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell types involved in an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (e.g., T cells), to determine if a pharmaceutical composition of the invention has a desired effect upon such cell types.","Suitable animal model systems include, but are not limited to, rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, pigs, dogs, rabbits, etc. Any animal system well-known in the art may be used. In a specific embodiment of the invention, combinations of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents are tested in a mouse model system. Preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are, for example, transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3Rs on mouse effector cells, e.g., any mouse model described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,396 can be used in the present invention.","Anti inflammatory activity can be determined by using various experimental and spontaneous animal models of inflammatory arthritis known in the art and described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L., \u201cArthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals\u201d, in Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology, McCarty et al. (eds.), Chapter 30 (Lee and Febiger, 1993). For example, adjuvant-induced arthritis models such as carrageenan-, xymosan-, or collagen-induced arthritis in rats, hamsters, rabbits, dogs and pigs, are useful in studying anti-inflammatory activity, and inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats is a primary in vivo screen for the anti inflammatory activity of most NSAIDs, and is considered predictive of human efficacy. These models are described in, e.g., Winter et al. (1962) Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol Med. 111:544-47; and Hansra et al. (2000) Inflammation 24(2):141-55. Animal models for inflammatory bowel disease can also be used to assess the efficacy of therapies of the invention, for example the models described in, e.g., Strober (1985) Dig. Dis. Sci. 30(12 Suppl):3S-10S; Kim et al. (1992) Scand. J. Gastroentrol. 27:529-37). In these models, ulcerative cholitis and Crohn's disease can be induced in animals by oral administration of sulfated polysaccharides, dextran sulfate or chemical irritants.","Efficacy in treating autoimmune disorders may be assessed using animal models for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, thyroid autoimmunity, systemic lupus eruthematosus, and glomerulonephritis, for example the models described in Flanders et al. (1999) Autoimmunity 29:235-46; Krogh et al. (1999) Biochimie 81:511-15; Foster (1999) Semin. Nephrol. 19:12-24, etc.","The anti-cancer activity of the therapeutic agents also can be determined by using various experimental animal models for the study of cancer such as the SCID mouse model, transgenic mice or nude mice with human xenografts, and other animal models such as hamsters, rabbits, etc. known in the art and described in Relevance of Tumor Models for Anticancer Drug Development (1999, eds. Fiebig and Burger); Contributions to Oncology (1999, Karger); The Nude Mouse in Oncology Research (1991, eds. Boven and Winograd); and Anticancer Drug Development Guide (1997 ed. Teicher). Preferred animal models are mouse xenograft models. Tumor cell lines that can be used as a source for xenograft tumors include but are not limited to, SKBR3 and MCF7 cells, which can be derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These cells have both erbB2 and prolactin receptors. SKBR3 cells have been used routinely in the art as ADCC and xenograft tumor models. Alternatively, OVCAR3 cells derived from a human ovarian adenocarcinoma can be used as a source for xenograft tumors.","The therapeutic agents of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. Therapeutic agents and methods may be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival and\/or growth; for example, cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring H-thymidine incorporation, by direct cell count, by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known genes such as proto-oncogenes (e.g., fos, myc) or cell cycle markers; cell viability can be assessed by trypan blue staining, differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes in morphology, decreased growth and\/or colony formation in soft agar or tubular network formation in three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation, etc.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.","D1. Gene Therapy","In a specific embodiment, nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding molecules of the invention, are administered to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection, by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded antibody or fusion protein that mediates a therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Any methods for gene therapy available in the art may be used, for example the methods described in, e.g., Goldspiel et al. (1993) Clinical Pharmacy 12:488-505; Wu and Wu (1991) Biotherapy 3:87-95; Tolstoshev (1993) Ann Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596; Mulligan (1993) Science 260:926-932; and Morgan and Anderson (1993) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217.","In a preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding an antibody, diabody, or fusion protein of the invention, said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids, as described in Koller and Smithies (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 86:8932-35; and Zijlstra et al. (1989) Nature 342:435-38.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a subject may be either direct, in which case the subject is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the subject. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded polypeptide. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods, such as by infection using retroviral or other viral vectors (as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286; Miller et al. (1993) Meth. Enzymol. 217:581-599; Salmons and Gunzberg (1993) Human Gene Therapy 4:129-141; Grossman and Wilson (1993) Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3:110-114; Kozarsky and Wilson (1993) Current Op. in Genetics and Dev. 3:499-503; Walsh et al. (1993) Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289-300; Bout et al.

No. 5,436,146), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus or in linkage to an antigen subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (as described in, e.g., Wu and Wu (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432; Joliot et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 88:1864-1868; WO 92\/06180; WO 92\/22635; WO92\/20316; WO93\/14188; WO 93\/20221) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc.","A nucleic acid may be introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell, for example as described in WO 94\/08598; Rheinwald (1980) Meth. Cell Bio. 21A:229; Pittelkow and Scott (1986) Mayo Clinic Proc. 61:771; Stemple and Anderson (1992) Cell 7 1:973-985. The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a subject by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art. Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the subject.","D2. Vaccine Therapy","In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention may be used to induce an immune response against an antigenic or immunogenic agent, including but not limited to cancer antigens and infectious disease antigens. The vaccine compositions of the invention comprise one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents to which an immune response is desired, wherein the one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents is coated with an antibody of the invention. The vaccine compositions of the invention are particularly effective in eliciting an immune response, preferably a protective immune response against the antigenic or immunogenic agent, which may be a virus against which an immune response is desired, or an antigen derived from other viral or non-viral pathogens.","In yet other embodiments, the invention encompasses pathogenic cells or viruses, preferably attenuated viruses, which express the antibody on their surface. The invention further encompasses methods to induce tolerance in a subject by administering a composition of the invention. Preferably a composition suitable for inducing tolerance in a subject, comprises an antigenic or immunogenic agent coated with an antibody of the invention.","D3. Targeting Liposomes or Other Microcarriers and Nanocarriers","In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be used to prepare targeted liposomes for delivery of a desired therapeutic composition (e.g., anti-cancer agents) to a target cell (e.g., a prostate cancer cell or other HER2\/neu expressing cell). The preparation and use of immunoliposomes for targeted delivery of antitumor drugs is reviewed in Mastrobattista et al. (1999) Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 40:103-127. Liposomes are vesicular structures based on lipid bilayers. They can be as small as 20 nm and as large as 10 \u03bcm in diameter. They can be unilamellar (only one bilayer surrounds an aqueous core) or multilamellar (two or more bilayers concentrically oriented around an aqueous core). Targeting of liposomes using a variety of targeting agents (e.g., antibodies of the invention) is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,957,773 and 4,603,044. Standard methods for coupling targeting agents to liposomes can be used. Antibody targeted liposomes can be constructed using, for instance, liposomes which incorporate protein A. See Renneisen et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265:16337-16342; and Leonetti et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 87:2448-2451.","In a preferred embodiment, the liposomes are formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which generally include neutral and negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of, e.g., liposome size and stability of the liposomes in the bloodstream. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et al. (1980) Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9:467; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871; 4,501,728; and 4,837,028. One method produces multilamellar vesicles of heterogeneous sizes. In this method, the vesicle forming lipids are dissolved in a suitable organic solvent or solvent system and dried under vacuum or an inert gas to form a thin lipid film. If desired, the film may be redissolved in a suitable solvent, such as tertiary butanol, and then lyophilized to form a more homogeneous lipid mixture which is in a more easily hydrated powder-like form. This film is covered with an aqueous solution of the targeted drug and the targeting component (antibody) and allowed to hydrate, typically over a 15-60 minute period with agitation. The size distribution of the resulting multilamellar vesicles can be shifted toward smaller sizes by hydrating the lipids under more vigorous agitation conditions or by adding solubilizing detergents such as deoxycholate.","D4. Immunoassays","The antibodies of the invention can be used to detect HER2\/neu, or cells expressing HER2\/neu. Any of a number of methods may be used to achieve such detection. For example, immunological binding assays may be used (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,366,241; 4,376,110; 4,517,288; and 4,837,168). For a review of the general immunoassays, see also Asai (ed. 1993) Methods in Cell Biology Vol. 37, Academic Press, New York; Stites & Terr (eds. 1991) Basic and Clinical Immunology 7th Ed.","Thus, the present invention provides methods of detecting cells that express HER2\/neu. In one method, a biopsy is performed on the subject and the collected tissue is tested in vitro. The tissue or cells from the tissue is then contacted, with an anti-HER2\/neu antibody of the invention. Any immune complexes which result indicate the presence of a HER2\/neu protein in the biopsied sample. To facilitate such detection, the antibody can be radiolabeled or coupled to an effector molecule which is a detectable label, such as a radiolabel. In another method, the cells can be detected in vivo using typical imaging systems. Then, the localization of the label is determined by any of the known methods for detecting the label. A conventional method for visualizing diagnostic imaging can be used. For example, paramagnetic isotopes can be used for MRI. Internalization of the antibody may be important to extend the life within the organism beyond that provided by extracellular binding, which will be susceptible to clearance by the extracellular enzymatic environment coupled with circulatory clearance.","HER2\/neu proteins can also be detected using standard immunoassay methods and the antibodies of the invention. Standard methods include, for example, radioimmunoassay, immunochromatographic methods, sandwich immunoassays (including ELISA), immunofluorescence assays, Western blot, affinity chromatography (affinity ligand bound to a solid phase), and in situ detection with labeled antibodies.","Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention unless specified.","The kinetic parameters of the binding of eluted and purified antibodies were analyzed using a BIAcore assay (BIAcore instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) and associated software.
