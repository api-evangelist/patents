title: Radioisotope fueled rotary actuator for micro and nano vehicles
abstract: The invention provides an actuator apparatus and method where a source provides electrons to a target material wherein electrical work is performed. A beta emission process comprises a source material emitting electrons which are then captured by a target material. The actuator's source vanes rotate within an electric field between the target chutes' walls, generating torque. The principal providing torque and power is the change in energy as a vane gets closer to the outer walls. During the release and capture process, electrical work is performed which, in turn, is transferred into mechanical work in the form of rotation of the rotor. Specific applications include a radioisotope fueled rotary actuator for micro and nano air vehicles employed as the main form of propulsion.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention was made under Contract No. W911QX-04-C-0097, mod. no. P00001, awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to an electrostatic actuator apparatus and method, and more particularly, to a beta emission process of a source material emitting electrons which are then captured by a target material wherein electrical work is performed which in turn is transferred into mechanical work in the form of rotation of a rotor. Specific applications include a radioisotope fueled rotary actuator for micro and nano air vehicles employed as the main form of propulsion.","A nano air vehicle (NAV) is commonly defined as an air vehicle with a maximum dimension of 7.5 centimeters in any axis, weighing 10 grams or less, and capable of at least 20 minutes endurance and 1-kilometer range.","At this scale, the aerodynamics and power are significant challenges. Multiple tradeoffs are involved. One approach to the challenges is to use lithium polymer batteries as part of the airframe. However, these tend to change size as they are used, impacting structure integrity. Another challenge is motor integration. Conventional fossil or battery powered motors are driven through gear mechanisms to turn a propeller or turbine. These designs impose severe range penalties, have a high specific mass fraction of total air vehicle, and endurance limitations which impact the overall ability to perform specific missions.","Propulsion of micro air vehicle (MAV) and NAV aircraft is traditionally affected through a conventional motor. The problem is that a motor, either electrical (usually DC) or fossil fueled, occupies a rather large portion of the vehicle mass fraction. Furthermore, as the MAV\/NAV vehicle becomes more structurally efficient, the percentage devoted to propulsion utilizing conventional technologies increases further, implying an even harsher penalty in terms of payload due to propulsion requirements. Another significant drawback to conventional propulsion technology is implicit in the range capability of the vehicles. As the vehicles shrink in size, the ability to carry fuel, either electrical or fossil based, enforces strict limits on overall endurance. Thus, a vehicle which is capable of flight at just 30 knots is typically only capable of ranges 7-10 nautical miles. While this may be suitable for some applications, under true operational constraints, a significant increase in range is required in order to make the technology truly valuable to the user community.","Endurance is another area requiring improvement for MAV\/NAV devices. Present technological limits are in the 30 minute range as evident by the AeroVironment\u00ae Black Widow design, typical of high performance MAV's. The flight duration under optimal conditions significantly limits utility to the operator. AeroVironment is a registered trademark of the AeroVironment Inc. Corporation of California.","Radioisotope power systems (RPS) are employed in spacecraft. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) have been used to power, for example, pacemakers and spacecraft, but are complex, requiring the source material, a walled container, thermocouples, and a heat sink to generate electricity. Nor is the energy produced by these compatible with the mass and volume constraints of MAV\/NAVs.","What is needed, therefore, are techniques for an actuator for micro-scale vehicles that is efficient in power conversion, providing sufficient power to generate lift and thrust at this small scale of flight.","Embodiments significantly reduce the mass fraction devoted to air vehicle propulsion and increase range and operation time for MAV\/NAV vehicles. Volumetric and electrical efficiencies are maximized to obtain an operational duration of 1 year for a propeller driven MAV design. The propulsion technique is directly applicable to all other types of micro and nano scale vehicles including ground and water conveyances, including submersibles. Embodiment applications encompass new robotic devices including home products.","Through the use of radioisotopes as the fuel and designing the rotary actuator to take advantage of the intrinsically high operating voltage and resulting high rotational frequency, direct drive is possible in embodiments. This eliminates the need for gearing and ancillary fuel storage containers. Therefore, the mass fraction devoted to propulsion for the vehicle can be significantly altered such that an increase in payload is permissible. This increases the utility of the overall vehicle concept. Furthermore, by using a radioisotope material with a sufficiently long half life, the endurance and therefore the range can be significantly improved allowing the vehicle to fly great distances and loiter over the mission area for weeks to potentially months before returning to the home base. This is a more extensive hover and stare capability than currently available. For embodiments, the radioisotope provides not only propulsive power but electrical power.","Embodiments of the present invention utilize a rotary actuator as a means of driving a conventional propeller for propulsion of the MAV\/NAV. The use of a radioisotope powers an EA at the MAV\/NAV scale at the power density level of \u2267100 mW\/gm. Embodiments are scalable over a range of absolute powers and corresponding sizes. Furthermore, by using a radioisotope to drive the actuator two significant improvements are enabled which dramatically change the MAV\/NAV paradigm. The first is a reduction in overall mass fraction of the air vehicle devoted to propulsion and the second is virtually unlimited range and endurance on the order of three months to a year in embodiments. Furthermore, this technology is not limited to conventional air vehicle designs. The rotary actuator, through a cam and follower motion transmission design, can also drive unconventional flapping wing designs such as an ornithopter. Embodiments can also mimic the biomechanics of insect type devices to effect flight in a manner analogous to dragonflies and hummingbirds.","As mentioned, additional applications include propulsion for micro-submersible vehicles wherein the radioisotope provides not only propulsive power but electrical power to the vehicle. By virtue of elimination of combustion, virtually unlimited range is available. Applications would not suffer from radiation emission safety hazards and so could avail themselves of more energetic sources. Other applications are NASA projects involving miniature robotic payloads which are keenly attuned to the needs for extremely low weight (during launch) and the desire for extremely long operation which is not necessarily afforded through conventional battery technology and solar charging circuits. Additional space applications include robotic devices which \u201cfly\u201d in an unconventional sense over a planetary surface and thus require both propulsion and extremely low weight.","One embodiment provides a rotary electrostatic actuator (EA) apparatus comprising a high voltage source; a target material receiving voltage from the high voltage source; wherein a source vane is attracted to the target material as a result of charges attracted to higher E fields. Another embodiment comprises a radioisotope emission high voltage source. Further embodiments provide at least one of piezoelectric crystals and Van de Graff generator. Yet other embodiments comprise S35; P32; P33; Ca45; and Sn123. In yet further embodiments, the actuator is a disk rotor; a vertical wall rotor; and a stacked rotor. Some embodiments comprise a replaceable source. An embodiment implements partial discharge. Another embodiment comprises a storage capacitor re-charging the target.","Another embodiment is an electrostatic rotary actuator method comprising providing emission from a source; capturing the emission by a target material; generating rotation from electrostatic force; and discharging developed potential. In another embodiment, the source is a radioisotope providing the emission. For other embodiments, the step of discharging comprises partial discharge. Additional embodiments provide a low atomic number beta emitter source. In a yet further embodiment, the radioisotope source further provides electrical power.","Embodiments include a radioisotope fueled electrostatic disk rotary actuator nano air vehicle apparatus comprising two pairs of chutes comprised of metal, wherein the two pairs of chutes comprise a surface film of a light metallic element; a rotating vane disk, between the two pairs of chutes and coaxial with the two pairs of chutes, the rotating vane disk comprising twenty four source vanes comprising beta-emitting radioisotope comprising at least one of S35 and Ca45, wherein the radioisotope comprises a source film with a thickness of about approximately one half penetration depth, whereby current is a maximum; a housing comprising a lead-plated vacuum envelope, enclosing the two pairs of chutes and the rotating vane disk, whereby emission products of the radioisotope are contained, the vacuum envelope is sputtered deposition plated with a lead layer of about approximately one micron, whereby surrounding area is protected from soft X-rays, and beta upset of localized electronics is prevented; and wherein rotation of the rotary actuator is magnetically coupled directly to a propeller component, thereby eliminating losses due to a mechanical gear box, whereby propulsion is provided to the nano air vehicle.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","Overview","An actuator's source vanes rotate within an electric field between chutes' walls, generating torque. The principal which allows torque and power is the change in energy as a vane gets closer to the outer walls. The general equation is Torque=d(Energy)\/d(theta)=d(\u00bd C V^2)\/d(theta). Hence, the vane is attracted toward the narrow sections of the \u201cchutes\u201d. The energy is proportional to the volume of the actuator, so large actuators will have more power and torque. Also, energy is proportional to the E field squared, hence, in embodiments, the E field is held close to the breakdown E field. The power is torque *frequency, so faster charging times and greater rotor RPM generate more power, provided that the electrical current can charge the plates at the higher frequency.","Rotor actuator embodiments provide an electrical-to-mechanical power conversion, and the upper limit of the mechanical power is a fraction of the electrical power, which is Voltage*Current. The larger the current, the more power is generated. For radioisotopes, this means a larger source disk will generate more power. Also, for minimum size, in embodiments, the gap dimension is slightly larger than the threshold distance necessary to prohibit breakdown.","The rotor can be scaled in size for more power. Due to electrostatic breakdown (arcing\/lightning), the gap between the vane and the chute of the rotor will scale as the voltage is increased, and the E field will be a constant. For example, in embodiments, the peak E field is at a value just below the threshold for arcing. As stated, the power of the actuator scales as E field squared, so it is beneficial to maintain high E fields.","A rotary actuator can have reasonably arbitrary spin RPM, unlimited by mechanical resonant frequencies, and hence can generate power just limited by the ability of the current to charge the plates.","The rotor can be charged by anything that generates high voltage. Examples are piezoelectric crystals or Van-de-Graff generators. It is not required that radioisotopes, embedded into the spinning disk, be the energy source. The charging source can be separate from the actuator.","For embodiments, the number of source \u201cwedges\u201d is much larger than the number of chutes, so that, as one wedge is getting discharged at the throat (end) of the chute, the torque is not disturbed for the next wedge. The wedge getting discharged is effectively at the chute voltage, and hence the next wedge will be attracted to this discharged wedge, which will not generate torque, because the discharged wedge is on the same disk. For this reason, in embodiments, there is a throat section at the end of each chute, which fully encapsulates the wedge getting discharged. Hence, the next-in-line wedge always is closer to the chute walls during the discharge process, and not closer to the discharging wedge.","Partial discharge can be used as a technique to keep the same power level at arbitrary RPM. With full discharge, the RPM is limited by the time is takes to re-charge the vanes. With partial discharge, smaller currents are not required to waste time and energy charging up the vane\/capacitor to close to peak voltage. Almost all the torque is generated when the capacitance is near fully charged, due to the E^2 dependence of the torque. Partial discharge can be implemented as a long RC time constant, when the spinning \u201cwedge\u201d of the disk is shorted at the end of the chutes. It can also be implemented as a separate storage capacitor, which quickly re-charges the chute.","Disk rotor embodiments with a flat spinning disk, have the advantage that they are mechanically robust. The flat spinning disk does not experience twist. However, the charge closer to the inner radius is not as effectively generating torque as the charge on the outer radius of the disk. The charge on the inner radius of the disk is also more susceptible to arcing. Vertical wall embodiments have the advantage of more torque, due to all the force being exerted at the farthest radius of the rotor. They are less susceptible to arcing, because the vertical surface of the rotor sees the same large dimensions. They also have the advantage that the outer vertical walls of the disk can be tall and have more surface area and hence more torque. However, mechanically, they are a more 3-dimensional structure that needs to be more rigid due to the strain on the outer walls of the spinning disk.","Using radioisotopes, a vacuum is employed in embodiments to allow the electrons or alpha particles to cross the gap between the spinning disk and the chutes. Without a vacuum, electrons ionize the intervening gas, not charging the capacitance. As shown by the standard \u201cPaschen Curve\u201d, the pressure, for millimeter size gaps or larger, is much less than 1\/1000th of an atmosphere. Pressures above 1\/1000 atmosphere stop charge carriers. Pressures near 1\/1000 atmosphere cause cascading ionization (lightning). This vacuum constraint is not necessary, for example, if embedded radioisotopes are not used to charge the vanes, and instead an external source is used.","Using radioisotopes, about one third of the charge carriers make it across the gap and charge the plates. Since radioisotopes emit charged particles in random directions, only one third have enough energy in the gap direction to bridge the high voltage across the gap, contributing to efficiency considerations.","Electrostatic actuator design particulars follow. Beta emission characteristics are explained as power modes. For example, operation life is highly dependent upon isotope selection. Embodiments provide weeks to months of useful life. Some embodiments may significantly extend this parameter. Rechargeable designs are included. For embodiments where only beta emission is employed, candidate isotopes are considered. X-ray emission can be a concern for some embodiments. However, judicious choice of materials can limit this to manageable levels. Aluminum structure, for example, generates softer X-ray spectrum than copper. Shielding is possible without significant impact to power density for \u201clight\u201d materials. For embodiments, the beta emitter has the lowest atomic number with acceptable half life which decays into stable elements, or maintains beta decay throughout the process. For some embodiments, this eliminates materials such as Ru106 which decays into gamma emitter. For embodiments, Sn123 is a gamma emitter which meets operational life and power density requirements. Embodiments demonstrate size, power density, frequency, absolute power, and stroke to support NAV size scale applications.","Figure Details",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"E field","Volt.","VI","Mech.","Mech","Largest","Smallest"]},{"entry":[{},"max","Max","power","Power","Power\/Mass","Gap","Gap"]},{"entry":["Case","(V\/m)","(kV)","(W)","(W)","mW\/gm","(mm)","(mm)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1) Stepped","5.50E+07","110","0.140","0.016","38.0","4.0","2.0"]},{"entry":"Parallel"},{"entry":"Plate"},{"entry":["2) 1 vane,","5.50E+07","16","0.005","0.002","5.4","4.0","0.2"]},{"entry":"1 spiral"},{"entry":["3) 24 vane,","5.50E+07","40","0.150","0.080","188.0","4.0","0.4"]},{"entry":"1 spiral"},{"entry":["4) 24 vane,","1.00E+08","84","3.800","0.870","2046.0","2.0","0.4"]},{"entry":"4 spiral"},{"entry":["4) 24 vane,","5.50E+07","42","1.100","0.254","598.0","2.0","0.4"]},{"entry":"4 spiral"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The embodiments depicted in  (first through fourth rotor embodiments in , respectively) and the table above have mechanical powers calculated for two different E fields: 5.5e7 and 1.0e8 V\/m (the second E field is double the first E field, and the voltage is doubled as well). In embodiments, the Power is four times larger when the voltage is doubled, for any of these actuators, because Power \u02dcV^2. The two E fields were selected assuming that one of these would be an upper bound below which arcing occurs.","Embodiment case 4 (,  disk rotor embodiment one), is a noted case for comparison. It is the rotary actuator using 4 chutes and 24 source wedges. It achieves, at a large E field, a Power\/Mass of 2048 mW\/gm.","For rotary embodiments, there is a limit to the number of source wedges that can be created around the source disk. The limit is caused by arcing considerations. At the throat of each chute, where each source wedge is individually discharged, there is now a voltage between the discharged source wedge and the neighboring un-discharged source wedge. Hence, there is a large E field, and arcing considerations apply just as between the source wedges and the metal chutes. In embodiments, this gap between source wedges may be free from material so that it is not conductive due to ionization.","An advantage of rotary embodiments is that they can operate at 500 Hz with no mechanical decelerations to overcome. However, a bearing needs to be used in embodiments. For embodiments, this bearing can be contained within a vacuum package, and hence itself not require a vacuum seal.","For embodiment case 1 (,  rotary embodiment four) and case 2 (,  rotary embodiment three), the main torque during a full cycle occurs when the tip of the single source wedge gets close to the throat of the chute. This only occurs once each cycle when only one large source wedge is used. Embodiment case 3 (,  rotary embodiment two) overcomes this situation of case 2 by breaking the large single source wedge into 24 separate smaller source wedges. Now, the main torque is occurring 24 times each cycle.","Case 2 also has another consideration. Torque is proportional to the change in the capacitance between the source wedge and metal chute as a function of angle. By using one large chute, this slope in capacitance is very small over the first 70% of the cycle. Hence, case 4 has 4 chutes to have this large slope region of the chute occur over a larger fraction of the cycle.","Finite element modeling (FEM) produced some results for capacitance v. rotation for 1 cm diameter embodiments. 1) More power is derived from more chutes. But an objective is to allow voltage to be high during the greatest slope of the capacitance. Hence, embodiments can not have too many chutes. More power is achieved with more chutes, to a limit. First, the source wedges need to have enough source film to be able to fully charge each chute as it passing through it. Second the number of chutes should probably be half the number of source wedges, in order for embodiments to optimize the torque on each source wedge.","2) The spiral smooth taper has a larger slope to the capacitance (more torque) compared to steps in a parallel plate design. The spiral chute embodiment has a larger change in the capacitance as a function of angle of the wedge source. The spiral also has less sharp corners to cause arcing.","3) For embodiments, it is better to have a least twice as many source pieces than the number of chutes. This allows a steady torque to be applied, and also allows more total capacitance. One source wedge can be experiencing the most torque near the throat of the chute, and the other source wedge(s) can be in the charging stage. Basically, in embodiments, one does not get double the torque by having double the width of the source wedge, because only the leading edge of the source wedge is experiencing the most torque.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2D","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1A"],"b":["300","305","310","315","320","325","305"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1A"],"b":["400","405","410","415","420"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1A"],"b":["500","505","510","515","520","505","510","525"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"],"b":"600"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 2D"],"b":"700"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B","FIG. 8C"],"b":"800"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":["1","2"]},{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"C"},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03b8"}]}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mi":"V","mn":"2"}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":["P","\u03c4\u03c9"],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}]}]}}}},"For embodiments, torque and power are optimized by optimizing the slope of C, and allowing the voltage to be large.

When the incident beta electron loses enough energy that its velocity is relatively slow but it still has a few keV of energy, then the probability that the beta electron will excite a resonant energy level within the atoms goes up. The beta electron collides with an inner electron and ejects it, creating a vacant inner shell. A valence electron then drops to the lower energy level to fill the vacant inner shell, and, in doing so, transfers this resonant energy to another electron, which then might escape from the target metal. Hence, in embodiments, we want the incident beta electrons to penetrate well beyond the surface of the target metal before they lose enough energy to excite these Auger electrons. This is another reason to allow the beta electrons to retain more than a few keV of kinetic energy before colliding with the target metal, and is another reason to use light-element target metals, which have low resonance K-shell energies.

This \u00bc peak voltage yields the highest VI power product. If the voltage is higher, then the current drops dramatically. The source film for embodiments needs to be about half the penetration depth, in order to yield the maximum current. Hence, some energy is lost as the beta electron escapes from the source film. The energy lost from half the penetration depth was assumed to be 30%, not 50%, because most energy is lost when the electrons are slower and have larger interaction times.

Hence, the metal target thickness will be at a minimum for the amount of energy it is stopping. For example, if P32 is used without consideration of the stopping metal thickness, and if the voltage is limited to 50 kV, then significant metal, hence added weight, is included in embodiments, without benefit. Since the rotary motor can run at 50 kV, embodiments are candidates for materials such as P33, for example, which is a choice from the current and energy perspective in embodiments.","The rotary actuator power can be restricted in embodiments if the maximum current from the isotope is weak and the rotary actuator can not spin very fast. Hence, the rotary actuator is very good during the initial timeline of the decay (within one half-life).","Following is a detailed comparison between the elements, using S35 as the baseline.","S35 ISOTOPE","For embodiments, the maximum voltage using Sulfur 35 is probably limited to approximately 40 kV, which means that the target metal can be the thinnest for the isotopes examined here. This is approximately \u00bc of the maximum beta energy, and is the optimal collection voltage. For embodiments, Sulfur 35 can have a maximum source thickness of approximately 0.2 mm, because the beta electrons need to be able to escape from the source material, and the penetration depth of the beta electrons, at the maximum 167 keV, is only a little larger than 0.2 mm. Using an 87 day half life, this 0.2 mm source thickness is enough to charge 4 times during a 100 Hz cycle; hence there can be 4 chutes. For embodiments, there also needs to be excess kinetic energy on the beta electron to be able to cross the voltage gap. Charge time should be relatively insensitive to the source wedge width, because the capacitance increases proportional to the width. Hence, if we have a limited current, due to restricted film thickness (due to 167 keV beta energy) and longer half-life (half life of S35 is 87 days), the charge time will be longer and embodiments are limited to only a few chutes or parallel plates. For S35, embodiments are limited to 4 chutes based on the limited current. Using 4 chutes, Power\/Mass 300 mW\/gm.","Ca45 ISOTOPE","Calcium 45 has similar behavior to Sulfur 35, except the beta energy is 258 keV instead of 167 keV, and the half-life is 162 days instead of 87 days. The film thickness can be 50% thicker due to the large beta energy, but the total current will be around 0.75 the S35 current due to the factor of two longer half-life. The current is enough to charge the capacitor 3 times during a 100 Hz cycle, and hence there can be 3 chutes. In embodiments, the optimal collection voltage can be 55 kV (or a little larger) instead of 40 kV for S35, which means more power but thicker target metal. Hence, although the longer half life reduces the current by a factor of two, the 30% or so larger voltage compensates for the reduced current. In this figure, 50 kV is assumed, regardless of source, so S35 is assumed to charge to 50 kV instead of 40 kV, and S35 has better Power\/Mass than Ca45. However, if we incorporate the 40 kV voltage instead of 50 kV for S35, then Ca45 and S35 would have very close Power\/Mass. Using 3 chutes, Power\/Mass 170 mW\/gm.","P33 ISOTOPE","P33 has greater differences from Sulfur 35. The beta energy is 249 keV instead of 167 keV, and the half-life is 25 days instead of 87 days. For embodiments, the film thickness can be 50% thicker due to the large beta energy, and the half-life is three times shorter; hence the total current will be around four times larger than the S35 current. The current in embodiments is enough to charge the capacitor 16 times during a 100 Hz cycle, and hence there can be 16 chutes. The optimal collection voltage can be 55 kV (or a little larger) instead of 40 kV for S35, which means more power but thicker target metal. For 16 chute embodiments, by extending the curve, the Power\/Mass \u02dc1000 mW\/gm.","P32 ISOTOPE","P32 has the greatest differences from Sulfur 35. The beta energy is 1700 keV instead of 167 keV, and the half-life is 10 days instead of 87 days. The film thickness in embodiments can be eight times thicker due to the large beta energy, and the half-life is nine times shorter; hence the total current will be around 70 times larger than the S35 current. The current is enough to charge the capacitor 280 times during a 100 Hz cycle, and hence there can be 280 chutes, and the voltage can go up to 400 kV.","Other considerations are applied next regarding power. If we just assume that the collection voltage can only be 50 kV based on breakdown, then we only use the large beta energy to create large currents, but we need very thick metal targets to trap the beta electrons (1.2 mm). If 16 chutes are implemented, based on breakdown between source wedges, then, by extending the curve, the Power\/Mass 400 mW\/gm. For embodiments, P32 would be better than P33 if the actuator can be charged to more than 50 kV. In embodiments, one benefit of the large film thickness is that the source material can be \u201coverstuffed\u201d and an adequate current can be generated for lifetimes 5 or 10 times larger (50 to 100 days) than the element half life of 10 days.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0140"},"figref":"FIG. 36","b":["3600","3605","3610","3615","3620"]},"In embodiments, conversion from electrical to mechanical power is accomplished by direct magnetic coupling to the rotor through a vacuum housing.
