title: Recording control device, recording system, recording control method, and recording medium storing a program executed by a control unit that controls the recording device
abstract: A printer that detects an error when a host computer does not send a timer reset command for a specific time is connected to a host computer. The host computer outputs a timer reset command to the printer using an application execution unit function, and causes the printer to print data processed by the application program. A timer reset command is sent to the printer when the application execution unit outputs a timer reset command and when a print job for printing the data is sent to the printer.

Technical Field","The present invention relates to a recording control device connected to a recording device, to a recording system that has this recording control device, to a recording control method executed by the recording control device, and to a program.","2. Related Art","Technology enabling a recording device to detect errors in data sent from an external device when a printer or other recording device is connected to a host device or other external device is taught in Japanese Unexamined Patent Appl. Pub. JP-A-H11-134146. Using the technology taught in JP-A-H11-134146, the recording device automatically determines if recording data is missing, for example, and detects errors during data transmission.","The system taught in JP-A-H11-134146 detects errors during data transmission from an external device to the recording device. Other events that could interfere with normal printing include a loss of power due to a mistake operating the external device connected to the recording device, external device hang-up, or a short in or disconnection of the cable connecting the external device and the recording device. When such an event occurs, the recording device cannot receive data and an OK\/error determination based on the received data is difficult. As a result, the user must directly check the operating status of the external device. However, if the external device and recording device are in separate locations, the need for the user of the recording device to go and check the status of the external device is a bother and imposition for the user.","When a recording device and external device are communicably connected, the present invention enables the recording device to accurately detect errors in the operating status of the external device connected to the recording device.","A first aspect of at least one embodiment of the invention is a recording control device that is communicably connected to a recording device that receives a connection confirmation command and detects (determines) an error when a time during which the connection confirmation command is not received reaches a first reference time, the recording control device including: an application execution unit that executes an application program and outputs data processed by the application program as recording data; and a recording control unit that sends a recording job to the recording device based on the recording data output by the application execution unit. When the application execution unit does not output the connection confirmation command, the recording control unit checks the status of the application execution unit and based on the status generates and sends the connection confirmation command to the recording device instead of the application execution unit.","In this aspect of the invention a recording control device connected to a recording device that performs a function of detecting an error when a connection confirmation command is not received from the externally connected recording control device sends a connection confirmation command to the recording device when the application execution unit running an application program outputs a connection confirmation command to the recording device and when recording data for recording data processed by the application execution unit is sent to the recording device. However, when the application execution unit cannot output the connection confirmation command due to an unexpected event such as the output timing of the recording data and the transmission timing of the connection confirmation command overlapping, the recording control unit checks the status of the application execution unit, and instead of the application execution unit generates and sends the connection confirmation command to the recording device based on this status. As a result, the recording device will not detect an error when the recording control unit is operating normally and can execute the application program, and the recording device can accurately detect errors in the operating status of the recording control device.","Preferably, recording control unit has a timer, outputs a response request to the application execution unit before the time during which the application execution unit does not output at least the connection confirmation command reaches the first reference time, and sends the connection confirmation command to the recording device if the application execution unit outputs a response to the response request,","With this aspect of the invention the recording device can be prevented from detecting an error when the application execution unit does not send a connection confirmation command due to an unexpected event because the recording device sends a response request to the application execution unit before detecting an error as a result of not receiving a connection confirmation command from the recording control device. The recording device can therefore accurately detect errors in the operating state of the recording control device because the recording device detects errors only when an error that should be detected occurs on the recording control device, such as when the application program cannot run or operation of the recording control device stops.","Further preferably, a second reference time that is shorter than the first reference time is preset in the recording control unit, and the recording control unit outputs a response request to the application execution unit when the time during which the application execution unit does not output at least the connection confirmation command reaches the second reference time.","Because a response request is sent to the application execution unit based on the second reference time, which is shorter than the first reference time at which the recording device detects an error, in this aspect of the invention, the response request can be reliably executed before the recording device detects an error, and the recording device can therefore be prevented from detecting an error when a connection confirmation command is not sent for some unexpected reason.","Further preferably, the recording control unit generates and sends the connection confirmation command to the recording device when the application execution unit outputs the recording data.","In this aspect of the invention the recording control unit instead of the application execution unit can generate and send the connection confirmation command to the recording device when the application execution unit does not output the connection confirmation command because the application execution unit can be determined to be operating normally when it is outputting recording data.","Another aspect of at least one embodiment of the invention is a recording system including a recording device that records on a recording medium, and a recording control device communicably connected to the recording device. The recording device includes a reception unit that receives a connection confirmation command from the recording control device, and an error detection unit that detects an error when the time during which the connection confirmation command is not received by the reception unit reaches a preset first reference time. The recording control device includes an application execution unit that executes an application program and outputs data processed by the application program as a recording data, and a recording control unit that sends a recording job to the recording device based on the recording data output by the application execution unit.

The printer  is an example of a recording device that prints (records) markings such as text or images on a cut-sheet recording medium or continuous web of plain paper, coated paper, or plastic, for example. The host computer  is a recording control device that controls and causes the printer  to record the markings. This embodiment of the invention shows a configuration having a 1:1 connection between the host computer  and printer , but there is no limit to the number of printers  that may be connected to one host computer , and a plurality of printers  may be connected to the host computer . A configuration having one printer  connected to a plurality of host computers  is also conceivable.","The communication line  is a communication cable or wireless connection connecting the host computer  and printer  1:1. Alternatively, the communication line  may be a wired or wireless LAN, or a wide-area network using public telecommunication lines, for connecting a plurality of printers  to one host computer .","Furthermore, while the recording method of the printer  is also not particularly limited, the printer  according to this embodiment of the invention is an inkjet printer that prints markings such as text or images by discharging plural colors of ink from a printhead onto the recording medium.","As shown in , main components of the host computer  include a CPU , a ROM  as nonvolatile memory, RAM  as volatile memory, a storage unit  as a large capacity storage device, an input unit  connected to a keyboard or other input device, an output unit  connected to a display device or other output device, and a communication interface . The host computer  controls the printer  using the CPU  executing the operating system A, application program B, and printer driver C stored in the storage unit  and outputting commands and print data to the printer  through the communication interface . The host computer  sends print jobs including the data to be printed and a command instructing the printer to print the print data to the printer . The host computer  also sends a timer reset command (connection confirmation command) described below at a regular period to the printer .","Main components of the printer  include a CPU , a ROM  as nonvolatile memory, RAM  as volatile memory, a communication interface , a print control unit  that prints by discharging ink onto paper used as the recording medium, a paper transportation mechanism , a printhead , a speaker , and an LED indicator .","The printer  receives print data by communicating with the host computer  through the communication interface  while the CPU  executes firmware stored in flash ROM . Based on the received commands and print data, the print control unit  drives the printhead  while conveying the paper using the paper transportation mechanism  to print on the paper and issue a receipt or coupon, for example. The printer  reports information visually or audibly to the user when issuing a receipt or coupon, for example, and when an error occurs, including host computer  errors, by causing the LED indicator  to light steady or blink, or outputting a melody or spoken message from the speaker . The speaker  may also be a simple buzzer.","The printer  monitors commands sent from the host computer , and determines if the host computer  is operating normally. The printer  also executes a specific error detection process when the host computer  is determined to not be operating normally. This error detection process of the printer  is described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["2","3","1","21","2","24","41","3","42"]},"As shown in , the printer  includes a reception unit  that receives commands and print data sent from the host computer , and a receive buffer  that temporarily stores the commands and print data received by the reception unit . The data stored by the receive buffer  is interpreted by the command interpreter , which passes control commands to the control command buffer  and print data to the print buffer  by DMA, for example.","Print data temporarily stored in the print buffer  is converted by a data conversion process to produce dot pattern data corresponding to the nozzle rows of the printhead , and stored in the print buffer . The control command data temporarily stored in the control command buffer  is read by the main control unit , and processes corresponding to the control commands, such as cutting the paper used as the recording medium, are executed by the main control unit .","The error detection unit  monitors if the host computer  is operating normally, and if a host computer  operating error is detected, a host computer  error is reported to the user.","The error detection settings storage unit  is an area reserved in flash ROM , and stores settings used in the error detection process. These settings include a first reference time for determining if the host computer  is operating normally, and the type of reporting method used to report an error when a host computer  error is detected.","The error detection unit  starts the timer  counting, and monitors if the timer reset command (connection confirmation command) was received from the host computer  during the count. The timer reset command is a real-time control command (immediately executed control command), and is detected and received by the reception unit  even if the printer  is offline, for example. If a timer reset command is received by the reception unit , the error detection unit  stops the timer , resets the count, and then starts counting again. While normal control commands stored in the control command buffer  are executed sequentially, the printer  immediately executes real-time control commands with priority over other commands when the command interpreter  detects a real-time control command in the receive buffer .","The error detection unit  determines that a host computer  error has occurred if the timer  count reaches the first reference time stored in the error detection settings storage unit  before the reception unit  receives the timer reset command after the timer  starts counting. In other words, the host computer  sends the timer reset command to the printer  on a shorter cycle than the first reference time stored by the printer  in this recording system , and the printer  detects an error if this timer reset command is not received by the printer  within this first reference time.","The host computer  performs the basic functions of the printer  by running the operating system A stored in the storage unit . The host computer  includes an application execution unit  that runs an application program B stored in the storage unit , a printer driver execution unit  (recording control unit) that runs the printer driver C, and a communication unit  that communicates print jobs and commands with the printer .","The application execution unit  runs an application program, processes data, and constantly outputs the processed data. When printing is instructed while executing the application program, the application execution unit  outputs the print execution command and the data to be printed as the print data (data for recording) to the printer driver execution unit .","The application execution unit  generates and outputs a timer reset command each time a preset time passes to indicate normal operation. This timer reset command can be output as an independent command or output with the print data.","The printer driver execution unit  includes a command transmission control unit , timer , application monitor  that monitors the operating status of the application execution unit , and a communication unit  that communicates with the printer .","Based on the print communication (print data) output as a result of the application execution unit  running the application program, the command transmission control unit  generates control commands and print jobs for printing the print data, and outputs to the printer  using the communication unit . The print jobs include the data to be printed and a print execution command telling the printer to print the print data, and may include other commands in addition to the print execution command.","The communication unit  sends commands to the printer  and receives information from the printer  according to the application programming interface (API) through a port (a LAN port in this embodiment of the invention) for communicating with the printer .","When the application execution unit  outputs print data and an instruction to print, the command transmission control unit  generates a print job by generating and combining a print execution command with the data for printing, and sends the generated print job to the communication unit . When the application execution unit  outputs a timer reset command, the command transmission control unit  sends the timer reset command to the printer  through the communication unit . The command transmission control unit  also generates and sends a timer reset command through the communication unit  to the printer  when a print job is generated and sent to the printer . The command transmission control unit  thus sends a timer reset command to the printer  whenever the application execution unit  outputs a timer reset command or a print instruction.","The timer  counts while being controlled by the application monitor . The application monitor  starts counting using the timer  after the printer driver execution unit  starts operating, and monitors if the application execution unit  outputs a timer reset command or a print instruction including a timer reset command while counting continues. The data to be printed may be included in this print instruction, and if only the data to be printed is output, this print data may function as the print command. When a timer reset command is output from the application execution unit , the application monitor  stops counting by the timer , resets the count, and then restarts counting.","The application monitor  monitors whether or not the timer  count has reached a preset second reference time without the application execution unit  outputting a timer reset command or print data including a timer reset command after the timer  starts counting. This second reference time is stored as configuration data D in the storage unit . If the timer  count reaches this second reference time while the application execution unit  has not output the timer reset command or print data including a timer reset command, the application monitor  sends a response request to the application execution unit , and detects an application execution unit  error if there is no response to this response request. The application monitor  can determine from this response request that the application execution unit  is operating normally even when the application execution unit  is OK but cannot output a timer reset command.","When an error is detected, the application monitor  issues an error report using a function of the output unit  instead of sending a command to the printer .","As described above, the invention is not limited to using a dedicated timer reset command when stopping and resetting the timer  count, and may stop counting by the timer  and reset the count using a print or other control command or a command with a specific function other than printing. More specifically, the function of a timer reset command may be incorporated into a command that is used as a printing or other control command, or a command with a specific function other than printing. This configuration enables applying the invention using an existing command system without defining a new timer reset command.","If the application execution unit  hangs while executing the application program due to a software problem in the recording system , the host computer  may have stopped operating normally due to a problem with the communication line  connecting the host computer  and printer , or because the host computer  power supply was interrupted due to an operator error, for example. The printer  may also be located in a different location than the host computer  in this recording system . For example, the host computer  and printer  may be located on different floors in the same building, or the printer  and host computer  may be located in remote locations by using a dedicated circuit or public telecommunication network as the communication line . Because it is difficult for the user of the printer  to monitor the host computer  when the host computer  and printer  are remote from each other, the remote printer  can preferably quickly detect host computer  errors. So that host computer  errors can be quickly detected by a function of the printer , the recording system  detects errors based on the first reference time described above.","The error reporting method of the printer  may include one or a combination of printing an error message, displaying the error using an LED indicator , or outputting an audible error report such as a particular error sound or speech output from a speaker . By using a combination of a printed error message, audio output, and LED indicator  output, the printer  user can both visually and audibly recognize the host computer error status, reliably determine the cause even if the system is down, and can quickly take measures to recover the system.","Note that the first reference time and reporting settings stored in the printer  can be changed as a result of the host computer  outputting a configuration command even while the system is running. If the first reference time and reporting settings can thus be changed, an appropriate error detection process reflecting the preferred operating configuration of the system administrator can be executed.","The error detection process is described next with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["210","2"]},"When it starts operating, the printer driver execution unit  starts the timer  counting (step S), and determines by a function of the application monitor  whether the application execution unit  outputs a timer reset command or a print command (including the print data) including a timer reset command (step S).","While a print command including a timer reset command or a timer reset command is not output, the printer driver execution unit  determines if the timer  count has reached the second reference time (step S).","When the application execution unit  outputs a timer reset command or print instruction including a timer reset command (step S returns Yes), the printer driver execution unit  generates a timer reset command by a function of the command transmission control unit  and sends the command to the printer  through the communication unit  (step S). After the timer reset command is sent, control goes to step S described below.","If the timer  count reaches the second reference time before the timer reset command or print instruction including a timer reset command is output (step S returns Yes), the printer driver execution unit  outputs a response request to the application execution unit  by a function of the application monitor  (step S).","The application monitor  waits for the response from the application execution unit  to this response request (step S), and if a normal response is received within a specific time (step S returns Yes), goes to step S and sends a timer reset command instead of the application execution unit .","If a normal response from the application execution unit  is not received within the specific time (step S returns No), the printer driver execution unit  determines that an error occurred in the operation of the application execution unit , reports the error using the output unit  (step S), and goes to step S. This configuration avoids determining that an error occurred when an error has not occurred in application execution unit  but the application execution unit  cannot output a timer reset command because it is executing a different process of higher priority.","In step S the printer driver execution unit  resets the timer  count, and determines whether or not to stop operation (step S). If operation continues, the process returns to step S. If operation stops, the process ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["1","201","210","3"]},"As described above, the application program B is written to output a timer reset command at a regular period while it is being run by the application execution unit . The application execution unit  therefore outputs a timer reset command on a regular cycle (step S), and the printer driver execution unit  thereby resets the timer  and sends a timer reset command to the printer  (step S). The printer  receiving this timer reset command resets the timer .","In addition to when the application execution unit  outputs a timer reset command, the printer driver execution unit  also generates and sends a timer reset command to the printer  (step S) when the application execution unit  outputs a print command (step S). The printer driver execution unit  executes a process to generate and send a print job to the printer  according to the print instructions output by the application execution unit  (step S).","This function of the printer driver execution unit  can send a timer reset command to the printer  when the timer reset command that should be output by the application execution unit  is not output, and when the output timing of the timer reset command is late. For example, if the timing when the application execution unit  outputs the timer reset command and the timing when the print instruction is output overlap, the output timing of the timer reset command may be delayed or the timer reset command may not be output because the print instruction takes priority. Even in such cases, however, a timer reset command can be reliably sent to the printer .","The printer driver execution unit  is configured so that the timer  count reaches the second reference time before the count of the printer  timer  reaches the first reference time used for error detection. When the timer  count reaches the second reference time, the printer driver execution unit  outputs a response request to the application execution unit  (steps S, S). When the application execution unit  outputs a response signal in response to this response request (step S), the printer driver execution unit  generates and sends a timer reset command to the printer  (step S). This is the operation whereby the printer driver execution unit  checks the operation of the application execution unit  immediately before the printer  detects an error when a timer reset command is not sent. A timer reset command may not be output even though the application execution unit  is operating normally because the application execution unit  is executing another process or another function unit is executing another process, or for some other unexpected reason. However, as a result of the printer driver execution unit  checking the operation of the application execution unit  and the printer driver execution unit  generating and outputting a substitute timer reset command immediately before the printer  detects an error, the printer  can be prevented from detecting an error while the application execution unit  is operating in such situations.","If the timer  count reaches the second reference time, the printer driver execution unit  outputs a response request to the application execution unit , and the application execution unit  does not return a response within the specified time, the printer driver execution unit  determines that an error occurred in the application execution unit  and does not send a timer reset command to the printer . As a result, the printer driver execution unit  can also determine if an error occurred, and on the printer  side the timer  count will reach the first reference time and an error will be reported.","As described above, the recording system according to this embodiment of the invention has a function that detects an error when the printer  does not receive a timer reset command from the host computer  within a certain period of time. The recording system according to this embodiment of the invention is configured so that a function of the application execution unit  running an application program on the host computer  connected to the printer  outputs a timer reset command at a specific period to the printer  and outputs a command to print data processed by an application program. When the application execution unit  outputs a timer reset command and when it outputs a print command, the printer driver execution unit  sends a timer reset command to the printer .","More specifically, in a recording system according to this embodiment of the invention, the host computer , which is communicably connected to a printer  that detects (determines) an error has occurred when the time in which a timer reset command is not received reaches a first reference time, has an application execution unit  and a printer driver execution unit . The application execution unit  runs an application program and outputs data processed by the application program as recording data, and the printer driver execution unit  sends a recording job to the printer  based on the recording data output by the application execution unit . When the application execution unit  does not output the timer reset command, the printer driver execution unit , instead of the application execution unit , checks the status of the application execution unit , and sends a timer reset command to the printer  as appropriate based on the detected status.","As a result, even when the application execution unit  cannot output a timer reset command for some accidental reason, such as a conflict between the timer reset command output timing and the output timing of the data for printing, a timer reset command is sent to the printer  by outputting print data. The printer  will therefore not detect an error when the host computer  can execute the application program, and the printer  can accurately detect if the operating status of the host computer  is normal or an error has occurred.","In addition, when the host computer  hangs while the application execution unit  is executing the application program due to a software problem, or the host computer  stops operating normally due to a problem with the communication line  connecting the host computer  and printer , or because the host computer  power supply was interrupted due to an operator error, for example, the printer  also can accurately detect an error and the user can immediately know that a host computer  error has occurred from the error detection report of the printer .","As a result, even when the host computer  is located remotely from the printer , the user of the printer  can immediately know when a host computer  error has occurred, and can quickly take action to restore the system. Because the host computer  will thus not detect an error when the host computer  is operating normally, wasted effort spent checking the operating status or resetting the host computer  can be prevented, and the recording system  can operate efficiently.","In addition, the printer driver execution unit  of the host computer  outputs a response request to the application execution unit  before the time that the application execution unit  does not output a timer reset command or print data reaches the first reference time, and sends a timer reset command to the printer  if the application execution unit  returns a response to the response request. As a result, an opportunity to send a timer reset command before the printer  detects an error is assured when the application execution unit  does not send a timer reset command due to some accidental event, and the printer  can be prevented from detecting an error. As a result, because the printer  detects an error only when an error that should be detected occurs on the host computer  side, such as when an application program hangs or host computer  operation stops, the printer  can accurately detect errors in the operating status of the host computer .","In addition, because a second reference time that is shorter than the first reference time is preset in the printer driver execution unit , and a response request is output to the application execution unit  when the time for which the application execution unit  does not output a timer reset command or print job reaches the second reference time, a response request can be reliably executed before the printer  detects an error.","This embodiment of the invention describes the printer driver execution unit  generating a print job based on a print instruction output by the application execution unit , but the invention is not so limited. For example, a configuration in which the application execution unit  generates and outputs print jobs, and the printer driver execution unit  sends the print jobs to the printer is also conceivable.","In the recording system  having one or a plurality of printers  connected to one host computer  according to the foregoing embodiment of the invention, the printer driver execution unit  of the host computer  monitors the time that the application execution unit  does not output a print command or timer reset command, but the invention is not so limited. For example, a configuration in which a plurality of host computers  and a plurality of printers  are communicably connected over a single network, and one host computer  monitors the time that the application execution unit  of another host computer  does not output a print command or timer reset command, is also conceivable. Further alternatively, a configuration in which a dedicated device that monitors the operation of the application execution unit  of each host computer  is connected to the host computer  is also conceivable.","The first reference time is also preset and stored in flash ROM , and the second reference time is preset and stored in the storage unit , in the foregoing embodiment, but the host computer  could communicate with the printer , acquire the first reference time stored in the printer , and automatically set a second reference time that is shorter than the acquired first reference time.","Yet further, in addition to causing an LED indicator  to light steady or blink, printing a message reporting that an error occurred, or audibly outputting an error message, the method whereby the printer  reports an error could involve the printer  sending a control signal to another device connected to the printer , and the device that receives this control signal displaying a message or otherwise reporting the error.","Because the printer driver execution unit  in these configurations generates and sends a timer reset command to the printer  at an appropriate time, the invention can be used with a variety of application programs B even if the application program B or application execution unit  is not compatible with the timer reset command.","The printer  is also described as an inkjet printer in the foregoing embodiment, but the recording devices to which the invention can be applied are not particularly limited insofar as the recording device can be any device that records markings such as text and images. More specifically, the invention can also be used with thermal printers that print to thermal roll paper using a line thermal head having heating elements, to dot impact printers, and laser printers.
