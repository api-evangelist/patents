title: Clamping device for securing cables to submerged ferrous hull surface
abstract: A cable clamping arrangement for securing one or more cables to a submerged hull surface of a ship. The cable clamping arrangement includes a plurality of powerful magnetic clamping devices for attaching signal carrying cables to a submerged ferrous submerged hull surface. The cable clamping devices each have a low-profile and are dome shaped to reduce hydrodynamic interference when the ship is travelling at operational speeds. The clamps are equipped to grip a cable in a desired path at a desired tension, thereby increasing the ability to maintain the cable in a fixed manner on the surface while the ship is operating.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy, and, thus the claimed invention may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally a cable clamping arrangement for securing a cable to a submerged bull surface, more particularly, a clamping arrangement including a plurality of powerful magnetic clamping devices for attaching signal carrying cables to a submerged ferrous submerged hull surface.","During sea trials it is often required to mount data collection devices, such as video cameras and accompanying cables, to the underwater portion of the hull of a ship. These devices may be mounted in a dry dock. Alternatively, the cables may also be mounted using underwater methods by divers. Some installation methods may be applicable to both dry dock environments and underwater environments.","Regardless of the method in which the cables may be secured to the bull, there is a need for improved cable-mounting when the cable is mounted below the ship's waterline for the purpose of underwater operations. For example, a commonly used method for securing cables to the submerged hull surface is to weld attachment points. The welding may be done in a dry dock scenario or may be carried out by underwater welding. Regardless, these permanent welds are very expensive, not easily reversed, and not always possible since the inside of the vessel must be certified as gas free. Another known method is to cut holes in the ship hull, install a waterproof pass-through, and run the cables directly through from the inside of the hull. This is also expensive, and could risk sinking the vessel.","The implementation of magnetic cable fasteners or guides has been used in non-water-related environments. If implemented for submerged hulls it would be beneficial because magnetic cable fasteners would simplify underwater cable installations. However, the prior art does not teach cable fasteners or guides that are robust enough for either underwater installation, or strong enough to work in after-installation applications, such as when the ship is travelling at operational speeds. For example, the prior art teaches a magnetic cable guide, but this device uses a magnet that only has a magnetic force of 2.2 lbs. This will not work in an underwater environment, as it is not strong enough to hold the cable firmly or to prevent damage by strumming since it does not have internal clamping to firmly hold the cable.","Thus it is desired to have a magnetic cable clamp that robust enough for underwater implementation, that can properly clamp and maintain a cable in position even when exposed to working conditions when the ship is traveling at operational speeds. It is also desired to have a clamp that minimizes hydrodynamic drag and that is not easily pulled off the hull when the ship is in operation. It is also desired to have magnetic clamps that are easily and securely installed and easily removed. It is also desired that the signals traveling through the cable are not disturbed by the magnets.","In one aspect, the invention is a cable clamping device for securing one or more cables to underwater ferrous surfaces. In this aspect, the cable clamping device has a low-profile housing body that is substantially dome shaped. The low-profile housing body includes a first outer section having a first bore for receiving a first magnet and a second outer section having a second bore for a second magnet. The low-profile housing body also includes a middle section having a bottom arch portion defining a cable receiving opening. The middle section extends from the first outer section to the second outer section, wherein the first outer section, the second outer section, and the middle section form a truncated n-shaped side profile. In this aspect, the cable clamping device also includes a first magnet within the first bore, a second magnet within the second bore, and a cable gripping member within the bottom arch portion of the middle section for gripping the cable within the cable receiving opening.","In another aspect, the invention is a cable clamping arrangement for securing a cable to a submerged hull surface. In this aspect the cable clamping arrangement includes a submerged ferrous hull surface, a cable for carrying signals, a plurality of cable clamping devices, and a cable tension sensor for determining when the cable is secured at a desired tension. In this aspect, the cable clamping devices are magnetically attached to submerged ferrous hull surface, wherein the cable is held along the submerged ferrous hull surface in a desired path by the plurality of cable clamping devices. According to the invention, the cable is in working contact with the cable tension sensor ensuring that the cable is extended at the desired tension. Each of the plurality of cable clamping devices has a low-profile housing body that is substantially dome shaped. The low-profile housing body has a first outer section having a first bore for receiving a first magnet, a second outer section having a second bore for a second magnet, and a middle section having a bottom arch portion defining a cable receiving opening. The middle section extends from the first outer section to the second outer section, wherein the first outer section, the second outer section, and the middle section form a truncated n-shaped side profile. In this aspect, each cable clamping device further includes a first magnet within the first bore, a second magnet within the second bore, and a cable gripping member within the bottom arch portion of the middle section for gripping the cable within the cable receiving opening.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIGS. 1B and 1C","FIGS. 1A, 1B"],"b":["100","1","100","100"]},"As outlined below, the cable clamping device  is for securing cables, such as data and video cables, to underwater ferrous surfaces.
