{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to wireless communications, and more particularly, to a mechanism for controlling an interval at which a network polls for a location of a mobile station.","Wireless telecommunication networks are increasingly using wireless location technologies to determine the locations of mobile stations they serve. As a result, there is an increasing interest in developing location-based services and applications, i.e., applications that make use of mobile station location information. These location-based applications may simply track or monitor the locations of mobile stations, or they may provide information or services to mobile stations based on their locations. Such location-based applications may be internal to the wireless telecommunication network, or they may be third-party applications that obtain the locations of mobile stations from a location server or other entity in the wireless telecommunication network. The Location Inter-operability Forum (LIF) has developed the \u201cMobile Location Protocol Specification\u201d (version 3.0.0 published on Jun. 6, 2002), which defines one access method that allows applications to obtain mobile station location information from a wireless network.","In the existing art, in order to determine that a mobile station is positioned at a designated location, an entity of a wireless network will periodically determine the mobile station's location, until the mobile station's location matches the designated location. For example, the wireless network may poll a mobile station every ten minutes to determine if the mobile station is located at designated locations. The process of periodically determining a mobile station's location, however, can be inefficient, particularly if the mobile station is currently located far away from the designated location. Moreover, periodically polling to determine the mobile station's location exhausts network resources, considering that the network may perform the polling function for many mobile stations at once.","According to the exemplary embodiment, a method for managing location polling intervals is provided. The method includes determining a current location of a mobile station and making a comparison of the current location to a designated location. The method further includes, based on the comparison, computing a next time to determine an updated location of the mobile station.","As one application of the exemplary embodiment, an application residing within a network entity may need to know when a mobile station arrives at or near a particular location. According to the exemplary embodiment, a location determining element can poll the mobile station once to determine its current location, and then receive an estimation of a travel time for the mobile station to travel from the current location to the particular location. The estimated travel time may be the fastest time (in minutes) that it would take the mobile station to arrive at the particular location, for example. The location determining element can then poll the mobile station again once the estimated time period has expired (or before the estimated time period has expired) to determine an updated location of the mobile station. This method of polling the mobile station prevents a network from polling users every 2 minutes (or at some pre-set configuration) unnecessarily and may help reduce use of network resources.","In another respect, the exemplary embodiment may take the form of a method that includes determining when a mobile station is located within a range of a designated location by: (i) determining a current location of the mobile station, (ii) if the current location is not within the range, computing a next time to determine an updated location of the mobile station, and at the next time, repeating from step (i). The method further includes responsively providing the mobile station with content that is associated with the designated location when the mobile station is located within the range of the designated location.","In still another respect, the exemplary embodiment may take the form of a system that includes a content serving element and a location determining element. The content serving element stores content associated with a designated location and sends the content to a mobile station when the mobile station is located within a range of the designated location. The location determining element is arranged to determine when the mobile station is located within the range and to responsively inform the content server when the mobile station is within the range. The location determining element determines when the mobile station is located within the range by performing a process that includes (i) determining a current location of the mobile station, (ii) if the current location is not within the range, computing a next time to determine an updated location of the mobile station, and at the next time, repeating from step (i).","These as well as other features, advantages and alternatives will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings.","The present invention provides a mechanism for controlling the interval at which a network polls for the location of a mobile station. The invention is particularly useful in a scenario where an effort is being made to determine that a mobile station is positioned at a particular location (rather than to just determine where a mobile station is currently located). An example of such a scenario is where an application server will send an e-coupon to a mobile station when the mobile station is located in front of a particular store.","In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a carrier or other entity will determine the mobile station's current location and will compare the location to a designated location. Based on the comparison between the current location and the designated location, the carrier or other entity will compute a next time to determine the mobile station's current location. This process will repeat until the mobile station is located at the designated location, or close enough to the designated location.","For instance, given an indication of the mobile station's current location and the designated location, the carrier can query MapPoint\u00ae or another geoserver (using a standard application programming interface (API), such as Open Location Services (OpenLS), for instance) to determine how long it might take for the mobile station to travel from the current location to the designated location. The travel time could be a drive time or a walk time, for instance, which the geoserver could determine by reference to traffic, route and mapping databases, possibly taking into consideration a current velocity of the mobile station, if known. In the exemplary embodiment, the most conservative value would be a fast drive time from the current location to the designated location.","In turn, the carrier may compute a predetermined percentage, such as 75%, of the travel time and can then plan to determine the mobile station's location again once that predetermined percentage of the travel time expires. This way, the carrier will poll the mobile station's location more often as the mobile station gets closer to the designated location. Further, the carrier could programmatically stop polling the mobile station's location once a determination is made that the remaining travel time is less than a predetermined floor.","Wireless Network Architecture","Referring now to the figures,  is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a wireless communication network . It should be understood that this and other arrangements described herein are set forth for purposes of example only, and other arrangements and elements can be used instead and some elements may be omitted altogether. Further, many of the elements described herein are functional entities that may be implemented as hardware, firmware or software, and as discrete components or in conjunction with other components, in any suitable combination and location.","The network  includes a base transceiver station (BTS)  that provides a wireless coverage area within which the BTS  may communicate with one or more mobile stations, such as mobile station , over an air interface. Mobile station  may be a wireless telephone, a wirelessly-equipped personal digital assistant (PDA), or other wireless communication device. The communications between the BTS  and the mobile station  may occur in a digital format, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), global standard for mobile communications (GSM), or 802.11x, or they may occur in an analog format, such as advanced mobile phone system (AMPS). One exemplary wireless communications format is \u201cCDMA 2000,\u201d such as described in EIA\/TIA\/IS-2000 Series, Rev. A (published March 2000), which is fully incorporated herein by reference.","The BTS  is controlled by a base station controller (BSC) , which, in turn, communicates with a mobile switching center (MSC) . The BSC  may be responsible for controlling power levels and frequency allocation for the air interface between the BTS  and the mobile station .","The MSC  is connected to a signaling network , which may be associated with a circuit switched network, such as a public switched telephone network (PSTN) (not shown), and the MSC  can then use an out-of-band signaling system, such as Signaling System 7 (SS7) in the signaling network  to route calls through the circuit switched network. The signaling network  may also be a packet switched network or it could take other forms.","The MSC  is able to signal through the signaling network  to a home location register (HLR) , which defines services and features authorized for use by particular mobile subscribers, and to an SCP . The signaling between the MSC  and the HLR  may conform to ANSI-41 specification, published by the Telecommunication Industry Association, which is fully incorporated herein by reference. The signaling between the MSC  and the SCP  may conform to the specification \u201cWireless Intelligent Network,\u201d TIA\/EIA\/IS-771, published in July 1999, which is fully incorporated herein by reference. However, other signaling protocols could be used.","The MSC , BSC  and BTS  may connect calls that originate from calling parties using landline telephones, mobile stations, or other communication devices, to the mobile station . Similarly, the MSC , BSC , and BTS  may connect calls originating from the mobile station  to their destinations.","The MSC  is programmed with a set of service logic that causes the MSC  to query the SCP  at predefined \u201ctrigger points\u201d during call processing (as described in IS-771), providing the SCP  with parameters such as an identification of the calling and called parties, for example. When the SCP  receives the query message, the SCP  may execute an appropriate set of service logic or consult appropriate databases to obtain information and instructions needed to provide a special service to the call. In turn, the SCP  may return a response message to the MSC , instructing the MSC  how to handle the call.","The wireless communication network  also includes a content serving element, such as a content server . The content server  may be any content serving element that stores content associated with a designated location and provides the content to the mobile station  when the mobile station  is located within a range of the designated location. The content may be any type of data, such as for instance, advertisements, solicitations, or e-coupons. For example, the content may be an advertisement that is associated with the location of a particular store. Once, the mobile station is within a range of the store, such as within a ten-minute travel time, or within a few miles of the store, the content server  may provide the advertisement to the mobile station . Although the content server  is illustrated as a separate entity, the content server  may reside within any network element, such as the SCP , for example.","The content server  couples to a gateway, such as a parlay gateway . The parlay gateway  provides a standard API that may translate messages sent from the content server  into a protocol understood by the mobile station . For example, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) may be used as a protocol between the content server  and the parlay gateway . However, other protocols may be used. The API may be an IpUI interface, as defined in the \u201cApplication Programming Interface (API) Part 5: User Interaction Service Control Feature (UISCF),\u201d published by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI) Parlay Group, V0.0.4 2003, which is fully incorporated herein by reference. The API provides functions to send information to, or gather information from the mobile station . For example, the IpUI interface allows the content server  to send short message service (SMS) messages, as defined by industry standard IS-637A (promulgated by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)\/Electronics Industry Association (EIA)).","The content server  therefore may send an SMS message to the mobile station  through the parlay gateway , which forwards the message to a bulk message gateway (BMG) . In turn, the BMG  sends the message to a short message service center (SMSC) . By querying the HLR , the SMSC  will then determine which MSC is currently serving the mobile station  and then forward the SMS message through the signaling network  to that MSC, e.g., MSC . The MSC  will then send the SMS message via the BSC  and the BTS  to the mobile station . The mobile station  will then alert a user of the new message and may display the message as text to the user.","The content server  may also send messages to the mobile station  using other signaling mechanisms as well, such as the well-known wireless application protocol (WAP) push signaling mechanism. Other examples are possible as well.","The signaling network  may also carry communications related to determining and reporting locations of mobile stations, such as mobile station . In this regard, the wireless communication network  may include a location determination system. The location determination system may include a location platform server , or any location determining element, communicatively coupled to the signaling network . The location determining element may be any element that resides within network . Also, in one instance, the location determining element may be the mobile station . The location determining element may manage the process of obtaining and reporting mobile station location information. The location determining element may include a processor and data storage including stored instructions that may be executed by the processor to determine a location of the mobile station, and in turn to determine when the mobile station is within a range of a designated location, for example (described more fully below).","In one instance, the location platform server  may direct the MSC  to signal the mobile station  according to the specification \u201cPosition Determination Service Standard for Dual Mode Spread Spectrum Systems,\u201d TIA\/EIA\/IS-801, published in October 1999 and fully incorporated herein by reference. This specification defines a set of signaling messages between the mobile station and the BTS\/BSC\/MSC to provide a position determination service in order to determine the location of the mobile station (described more fully below).","The signaling network  also couples to an MPC , which is communicatively coupled to the location platform server  through an IP connection, such as through an IP network . The MPC  also couples to a position determining entity (PDE) . The MPC  may be a database application operable to store and\/or report locations of mobile stations. The MPC  may obtain and store \u201clocation tags\u201d received from the PDE . A location tag may be a digital bit string that contains location information corresponding to the location of a mobile station. The location information may correspond to longitude and latitude coordinates (geocode), cell and sector information, and\/or any other data representation of the location of the mobile subscriber terminal.","Multiple PDEs may serve an MPC. Therefore, the MPC  selects a PDE, such as PDE , to determine the position of a mobile station. The PDE  may reside within many entities, which couple to the MPC . Thus, PDE  may communicate with mobile stations, such as the mobile station , to determine the locations of the mobile stations and to convey this information to the MPC  and to the MSC  through the signaling network . The mobile station itself may also function as a PDE and communicate with MPC  to convey its location.","To determine the location of a mobile station, the PDE  may receive position information from the mobile station. (If the mobile station  is functioning as the PDE , then the PDE  will know the position information.) The mobile station may use a terrestrial positioning system, a celestial positioning system, or a combination of these systems to determine its position. Terrestrial positioning systems utilize various techniques, such as forward link trilaterization (FLT), advanced forward link trilaterization (AFLT), amplitude difference, angle of arrival (AD-AOA), and enhanced observed time difference (EOTD). Global Positioning System (GPS) is an example of a celestial positioning system. The PDE  may then process the position information, which may include analyzing pseudo ranges obtained from the mobile station. The PDE  may then transmit a location tag containing the location information corresponding to the location of the mobile station to the MPC . The PDE  may determine the location of the mobile station when the mobile station is engaged in a call, in data mode, and\/or in idle mode.","In one embodiment, the PDE  determines the mobile station's location by acquiring a GPS reading of the mobile station's current location, which can include an indication of altitude, latitude, and longitude. In this regard, the mobile station  may include a GPS receiver, and may autonomously determine its location. The mobile station  may simply send to the PDE  or other network element its calculated location, e.g., its latitude, longitude and possibly altitude coordinates. The mobile station  may relay this information to the PDE  either upon initiation of a call, termination of a call, or periodically to update the PDE's knowledge of the location of the mobile station . In addition, the mobile station  may relay this information to the PDE  in response to a specific request for this information. For example, as explained above, the MPC  may signal the mobile station  requesting the mobile station's location and the mobile station  may respond by sending a position determination response message to the MSC , which relays this information to the PDE .","In another embodiment, \u201cwireless assisted GPS\u201d is used to determine the location of the mobile station . In the wireless assisted GPS approach, the mobile station  includes a GPS receiver but does not determine its location on its own. Instead, the MPC  or PDE , determines the location of mobile station , in terms of latitude, longitude and altitude, based at least in part on information provided by the mobile station . For example, the mobile station  may first send its approximate location, such as the cell\/sector of a BTS it is operating in, to the PDE . Using this approximate location, the PDE  determines what GPS satellites are in view of the cell\/sector and their Doppler offsets and then sends this information to the mobile station  as \u201cassistance data.\u201d The mobile station  then uses this assistance data to acquire GPS signals from the GPS satellites and, thereby, obtains information, such as pseudo ranges, from which its location may be calculated. The mobile station  then sends the pseudo ranges and\/or other location-related information to the PDE . The PDE  then calculates the location of the mobile station , such as in terms of latitude, longitude and altitude, based on the information from the mobile station  and, optionally, various corrections.","In still another example, the mobile station  may autonomously determine its location in response to a request to determine its location from an application that resides within the mobile station , by either using a GPS receiver or by sending a position determination request message into the network and receiving a position information response from the network.","However, other techniques for determining the location of the mobile station  may be used. For example, location technologies that do not rely on GPS may be used to determine the location of the mobile station , such as by performing a time\/frequency analysis on incoming signals received at the BTS .","Signaling between the MPC  and PDE , and between the MPC  and the MSC  to determine mobile station location information, may conform to the TIA\/EIA\/J-STD-036 (Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronics Industry Alliance), entitled \u201cEnhanced Wireless 911, Phase 2,\u201d published in August 2000, and revised in March 2002, and which is fully incorporated herein by reference.","As one example outlined in J-STD-036, the Location Services Protocol (LSP) may be used for signaling between the MPC  and PDE  and is applicable to AMPS, TDMA and CDMA air interfaces. A GeoPositionRequest (GPOSREQ) message may be sent by the MPC  to the PDE  to request the PDE  for an initial, updated or last known position of a mobile station. Position information may then be sent from the PDE  to the MPC  using a GeoPositionDirective (GPOSDIR) message. Further, a Short Message Delivery Point To Point (SMDPP) message can be used to transfer position information between the MPC  and the MSC .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","36","38","36","38","14"]},"The PDE  then initiates an SMDPP message to the MSC  to request the mobile station's position. The SMDPP may contain parameters such as a ServiceIndicator (to indicate the type of service requested such as a position determination service), an ActionCode (to specify the nature of the action to be performed by the PDE), an SMS_BearerData (e.g., including information pertaining to the mobile station), and others. The PDE  encapsulates in the SMS_BearerData parameter an action according to the value of the MPCAP parameter and the procedures defined in IS-801. The ServiceIndicator parameter may identify this as handset assisted position information. The MSC  will receive the SMDPP message and send a databurst message according to TIA\/EIA\/IS-801 to the mobile station  containing the bearer data from the SMDPP message including the positioning related information. The mobile station returns a response containing the positioning related information (e.g., IS-801 information) in a databurst message to the MSC . The MSC  sends the mobile station-provided positioning related information in an SMDPP response message to the PDE . The PDE  uses the received information to determine the mobile station's position and sends a response to the MPC  (e.g., a GPOSDIR response message).","Controlling Polling Interval",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["40","42","44"]},"In the exemplary embodiment, the location platform server  may use the method as depicted in  to determine when a mobile station is located within a range of a designated location, and then responsively direct the content server  to send content that is associated with the designated location to the mobile station when the mobile station is located within the range. For example, the location platform server  may determine when a mobile station is within an approximate travel time to a specific location, such as a store, and then when the mobile station is within that travel time, the location platform server  will then inform the content server  (e.g., possibly through a packet-switched network using any number of Internet Protocols such as Remote Method Invocation (RMI), CORBA, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)). The content server  will then send content associated with the specific location to the mobile station. For example, the content server  could send an advertisement for a specific store to the mobile station once the mobile station is within five minutes, or any predefined range of travel time, from the store. The designated or specific location that the location platform server  monitors, in relation to the location of the mobile station, can be any desired location. Exemplary locations may be locations associated with specific stores or restaurants.","However, in an alternate embodiment, the mobile station  (rather than or in addition to a network platform server) may use the method as depicted in  to determine when the mobile station  is located within a range of a designated location, such as a user-defined location. The mobile station  may send a position determination request (such as an IS-801 message) into the network  and receive an indication of the current location of the mobile station  from the network . As one example, the mobile station  may determine when the mobile station  is within five minutes of a store using the method of , and at that time responsively activate on the mobile station  a web browser with a web page of the store. Other examples are possible as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["10","50","14","34","100","50","10","50","26","14","34","50","14","50","14","34","50","26","50","20","34"]},"By requesting or subscribing to the location of the mobile station , the application  asks the location platform server  to inform the application  when the mobile station  is at or near a designated location. The application  may ask the location platform server  to inform the application  when the mobile station  is at a specific designated location and\/or a distance within a designated location. The location platform server  will then continue to determine the location of the mobile station  until the mobile station  is at or near the designated location. The location platform server  can then respond to the application  once the mobile station  is at or near the designated location.","In one embodiment, the application  may request the location of the mobile station  from the location platform server  through a Parlay gateway (not shown in ). The Parlay gateway may translate the application's request for the location of the mobile station  into a protocol understood by the location platform server . Additionally, the Parlay gateway may translate the location information obtained from the location platform server  into a protocol understood by the application . For example, CORBA may be used as a protocol between the application  and the Parlay gateway. Additionally, Location Interoperability Forum (LIF) Mobile Location Protocol (MLP) 3.0.0 may be used as a protocol between the Parlay gateway and the location platform server . However, other protocols may be used.","The location platform server  will request the location of the mobile station  by contacting the MPC , as shown by message . In turn, the MPC  will contact the PDE , as shown by message , and the PDE  then requests the location of the mobile station  from the mobile station , as shown by message .","The mobile station  will respond by sending location information to the PDE , as shown by message , and the PDE  will forward this information to the MPC , as shown by message . The MPC  then forwards this information to the location platform server , as shown by message . The location platform server  will then calculate a next time to poll the MPC  to determine an updated location of the mobile station , and at the next time, the location platform server  signals the MPC , as shown by message . The location platform server  calculates the next time in part by considering a comparison between the current location of the mobile station  and the designated location.","Once the location platform server  determines that the mobile station  is at (or close enough to) the designated location, the location platform server  will stop polling the MPC , and then notify the application , as shown by message . The location platform server  can notify the application  once the mobile station  is at or near the designated location using a callback function. For example, the location platform server  could perform a callback to the application  using any protocol such as RMI, CORBA, HTTP or SIP. As one specific example, the location platform server  may send a callback message to the application  when the mobile station  is at or near the designated location, i.e., when the event is triggered. This may be accomplished using the gateway  that resides between the application  (assuming in this example that the application  resides in the content server ) and the location platform server .","Once the application  is notified that the mobile station  is at or near the designated location, the application may then cause the content server  to send content that is associated with the designated location via the SMSC  through the signaling network  to the mobile station , for example.","Making a Comparison of the Current Location to the Designated Location","After receiving the current location of the mobile station , the location determining element, e.g., location platform server , then compares the current location to the location designated by the application . The location platform server  will make a comparison in part by estimating a time interval for the mobile station  to travel from the current location to the designated location. In one example, the location platform server  will request the estimated time interval from a geoserver, and the geoserver will respond by sending the estimated time interval to the location platform server . The location platform server  may query the geoserver using a standard API for instance, to determine how long it might take the mobile station  to travel from the current location to the designated location. The location platform  will send the current location and the designated location to the geoserver, which may then calculate an estimated time for the mobile station  to travel to the designated location. The travel time could be a drive time or a walk time, for instance, which the geoserver could determine by reference to traffic, route and mapping databases, possibly taking into consideration a current velocity of the mobile station, if known.","The geoserver server may be MapPoint\u00ae or another server residing within the signaling network . The geoserver may include any number of mapping databases for determining a travel route between two locations. The geoserver may then determine a travel time for the route using known speed limits of roads within the travel route, for example. To determine a conservative travel time, such that the mobile station will not pass the designated location before the next polling, a fast drive time could be used to compute the travel time, such as 65 miles per hour (or any desired driving speed).","The location platform server  will receive the estimated travel time from the geoserver and will then determine if the mobile station is located within a range of the designed location, which is close enough such that the location platform server  notifies the application . For example, if the estimated travel time is short, such as ten minutes or less, the location platform server  may then inform the application  that the mobile station  is approximately located, or will soon be located, at the designated location. If the estimated travel time is more than ten minutes, a predetermined floor threshold amount of time, then the location platform server  will compute a next time to determine an updated location of the mobile station.","The location platform server  may also make a comparison in part by estimating a distance between the mobile station's current location and the designated location. In one example, the location platform server  will determine the current location of the mobile station and calculate the distance between the current location and the designated location. The location platform server  could do so by computing the Euclidian distance between location coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude) of the current location and location coordinates of the designated location. The location platform server  may also query a geoserver to determine the distance between the current location and the designated location. In this manner, the location platform  will send the current location and the designated location to the geoserver, which may then calculate an estimated distance between the two locations.","The location platform server  will receive the estimated travel distance from the geoserver (or calculate the travel distance itself) and then determine if the mobile station is located within a range of the designed location, which is close enough such that the location platform server  notifies the application . For example, if the estimated travel distance is short, such as five miles or less, the location platform server  may then inform the application  that the mobile station  is approximately located, or will soon be located, at the designated location. If the estimated travel distance is more than five miles, a predetermined floor threshold distance, then the location platform server  could compute a next time to determine an updated location of the mobile station.","Computing a Next Time to Determine an Updated Location of the Mobile Station","In the exemplary embodiment, the location platform server  will compute the next time to determine the updated location of the mobile station, as shown by message  in , by calculating a percentage of the estimated travel time. For example, if the estimated travel time is thirty minutes, the location platform server  may calculate the next time to poll by taking 75% of the estimated travel time, i.e., twenty-two and a half minutes. The location platform server  then queries the MPC  to determine an updated location of the mobile station  once the next time expires. In this example, the location platform server  would query the MPC  to determine an updated location of the mobile station  after twenty-two and a half minutes. The percentage of the travel time used to calculate the next polling time may be any desired amount. However, if the estimated travel time for the mobile station  to travel from its current location to the designated location is one hour, for example, there is no need to poll the mobile station  again in ten minutes to determine if the mobile station  is at or near the designated location. It would be more efficient to poll again after thirty to forty minutes, for example. Therefore, in practice it may be more efficient to calculate the next polling time using at least 50% of the estimated travel time.","Using a predetermined percentage, such as 75%, of the travel time to compute the next time to poll provides for polling the mobile station's location more often as the mobile station  gets closer to the designated location. In the example above, for instance, after waiting twenty-two and a half minutes, the location platform server  will query to determine the updated location of the mobile station. Suppose after this query, now that the estimated travel time is ten minutes. Then the location platform server  will calculate the next time to determine an updated location of the mobile station by taking 75% of ten minutes, or seven and a half minutes. Therefore, the location platform server  will now query to determine an updated location of the mobile station in approximately seven and a half minutes. The location platform server  will continue polling the mobile station until the estimated travel time is less than a predetermined amount, such as five minutes for example.","In an alternate embodiment, the location platform server  will compute the next time to determine the updated location of the mobile station by calculating a percentage of an estimated travel time that it would take for the mobile station  to travel the distance between its current location and the designated location. For example, if the estimated travel distance is twenty miles, the location platform server  may calculate the next time to poll by taking 75% of an estimated travel time to travel twenty miles, which using a half hour to travel twenty miles would be twenty-two and a half minutes. The location platform server  could have predefined travel times corresponding to predefined travel distances. The location platform server  could then use the estimated travel distance to select a predefined travel time to calculate the next time to poll. In this manner, the location platform server  may not need to query a geoserver, since the location platform server  may be able to calculate the estimated travel distance and then could use a predefined travel time corresponding to this distance to calculate the next time to poll. The location platform server  then queries the MPC  to determine an updated location of the mobile station  once the next time expires. In this example, the location platform server  would query the MPC  to determine an updated location of the mobile station  after twenty-two and a half minutes. As above, the percentage of the travel time used to calculate the next polling time may be any desired amount.","In another embodiment, if the estimated travel time or estimated travel distance is more or less than a threshold amount, then the location platform server  may poll the MPC  again at a predetermined time interval. For example, if the estimated travel time is two hours or more, the location platform server  may simply poll again to determine the updated location of the mobile station  in one hour. Further, the location platform server  could programmatically stop polling the mobile station's location once a determination is made that the remaining travel time is less than a predetermined floor. For example, once the estimated travel time is determined to be five minutes or less, the location platform server  will then notify the application , as shown by message  in .","As another example, instead of using a percentage of the travel time, the location platform server  could have preset throttling intervals to apply depending on the estimated travel time or estimated travel distance. For instance, if the travel time is over a first threshold, the location platform server  may programmatically apply an interval of A minutes, if the travel time is between a second threshold and the first threshold, the location platform server  may apply an interval of B minutes, and if the travel time is lower than the second threshold, the location platform server  may apply an interval of C minutes. (Values A, B and C could be single values, or they could be acceptable ranges.) Other examples are possible as well.","When computing the next time to poll, the location platform server  may compute a time period and plan to determine the updated location of the mobile station once the time period expires, or the location platform server  may compute a time of day and plan to determine the updated location of the mobile station at the time of day. For example, the location platform server  may compute the polling interval to be ten minutes. The location platform server  could then compute the time of day to poll again, which would be ten minutes from the current time.","While exemplary embodiments have been described, persons of skill in the art will appreciate that variations may be made without departure from the scope and spirit of the invention. This true scope and spirit is defined by the appended claims, which may be interpreted in light of the foregoing."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES","p":["Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the following drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
