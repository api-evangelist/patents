title: Infrastructure for adaptive environmental control for equipment in a bounded area
abstract: Integrating information and performance controls for individual devices with environmental controls. Integrating the individual devices with general environmental control enables adaptive environmental control. For equipment housed in a bounded space such as a server room, information about the thermal environment within the bounded space can affect the performance of the equipment. Additionally, information about the performance conditions and/or thermal conditions about a piece of equipment can affect how the environmental control system for the bounded space operates. The equipment exchanges environmental event messages with a control node to affect the performance of the equipment and/or the environmental control system.

The copyright owner has no objection to the reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The copyright notice applies to all data as described below, and in the accompanying drawings hereto, as well as to any software described below: Copyright\u00a9 2008, Red Hat, Inc., All Rights Reserved.","Racks of equipment are commonly used in data routing (e.g., racks of routers, banks of modems), data storage (e.g., banks of storage devices), and data access (e.g., racks of servers). Typically, such racks of equipment or racks of devices are housed in a confined or bounded area or physical space. In confined areas (e.g., server rooms, data centers), the operation of the equipment can generate a significant amount of heat that could negatively affect the performance of the equipment. Thus, server rooms or their equivalent generally include cooling systems or environmental control systems. On top of the economic cost associated with running the equipment, the owner\/operator of the equipment must also be concerned with the economic costs of running the environmental control systems.","Additionally, some server rooms house many (dozens or hundreds) of devices, which may make controlling the environment of the bounded space inefficient, given that the entire room may be controlled based on the operation of a particularly active hardware device or devices. Even in rooms that are separated into zones of environmental control, the reactive nature of the environmental control systems may not effectively increase or reduce cooling to the equipment based on actual performance of the individual devices. Thus, the environmental control systems may be inefficient, resulting in increased costs associated with running the environmental control systems.","An infrastructure enables the use of internal environmental information and performance controls of equipment in coordination with an environmental control system of a bounded area in which the equipment is housed. Thus, for example, data center environmental systems can be integrated with the operating system of individual devices. The infrastructure includes a master node in communication with the hardware devices. The hardware devices are slave nodes, and the master node and the slave nodes together make up an environmental event network, where environmental information is exchanged between the master and the slaves. The exchange of environmental information includes either information about internal performance of the slave node devices and\/or the control of the operation of the slave node devices to adaptively control the environment of the bounded area.","The infrastructure provides a \u201cgreen engineering\u201d initiative that increases the efficiency of the environmental control of the devices of the bounded area, which saves energy and decreases the cost of operation. In one embodiment, the infrastructure includes an operating system level API (application programming interface), which allows individual hardware devices (e.g., servers) to communicate internal environmentals (e.g., operating conditions such as internal temperature, or load that may increase or decrease the internal temperature) to the environmental control system of the bounded area. Additionally, such an API could allow the environmental control system to communicate with the individual hardware devices to cause the devices to alter performance in response to an event external to the device (e.g., increased heat in the bounded area, break-down in the environmental controls, business event, etc.). The infrastructure enables, for example, merging server room environmental controls and servers themselves to function as one dynamic and cohesive system.","Current systems have sensors placed around a server room (or other bounded space), which are connected to a control unit that cannot be integrated with the individual devices in the server room. The devices themselves typically have, e.g., scripts or other logic to handle events such as overheating, but do not dynamically respond to changing conditions of the server room. Instead, the devices can only react to significant local events. In contrast, finer-grain control of the server room can be provided with the infrastructure described herein. The individual hardware devices can provide input consideration of how the cooling system of the server room is to operate.","The adaptive environmental control infrastructure provides bi-directional communication functionality to allow devices to coordinate with the environmental control system of a bounded space. Consider a server room housing multiple servers. With the adaptive environmental control infrastructure, the servers communicate with the environmental control system to identify events or conditions that might cause the system to increase or decrease cooling to a particular zone or group of devices. Additionally, the server room (environmental control system) can communicate with the servers to notify the servers of server room related environmental events such as overheating, power failure, the beginning or end of the business day, start and end of peak computing period, etc., where more power or less power would be required.","In one embodiment, the infrastructure includes an API at the hardware devices of the bounded space. The API may include a daemon process (such as a kernel-level module, or a userspace application) running on each device in the bounded space. Such a daemon process may read temperatures, CPU (central processing unit) frequencies, power consumption levels, and other internal environmentals that might be of interest to the environmental control system. It will be understood that such reading may be made on most equipment without the addition of additional sensors, or without any hardware modification at all. The internal information is relayed back to a controller of the environment control system for the bounded space. The controller can then direct more or less cooling to each hardware device as needed. Further, such a daemon process can respond to events broadcasted by the the environmental control system controller, and cause each hardware device to adapt dynamically to the broadcast. For example, the hardware devices may respond to such broadcasted events by changing internal power consumption levels, or changing internal thermal (heat) output. Such granular control is possible with the daemon process communicating directly with a kernel of the operating system.","As examples, consider the following events, and responses to these events: 1) A server room cooling system cannot keep up with the heat output from the servers, and broadcasts a message that the server room is overheating\u2014the daemon process (API) on each server could respond by enforcing thermal threshold to reduce thermal output; 2) A data center experiences a power failure (e.g., failover to UPS (uninterruptible power supply) or generator) or power shortage, and broadcasts a message indicating the power interruption\/failure\u2014the daemon process (API) on each server could respond by cutting power consumption to an absolute minimum; 3) The beginning of the business day begins (start of peak computing hours), and a control system sends a message to hardware devices\u2014the daemon process (API) on each hardware device could respond by optimizing the dynamics of each hardware device for a zero-latency mode to put the device in full power mode (no power savings), which readies the devices for maximum throughput with no energy savings being employed; and, 4) The end of the business day is reached (end of peak computing hours), and a control system sends a message to hardware devices\u2014the daemon process (API) could respond by putting the hardware devices in a power savings mode, reducing power consumption to a minimum without concern for latency issues that may result.","The master node could be considered part of the control system, or could be incorporated into the control system. In one embodiment, the master node is a server dedicated to managing the environmental event information. In a room full of servers, the master node may be one of the servers. In a room of equipment other than servers, one of the pieces of equipment may be configured to act as a master node, or a server may be included in the room. The master node includes software that reads the environmental conditions from the server room itself, such as from sensors or control devices that are part of the environmental control system, and each of the functional hardware devices that serves and\/or routes data (as opposed to devices that are auxiliary, such as the environmental control devices). Additionally, the master node could read environmental conditions from a power system of the bounded space, and various pieces of scheduling software such as batch managers. The batch manager software could make decisions based on internal logic that enforces a defined level of symmetry between the needs of the functional hardware devices, the cooling system, the power systems, and the scheduling software and batch managers. The batch manager software would attempt to achieve maximum power savings by balancing bounded space and hardware device internal conditions based on business and\/or computing priorities. As part of a configuration of the batch software itself, or as part of the information passed to the master node, the batch software can be made aware of the limits of the cooling capacities and status, the power system capacities and status, device-internal thermal limitations and status, and the device-internal minimum and maximum power usage (per device) and status.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","112","114","122","124"]},"In one embodiment, the servers are separated into zones  and . It will be understood that system  does not need to be separated into zones. Separation of the area into zones can make directed cooling easier. As shown, zone  includes servers  and , which has associated sensor . Sensor  may be, for example, a temperature sensor commonly used in environmental control systems. Traditionally, the environmental control system would use sensor  to determine a thermal condition or thermal environment of zone , and may direct more or less cooling to the zone based on sensor readings.","The environmental control system traditionally includes environmental controller , control nodes  and , and sensors  and . Sensors  and  are connected to environmental controller  (with either individual connections, or via a common bus), which performs computations to determine how to cool system . Control nodes  and  represent air flow registers or vent, fans, cooling systems, etc., which combine to direct cooled air at system , or a part of the system (e.g., a specific zone). It will be understood that more zones could be used. In one embodiment, one rack of equipment corresponds to one zone.","In one embodiment, the cooling system of system  can be a separated section of zones like an HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system, where each equipment stack has a connection. While there is no restriction on the type of cooling or ventilation used, cooling frequently is directed up through the floor, or down from the ceiling across a rack. Vents may be spaced within every 3 m\u00d73 m space, for example. The cooling system can direct more or less airflow to certain zones or vents based on how much cooling is needed.","In addition to traditional components, master node  is coupled to environmental controller  to integrate not only information from the sensors, but information from the servers into decisions about environmental control. In one embodiment, master node  and environmental controller  are combined as a single unit, but such an architecture is not necessary. For purposes of discussion, master node  and environmental controller  are discussed herein as separate, and reference may be made to the master node sending a message to the environmental control system. It will be understood that to the extent some or all of the functions of environmental controller  are integrated into master node  (or the functions of master node  are integrated into an extended environmental controller ), exchange of such messages may refer to the passing of information between modules, or between subroutines within the single device.","Master node  is also part of environmental event network . The servers are also part of the environmental event network. The servers act as slave nodes in the network, and report conditions that could affect the thermal environment of the server, such as CPU frequency, data throughput, temperature, load (e.g., traffic or number of requests), or other conditions that may cause a server to perform more processing and run hotter, or perform less processing and run cooler. Master node  watches or monitors what is happening in network . Master node  receives and monitors events in the network. An event refers to any condition that represents a change of current operating conditions. In one embodiment, an event is anything that diverges from the dynamic cooling expectations. Thus, a response to a heavy traffic load could be an event, as well as power surges or lapses, reaching of thermal thresholds, etc. As mentioned above, master node  is connected to environmental controller , and can send a message or other affect how the environmental control system operates. Network  can thus operate as an event messaging system with integrated environmental control.","Thus, rather than waiting for indications from the sensors in the zones, the system can be responsive to the cues from each individual server about its performance, and especially its thermal or environmental state. Thus, server internals or information on a server's local thermal environment can be the principal information used to direct the cooling, with the sensors in the system primarily serving as backup or as a failsafe. Thus, the system is much more efficient in its use of cooling and environmental control, because it is performing on a micro-level of environmental control rather than a macro-level of control.","In one embodiment, other systems  could provide information to master node . Such \u201cother systems\u201d may actually be scripts, schedulers, or batch jobs executing on master node , which are part of business systems that indicate schedules for particular operations to occur. Thus, with master node , the system can for example hook into the scheduler and address power and latency concerns. Similar functions are possible through tying into batch systems.","Based on information received from the servers and\/or from another system , master node  may send one or more messages, such as a control message or instruction to the environmental control system (e.g., to environmental controller ) to cause the system to adapt environmental control of system . Such adaptation may include directing more or less cooling through control nodes  and\/or .","In one embodiment, each server may be able to detect certain internal conditions related to thermal environment and\/or performance (e.g., temperature and\/or load, CPU frequency, data throughput, power usage), but has little or no \u201cintelligence\u201d for decision-making based on the conditions. Each server may have scripts that direct slowing down CPU frequency or performing other actions if an internal thermal threshold is reached, but may be very limited in this respect. Instead, master node  includes intelligence to identify conditions and direct actions to servers and\/or the environmental control system. The intelligence may be or include a heuristic algorithm, which would be implementation specific related to the amount of equipment, the type of equipment, the size of the room, the architecture and capability of the environmental controls, and current status of each of these. Lookup tables may be provided for certain conditions (e.g., especially common scenarios), but are again dependent on the implementation.","Consider that the CPU (not shown) on server  is running hot. Server  recognizes the CPU is running too hot as it approaches its thermal limits (which is set by configuration for the particular device). As it approaches the thermal limit, server  could cause an automatic process to occur, and would not need to wait for the thermal limit to be reached before performing an action in response to the overheating. For example, the server could broadcast or send a message to master node  to indicate that its proximity to the thermal limit, and allow the master node to perform an action in response to the indication. In one embodiment, in response to the message from server , master node  can send more cooling to control node  for the zone or group of servers to which server  belongs.","The message may be sent via daemon . Each server, , , ,  has an associated daemon , , , , respectively. Each daemon can respond to the internal conditions by creating an event and event message to send to master node . The daemon can then monitor for messages sent from master node , such as a message indicating to cut back CPU frequency, place the system in a sleep mode, or take another defined action.","While certain descriptions are made with more particular reference to system , a general description applicable to any one or more embodiments described herein follows. The infrastructure allows a master node and slave nodes to exchange messages to affect an operation of either the slave and\/or the master, based on environmental conditions or events. The master node communicates with peripherals of the bounded space, and conducts the environmental control operation within the bounded space.","A communication interface enables slave devices and a master node to participate in an environmental event information network. The interface integrates environmental controls and conditions and event information. When operated as an event driven system, the environmental event information network can be activated by environmental condition detection, scheduled events, batch events, and\/or business events. Each slave device changes its operation based on an event indicated by the master node, or transmits an event to the master node based on internal conditions that generate an event within the network. The master node can then make a decision based on the event to direct environmental control of the bounded space.","In one embodiment, the infrastructure described herein can be used in conjunction with what is frequently referred to as \u201cdynamic cooling\u201d technology that is targeted to server room environmental control systems. The dynamic cooling technology is generally described as a system that separates a server room into different zones, and controls the environment of each zone based on sensor detection within the zone. However, such dynamic cooling alone has drawbacks. For example, by the time the zone sensor can detect and respond to the changes in the environment, a particular device may be running too hot. Dynamic cooling can be extended by the infrastructure described herein with the interface that allows each device to report back internal temperatures to the server room environmental controls. Thus, the server room control can direct more cooling or less cooling to individual servers or groups of servers as required. Such a unidirectional communication from a server to a server room controller can further be extended by providing the bi-directional communication possible with the infrastructure described herein to allow the server room controller to communicate with the servers and notify them of environmental events in the server room.","With the environmental event network and environmental control system infrastructure, environmental control of a bounded space can be adaptive to the temperature constraints within each individual hardware device. The overall environmental control system becomes much more efficient by responding to hardware device performance rather than external environment sensor readings. In one embodiment, the sensor system can be retained, but would primarily act as a backup or failsafe, rather than providing the primary conditions for environmental control consideration. Contrasted with prior systems, power failure, system overheating, or other events could be reported back to the environmental control system. The hardware devices themselves may be configured to cut back on throughput, reduce heat output, etc., in response to a particular event, which alters the normal focus on reducing latency in responding to requests.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100"]},"Master node  coordinates the integration of individual device information and controls into the use of the environmental control system (ECS). Master node  includes operating system (OS)  that controls the operation of the master node. In one embodiment, master node  includes event module , which represents one or more components that receive and send messages related to environmental events, including processing modules to determine how to respond to the events. Event module  may include interfaces to the slave nodes to receive the local environmental information from each slave node and determine what actions to take in system  to address the conditions or events representing the local environmental information.","Master node  include EE API , which refers to an \u201cenvironmental event\u201d API, which could be the daemon discussed above, for example. EE API  is associated with event module , and represents a control system to receive and coordinate messages to affect the thermal environment of the bounded space of system . The control system could be implemented in kernel space, for example, as a kernel module. Alternatively, the control system components could be implemented as a driver module instead of built into the kernel. There could be API controls (an API module or API hooks) in a kernel module, and daemon reading processes in user space, or another combination. The control system issues commands or message to affect the CPU frequency and the temperature control of individual slave nodes (or affect them collectively with a broadcast message). One example implementation of the event module is to implement it in the \/sys filesystem, where values are commonly written. One implementation in Linux would allow the master node  to be a module running within OS  of a hardware device, where various software components may be implemented in userspace, and for example, could be POSIX compliant, etc., to enhance buildability of the system.","Master node  is illustrated with port , which represents hardware and\/or software components that enable master node  to communicate with slave node  (and other slave nodes). In one embodiment, all that is required for EE API  is an open socket for a daemon process. The open socket allows the daemon process on the slave node to either read information (and adjust internal parameters in accordance with what is read), or to write internal information back to master node . The kernel could then \u201clisten\u201d or monitor the communication interface for messages. In one embodiment, master node  is implemented in an embedded firmware controller, and could thus be built into hardware devices to create and operate an environmental event network.","Master node includes ECS interface , which represents one or more components that enable master node  to connect to environmental control system (ECS) . ECS  generically represents the hardware and software components that monitor and adjust the environment of system . The environment of system  may be referred to as an \u201cexternal\u201d environment from the perspective that it is external to any given slave node, which each may have a unique internal environment. The external environment of slave node  and other slave nodes may be monitored by sensors , as discussed above, which monitor the external environment and report to the ECS what the environmental conditions of system  are.","Slave node  includes similar components corresponding to components of master node . For example, in one embodiment, slave node  includes OS , event module , EE API , and port . Additional details illustrated include processor , temperature sensor , load monitor , and performance control . The addition of processor  in slave node  does not imply that master node  does not have a processor. Rather, the inclusion of processor  in slave node  highlights the fact that the environmental conditions such as temperature, and the performance or load conditions of processor  may be coordinated with the operation of ECS . Processor  may be any type of processor, including multi-core or multi-threaded processors.","Temperature sensor  may be distinguished from sensors  of ECS . Temperature sensor  is typically built into the processor or chipset of slave node , and indicates the internal environment associated with the processor or chipset. Such a sensor is typically included in the hardware of slave node \u2014thus, additionally hardware may not be necessary to monitor the internal environment of slave node .","Load monitor  refers to hardware and software mechanisms known in the art to detect the load on processor , whether the load is from computations, data access processing (e.g., reading or writing), packet forwarding or routing, etc. Performance control  represents any mechanism included within slave node  to adjust its performance. Such mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, processes to enter a sleep mode, processes to reduce or increase CPU frequency, processes to reduce or increase workload, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},"In a bounded space (e.g., system  of , system  of ), a master node (e.g., , ) is coupled to a slave node (e.g., , , , , ) in an environmental event network (e.g., ). The master node is also coupled to an environmental control system (e.g., ). The master node receives information from a sensor of the environmental control system, a scheduler or batch system, a slave node, or another event source, . The information indicates a condition related to or that affects the thermal environment of a slave node. From the information, the master node detects an environmental event, . The master node determines an action and\/or control to respond to the event, . The master node sends out an event or control message to one or more slave node(s) and\/or to an environmental control system, .","If a message is sent to a slave node, the slave node receives the message from the master node, , and determines a performance adjustment based on the received message, . The adjustment may be to reduce performance, or increase performance, depending on the message. Performance may be reduced if a message indicates a condition that has a negative effect on the thermal environment of the bounded space. If a message indicates a negative condition has ended, or if an increase in performance is needed, performance may be increased. The slave node adjusts its performance based on the message, .","If a message or control command is received at the environmental control system, the system receives the control from the master node, .

The slave node may detect an environmental condition in the read information, . It will be understood that as used here, a condition is an \u201cenvironmental condition\u201d if it affects the operating environment of the slave node. Most conditions having to do with the internal temperatures and the amount of processing to be performed by the slave node can be considered an \u201cenvironmental condition\u201d that affects the thermal environment of the slave node. Examples of such conditions could include a temperature reading, as well as determining that a high volume of requests for processing have been received.
