title: Blind phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) identification
abstract: Technology for blind phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) identification of a received radio frequency (RF) signal is disclosed. One method can include: uniform sub-sampling the received RF signal to eliminate a phase contribution from a carrier frequency of the received RF signal; and computing a likelihood function of observed phase differences of the sub-sampled received RF signal of a phase sequence for each PSK modulation type. Another method can include: non-uniformly sub-sampling the received RF signal for a distribution of signal amplitudes of the received RF signal; and computing a likelihood function of the signal amplitudes of the sub-samples of the received RF signal for each modulation type.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","DEFINITIONS","Examples of the Technology"],"p":["A radio frequency (RF) signal can be modulated using various modulation schemes, such as phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). PSK modulation can include binary PSK (BPSK, phase reversal keying (PRK), or 2PSK), quadrature PSK (QPSK, quaternary PSK, quadriphase PSK, or 4-PSK) and 8PSK (8-PSK), and QAM can include 16QAM, 32QAM, 64QAM, 128QAM, 256QAM, 512QAM, and 1024QAM or higher order.","The disclosed technology describes a method for identifying different QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) and PSK (Phase-shift Keying) signals without information about a carrier frequency, symbol rate, pulse shaping or any other information pertaining to the transmitter. An amplitude likelihood-based method may be used to classify between QAM and PSK modulations and to identify different QAMs. Subsequently, a phase likelihood-based method may be applied to identify different PSK modulations. The likelihood-based method can identify a modulation type by maximizing a likelihood function of the amplitudes or the phase difference between nearby samples of the received signal. The technology can compute likelihood functions of the received signals for each of the candidate modulation types and identify the modulation type as a candidate modulation type for which the likelihood function is maximum.","The technology can include amplitude and phase likelihood-based methods for automatically identifying different quadrature amplitude modulations (QAMs) and different phase-shift keying (PSK) modulations. In one example method, an amplitude likelihood-based method can be used to classify between QAM and PSK modulations and to identify different QAMs. A phase likelihood-based algorithm can then be applied to identify different PSK modulations. The method does not need prior knowledge of carrier frequency or symbol rate and can identify modulation types at relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using a small number of input samples. Pulse shaped signals can be identified using a small number of symbols. Further, the method works well at low signal-to-noise ratios.","There has thus been broadly outlined some features of the disclosure so that the detailed description that follows may be better understood, and so that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. Other features of the disclosure will become clearer from the following detailed description of the disclosure, taken with the accompanying drawings and claims, or may be learned by the practice of the disclosure.","The drawings merely depict exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, therefore, the drawings are not to be considered limiting of its scope. It will be readily appreciated that the components of the disclosure, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, could be arranged, sized, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Nonetheless, the disclosure will be described and explained with additional specificity and detail through the use of the accompanying drawings.","It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed, but is extended to equivalents as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. Alterations and further modifications of the illustrated features, and additional applications of the principles of the examples, which would occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the disclosure. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element.","It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca wave\u201d includes one or more of such elements, reference to \u201crows\u201d includes reference to one or more of such features, and reference to \u201cexposing\u201d includes one or more of such steps.","In describing and claiming the present disclosure, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set forth below.","As used herein, \u201csubstantial\u201d when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material, or a specific characteristic thereof, refers to an amount that is sufficient to provide an effect that the material or characteristic was intended to provide. Therefore, \u201csubstantially free\u201d when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material, or a specific characteristic thereof refers to the absence of the material or characteristic, or to the presence of the material or characteristic in an amount that is insufficient to impart a measurable effect, normally imparted by such material or characteristic.","As used herein, a plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, and\/or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus, no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary.","Numerical data may be expressed or presented herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such a range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and thus should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. As an illustration, a numerical range of \u201cabout 0.6 mm to about 0.3 mm\u201d should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited values of about 0.6 mm and about 0.3 mm, but also include individual values and sub-ranges within the indicated range. Thus, included in this numerical range are individual values such as 0.4 mm and 0.5, and sub-ranges such as from 0.5-0.4 mm, from 0.4-0.35, etc. This same principle applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value. Furthermore, such an interpretation should apply regardless of the breadth of the range or the characteristics being described.","As used herein, the term \u201cabout\u201d means that dimensions, sizes, formulations, parameters, shapes and other quantities and characteristics are not and need not be exact, but may be approximated and\/or larger or smaller, as desired, reflecting tolerances, conversion factors, rounding off, measurement error and the like and other factors known to those of skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise stated, the term \u201cabout\u201d shall expressly include \u201cexactly,\u201d consistent with the discussion above regarding ranges and numerical data.","In the present disclosure, the term \u201cpreferably\u201d or \u201cpreferred\u201d is non-exclusive where it is intended to mean \u201cpreferably, but not limited to.\u201d Any steps recited in any method or process claims may be executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented in the claims. Means-plus-function or step-plus-function limitations will only be employed where for a specific claim limitation all of the following conditions are present in that limitation: a) \u201cmeans for\u201d or \u201cstep for\u201d is expressly recited; and b) a corresponding function is expressly recited. The structure, material or acts that support the means-plus function are expressly recited in the description herein. Accordingly, the scope of the disclosure should be determined solely by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the descriptions and examples given herein.","A technology is described for blind modulation identification. Blind modulation identification may be modulation identification performed without a priori knowledge of a carrier frequency, symbol rate and other parameters of radio frequency (RF) signal transmission. Methods used for blind modulation identification may expect to receive an RF signal that is Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (QAM) or phase-shift keying (PSK) modulated, but does not assume any prior knowledge of a modulation order.","The technology can combine a QAM likelihood identification function with a PSK likelihood identification function to identify both QAMs and PSKs. As a result, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) searching range in an amplitude likelihood function for QAMs can be modified to achieve better performance as compared to similar methods. A non-uniform sub-sampling process can also be modified for the amplitude likelihood function. In phase likelihood functions, a constant phase contributed by a carrier frequency can be estimated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["S","k"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"gT","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["kT","b"]}}}}}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j2","\u03c0","fct"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}}},{"msub":{"mi":"N","mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["k ","k","k","k","k ","k ","b ","T ","c ","0 ","0 "],"sup":"2"},"Applying Hilbert transformation to the received RF signals, a sampled version of the RF signal is given by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["S","k"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"gT","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":"-","msub":{"mi":["kT","b"]}}}}}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j2","\u03c0","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":["f","c"]}}}}},{"msub":{"mi":"N","mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}},{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["S","k"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"gT","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["nT","s"]},{"mi":["kT","b"]}],"mo":"-"}}}}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":"j2\u03c0","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":[{"mi":["f","c"]},{"mi":["nT","s"]}]}}}},{"msub":{"mi":"N","mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["NT","s"]}}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"sub":["s ","0","s","m","o","0"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["y","m","s","gT","e","+N","m"],"sup":["j2\u03c0f",{"sub2":"c"},"mT",{"sub2":"b"},"th "]},"Having received the RF signal, as in block , a baud rate can be estimated for the received RF signal, as well as other characteristics, such as parameters in pulse shaping filter and noise, which may be used in determining a RF signal type (i.e., PSK or QAM).

In addition, the amplitude likelihood function can be used to identify different types of QAM modulations.

For example, the timing recovery method may be configured so that an assumption may be made that a ratio between a sampling rate and baud is integer. However, for a given blind received RF signal, the number of samples per baud may not always be integer. As a result, a time recovery method may be modified to a non-uniform sub-sampling  method based on the ensemble average power of each samples for the received RF signals. For example, the sampled RF signals as shown in Equation (3) use a baud number of samples per symbol T=T\/Tinstead of the baud rate Tto describe the non-uniform process.","In consideration of non-integer baud, the ensemble average power can be calculated by interpolating samples of received RF signals. Using coarse estimation of the baud, an evaluation of the ensemble average power of each samples shown in Equation (7) may be performed. As an example, the non-uniform sub-sampling  can be performed by starting with a sample with the maximum ensemble power among samples in the first several symbol durations. The next sample selected can be a sample with a peak value of the ensemble average power, as the result of a search over a small interval around the middle point of next baud based on last selected samples. Illustratively, a small interval may be selected to be the smallest integer larger than or equal to one-fourth of an estimated number of samples per baud. It is noted that the sub-sampling process described above may be non-uniform due to peak values that may not be equally spaced from one another.","Examples of the effects of matched filtering  and non-uniform sub-sampling  are illustrated in . Shown is one example of an amplitude distribution of received RF signals before and after matched filtering  and non-uniform sub-sampling  for a 16-QAM signal. For example, the distribution of signal amplitudes of the received RF signal can include a weighted sum of distributions corresponding to different amplitude values. Parameters for the example RF signals shown in are: SNR=20 dB; number of symbols N=10,000; T=T=20. The graph  shows a \u201cconstellation map\u201d of a received RF signal. A histogram  of the RF signal amplitude is shown. Corresponding results after matched filtering  and sub-sampling are shown in the graph  and the histogram . Three groups of amplitude of the 16-QAM signals can be observed after matched filtering  and non-uniform sub-sampling , but the three groups cannot be observed in the received RF signal prior to matched filtering  and non-uniform sub-sampling . Consequently, the likelihood functions ,  used for modulation identification of RF signals without pulse shaping can be used to identify pulse shaped RF signals after sub-sampling.","In one example, a QAM likelihood function  (e.g., an amplitude likelihood function) for different QAM signals can be based on the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the QAM signal amplitudes. For example, a modulation type of a received RF signal may be determined by letting there be N distinct amplitude values for the Mth modulation type and let Hrepresent the hypothesis that the Mth modulation type is the actual modulation type of the received RF signal. Further, letting the set {S; i=1, 2, . . . , N} represent the N distinct amplitude values and letting W[i] be the probability of the ith amplitude value for the Mth modulation type.

The lth samples by non-uniform sampling becomes:\n\n()=()()\u2003\u2003(26)\n\nwhere l=k*T|T+\u0394l; \u0394l is optimized based on the non-uniform sampling process. If \u0394l equals to 0, the samples have been chosen correctly and the RF signal model is the same as that in the likelihood functions. But when \u0394l does not equal 0, the amplitude of the RF signal model can be simplified as:\n\n|()|=|(\u0394)|+|()|=|(0)+|()|\u2003\u2003(27)\n","The additional term |\u0394g(0)| is small variation from |g(0)| and can be regarded as additional noise added to the RF signal model. When the number of samples is large, the number of samples satisfy Gaussian distribution using central limit theorem. In this way, the SNR of the RF signal after non-uniform sampling can have a small variation compared with the SNR before.

Circuitry can include hardware, firmware, program code, executable code, computer instructions, and\/or software. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium can be a computer readable storage medium that does not include signal. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device may include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. The volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements may be a random-access memory (RAM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), flash drive, optical drive, magnetic hard drive, solid state drive, or other medium for storing electronic data. The switch may also include a transceiver module (i.e., transceiver), a counter module (i.e., counter), a processing module (i.e., processor), and\/or a clock module (i.e., clock) or timer module (i.e., timer). One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various techniques described herein may use an application programming interface (API), reusable controls, and the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) may be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with hardware implementations.","It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions, which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.","Indeed, a module of executable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules may be passive or active, including agents operable to perform desired functions.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201can example\u201d or \u201cexemplary\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the example is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases \u201cin an example\u201d or the word \u201cexemplary\u201d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","As used herein, a plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, and\/or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus, no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary. In addition, various embodiments and example of the present invention may be referred to herein along with alternatives for the various components thereof. It is understood that such embodiments, examples, and alternatives are not to be construed as defacto equivalents of one another, but are to be considered as separate and autonomous representations of the present invention.","Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of layouts, distances, network examples, etc., to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, layouts, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","While the forgoing examples are illustrative of the principles of the present invention in one or more particular applications, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications in form, usage and details of implementation can be made without the exercise of inventive faculty, and without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention.
