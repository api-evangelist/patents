{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/765,325, filed on Feb. 15, 2013, entitled \u201cMECHANISM FOR SERVICE LAYER RESOURCE PROPAGATION\u201d, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.","Machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies allow devices to communicate more directly with each other using wired and wireless communications systems. M2M technologies enable further realization of the Internet of Things (IoT), a system of uniquely identifiable objects and virtual representations of such objects that communicate with each other and over a network, such as the Internet. IoT may facilitate communication with even mundane everyday objects, such as products in a grocery store or appliances in a home, and thereby reduce costs and waste by improving knowledge of such objects. For example, stores may maintain very precise inventory data by being able to communicate with, or obtain data from, objects that may be in inventory or may have been sold.","An M2M entity (e.g., an M2M functional entity such as device, gateway, server\/platform that may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software) may provide an application or service. For example, a light sensor may provide data indicating detected light levels or a thermostat may provide temperature data and the ability to adjust air conditioning controls. This data may be made available as a \u201cresource\u201d that may be accessed by other M2M entities and that essentially serves as a means to exchange data between M2M entities. A resource may be a uniquely addressable representation of data that may be addressed using a Universal Resource Indicator (URI). The availability of such resources may be communicated among M2M entities via the M2M service capabilities layer (SCL) using a mechanism called \u201cAnnounce\u201d that allows these entities to advertise and discover available resources in an M2M communication system. The M2M SCL is a functional entity that may be implemented by hardware and\/or software and that provides functions exposed on reference points (i.e., functional interfaces between M2M entities). For example, the M2M SCL may provide common (service) functionalities that are shared or commonly used by different M2M applications and\/or services. These common functionalities may be exposed using a set of open interfaces. For example, M2M service capabilities may use cellular core network functionalities through a set of exposed interfaces (e.g., existing interfaces specified by 3GPP, 3GPP2, ETSI TISPAN, etc.) and may also interface to one or more other core networks. Because devices offering resources may be simple devices, communications announcing a resource are often handled by a more intelligent device referred to as a \u201chosting\u201d SCL entity that may be where the original resource resides. Like other M2M communications at the SCL, resource announcements are made using logical communications interfaces at each entity called \u201creference points\u201d that are independent of the physical communications interfaces and the actual communications path below the application layer between any communicating M2M entities.","M2M devices and entities are typically organized into M2M network domains. In many implementations, an M2M server configured with a network SCL entity (NSCL) may maintain resources and resource data for use by other devices (e.g., other M2M devices and M2M gateways) in the same M2M network domain. However, in current M2M implementations, an SCL entity can only announce resources associated with an application registered with the SCL to other SCL entities in its own network domain. The announcement procedures currently in use are limited to announcing application resources by SCL entities (may be referred to simply as \u201cSCLs\u201d) rather than also allowing announcement of the SCLs, and only facilitate announcements to the NSCL in the same network domain as the device announcing the resource.","Embodiments disclosed herein include methods for a machine-to-machine network node in one domain to generate a request to advertise a resource or a services capabilities layer entity in that domain and to transmit the request to another machine-to-machine network node in another domain via an inter-domain reference point between the nodes.","Embodiments disclosed herein further include a machine-to-machine network node that executes instructions to effectuate operations including generating a request to advertise a resource in that node's domain and transmitting the request to another machine-to-machine network node in another domain via an inter-domain reference point between the nodes.","Embodiments disclosed herein further include a computer-readable medium having computer-readable instructions stored thereon that, when executed, effectuate operations including generating a request to advertise a resource in a node's domain and transmitting the request to another machine-to-machine network node in another domain via an inter-domain reference point between the nodes.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to limitations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.","ETSI M2M TS 102 690 V2.0.12 (herein: \u201cETSI M2M specification\u201d) defines a mechanism called \u201cAnnounce\u201d that allows one service layer entity to advertise its resources to other entities, thereby facilitating the use of resources by multiple entities. The instant disclosure may refer to this specification and\/or use terms as they are understood in this specification to aid in the understanding of the disclosed embodiments.","The embodiments set forth herein are described in terms of a representational state transfer (REST) architecture, with components and entities described conforming to the constraints of a REST architecture (RESTful architecture). A RESTful architecture is described in terms of the constraints applied to components, entities, connecters, and data elements used in the architecture rather than in terms of physical component implementation or communications protocols used. Thus, the roles and functions of the components, entities, connecters, and data elements will be described. In a RESTful architecture, representations of uniquely addressable resources are transferred between entities. The ETSI M2M specification has standardized the resource structure that resides on a SCL. When handling resources in a RESTful architecture, there are basic methods that may be applied to resources, such as Create (create child resources), Retrieve (read the content of the resource), Update (write the content of the resource) or Delete (delete the resource.) One skilled in the art will recognize that implementations of the instant embodiments may vary while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. One skilled in the art will also recognize that the disclosed embodiments are not limited to implementations using the ETSI M2M architecture that is used herein to describe exemplary embodiments. The disclosed embodiments may be implemented in other architectures and systems, such as oneM2M and other M2M systems and architectures.","As discussed above in the Background section, in current M2M implementations, an SCL entity can only announce resources associated with an application to other SCL entities in its own network domain. Moreover, the announcement procedures currently in use are limited to announcing resources associated with an application (may be referred to as simply a \u201cresource\u201d) by SCL entities (may be referred to simply as \u201cSCLs\u201d) rather than also allowing announcement of resources representing the SCL (may be referred to simply as an \u201cSCL resource\u201d), and only facilitate announcements to the NSCL in the same network domain as the entity announcing the resource. Embodiments described hereinafter improve upon the existing announce mechanism, enabling an SCL to announce an SCL resource and its subresources to other SCLs. For example, an NSCL may advertise resources and SCL resources in the NSCL's domain to one or more other NSCLs in different domains. Alternatively, other SCLs, such as gateway SCLs (GSCLs) and device SCLs (DSCLs) may also advertise resources and SCL resources to one or more other SCLs in the same or in a different domain. This allows access to SCL resources and resources in one network domain by M2M entities in different network domains.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"System  may include M2M devices and entities in network domains  and . NSCL  may be in domain  and configured with network application (NA)  at M2<server platform . NA  and NSCL  may communicate via reference point mIa . The mIa reference points may allow a NA to access the M2M Service Capabilities available from an NSCL in an M2M domain. Also within network domain  may be GSCL  and gateway application (GA)  that may be configured at M2M gateway device . GSCL  and GA  may communicate using reference point dIa . Further within network domain  may be DSCL  and device application (DA)  that may be configured at M2M device . DSCL  and DA  may communicate using reference point dIa . Each of GSCL  and DSCL  may communicate with NSCL  using reference point mId . In general, dIa reference points allow device and gateway applications to communicate with their respective local service capabilities (i.e., service capabilities available at a DSCL and a GSCL, respectively). The mId reference point allows an M2M SCL residing in an M2M Device (e.g. DSCL ) or an M2M Gateway (e.g. GSCL ) to communicate with the M2M Service Capabilities in the Network Domain and vice versa (e.g., NSCL ).","NSCL  may be in domain  with NA . NA  and NSCL  may communicate via mIa reference point . mIm reference point  may be an inter-domain reference point that allows M2M network nodes in different network domains, such as NSCL  in network domain  and NSCL  in network domain , to communicate with one another. In embodiments of the methods and apparatus described hereinafter, such inter-domain communication may be used to announce resources and SCL resources across domains.","An SCL may announce a resource only to SCLs with which it has registered and that are able to accept the announcement request. In an embodiment, procedures that are used to announce a resource to all potential \u201cAnnounced-to SCLs\u201d may use one or both of the relevant mIa or dIa and the mId reference point. An Announced-to SCL is an SCL containing an \u201cannounced resource\u201d whose content may refer to the original resource hosted by a hosting SCL. The announced resource is an actual resource that may consist of only a limited set of attributes, such as a link to the original resource hosted by another SCL (a hosting SCL), search strings and access rights. The announced resource facilitates a discovery of the original resource hosted by the hosting SCL so that the issuer of the discovery request does not have to contact all SCLs in order to find the original resource. If the original issuer of an announcement is an application, such as GA , DA , or NA , then the announcement may be triggered on the respective mIa or dIa reference point. For example, dIa  may be used to trigger an announcement for GA  and dIa  may be used to trigger an announcement for DA . The announcement may then be sent (executed) to NSCL  using mId . If the original issuer of an announcement request is an SCL, such as GSCL  or DSCL , then the announcement may be both triggered and executed on mId . Where the original issuer of an announcement request is an SCL such as GSCL  or DSCL , an application may request to be notified of the status of the announcement. Applications may use information announced to an SCL to access the resource. For example, a link and\/or search strings for an announced application may be used by another application to communicate with the announced application.","In an embodiment, where the issuer of an announcement request is an application (e.g., NA , GA , DA ), the application may request to announce a resource to other SCLs by changing the appropriate attribute of the resource. The trigger to begin the announcement procedure may be the registration of the issuer with its local SCL. For example, when GA  registers with GSCL  in network domain , the registration may trigger the start of the process to announce the resources of GA . Alternatively, the creation of a new resource on the local SCL, such as the creation of a new resource for DA  on DSCL  in network domain , or an update of a resource on the local SCL, such as an update of a resource associated with NA  on NSCL  in network domain , may trigger the start of the process to announce the resources of the respective application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["210","211","220","240","211","210","220","211","210","220","210","220","211","210","220","220","210"]},"Announcement request  may include one or more announce attributes provided in a list, referred to as an \u201cannounce attribute list\u201d, where each attribute includes information regarding the scope of the announcement. Such attributes may include the type of announcement being requested. The attributes may further indicate that the issuer will determine the specific SCLs to which an announcement is to be made by listing those SCLs in the announce attribute list or announcement request , or they may indicate that the local SCL is to make the determination of the SCLs to which the announcement is to be made. The attributes may further indicate whether the announce operation needs to be confirmed to the issuer. Announce operation confirmation may be used for all interface procedures or only a subset of such procedures. These attributes may further indicate whether announcement is enabled (e.g., active or inactive). By using the inactive attribute, the announce attribute list may be populated at the local SCL (e.g., SCL ), but the announcement may not be made from the local SCL to other SCLs (e.g., SCL ). Use of the inactive attribute may only be allowed at resource creation and may be used to prevent an SCL from announcing the resource until an active attribute is received. In some embodiments, once an announcement is indicated as active, use of the inactive attribute may not be allowed or accepted.","The attribute list may be applicable to all announceable resources for which issuer  may request creation or update on SCL . The attribute list that is provided by issuer  at registration with SCL  may be referred to as the issuer 's default attribute list. Issuer 's announceable resources may also provide their own respective attribute list, in which case issuer 's default attribute list may not be used for that particular resource. Updates or changes to the default attribute list by issuer  are not propagated to previously created announceable resources on SCL , but any new announceable resources of issuer  may be requested using the updated default attribute list. To change attributes of an existing resource on SCL , issuer  may transmit an update to SCL  for the resource that includes an updated attribute list.","SCL  may validate received announcement request  by determining that issuer  is on a list of issuers authorized to announce resources. This list may be labeled \u201caccessRights\u201d. If not validated (e.g., because issuer  is not registered at SCL , issuer  is not authorized to create or update the requested resource on SCL , or the attribute included in announcement request  are not allowable), SCL  may not perform any of the announcement procedures, and in some embodiments may return an error message to issuer . If validated, at block , SCL  may create or update the resource representing an application (e.g., NA, GA, or DA). If there are no attributes provided in announcement request , SCL  may use the current default attribute list for issuer  in creating the new requested resource. A response  may be transmitted to issuer  via mIa or dIa reference point  confirming that issuer  is authorized to request the creation of resources on SCL . SCL  may send this response prior to or after the completion of the announce procedure.","Note that in an embodiment, where issuer  is an application and does not indicate in announcement request  the SCLs to which SCL  should announce, SCL  sends response  via mIa or dIa reference point  to issuer  prior to the completion of the announce procedure using mid reference point  described below. In this embodiment, SCL  decides when and to which SCLs to announce the resource. In another embodiment, wherein issuer  is an application and announcement request  indicates the SCLs to which SCL  should announce, the SCL  sends response  to issuer  (via mIa or dIa reference point ) after it has completed announcing the resource to all the indicated SCLs. In this embodiment, response  may indicate to issuer  the status of the announced resources (i.e., whether the resource was successfully created at each of the indicated SCLs). In this embodiment, response  may include a list of the SCLs that were announced to successfully.","In another embodiment, announcement request  may indicate that no confirmation is required, and therefore in this embodiment response  may not be sent. In other embodiments, where announcement request  is an Update request rather than a Create request, and where an indication that no confirmation is required is included in announcement request , response  is not sent, but when announcement request  is a Create request response  is transmitted regardless.","In response to determining that announcement request  is valid, SCL  may continue announce procedure processing at block  and determine when and to which SCLs to announce the newly created or updated resource.","Announce resource request  may be transmitted via reference point mId  to Announced-to SCL . Announce resource request  may be referred to simply as an \u201cAnnounce\u201d, and may be a \u201cCreate\u201d request requesting the creation of a resource. Announce  may include search strings and a link to the created resource.","Announced-to SCL  may validate Announce , in an embodiment, similarly to the process used by SCL  to validate announcement request , but other embodiments using alternate methods of validation are contemplated as within the scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment, creation of the resource may only be allowed if SCL  is included in Announced-to SCL 's accessRight list of entities authorized to announce resources to Announced-to SCL .","At block , Announced-to SCL  may attempt to create the requested resource, for example, an announced resource that represents an active announcement of the application (NA, GA or DA), with the specified attributes if SCL  has successfully been validated. If Announced-to SCL  determines that SCL  is permitted to announce resources to Announced-to SCL , Announced-to SCL  will proceed with generating and populating memory space to contain announced resource data and taking any other steps needed to prepare for, and conduct, announcement of the resource.","Upon completion of the processing at block , Announced-to SCL  may transmit response  that may indicate whether the creation of the announced resource was successful or unsuccessful. If the announced resource was not created at Announced-to SCL  (e.g., because SCL  is not registered at Announced-to SCL , SCL  is not authorized to create the requested resource on Announced-to SCL , or the attribute(s) included in request  are not allowable), SCL  may not perform any of the announcement procedures, and in some embodiments may return an error message to issuer . If creation of the announced resource at Announced-to SCL  was successful, response  includes an identifier (e.g., a uniform resource identifier (URI)) of the announced resource.","Note that SCL  may also send Announce  to other SCLs as well, and therefore the steps within dashed box  may be repeated until the resource is announced to all SCL to which SCL  has determined it should be announced. Unless specified in the announce attribute list included in announcement request , SCL  may determine to which SCLs the resource should be announced. SCL  may also provide the corresponding expiration time for the resource.","As an improvement over the existing M2M announce processes, in an embodiment, and referring again to , NSCL  may be configured to announce SCL resources, including announceable subresources. Based on an announce attribute list received from another SCL (e.g., GSCL , DSCL ) or from an application (e.g., NA , GA , DA ), NSCL  may announce a resource to an Announced-to NSCL, such as NSCL  in domain , via mIm reference point  by sending an announcement (e.g., Create request) over mIm reference point . If the resource is hosted by NSCL  (e.g., a resource originating at NA ), NSCL  may create the announced resource and send an \u201cannounce resource\u201d request to the NSCL  that includes the announced resource containing, for example, a search strings and the link to the original resource. If the resource has been announced to NSCL  by another SCL (e.g., GSCL , DSCL ), the resource is an announced resource at NSCL , and NSCL  may announce it to NSCL  according to the list of specific SCLs to which an announcement is to be made that was included in the attribute list that accompanied the request to create the resource received by NSCL . Note that this attribute or list may be referred to as an \u201cannounceTo\u201d attribute of the resource.","The ETSI M2M specification defines an <scl> resource that represents a remote SCL that is registered at the SCL storing the <scl> resource. This specification further defines a <sclBase> that is a root resource that included all resources (may be referred to as \u201csubresources\u201d) that reside and are available at an SCL storing the <sclBase> resource, including a collection resource (i.e., a resource that represents zero or more other resources) \u201cscls\u201d that contains all <scl> resources representing all SCLs registered on the SCL (or that the SCL is registered to) on which the <sclBase> resource is located (i.e., all SCLs registered at the SCL storing the <sclBase> resource). Thus each remote SCL that is registered with an SCL's <sclBase> is represented by an <scl> resource in that SCL's<sclBase> resource. Likewise, each registered-to SCL is also represented as a sub-set <scl> resource in the registering SCL's <sclBase>. For example, referring again to  and using ETSI resource notation, when GSCL  registers with NSCL , there are two <scl> resources created, one in GSCL \u2014a <sclBase>\/scls\/<scl> resource\u2014and one in NSCL \u2014a <sclBase>\/scls\/<scl> resource.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","305","310","315","320","325","330","335","340","345","350"]},"As an improvement to the existing M2M announce procedures, in an embodiment, also included under the <scl> resource may be a collection resource representing a set of resources that each represent an announced SCL and its subresources available which may be in a different network domain from that of the entity on which the collection resource is located. This collection resource may be referred to as \u201csclAnncs\u201d in some embodiments. An example of this collection resource is shown as sclAnncs  under <scl> resource  of . Also, among attributes  may be an \u201cannounceTo\u201d attribute that is a list of the SCLs to which an announcement of this <scl> resource  should be made. The SCL on which the <scl> resource  is configured will attempt to announce resources to the SCLs in the announceTo list. As noted above, if a list of entities to which to announce resources is not provided in an announcement request received over the mIa or dIa reference point, the local SCL will decide where the resource will be announced. Also among attributes  may be a \u201cregisteredScls\u201d attribute that is a list of SCLs that are registered with the SCL configured with the <scl> resource . (For example in , if GSCL  registers with NSCL  configured with the <scl> resource , then GSCL  is an element of the registeredScls of NSCL .)","sclAnncs resource  may include zero or more subresources (e.g., resources of the SCL) that each may be referred to as an <sclAnnc> resource. Each <sclAnnc> resource, an announced SCL resource, represents an active announcement of an SCL. The SCL may be a registered SCL in a different network domain from that of the SCL on which sclAnncs resource  is configured.

Thus, a program running in a first mode can access only memory mapped by its own process virtual address space; it cannot access memory within another process's virtual address space unless memory sharing between the processes has been set up.","In addition, computing system  may contain peripherals controller  responsible for communicating instructions from CPU  to peripherals, such as printer , keyboard , mouse , and disk drive .","Display , which is controlled by display controller , is used to display visual output generated by computing system . Such visual output may include text, graphics, animated graphics, and video. Display  may be implemented with a CRT-based video display, an LCD-based flat-panel display, gas plasma-based flat-panel display, or a touch-panel. Display controller  includes electronic components required to generate a video signal that is sent to display .","Further, computing system  may contain network adaptor  that may be used to connect computing system  to an external communications network, such as network  of . In an embodiment, network adaptor  may receive and transmit data related to the disclosed of systems and methods for service layer resource propagation, such as the announcement or deannouncement of SCL resources.","It is understood that any or all of the systems, methods, and processes described herein may be embodied in the form of computer executable instructions (i.e., program code) stored on a computer-readable storage medium embodied as a physical device or apparatus.
