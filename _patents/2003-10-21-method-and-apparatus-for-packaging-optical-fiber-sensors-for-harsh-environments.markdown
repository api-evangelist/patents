title: Method and apparatus for packaging optical fiber sensors for harsh environments
abstract: A package for an optical fiber sensor having a metal jacket surrounding the sensor, and heat-shrink tubing surrounding the metal jacket. The metal jacket is made of a low melting point metal (e.g. lead, tin). The sensor can be disposed in a rigid tube (e.g. stainless steel or glass) that is surrounded by the metal jacket. The metal jacket provides a hermetic, or nearly hermetic seal for the sensor. The package is made by melting the metal jacket and heating the heat shrink tubing at the same time. As the heat-shrink tubing shrinks, it presses the low melting point metal against the sensor, and squeezes out the excess metal.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60\/419,535 filed on Oct. 21, 2002, the complete contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Contract Number DE-FT26-98BC15167 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to optical fiber sensors. More particularly, the present invention provides a method and apparatus for packaging optical fiber sensors which may be used in an oil well downhole, or in other harsh environments. The package employs a low melting point metal jacket inside heat shrink tubing.","Optical fiber sensors are employed for measuring temperature, pressure or other physical parameters. Optical fiber sensors are sometimes employed in extreme environments where they can outperform conventional electronic sensors. For example, optical fiber sensors can measure temperature and pressure in the environment of an oil well downhole. The downhole environment is a challenging place to locate an optical fiber sensor because of mechanical shock, chemical corrosion, thermal degradation, and water penetration that can occur. In order to provide a downhole optical sensor, the sensor must be packaged to protect it from these threats. Additionally, the sensor package must have a small size because space is limited in the downhole environment.","Accordingly, there is presently a need for packages for optical fiber sensors that are suitable for harsh environments such as a downhole environment. The package must provide chemical, mechanical and thermal protection. Also, it is preferable for the package to be simple to fabricate and inexpensive.","The present invention includes a fiber optic sensor package that is well-suited for use in harsh environments such as a downhole environment.","The present optical fiber sensor package includes a sensor with a metal jacket surrounding the sensor. The metal jacket is made of low melting point metal and has a shape formed by melting and refreezing (solidifying) in contact with a shrunken heat shrink tubing. The package may further comprise the heat shrink tubing surrounding the metal jacket.","The metal jacket can be made of low melting point metals such as lead, tin, bismuth, indium and alloys thereof.","The package may further comprise a rigid tube within the metal jacket and surrounding the sensor.","The metal jacket may have a meting temperature less than 250, 300, 350, or 400 degrees Celsius, for example.","The metal jacket preferably has a melting temperature less than the shrinking temperature of the heat shrink tubing.","The present invention includes a method for making the present sensor package. The present sensor package is made by disposing the sensor and the low melting point metal into the heat shrink tube and heating the tube and metal so that the metal melts and the tube shrinks. This causes the tube to press the metal against the sensor. The location of applied heat can be scanned across the sensor to minimize the amount of air trapped within the package.","The present invention provides a fiber optic sensor package that is inexpensive and suitable for use in harsh environments such as a downhole environment (e.g. oil well). The present package provides exceptional mechanical and chemical protection, and is compatible for use at high pressure. Also, the present package is simple and inexpensive to fabricate, and can be used with a wide range of fiber optic sensors.","The present fiber sensor package has a optical fiber sensor within a metal jacket made of low melting point metal (e.g. lead, tin, indium or their alloys) surrounded by a shrunken heat shrink tubing. The heat shrink tubing is shrunken while the low melting point metal is in a molten state, thereby squeezing out excess metal (if any). The low melting point metal jacket provides an inexpensive and durable coating that, in combination with the heat shrink tubing provides mechanical and chemical protection. Preferably, the metal has a melting point equal to or lower than the temperature required to make the heat-shrink tubing shrink. Optionally, the package can have a rigid tubing (e.g. made of glass, quartz, ceramic, stainless steel or the like) disposed between the sensor and the low melting point metal. The fiber optic sensor can have a Bragg grating, Fabry-Perot cavity, special optical coatings or other structures designed to provide sensing capability. The present package is compatible with a wide range of fiber sensors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","22","24","20","26","26","28","20","24","28","30","28","24","20","20","24","28"]},"According to the present invention, a low melting point metal jacket  is provided over the rigid tube . A shrunken heat-shrink tube  is provided over the metal jacket . The metal jacket  has a shape formed by the heat-shrink tube  while it is in the molten state. Accordingly, the metal jacket  will typically have meniscuses  shaped by surface tension forces of the molten metal. It is noted that the rigid tube  can be made of a wettable material (e.g. copper) so that the metal jacket  is bonded to the tube . Additionally, the fibers  can be metallized so that they are wetted by the metal jacket . Also, it is noted that the heat shrink tube  can be pinched closed at the end so that the metal jacket is not exposed.","Preferably in the invention, the melting point of the metal jacket  is equal to or less than the temperature required to shrink the heat shrink tubing , and the melting or disintegration temperature of the rigid tube  is in excess of the melting temperature of the metal jacket and the temperature required to shrink the heat shrink tubing . The heat shrink tubing accordingly forms and shapes the metal jacket  during the shrinking process. As a result, the thickness of the metal jacket  between the rigid tubing  and heat shrink tubing  can be for example less than 1 mm thick. The thickness of the metal jacket can also be a thin, foil type layer less than 100 or 200 microns thick.","The metal jacket  can be made of many different metals or alloys having a relatively low melting temperature (e.g. less than 250, 300, 350 or 400 degrees Celsius). The metal jacket  can be made of lead, tin, bismuth, gallium, indium and alloys containing these metals. The metal jacket can also be made of silver-bearing solder alloys (e.g. 95% tin\/5% silver alloy), or lead-tin solder alloys. The metal jacket can also be alloyed with high melting temperature metals such as copper, iron, aluminum and the like. High melting temperature metals can be added to alter the melting temperature of the metal jacket, or alter the chemical properties of the metal jacket. For example, the metal jacket can be made of an alloy selected to have a low permeability to water or other substances damaging to the sensor. The composition of the metal jacket should be chosen in accordance with the thermal, mechanical and chemical property requirements of the package.","The heat shrink tubing  can be made of any material that shrinks in a radial direction upon heating to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting temperature of the metal. For example, the heat shrink tubing can be made of polytetrafluoroethylene (e.g. TEFLON (trademark of DuPont)) type materials that tend to have a relatively high shrinking temperature of about 327 degrees Celsius, polyolefin type materials that shrink at about 95 degrees Celsius, or other heat-shrink materials that shrink at temperatures in the range of 95-350 degrees Celsius.","The buffer  can be any conventional optical fiber buffer, but it preferably comprises a material that is resistant to temperatures used to melt the metal jacket. For example, the buffer can be made of polyimide. The optical fiber can be made of silica or any other conventional optical fiber material that can withstand the temperatures required to melt the metal  and shrink the tubing . The buffer can be removed prior to forming the present hermetic package.","The fiber endfaces defining the Fabry-Perot cavity can have special coatings to provide desired optical properties needed for specialized sensors. The type of sensor is immaterial to the invention because the present invention is applicable to many different types of optical fiber sensors. For example, the present invention can be used with sensors that do not have a Fabry-Perot cavity.","The bonds  can be fusion bonds provided by CO2 laser, or can be bonds provided by adhesives or glass solders, for example. In any case, if bonds  are present, they should be resistant to the temperature required to melt the metal jacket material  and shrink the heat shrink tubing .","In use, the heat shrink tubing  and metal jacket  provide adequate protection for the fiber sensor in many harsh environments including a downhole environment. While in use, the metal jacket  is preferably at a temperature below its melting point so that it remains solid. However, the present invention includes applications where the sensor is used at elevated temperatures where the metal jacket  is molten. It is noted that in such applications, the metal jacket  will typically not contribute to mechanical protection for the sensor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["38","28","34","28","38","32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["46","20","46","32","20","32","32","34"]},"It is noted that the Bragg grating is merely exemplary, and is optional. The fiber sensor can have any structure that provides sensing capability. For example, the optical fiber  can have a special coating in its endface that provides sensing capability.
