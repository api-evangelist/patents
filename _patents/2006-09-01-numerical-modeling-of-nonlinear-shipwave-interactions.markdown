title: Numerical modeling of nonlinear ship-wave interactions
abstract: The hydrodynamics of a seagoing vessel are numerically modeled through the present invention's new calculative methodology, which uniquely combines vessel boundary characteristics and pseudo-spectral environmental characteristics. Solutions are obtained through mutual transformations between the vessel boundary's irregular grid and the environment's regular pseudo-spectral grid. The pressure at the vessel boundary, an important component of the vessel boundary itself, can be determined via either (i) finite element analysis (which has a Cartesian framework) or (ii) the present invention's new vessel normal vector analysis (which has a non-Cartesian framework); the latter approach avoids the singularity problem that generally besets hydrodynamics-related mathematics. Typical inventive practice implements a computer processing unit and succeeds in finding superior solutions in shorter CPU durations.

Generally, the ship motion models have been developed via algorithms or formulae based on either linear theory (e.g., Green function) or weakly nonlinear theory. Two major problems hinder the application of these conventional models, viz.: (i) their inability to model strongly nonlinear interactions (e.g., wherein the nonlinear interactions are comparable to or stronger than the linear variations) among surface waves, and among surface waves and ship bodies; (ii) the computationally expensive nature of the backbone algorithms, particularly in solving global wave-like solutions. Therefore, the conventional models are limited to the \u201cmild-condition\u201d applications; that is to say, the conventional models are significantly less than ideal (and may even be impossible) for solving extreme problems, such as storm surges, strong incident waves, and high speed ships. In addition, due to computational costs, the conventional models tend to be less likely than desired to meet real-time or near real-time application requirements.","Lord Kelvin first developed a mathematical description of wave pattern due to a point pressure distribution, the classical V-shaped wave pattern that bears his name; see W. Thompson, \u201cOn Ship Waves,\u201d Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., 1887, Reprint, 1891, in 3:450-500, MacMillan, London; W. Thompson, \u201cOn the Waves Produced by a Single Impulse in Water of Any Depth, or in a Dispersive Medium,\u201d 42:80-85, 1887.","Michell developed a thin-ship theory for the wave resistance of a ship; see J. H. Michell, \u201cThe Wave Resistance of a Ship,\u201d 45:106-23, 1898.","Havelock extended Michell's thin ship theory to predict the wave pattern about the ship; see T. H. Havelock, \u201cThe Propagation of Groups of Waves in Dispersive Media, with Application to Waves on Water Produced by a Traveling Disturbance,\u201d 81:398-430, 1908; T. H. Havelock, \u201cWave Patterns and Wave Resistance,\u201d 76:430-46 (1934).","Tuck developed slender body theory for a ship and the wave field near the ship. See E. O. Tuck, \u201cA Systematic Asymptotic Expansion Procedure for Slender Ships,\u201d 8(1):15-23, 1964; E. O. Tuck, \u201cOn Line Distributions of Kelvin Sources, 8(2):45-52, 1964.","Two families of linearized free surface solutions satisfying the exact body boundary condition have been developed, viz., the Neumann-Kelvin methods and Dawson the methods. The Neuman-Kelvin methods linearize the free-surface flow about the free-stream velocity. The Dawson methods linearize the problem about the double-body flow.","The Havelock singularity solution of the Neumann-Kelvin formulation of the ship-wave problem reduces the problem to the solution of an integral equation on the body surface by using a Green function that satisfies explicitly the Laplace equation and the linearized free-surface condition. Doctors together with Beck, and Scragg, have developed Havelock-Green function-based methods for computing the solution of the Kelvin-wake problem; see L. J. Doctors and R. F. Beck, \u201cNumerical Aspects of the Neumann-Kelvin Problem,\u201d 31:1-13, 1987; L. J. Doctors and R. F. Beck, \u201cConvergence Properties of the Neumann-Kelvin Problem for a Submerged Body,\u201d 31:227-34, 1987; A. M. Reed, J. G. Telste and C. A. Scragg, \u201cAnalysis of Transom Stern Flows,\u201d 18, Ann Arbor, Mich., pp 207-19, Washington, D.C.: Natl. Acad. Press, 1990.","Doctors & Beck and Scragg solve the full Neumann-Kelvin problem for the strengths of the singularities. Telste (See A. M. Reed, J. G. Telste and C. A. Scragg, \u201cAnalysis Of Transom Stern Flows,\u201d 18, Ann Arbor, Mich., pp 207-19, Washington, D.C.: Natl. Acad. Press, 1990; J. Telste and A. M. Reed, \u201cCalculation of Transom Stern Flows,\u201d 6, Iowa City, Iowa, pp 79-92, Washington, D.C.: Natl. Acad. Press, 1993) employs Rankine singularities to solve the Neumann-Kelvin problem, which necessitates distributing Rankine singularities on the free surface as well as on the hull surface.","Dawson methods (See C. W. Dawson, \u201cA Practical Computer Method for Solving Ship Wave Problems,\u201d 2, Berkeley, Calif., pp 30-38, Berkeley, Calif.: Univ. Calif. Berkeley, 1977) solve for the Kelvin wake in a two-stage process. The first step involves the solution of a double-body problem where the ship's hull is reflected in the free surface and the flow is predicted as though the body and its reflected image are submerged infinitely deep in the fluid. The second stage of the solution involves solving a free-surface problem that is linearized around the double-body solution. This second solution involves singularities on the free surface as well as on the body. Compared to the Havelock Green function-based methods, the Dawson methods trade a much simpler Green function for a much larger computational domain with many more unknowns.","Cheng (1989), Kim et al. (1989), Sclavounos & Nakos (1988), and Nakos & Sclavounos (1990) have developed Dawson methods for solving the Kelvin-wake problem using Rankine sources. See B. H.

Sclavounos, \u201cShip Motions by a Three-Dimensional Rankine Panel Method,\u201d 18, pp 21-41, Ann Arbor, Mich., 1990.","Scragg & Talcott (1990) and Scragg (1999) have developed a \u201cHavelock-Dawson\u201d approach that employs Rankine singularities on the hull and Havelock singularities on the free surface in a limited region of the undisturbed free surface near the body. See C. A. Scragg. and J. C. Talcott., \u201cNumerical Solution of the \u201cDawson\u201d Free-Surface Problem Using Havelock Singularities,\u201d 18, Ann Arbor, Mich., pp 259-71, Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1990; C.

The Havelock-Dawson method allows one to panel only a limited region of the free surface because the singularities satisfy both the linearized free surface and the radiation boundary conditions, resulting in a \u201cself-limiting\u201d distribution of singularities on the free surface. The Havelock-Dawson approach is computationally very efficient.","Most recently, fully nonlinear free surface flow solutions have been developed based on both potential flow and on RANS formulations. Raven (1996, 1998), Subramani (2000), and Wyatt (2000) have published nonlinear potential flow methods for predicting the wave field around ships. See D. C. Wyatt, \u201cDevelopment and Assessment of a Nonlinear Wave Prediction Methodology for Surface Vessels,\u201d 44:96-107, 2000; A. K. Subramani, \u201cComputations of Highly Nonlinear Free-Surface Flows, with Applications to Arbitrary and Complex Hull Forms,\u201d PhD thesis, Dep. Naval Arch. Mar. Eng., Univ.

Press, 1998.","All three authors in the preceding paragraph employ Rankine singularities and desingularize the free surface. Several authors have published the results from free-surface RANS codes that can solve the steady-ship wave problem. See A. Arabshahi, M. Beddhu, W. Briley, J. Chen, A. Gaither, et al., \u201cA Perspective on Naval Hydrodynamic Flow Simulations,\u201d Proceedings of the 22nd Symposium on Naval Hydrodynamics, Washington, D.C., pp 920-34, Washington, D.C.: Natl. Acad. Press, 1998; see also, R. Wilson, E. Paterson, and F. Stern, \u201cUnsteady RANS CFD Method for Naval Combatants in Waves,\u201d Proceedings of the 22nd Symposium on. Naval Hydrodynamics, Washington, D.C., pp 532-49, Washington, D.C.: Natl. Acad. Press, 1998.","These codes solve the field equations using a finite volume or finite difference scheme. Each satisfies the full nonlinear free-surface boundary condition by employing some type of upstream differencing scheme on the free surface. The fact that the fluid volume must be re-gridded to track the nonlinear free-surface deformation adds a significant complication to the iteration scheme and adds significantly to the computation time. Solutions using nonlinear free-surface RANS codes such as these can take 40-80 hours or more to compute on a state-of-the-art multiprocessor super computer.","In parallel with the above studies, effort has recently been focused on interactions between ship waves and ambient waves because they cannot be well described by linear superposition (See, e.g., M. St. Denis and W. J. Pierson, \u201cOn the Motions of Ships in Confused Seas,\u201d , Vol. 61, 1953); Y. Liu, D. G. Dommermuth, and D. K. P. Yue, \u201cA high-order spectral method for nonlinear wave-body interactions,\u201d 245:115-136, 1992) first used a high-order spectral method to study nonlinear interactions among surface waves and ship. Their model was developed originally by Dommermuth and Yue (See D. G. Dommermuth and D. K. P. Yue, \u201cNumerical Simulations Of Nonlinear Axisymmetric Flows With A Free Surface,\u201d 209, 57, 1987) to study nonlinear gravity wave interactions based on the third-order Zakharov equation. See R.-Q. Lin, and W. Perrie, \u201cA New Coastal Wave Model, Part III: Nonlinear Wave-Wave Interaction for Wave Spectral Evolution,\u201d 27:1813-26, 1997; D. R. Crawford, B. M. Lake, P. G. Saffman, and H. C. Yuen, \u201cStability of Weakly Nonlinear Deep-Water Waves in Two and Three Dimensions,\u201d 105:177-191, 1982.","However, the Zakharov Equation, and the Hasselmann Equation (See S. Hasselmann and K. Hasselmann, \u201cA Symmetrical Method of Computing the Nonlinear Transfer in a Gravity-Wave Spectrum,\u201d , Vol. 52, 138 pp, 1981), which is similar to the Zakharov equation, are both derived using perturbation methods, which implies that the equations are not appropriate for problems with large wave steepness. For example, the maximum wave steepness for the Zakharov equation is 0.3, with a 10 percent error level. With the similar error, the Hasselmann equation only allows wave steepness up to 0.06; see R.-Q. Lin and W. Perrie, \u201cA New Coastal Wave Model, Part III: Nonlinear Wave-Wave Interaction for Wave Spectral Evolution,\u201d 27:1813-26, 1997.","In addition, the model of Liu et al. (1992) can only solve interactions between a cylinder and surface waves, while ships have much more complicated geometries. The solutions of Liu et al. can be extended to more complicated problems by applying conformal mappings, but this imposes constraints on the flow properties and on the ship geometries. In order to resolve arbitrary ship shapes, boundary element methods are introduced in modeling finite amplitude ship-wave interactions. See, e.g., W. M. Lin and D. K. P. Yue, \u201cNumerical Solution for Large-Amplitude Ship Motions in Time-Domain,\u201d 18, U. Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich., 1990; W. M. Lin, M. J. Meinhold, N. Salvesen, and D. K. P. Yue, \u201cLarge-Amplitude Motions and Wave Load for Ship Design,\u201d 20, U. California, Santa Barbara, Calif., 1994; Lin and Yue, 1990; Liu et al., 1992, 1994; M. Xue, \u201cThree-Dimensional Fully-Nonlinear Simulations of Waves and Wave Body Interactions,\u201d Ph.D. Thesis, Dept Ocean Engineering, MIT, 1997; M. Xue, H. X\u00fc, Y. Liu, and D. K. P.

P, Yue, \u201cComputations of Fully Nonlinear Three-Dimensional Wave-Wave Wave-Body Interactions, Part 2: Nonlinear Waves and Forces,\u201d 438:41-66, 2000.","Though the boundary element method (and other local methods) is very good for resolving flow near the boundaries of arbitrary ships, it is not very efficient in resolving the waves away from the ship. This problem can be very serious when ambient waves are present. In this case, fine-scale grids are necessary to resolve small-scale waves and wave-wave interactions. Insufficient resolution can easily result in numerical instabilities. On the other hand, spectral methods can take advantage of the wave-like motions at the surface away from the ship. In particular, by selecting appropriate base wave functions for spectral expansion, one can easily model surface waves and wave-wave interactions with high computational efficiency. Furthermore, one can model wave-breaking mechanisms that are important in studying finite amplitude wave-wave interactions. Because of these numerical advantages, ship hydrodynamics models based on spectral methods have been developed. For example, Liu et al. (1992) developed a spectral model to study interaction between incident waves and a cylinder (an idealized ship).","However, the spectral method is not very efficient in solving for the local flow structures near the ship. For example, a very fine ship will generate very small-scale flow near the ship. Resolving this small-scale flow with spectral methods requires a very high truncation order, not necessary for the flow away from ship. In addition, traditional periodic boundary conditions used in modeling wave-wave interactions (See, e.g., R.-Q Lin and W. Kuang, \u201cNonlinear Wave-Wave Interactions of Finite Amplitude Gravity Wave,\u201d 8:109-116, 2004) are not applicable to ship-wave interaction problems. An example is the case of a ship moving in calm water where there are no waves ahead of the ship but waves extend behind the ship to infinity, where there can be no periodic far-field boundary conditions.","In ship-wave hydrodynamics, the flow is assumed to be an incompressible, inviscid potential flow. Therefore, singularities occur in solving flow at the ship boundary, particularly at bow and stern points. Resolving the flow near the ends of the ship is one of the important problems in ship hydrodynamics, and is particularly critical for correct evaluation of the pressure on a moving ship. In the past, researchers developed various approximations and techniques to avoid the singularities. As previously mentioned herein, Michell (1898) developed thin ship theory, which was further refined by Havelock (1908, 1934). Tuck (1964) developed slender theory for a ship and the wave field near the ship. Similar methods were developed in (linear and nonlinear) studies using the exact ship boundary condition, e.g. Doctors & Beck (1987), Scragg (Reed et al. 1990), Telste (Reed et al. 1990, Telste & Reed 1993), and Liu et al. (2000). These approaches to solving the velocity potential at the ship boundary depend on certain \u201ccut-off\u201d domains (e.g., truncation in wave number space of integrals for the wave components of the potential, or truncation of the Fourier series of the spectral representation). In addition, computations with arbitrary ship geometries can be very expensive, because high numerical resolution is required to avoid numerical errors and instabilities.","In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a robust numerical model that can be used to study nonlinear interactions between steadily moving ships and environmental waves.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a model that is sufficiently flexible for arbitrary single-hull and multi-hull ships.","A further object of the present invention is to provide such a model that is sufficiently flexible for extreme environmental conditions.","It is a another object of the present invention to provide such a model that is computationally efficient.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a model that is capable of real-time or near-real-time applications.","The present invention provides a pseudo-spectral model for nonlinear ship-surface wave interactions. The algorithm used in the inventive model represents a combination including spectral and boundary element methods. The boundary element method is used to translate physical quantities between the non-uniform ship surface and the regular grid of the spectral representation; the spectral method is used throughout the remainder of the fluid domain. All possible wave-wave interactions are included in the inventive model (up to N-wave interactions for the truncation order N of the spectral expansions). The instant disclosure focuses on the mathematical theory and numerical method of the inventive model and presents some numerical results for steady Kelvin waves in calm water. The nonlinear bow waves at high Froude numbers from the inventive pseudo-spectral model are much closer to the experimental results than those from linear ship wave models.","The present inventors' results demonstrate that the present invention's pseudo-spectral model is significantly faster than previous ship wave models; with the same resolution, the CPU time of the pseudo-spectral model is orders of magnitude less than those of previous models. For instance, convergence speed of the inventive model is ANLogN instead of BN, where N is the number of unknowns. Note that the N for the traditional boundary element method may be significantly larger than the N for the inventive pseudo-spectral method for the same quality solution. A and B are CPU time requirements in each time step for the inventive model and for other models, respectively.","To solve the problems of the existing ship motion models, the present inventors started by modeling ship motions from the fundamental equations derived from the first principles. According to this approach, the present inventors introduced no approximation on the nonlinearity in their model, thereby ensuring that their ensuing model shall be applicable to any ship motion studies, including those of extreme environment (where nonlinear interaction is the strongest). In furtherance of numerical stability and efficiency, the present inventors introduced a new approach on solving pressure on the ship boundaries, this new approach ensuring that their new model can work with arbitrary ship boundaries, especially those causing mathematical stiffness. In addition, the present inventors created an interpolation algorithm to map between the localized ship grid systems and the (global) pseudo-spectral grid systems.","With their inventions, the present inventors avail themselves of the combined numerical advantages of pseudo-spectral algorithms (for global surface waves) and finite difference\/finite element algorithms (for local ship boundaries). The combination of these two types of algorithms can dramatically reduce computational costs, making the real-time or near real-time applications feasible. The present invention as typically practiced features, inter alia: (a) inclusion of full nonlinear interactions (in the inventive model); (b) combination of pseudo-spectral algorithms and finite difference\/finite element algorithms; and, (c) evaluation of pressure correction on the ship boundaries. Inventive feature (a) promotes the capability of the inventive model of being applied to the studies of arbitrary ship motions in any environment. Inventive features (b) and (c) promote the numerical stability and efficiency of the inventive model, such attributes being necessary for real-time or near real-time applications.","One of the main problems in modeling ship-wave hydrodynamics is solving for the forcing (pressure) at the ship boundary. With an arbitrary ship, singularities occur in evaluating the velocity potential and the velocities on the hull. Inaccuracies in the evaluation of the singular terms in the velocity potential result in discretization errors, numerical errors and excessive computational costs. The present invention uses a pseudo-spectral method to solve the velocity potential at the ship boundary in Cartesian coordinates; however, like other methods such as disclosed by Tuck (1964), Doctors & Beck (1987), Scragg (Reed et al. 1990), Telste (Reed et al. 1990, Telste & Reed 1993), and Liu et al. (2000), the present invention's more traditional approach to solving the velocity potential at the ship boundary depends on certain \u201ccut-off\u201d domains (e.g., truncation in wave number space of integrals for the wave components of the potential, or truncation of the Fourier series of the spectral representation).","As alternative to their new but more traditional approach, the present inventors disclose herein a new and totally untraditional approach to evaluating the pressure on a ship: evaluating the pressure in the ship normal vector coordinate system. The present invention's more traditional approach evaluates the pressure (velocity potential) at the ship boundary in a Cartesian coordinate system; in contrast, the present invention's entirely untraditional approach evaluates the pressure (velocity potential) at the ship boundary in a non-Cartesian, ship normal vector coordinate system. The main advantage of the latter (non-Cartesian) inventive approach is that p is a smooth function in the ship normal vector coordinate system, enabling the inventive practitioner to obtain accurate results very efficiently (e.g., in much less CPU time) without encountering numerical difficulties arising from possible singularities.","According to the present invention's ship-wave numerical model, a pseudo-spectral method and a boundary element representation of the ship are combined to solve for the velocity potential. To improve numerical efficiency and accuracy in modeling ship hydrodynamic problems, a central issue is to resolve appropriately the velocity potential near ship boundaries. The present invention's alternative, non-Cartesian approach is to solve the flow near the ship boundary in a coordinate system different from the normal Cartesian coordinate in which the far-field flow is well defined. The special coordinate system is defined with the ship boundary normal vectors, in which the pressure is a smooth function. The present invention thereby avoids the difficulties associated with the singularities in the velocity potential.","Spectral (e.g., pseudo-spectral) method is capable of studying the strong nonlinear interactions between a ship body and the environment (e.g., the incident waves). For instance, spectral method can be used to study winter storms or hurricanes that impact motions of a ship. However, spectral method is incapable of studying the complicated ship body itself. In contrast, finite element method (also known as finite different method or panel method) is capable of studying the complicated ship body, but is incapable of studying the strong nonlinear interactions between a ship body and the environment (e.g., the incident waves). The present invention, as frequently practiced, succeeds in using both spectral method and finite element method to holistically model the hydrodynamics of the seagoing ship as it interacts with its environment. The term \u201cship,\u201d as used herein in relation to practice of the present invention, broadly refers to any marine or water-going (e.g., sea-going or ocean-going) vessel, since inventive principles are broadly applicable to any such vessel.","According to typical inventive practice, a numerical method for modeling hydrodynamics of a ship and water waves comprises: (a) determining a boundary described by a ship; (b) determining a nonlinear interaction between the ship and incident waves; and, (c) mutually transforming information between the boundary and the nonlinear interaction. The determination of the nonlinear interaction includes using spectral method, a known genre of mathematical technique. More specifically, usually preferred inventive practice provides for use of \u201cpseudo-spectral\u201d method, a known type of spectral method, for nonlinear interaction determination. The ship boundary is characterized by irregular body points on the ship. The nonlinear interaction is characterized by regular pseudo-spectral collocation points. The mutual transformation of information includes mutually transforming grid-related information between the irregular body points and the regular pseudo-spectral collocation points. As the present invention is frequently practiced, the present invention's unique mutual transformation methodology succeeds in transferring information between the ship's body and the ship's environment in each time step. According to typical inventive practice, the determination of the ship boundary includes determination of the pressure at the ship boundary. According to some inventive embodiments, the determination of the pressure is contextualized in a Cartesian coordinate system and includes use of finite element method. According to other inventive embodiments, the determination of the pressure is contextualized in a ship normal vector coordinate system, the present invention's unique form of a non-Cartesian coordinate system.","The present invention's novel non-Cartesian approach to pressure determination is both accurate and efficient, as it eliminates unwanted mathematical singularities that are associated with all other approaches to pressure determination. Every other pressure determination methodology requires truncation of at least one singularity; in contrast, the inventive non-Cartesian pressure determination methodology avoids any such artificial effect on its solutions. The present invention's ship normal vector coordinate system mode of determination of pressure includes: (a) establishing a pressure dichotomy and (b) obtaining the \u201cship-present\u201d pressure. The pressure dichotomy is of a ship-absent pressure kind and a ship-present pressure kind. The ship-absence pressure is characterized by absence of the ship; the ship-present pressure kind is characterized by presence of the ship. The ship-absent pressure kind includes a ship-absent pressure pand a ship-absent modified pressure p*; the ship-present pressure kind includes a ship-present pressure p and a ship-present pressure correction \u0394p. The ship-present pressure p is the pressure being solved for. The ship-present pressure p is obtained based on the ship-absent pressure pand the ship-present pressure correction \u0394p. The ship-present pressure p is defined as the sum of the ship-absent pressure pand the ship-present pressure correction \u0394p.

Normally, a ship can be very accurately resolved by clustering more grid points in the regions where the ship geometry varies rapidly. Therefore, the uniform collocation points of the spectral representation are less than ideal for arbitrary bodies. Furthermore, ship hull forms are defined on surface grids that are very different from the uniform grid of the spectral method collocation points. To resolve these problems, we introduce a grid point transformation between the uniform collocation points of the spectral method and the non-uniform grid points of the ship surface.

Different numerical resolutions are used in the sub-domains to reduce the computational cost, without compromise on convergence rate. The division and the numerical resolutions depend on specific problems under consideration.","For example, to study a steady ship motion in calm water, it is sufficient to have three sub-domains, with the center domain containing the ship, and one sub-domain on each side of the center domain. In the center domain, a fine spatial resolution of the truncation order (N=96, M=192) is applied so that approximations Equation (13) and Equation (15) can be evaluated very accurately. In the two side domains, a coarser spatial resolution of (N=64, M=128) is adopted. To speed up the simulation, the dimensions of the sub-domains are decided according to the truncation level and the smallest length scale necessary for numerical convergence. To match solutions in adjacent sub-domains, we allow small overlapping areas between them, and apply matching boundary conditions in the overlapping areas.

The value of the wave resistance coefficient computed using pressure integration over the hull is not shown in  because the maximum relative difference between the two is less than 10 percent.  incorporates information from FIG. 4.1 of Raven (1998) and additionally illustrates inventive results (the dash-dotted line). In  it is seen that the inventive model results agree well with the other model results. The present inventors conjecture that the difference between the results may be due to the sinkage and the trim effects neglected in the inventive pseudo-spectral computations as well as numerical issues and experiment inaccuracies.","Disclosed herein is the present invention's pseudo-spectral model for nonlinear ship-wave interactions. The present invention's numerical results demonstrate that fully nonlinear ship waves in calm water can be well resolved with the present invention's pseudo-spectral methods. The numerical results also demonstrate that the present invention's nonlinear pseudo-spectral model is more accurate in resolving ship-wave interactions than linear models. For example, the difference in the bow waves obtained with linear or small perturbation models and those measured from experiments increases very rapidly with Froude number. For the Wigley hull, when F=0.408, the computed linear bow waves are about 20 percent smaller than those from experiments. However, the numerical results from the present invention's nonlinear pseudo-spectral model are only 5 percent smaller, and are thus much closer to the actual measured waves. At low Froude numbers, the difference is negligible. This small difference between the pseudo-spectral numerical results and the experiments may partly result from the fact that the sinkage and trim are not included in the pseudo-spectral results. As is well known, the effect of sinkage and trim increases with increasing Froude number.","The success of the present invention's pseudo-spectral model depends, to some extent, on several key numerical developments. The first is the transformation between the regular pseudo-spectral collocation points and irregular body points on the ship, thus enabling us to model arbitrary ships with little loss of computational efficiency. The second is the multi-domain approach that maximizes the advantage of spectral methods, so that different spatial resolutions can be effectively addressed with moderate truncation levels. The third is the open boundary condition approximation that effectively reduces the dimension of numerical domain, resulting in less computational time.","In addition, the present invention's pseudo-spectral model can effectively simulate interactions between ships and incident gravity waves, because the latter are either the base functions themselves in Equation (8) or linear combinations of the base functions. Modeling surface wave-ship interactions will require careful unification of the present invention's pseudo-spectral steady motion model with a fully nonlinear free surface wave-wave interaction model (Lin and Kuang, 2004). The present inventors plan to pursue this avenue.","The present invention's pseudo-spectral model typically includes a boundary element representation of the ship. This inventive boundary element representation can be in either a Cartesian coordinate system or a non-Cartesian coordinate system. According to typical inventive practice in which the inventive boundary element representation is in a Cartesian coordinate system, a blocked Fourier series representation of the flow is used to solve for the pressure on the hull. According to typical inventive practice in which the inventive boundary element representation is in a non-Cartesian coordinate system, the pressure is solved for in a ship normal vector coordinate system whereby the pressure due to the ship motion through the fluid becomes a smooth function. Comparisons between computational results and experimental data show that the present invention's boundary element method expressed in normal vector coordinates is more accurate than the present invention's boundary element method expressed in Cartesian coordinates.","Presented hereinabove are numerical results for Series 60, C=0.6 as well as quantitative comparisons of the inventive wave profile along the ship and far-field wave making resistance with experimental data extracted from Raven (1998) and Yang et al. (2000). The difference between the results using the present invention's pressure body boundary condition, versus the experiments, may partly result from the fact that sinkage and trim are not included in the results. It is known that the effect of sinkage and trim increases with the Froude number. Also presented hereinabove are ship wave patterns that are shown to be similar to those existing model results and observed data. This suggests that the fully nonlinear ship waves in calm water can be well resolved with inventive pseudo-spectral methods even with a complicated hull shape, especially when the boundary element representation of the ship is inventively rendered in a normal vector coordinate system. Uniquely and advantageously, the present invention's non-Cartesian coordinate system as applied to ship boundary is characterized by non-singularity. The velocity potential on a moving ship is singular according to inventive practice of a Cartesian coordinate system; in contrast, the velocity potential on a moving ship is non-singular according to inventive practice of a non-Cartesian (normal vector) coordinate system, thus avoiding the discretization and numerical errors.","Worthy of emphasis is the computational efficiency of the present invention's model. Assuming that the numerical resolutions in (x, y) are given by N\u00d7N grid points, the typical floating point operations (flops) of the local algorithms (used in the existing models) are of the order N. In contrast, according to the present invention's model, the flop is of the order N log N. If N=1000, the present invention's model can be 300 times faster than other models. The \u201cspeed-up\u201d afforded by inventive practice can be orders of magnitude larger with more grid points (or higher numerical resolutions).","The present invention, which is disclosed herein, is not to be limited by the embodiments described or illustrated herein, which are given by way of example and not of limitation.
