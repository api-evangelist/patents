{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This is the U.S. national stage of International application PCT\/IB2009\/007404, filed Nov. 10, 2009 designating the United States and claims priority to GB 0821219.3, filed Nov. 10, 2008.","The invention relates to new therapeutic agents and diagnostic probes, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and metabolites thereof, which are useful for modulating protein or enzyme activity for modulating cellular activities such as signal transduction, proliferation, differentiation, programmed cell death, migration and cytokine secretion. More specifically the invention provides compounds which inhibit, regulate, detect and\/or modulate kinase activity, in particular phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), DNA-PK and ATM kinase inhibitor compounds, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and prodrugs thereof; compositions of the new compounds, either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent, with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; and uses of the new compounds, either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent, in the prophylaxis or treatment of a number of diseases, in particular, those characterized by the abnormal activity of serine\/threonine kinases, receptor tyrosine kinases and lipid kinases. The invention also relates to methods of using the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis, assay development or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.","Protein kinases participate in the signaling events which control the activation, growth, differentiation, survival and migration of cells in response to extracellular mediators or stimuli including growth factors, cytokines or chemokines. In general, these kinases are classified in two groups, those that preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues and those that preferentially phosphorylate serine and\/or threonine residues. The tyrosine kinases include membrane-spanning growth factor receptors, for example the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytosolic non-receptor kinases including Src family kinases, the Syk family kinases and the Tec family kinases.","Inappropriately high protein kinase activity is involved in many diseases including cancer, metabolic diseases, immunological diseases and inflammatory disorders. This can be caused either directly or indirectly by the failure of control mechanisms due to mutation, overexpression or inappropriate activation of the enzyme.","Protein tyrosine kinases\u2014both receptor tyrosine kinases and non-receptor kinases\u2014are essential for the activation and proliferation of cells of the immune system. Among the earliest detectable events upon the immunoreceptor activation in mast cells, T cells and B cells is the stimulation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases.","Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) were early on identified as lipid kinases associated with viral oncogens [Whitman et al., 315:239-242 (1985); Sugimoto et al., 81:2117-2121 (1984); Macara et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81:2728-2732 (1984)], and for the last 20 years, the connection between cancer and PI3K has been further substantiated [Cully et al., 6:184-192 (2006); Wymann et al., 17:141-149 (2005); Vivanco et al., 2:489-501 (2002)]. PI3Ks have since been recognized to modulate a wide range of cellular activities, and to be central to the growth and metabolic control. Genetically modified mice targeting the PI3K pathway, and the elucidation of human hereditary disease like Cowden's syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, ataxia telangiectasia, X-linked myotubular myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, have provided further insight in the cellular and systemic role of phosphoinositide signaling. Deregulation of phosphoinositide levels, and in particular the product of class I PI3Ks, PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, chronic inflammation, allergy, metabolic disease, diabetes and cardiovascular problems.","PI3Ks are a family of enzymes, which phosphorylate the 3\u2032-OH position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides. They have been divided into three classes on the basis of structural features and in vitro lipid substrate specificity [(Marone et al, 1784:159-185 (2008)]. Class I PI3Ks form heterodimers, which consist of one of the four closely related \u02dc110 kDa catalytic subunits, and an associated regulatory subunit belonging to two distinct families. In vitro they are capable to convert PtdIns to PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-4-P to PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but the in vivo substrate is PtdIns(4,5)P2 [Cantley et al., Science 296:1655-1657 (2002)]. Class I PI3Ks are activated by a large variety of cell-surface receptors, comprising growth factor receptors as well as G protein-coupled receptors.","Class II PI3Ks are capable to phosphorylate PtdIns and PtdIns-4-P in vitro, but their relevant in vivo substrates are still under investigation. This class of large (170-200 kDa) enzymes has three members, all characterized by a C-terminal C2 homology domain. No adaptor molecules for class II PI3Ks have been identified so far. Class III PI3Ks are solely able to phosphorylate PtdIns, and thus generate only PtdIns-3-P. The single member of this class is Vps34, of which the S. cerevisiae Vps34p (vacuolar protein sorting mutant 34 protein) is the prototype, and has been shown to play an essential role in trafficking of newly synthesized proteins from the Golgi to the yeast vacuole, an organelle equivalent to lysosomes in mammals [Schu et al., Science 260:88-91 (1993)].","Phosphoinositide 4-kinases (PI4Ks) phosphorylate the 4\u2032-OH position of the inositol ring of PtdIns, and thereby generate PtdIns-4-P. This lipid can then be further phosphorylated by PtdIns-4-P 5-kinases to generate PtdIns (4,5)P2, which is the main source for phospholipase C and PI3K signaling at the plasma membrane. Four PI4Ks isoforms are known: PI4KII\u03b1 and \u03b2, and PI4KIII\u03b1 and \u03b2. The PI4KIIIs are most closely related to PI3Ks.","The class of PI3K-related proteins, referred to as class IV PI3Ks, consists of high molecular weight enzymes with a catalytic core similar to PI3Ks and PI4Ks and include the target of rapamycin (mTOR, also known as FRAP), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene product (ATM), ataxia telangiectasiarelated (ATR), SMG-1 and transformation\/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP). The first five members are active protein serine-threonine kinases that are involved in cell growth control and genome\/transcriptome surveillance [(Marone et al., 1784:159-185 (2008)]. DNA-PKcs, ATM, ATR and SMG-1 are involved in DNA-damage responses. The only active kinase not involved in DNA-damage is mTOR, which is regulated by growth factors and nutrient availability, and coordinates protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation. Target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes 1 and integrate growth factor signaling (via PI3K\/PKB and the Ras\/MAPK cascade), energy status (LKB1 and AMPK) and nutrient detection. TOR is positively regulated by PKB\/Akt, which phosphorylates the negative regulator TSC2 in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), resulting in activation of the GTPase Rheb and mTOR [(Marone et al., 1784:159-185 (2008)]. In parallel, mTOR stimulates translation of ribosomal proteins and therefore ribosome biogenesis via the activation of p70[Wullschleger et al., 124:471 (2006)]. Rapamycin, and its derivatives RAD001 and CCI-779, bind to FKBP12, and the complex blocks mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity very selectively. Various clinical trials were initiated using Rapamycin and derivatives, mostly in patients with tumors displaying elevated PI3K signaling and hyperactive mTOR. Promising results were obtained in mantle cell lymphoma, endometrial cancer and renal cell carcinoma [Guertin et al., 12:9 (2007)]. Rapamycin and its derivatives possess anti-angiogenic activity because they counteract VEGF action [Guba et al., 8:128 (2002)]. This opens avenues for combinatorial treatments with conventional chemotherapy [Beuvink et al., 120:747 (2005)].","The PI3K pathway is a key signaling transduction cascade controlling the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, survival as well as cell migration. PI3Ks are activated by a wide variety of different stimuli including growth factors, inflammatory mediators, hormones, neurotransmitters, and immunoglobulins and antigens [Wymann et al., 24:366-376 (2003)]. The class IA PI3K isoforms PI3K\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b4, are all bound to one of the p85\/p55\/p50 regulatory subunits, which all harbor two SH2 domains that bind with high affinity to phosphorylated Tyr-X-X-Met motifs. These motifs are present in activated growth factor receptors, their substrates and numerous adaptor proteins. As described above, activation of the PI3K\/PKB signaling cascade has a positive effect on cell growth, survival and proliferation. Constitutive up-regulation of PI3K signaling can have a deleterious effect on cells leading to uncontrolled proliferation, enhanced migration and adhesion-independent growth. These events favor not only the formation of malignant tumors, but also the development of inflammatory and autoimmune disease.","The PI3 kinase\/Akt\/PTEN pathway is an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would be expected to inhibit proliferation, reverse the repression of apoptosis and surmount resistance to cytotoxic agente in cancer cells. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been reported [see notably Marone et al., 1784:159-185 (2008); Yaguchi et al. (2006) Jour. Of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 98(8):545-556; U.S. Pat. No. 7,173,029; U.S. Pat.

Especially, hexamethylmelamine or altretamin (HMM or N,N,N,N,N,N-hexamethyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine) is well-known, which has been developed as analogue of antitumor agent triethylenemelamine (TEM); HMM acts as a prodrug of hydroxymethylpentamethylmelamine (HMPMM: metabolically active type of HMM) [Johnson et al., Cancer, 42:2157-2161 (1978)]. HMM has been marketed in Europe under the indications for the treatment of ovarian and small cell lung cancers.","Certain triazine compounds are known to have PI3 kinase inhibitor activity and inhibit the growth of cancer cells [WO02088112 (EP1389617), \u201cHETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS AND ANTITUMOR AGENT CONTAINING THE SAME AS ACTIVE INGREDIENT\u201d, Kawashima et al., Filing date: 26 Apr. 2002; WO05095389 (EP1741714), \u201cHETEROCYCLIC COMPOUND AND ANTI-MALIGNANT-TUMOR AGENT CONTAINING THE SAME AS ACTIVE INGREDIENT\u201d, Kawashima et al., Filing date: 30 Mar. 2005; WO06095906 (EP1864665), \u201cIMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENT AND ANTI-TUMOR AGENT COMPRISING HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUND AS ACTIVE INGREDIENTS\u201d, Haruta et al., Filing date: 11 Mar. 2005; WO09905138 (EP1020462), HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS AND ANTITUMOR AGENT CONTAINING THE SAME AS ACTIVE INGREDIENT, Kawashima et al., Filing date: 24 Jul. 1998;]. The triazine compound ZSTK474, developed in research laboratories of Zenyaku Kogyo is the first orally administered triazine compound highly active against PI3Ks that displayed potent antitumor activity against human cancer xenografts in mice, without evidence of critical toxicity [Yaguchi et al., Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 98:545-556, (2006)]. ZSTK474 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase isoforms [Kong et al., Cancer Sci, 98:1638-1642 (2007)].","Certain pyrimidine compounds are known to have p110 alpha binding, PI3 kinase inhibitor activity and inhibit the growth of cancer cells [IP of AstraZeneca: WO07066103, WO07080382, WO08023159, WO08023180, WO08032027, WO08032033, WO08032036, WO08032041, WO08032072, WO08032077, WO08032086, WO08032089, WO08032091; IP of Genentech\/Piramed\/Roche: US2007009880, WO07127183, WO08073785, WO07042810, WO07122410, WO07127175, WO07129161, WO08070740, WO2006046031, WO2006046040, WO2007042806, WO2007122410; IP of Novartis: WO07084786, WO08098058].","In order to expand antitumor spectrum of and increase antitumor activities of such compounds, active against PI3Ks and\/or mTOR, the inventors carried out intensive studies on triazine-, pyrimidine- and pyridine-based derivatives.

The desired products of each step or series of steps are separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.","Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid\/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like.","Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example, boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr., 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: \u201cDrug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology,\u201d Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. J. Org. Chem. (1982) 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (\u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography\u201d (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, J. Chromatogr., (1990) 513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Administration of Compounds of the Invention","The compounds of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary and intranasal. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be administered by intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. Where the compound is administered orally, it may be formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

Also provided is the use of a compound of this invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of the diseases and conditions described herein in a warm-blooded animal, such as a mammal, for example a human, suffering from such disorder.","Pharmaceutical Formulations","In order to use a compound of this invention for the therapeutic treatment (including prophylactic treatment) of mammals including humans, it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.","A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier, diluent or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and\/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are nontoxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).","The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.","The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.","Pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared for various routes and types of administration. For example, a compound of formula Ia-d having the desired degree of purity may optionally be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous solution, formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may range from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.","The compound of this invention for use herein is preferably sterile. In particular, formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. Such sterilization is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","The compound ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will be formulated, dosed and administered in a fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the coagulation factor mediated disorder. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host or renders the host significantly more susceptible to bleeding.","As a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the inhibitor administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg\/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20 mg\/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg\/kg\/day.","Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations of compounds of formula Ia-d may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of formula Ia-d, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or polyvinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Formulations of a compound of formula Ia-d suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of formula Ia-d.","Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.","Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared for oral use, formulations of compounds of formula Ia-d intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.","For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w\/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.","If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs.","The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween\u00ae 60, Span\u00ae 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.","Aqueous suspensions of formula Ia-d compounds contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","The pharmaceutical compositions of compounds of the invention may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight: weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 \u03bcg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 niL\/hr can occur.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and nonaqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.","Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w\/w, for example about 0.5 to 10% w\/w, for example about 1.5% w\/w.","Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.","Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate. [00180] formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis disorders as described below.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.","Combination Therapy","The compounds of the invention may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of formula Ia-d is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound that has anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of formula Ia-d such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment, a composition of this invention comprises a compound of formula Ia-d, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, a N-oxide derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent such as described herein.","The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.","The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes, separate pills or capsules, or separate infusions. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","In a particular embodiment of anti-cancer therapy, a compound of formula Ia-d, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, N-oxide derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, may be combined with other chemotherapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents such as those described herein, as well as combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula Ia-d, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, N-oxide derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound(s) of formula Ia-d and the other pharmaceutically active chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.","Metabolites of Compounds of the Invention","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of formulas (I) and (Ia) to (Ii) described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of formulas (I) and (Ia) to (Ii), including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabeled (e.g., C or H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.","Prodrugs of the Compounds of the Invention","In addition to compounds of the invention, the invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of such compounds. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues, is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, gamma-carboxyglutamate, hippuric acid, octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid, statine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, penicillamine, ornithine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, homocysteine, homoserine, methyl-alanine, para-benzoylphenylalanine, phenylglycine, propargylglycine, sarcosine, methionine sulfone and tert-butylglycine.","Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, a free carboxyl group of a compound of the invention can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example, compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as, but not limited to, a phosphate ester, hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group, as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, (1996) 19:115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem., (1996), 39:10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C-C)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((Ci-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (Ci-C)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N\u2014(C]-C)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (CrC)alkanoyl, \u03b1-amino(C-C)alkanoyl, arylacyl and \u03b1-aminoacyl, or \u03b1-aminoacyl-\u03b1-aminoacyl, where each \u03b1-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH), \u2014P(O)(O(C-C)alkyl)or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).

In one embodiment, the kit comprises a container comprising a compound of formula Ia-d, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, N-oxide derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof. The kit may further comprise a label or package insert on or associated with the container. The term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container may hold a compound of formula Ia-d or a formulation thereof which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example, the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a compound of formula Ia-d. The label or package insert indicates that","the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. In addition, the label or package insert may indicate that the patient to be treated is one having a disorder such as a hyperproliferative disorder, neurodegeneration, cardiac hypertrophy, pain, migraine or a neurotraumatic disease or event. In one embodiment, the label or package inserts indicates that the composition comprising a compound of formula Ia-d can be used to treat a disorder resulting from abnormal cell growth. The label or package insert may also indicate that the composition can be used to treat other disorders. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","The kit may further comprise directions for the administration of the compound of formula Ia-d and, if present, the second pharmaceutical formulation. For example, if the kit comprises a first composition comprising a compound of formula Ia-d and a second pharmaceutical formulation, the kit may further comprise directions for the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the first and second pharmaceutical compositions to a patient in need thereof.","In another embodiment, the kits are suitable for the delivery of solid oral forms of a compound of formula Ia-d, such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number of unit dosages. Such kits can include a card having the dosages oriented in the order of their intended use. An example of such a kit is a \u201cblister pack\u201d. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are widely used for packaging pharmaceutical unit dosage forms. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in the form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered.","According to one embodiment, a kit may comprise (a) a first container with a compound of formula Ia-d contained therein; and optionally (b) a second container with a second pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second pharmaceutical formulation comprises a second compound with anti-hyperproliferative activity. Alternatively, or additionally, the kit may further comprise a third container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","In certain other embodiments wherein the kit comprises a composition of formula Ia-d and a second therapeutic agent, the kit may comprise a container for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet, however, the separate compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically, the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.","Example of Biological Evaluation","Determination of the potential to target PI3K\/PI3K-related kinases (PIKK) of a compound of formula I is possible by a number of direct and indirect detection methods. Certain exemplary compounds described herein were assayed for their phospho PKB blocking activity and their in vitro activity against tumor cells. The range of phospho PKB activities was less than 1 nM (nanomolar) to about 10 \u03bcM (micromolar). Other exemplary compounds of the invention had phospho PKB blocking activity ICvalues less than 10 nM. Certain compounds of the invention had tumor cell-based activity ICvalues less than 100 nM.","The cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of formula I exemplary compounds was measured by: establishing a proliferating mammalian tumor cell lines in a cell culture medium, adding a formula I compound, culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 3 days; and measuring cell viability. Cell-based assays were used to measure viability, i.e. proliferation (IC), cytotoxicity (EC), and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation).","The in vitro potency of formula I compounds was measured by the in-cell Western assay designed in laboratories at University of Basel. This assay method was conducted in microtiter plate formats, making it amenable to high-throughput screening (HTS). Inhibitors were added to the medium and incubated. Antibodies diluted in PBS\/T against pPKB Ser473 (Cell Signalling) and PKB (gift from E. Hirsch) or pS6 Ser 235\/236 (Cell Signalling) were incubated overnight and then secondary fluorescently labelled antibodies (LI-COR) were applied and plates were scanned on an Odyssey reader to detect pPKB\/PKB ratios.","The following compounds have shown particularly interesting biological activities:\n\n","The invention will be now described in a more detailed fashion with regard to specific embodiments and examples of the invention, which have an exemplary but not a limitative character.","Table 1 gives the structures and the corresponding IUPAC names (using ChemDraw Ultra, Version 11.0.1 as well as lower and upper software versions thereof, CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge Mass.) of exemplary compounds Nos. 1-259 of formula (Ia), (Ib) or (Id).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0450","num":"0523"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE
