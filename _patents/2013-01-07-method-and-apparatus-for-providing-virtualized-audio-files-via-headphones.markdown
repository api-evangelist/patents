No. 61\/584,055, filed Jan. 6, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, including any figures, tables, or drawings.","Music is typically recorded for presentation in a concert hall, with the speakers away from the listeners and the artists. Many people now listen to music with in-ear speakers or headphones. The music recorded for presentation in a concert hall, when presented to users via in-ear speakers or headphones, often sounds like the music originates inside the user's head.","Providing virtualized audio files to a headphone user can allow the user to experience the localization of certain sounds, such as 3D sound, over a pair of headphones. Such virtualization can be based on head related transfer function (HRTF) technology or other audio processing that results in the user perceiving sounds originating from two or more locations in space, and preferably from a wide range of positions in space.","Embodiments of the subject invention relate to a method and apparatus for providing virtualized audio files. Specific embodiments relate to a method and apparatus for providing virtualized audio files to a user via in-ear speakers or headphones. A specified embodiment can provide Surround Sound virtualization with DTS Surround Sensations software. Embodiments can utilize the 2-channel audio transmitted to the headphones. In order to accommodate for the user moving the headphones in one or more directions, and\/or rotating the headphones, while still allowing the user to perceive the origin of the audio remains is a fixed location, heading data regarding the position of the headphones, the angular direction of the headphones, the movement of the headphones, and\/or the rotation of the headphones can be returned from the headphones to a PC or other processing device. Additional processing of the audio files can be performed utilizing all or a portion of the received data to take into account the movement of the headphones.","Embodiments of the subject invention relate to a method and apparatus for providing virtualized audio files. Specific embodiments relate to a method and apparatus for providing virtualized audio files to a user via in-ear speakers or headphones. A specified embodiment can provide Surround Sound virtualization with DTS Surround Sensations software. Embodiments can utilize the 2-channel audio transmitted to the headphones. In order to accommodate for the user moving the headphones in one or more directions, and\/or rotating the headphones, while still allowing the user to perceive the origin of the audio remains is a fixed location, heading data regarding the position of the headphones, the angular direction of the headphones, the movement of the headphones, and\/or the rotation of the headphones can be returned from the headphones to a PC or other processing device. Additional processing of the audio files can be performed utilizing all or a portion of the received data to take into account the movement of the headphones.","In specific embodiments, the data relating to movement and\/or rotation of the headphones, which can be provided by, for example, one or more accelerometers, provides data that can be used to calculate the position and\/or angular direction of the headphones. As an example, an initial position and heading of the headphones can be inputted along with acceleration data for the headphones, and then the new position can be calculated by double integrating the acceleration data to recalculate the position. However, errors in such calculations, meaning differences between the actual position and the calculated position of the headphones and differences between the actual angular direction and the calculated angular direction, can grow due to the nature of the calculations, e.g., double integration. The growing errors in the calculations can result in the calculated position and\/or angular direction of the headphones being quite inaccurate. In specific embodiments, data relating to the position and\/or heading (direction), for example position and\/or angular direction, of the headphones can be used to recalibrate the calculated position and\/or angular direction of the headphones for the purposes of continuing to predict the position and\/or angular direction of the headphones. Such recalibration can occur at irregular intervals or at regular intervals, where the intervals can depend on, for example, the magnitude of the measured acceleration and\/or the duration and\/or type of accelerations. In an embodiment, recalibration of the position and\/or the angular direction can be accomplished at least every 0.1 sec, at least every 0.01 sec, at least every 0.005 sec, at least every 0.004 sec, at least every 0.003 sec, at least every 0.002 sec, and\/or at least every 0.001 sec, or at some other desired regular or variable interval. For this purpose, absolute heading data can be sent from the headphones, or other device with a known orientation with respect to the headphones, to a portion of the system that relays the heading data to the portion of the system processing the audio signals. Such angular direction data can include, for example, an angle a known axis of the headphones makes with respect to a reference angle in a first plane (e.g., a horizontal plane) and\/or an angle the known axis of the headphone makes with respect to a second plane (e.g., a vertical plane).","Specific embodiments can also incorporate a microphone, and microphone support.","The headphones can receive the virtualized audio files via a cable or wirelessly (e.g., via RF or Bluetooth.","An embodiment can use a printed circuit board (PCB) to incorporate circuitry for measuring acceleration in one or more directions, position data, and\/or heading (angular direction) data into the headphones, with the following interfaces: PCB fits inside wireless Bluetooth headphones; use existing audio drivers and add additional processing; mod-wire out to existing connectors; use existing battery; add heading sensors. In an embodiment, the circuitry incorporated with the headphones can receive the virtualized audio files providing a 3D effect based on a reference position of the headphones and the circuitry incorporated with the headphones can apply further processing to transform the signals based on the position, angular direction, and\/or past acceleration of the headphones. Alternative embodiments can apply the transforming processing in circuitry not incorporated in the headphones.","In a specific embodiment, a Bluetooth Button and a Volume Up\/Down Button can be used to implement the functions described in the table below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0014"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Bluetooth Button","Function"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["No user interaction required, this should","Start or stop listening to music"]},{"entry":"always happen when device is on"},{"entry":["Send answer or end a call signal","1 tap"]},{"entry":"or reconnect lost Bluetooth connection"},{"entry":["Send redial signal","2 taps"]},{"entry":["Activate pairing","Hold button until LED flashes"]},{"entry":[{},"Red\/Blue"]},{"entry":[{},"(First power up: device starts"]},{"entry":[{},"in pairing mode)"]},{"entry":["Activate multipoint (optional for now -","Hold down the button while"]},{"entry":["this allows the headphones to be paired","powering on"]},{"entry":"with a primary and a secondary device)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0015"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Volume Buttons","Function"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Tap Volume Up\/Down","Turn up\/down volume and communicate"]},{"entry":[{},"volume up info to phone.

The power output can also preferably be about as much as an iPod, such as consistent with the description of iPod power output provided in various references, such as (Y. Kuo, et al., Hijacking Power and Bandwidth from the Mobile Phone's Audio Interface, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich., 48109, <http:\/\/www.eecs.umich.edu\/\u02dcprabal\/pubs\/papers\/kuo10hijack.pdf>).","Embodiments can use as the source a PC performing the encoding and a headphone performing the decoding. The PC-based encoder can be added between a sample source and the emitter.","One or more of the following codecs are supported in various embodiments:\n\n","Heading information can be deduced from one or more accelerometers and a digital compass on the headphones and this information can then be available to the source.","A reference point and\/or direction can be used to provide one or more references for the 3D effect with respect to the headphones. For example, the \u201cfront\u201d of the sound stage can be used and can be determined by, for example, one or more of the following techniques:\n\n","Various embodiments can incorporate a heading sensor. In a specific embodiment, the headphones can have a digital compass, accelerometer, and tilt sensor. From the tilt sensor and accelerometer, the rotation of the viewers forward facing direction through the plane of the horizon should be determined. In a specific embodiment, the tilt sensor data can be combined with the accelerometer sensor data to determine which components of each piece of rotation data are along the horizon.","This rotation data can then be provided to the source. The acceleration data provides high frequency information as to the heading of the listener (headphones). The digital compass(es) in the headphones and the heading sensor provide low frequency data, preferably a fixed reference, of the absolute angle of rotation in the plane of the horizon of the listener on the sound stage (e.g., with respect to front). This data can be referenced as degrees left or right of parallel to the heading sensor, from \u2212180 to +180 degrees, as shown in the table below.","Which data is fused in the PC and which data is fused in the headphones can vary depending on the implementation goals. After the data is combined, the data can be made available via, for example, an application programming interface (API) to the virtualizer. Access to the output of the API can then be provided to the source, which can use the output from the API to get heading data as frequently as desired, such as every audio block or some other rate. The API is preferably non-blocking, so that data is available, for example, every millisecond, if needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0031"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Heading information",{}]},{"entry":["presented to API","Meaning"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0","[degrees]","Listener is facing same direction as heading"]},{"entry":[{},{},"sensor.
