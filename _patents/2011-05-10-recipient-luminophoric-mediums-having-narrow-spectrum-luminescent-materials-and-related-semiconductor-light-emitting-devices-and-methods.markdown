{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention was developed with Government support under Department of Energy Contract No. DE-FC26-08NT01577. The Government has certain rights in this invention","The present invention relates to light emitting devices and, more particularly, to semiconductor light emitting devices that include recipient luminophoric mediums.","A wide variety of light emitting devices are known in the art including, for example, incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent lights and semiconductor light emitting devices such as light emitting diodes (\u201cLEDs\u201d). LEDs generally include a series of semiconductor layers that may be epitaxially grown on a substrate such as, for example, a sapphire, silicon, silicon carbide, gallium nitride or gallium arsenide substrate. One or more semiconductor p-n junctions are formed in these epitaxial layers. When a sufficient voltage is applied across the p-n junction, electrons in the n-type semiconductor layers and holes in the p-type semiconductor layers flow toward the p-n junction. As the electrons and holes flow toward each other, some of the electrons will \u201ccollide\u201d with corresponding holes and recombine. Each time this occurs, a photon of light is emitted, which is how LEDs generate light. The wavelength distribution of the light generated by an LED generally depends on the semiconductor materials used and the structure of the thin epitaxial layers that make up the \u201cactive region\u201d of the device (i.e., the area where the electrons and holes recombine).","Most LEDs are nearly monochromatic light sources that appear to emit light having a single color. Thus, the spectral power distribution of the light emitted by most LEDs is tightly centered about a \u201cpeak\u201d wavelength, which is the single wavelength where the spectral power distribution or \u201cemission spectrum\u201d of the LED reaches its maximum as detected by a photo-detector. The \u201cwidth\u201d of the spectral power distribution of most LEDs is between about 10 nm and 30 nm, where the width is measured at half the maximum illumination on each side of the emission spectrum (this width is referred to as the full-width-half-maximum or \u201cFWHM\u201d width).","In order to use LEDs to generate white light, LED lamps have been provided that include several LEDs that each emit a light of a different color. The different colored light emitted by the LEDs combine to produce a desired intensity and\/or color of white light. For example, by simultaneously energizing red, green and blue LEDs, the resulting combined light may appear white, or nearly white, depending on, for example, the relative intensities, peak wavelengths and spectral power distributions of the source red, green and blue LEDs.","White light may also be produced by surrounding a single LED with one or more luminescent materials such as phosphors that convert some of the light emitted by the LED to light of one or more other colors. The combination of the light emitted by the single-color LED that is not converted by the luminescent material(s) and the light of other colors that are emitted by the luminescent material(s) may produce a white or near-white light.","As one example, a white LED lamp may be formed by coating a gallium nitride-based blue LED with a yellow luminescent material such as a cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet phosphor, which has the chemical formula YAlO:Ce, and is commonly referred to as YAG:Ce. The blue LED produces an emission with a peak wavelength of, for example, about 460 nm. Some of blue light emitted by the LED passes between and\/or through the YAG:Ce phosphor particles without being down-converted, while other of the blue light emitted by the LED is absorbed by the YAG:Ce phosphor, which becomes excited and emits yellow fluorescence with a peak wavelength of about 550 nm (i.e., the blue light is down-converted to yellow light). The combination of blue light and yellow light that is emitted by the coated LED may appear white to an observer. Such light is typically perceived as being cool white in color, as it is primarily comprises light on the lower half (shorter wavelength side) of the visible emission spectrum. To make the emitted white light appear more \u201cwarm\u201d and\/or exhibit better color rendering properties, red-light emitting luminescent materials such as Eu doped CaAlSiNbased phosphor particles may be added to the coating.","Phosphors are the luminescent materials that are most widely used to convert a single-color (typically blue or violet) LED into a white LED. Herein, the term \u201cphosphor\u201d may refer to any material that absorbs light at one wavelength and re-emits light at a different wavelength in the visible spectrum, regardless of the delay between absorption and re-emission and regardless of the wavelengths involved. Thus, the term \u201cphosphor\u201d encompasses materials that are sometimes called fluorescent and\/or phosphorescent. In general, phosphors may absorb light having first wavelengths and re-emit light having second wavelengths that are different from the first wavelengths. For example, \u201cdown-conversion\u201d phosphors may absorb light having shorter wavelengths and re-emit light having longer wavelengths. In addition to phosphors, other luminescent materials include scintillators, day glow tapes, nanophosphors, quantum dots, and inks that glow in the visible spectrum upon illumination with (e.g., ultraviolet) light.","A medium that includes one or more luminescent materials that is positioned to receive light that is emitted by an LED or other semiconductor light emitting device is referred to herein as a \u201crecipient luminophoric medium.\u201d Exemplary recipient luminophoric mediums include layers having luminescent materials that are coated or sprayed directly onto a semiconductor light emitting device or on surfaces of the packaging thereof, and clear encapsulents (e.g., epoxy-based or silicone-based curable resin) that include luminescent materials that are arranged to partially or fully cover a semiconductor light emitting device. A recipient luminophoric medium may include one medium layer or the like in which one or more luminescent materials are mixed, multiple stacked layers or mediums, each of which may include one or more of the same or different luminescent materials, and\/or multiple spaced apart layers or mediums, each of which may include the same or different luminescent materials.","Pursuant to some embodiments of the present invention, light emitting devices are provided that include an LED and a recipient luminophoric medium that is configured to down-convert at least some of the light emitted by the LED.

In some embodiments, the radiation emitted by the second broad-spectrum luminescent material has a peak wavelength in the green color range and has a full-width-half-maximum emission bandwidth that extends into the cyan color range and\/or has a peak wavelength between 525 nm and 550 nm and has a full-width-half-maximum emission bandwidth that extends below 500 nm.

The design and fabrication of semiconductor light emitting devices are well known to those skilled in the art, and hence further description thereof will be omitted.","Visible light may include light having many different wavelengths. The apparent color of visible light can be illustrated with reference to a two-dimensional chromaticity diagram, such as the 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram illustrated in . Chromaticity diagrams provide a useful reference for defining colors as weighted sums of colors.","As shown in , colors on a 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram are defined by x and y coordinates (i.e., chromaticity coordinates, or color points) that fall within a generally U-shaped area. Colors on or near the outside of the area are saturated colors composed of light having a single wavelength, or a very small wavelength distribution. Colors on the interior of the area are unsaturated colors that are composed of a mixture of different wavelengths. White light, which can be a mixture of many different wavelengths, is generally found near the middle of the diagram, in the region labeled  in . There are many different hues of light that may be considered \u201cwhite,\u201d as evidenced by the size of the region . For example, some \u201cwhite\u201d light, such as light generated by sodium vapor lighting devices, may appear yellowish in color, while other \u201cwhite\u201d light, such as light generated by some fluorescent lighting devices, may appear more bluish in color.","It is further known that a binary combination of light from light sources emitting light of first and second colors may appear to have a different color than either of the two constituent colors. The color of the combined light may depend on the wavelengths and relative intensities of the two light sources. For example, light emitted by a combination of a blue source and a red source may appear purple or magenta to an observer. Similarly, light emitted by a combination of a blue source and a yellow source may appear white to an observer.","Each point in the graph of  is referred to as the \u201ccolor point\u201d of a light source that emits a light having that color. As shown in  a locus of color points that is referred to as the \u201cblack-body\u201d locus  exists which corresponds to the location of color points of light emitted by a black-body radiator that is heated to various temperatures. The black-body locus  is also referred to as the \u201cplanckian\u201d locus because the chromaticity coordinates (i.e., color points) that lie along the black-body locus obey Planck's equation: E(\u03bb)=A \u03bb\/(e\u22121), where E is the emission intensity, \u03bb is the emission wavelength, T is the color temperature of the black-body and A and B are constants. Color coordinates that lie on or near the black-body locus  yield pleasing white light to a human observer.","As a heated object becomes incandescent, it first glows reddish, then yellowish, and finally bluish with increasing temperature. This occurs because the wavelength associated with the peak radiation of the black-body radiator becomes progressively shorter with increased temperature, consistent with the Wien Displacement Law. Illuminants that produce light which is on or near the black-body locus  can thus be described in terms of their correlated color temperature (CCT). As used herein, the term \u201cwhite light\u201d refers to light that is perceived as white, is within 7 MacAdam ellipses of the black-body locus on a 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram, and has a CCT ranging from 2000K to 10,000K. White light with a CCT of 4000K may appear yellowish in color, while white light with a CCT of 8000K or more may appear more bluish in color, and may be referred to as \u201ccool\u201d white light. \u201cWarm\u201d white light may be used to describe white light with a CCT of between about 2500K and 4500K, which is more reddish or yellowish in color. Warm white light is generally a pleasing color to a human observer. Warm white light with a CCT of 2500K to 3300K may be preferred for certain applications.","The ability of a light source to accurately reproduce color in illuminated objects is typically characterized using the color rendering index (\u201cCRI\u201d). The CRI of a light source is a modified average of the relative measurements of how the color rendition of an illumination system compares to that of a reference black-body radiator when illuminating eight reference colors. Thus, the CRI is a relative measure of the shift in surface color of an object when lit by a particular lamp. The CRI equals 100 if the color coordinates of a set of test colors being illuminated by the illumination system are the same as the coordinates of the same test colors being irradiated by the black-body radiator. Daylight generally has a CRI of nearly 100, incandescent bulbs have a CRI of about 95, fluorescent lighting typically has a CRI of about 70 to 85, while monochromatic light sources have a CRI of essentially zero. Light sources for general illumination applications with a CRI of less than 50 are generally considered very poor and are typically only used in applications where economic issues preclude other alternatives. Light sources with a CRI value between 70 and 80 have application for general illumination where the colors of objects are not important. For some general interior illumination, a CRI value of greater than 80 is acceptable. A light source with color coordinates within 4 MacAdam step ellipses of the planckian locus  and a CRI value that exceeds 85 is more suitable for general illumination purposes. Light sources with CRI values of more than 90 provide greater color quality.","For backlight, general illumination and various other applications, it is often desirable to provide a lighting source that generates white light having a relatively high CRI, so that objects illuminated by the lighting source may appear to have more natural coloring to the human eye. Accordingly, such lighting sources may typically include an array of semiconductor lighting devices including red, green and blue light emitting devices. When red, green and blue light emitting devices are energized simultaneously, the resulting combined light may appear white, or nearly white, depending on the relative intensities of the red, green and blue sources. However, even light that is a combination of red, green and blue emitters may have a low CRI, particularly if the emitters generate saturated light, because such light may lack contributions from many visible wavelengths.","The present disclosure describes various recipient luminophoric mediums that have luminescent materials that have peak emission wavelengths in various color ranges. For purposes of this disclosure, the various color ranges described herein are defined as follows:","Blue color range=450-479 nm","Cyan color range=480-510 nm","Green color range=511-549 nm","Yellow\/Orange color range=550-604 nm","Red color range=605-700 nm","As noted above, a recipient luminophoric medium that includes, for example, a yellow phosphor, may be used in conjunction with a blue LED to provide a white light emitting device. Such a device typically emits cool white light that often has a lower CRI value. In order to increase the \u201cwarmth\u201d of the emitted white light and\/or to improve the CRI of the device, red phosphor particles may be added to the recipient luminophoric medium. Such red phosphors can be classified into two categories, namely stable and unstable phosphors. Generally speaking, the unstable phosphors are BOSE, sulfides and other non-nitride phosphors, while the stable red phosphors are nitride-based phosphors. The nitride-based red phosphors are typically characterized by broad emission spectrums (e.g., FWHM widths of greater than 80 nm) and relatively high peak wavelengths (e.g., between about 630 nm and about 660 nm).","The above-described nitride-based red phosphors may be used in conjunction with, for example, green or yellow phosphors and a blue LED to provide a warm white LED lamp that has a high CRI value, such as a CRI value that exceeds 90. However, such LEDs tend to be relatively inefficient. For example, typical conventional warm white LEDs (e.g., correlated color temperatures of between 2,700 K and 4,100 K) that have recipient luminophoric mediums that include the above-described nitride-based red phosphors may have, for example, a Lumen equivalent output of about 270-320 Lum\/W-Optical. As known to those of skill in the art, the \u201cLumen equivalent output\u201d or \u201cLumen Equivalent Ratio LER\u201d of a light emitting device refers to the number of Lumens of light output by the device, as perceived by the human eye, per Watt of optical power emitted by the light source.","Other nitride-based red phosphors are available that have lower peak wavelengths (e.g., between about 610 nm and about 629 nm) and generally narrower emission spectrum (e.g., FWHM widths of between 60 nm and 80 nm). Herein, phosphors or other luminescent materials that have FWHM widths of greater than 60 nm are referred to as \u201cbroad-spectrum\u201d phosphors or luminescent materials. Pursuant to embodiments of the present invention, it has been discovered that white LEDs having significantly improved Lumen equivalent outputs may be provided by using these lower wavelength (610 to 629 nm) broad-spectrum red phosphors in place of the above-described conventional broad-spectrum red phosphors that have higher wavelengths (630 to 660 nm) and typically broader emission spectra (FWHM widths that exceed 80 nm). In particular, the lower Lumen equivalent output of the above-described conventional warm white LEDs may in part be attributed to the high Stoke's shift of these devices (the Stoke's shift refers to the difference between the peak wavelength of the light absorbed by the phosphor and the peak wavelength of the light emitted by the phosphor). These high Stoke's shifts can limit the conversion efficiency of the red phosphor (i.e., the percentage of blue light that is absorbed by the phosphor that is actually converted to red light is relatively low), resulting in the decreased Lumen equivalent output. Additionally, the human eye does not perceive light well that has wavelengths that exceed about 630 or 640 nm, and hence light emitted in the higher portion of the red color range does not significantly contribute to the Lumen equivalent output of a device. As many conventional nitride-based red phosphors have peak wavelengths that exceed 630 or 640 nm, at least half of the emission spectrum of such phosphors provides little overall contribution to the Lumen equivalent output of a light emitting device that includes such phosphors.","By replacing the above-described conventional broad-spectrum red phosphors with red phosphors that have lower peak wavelengths and more compact emission spectra, the Stoke's shift can be reduced and the percentage of the emission spectra that is well-perceived by the human eye can be increased significantly. As a result, by switching to the 610 to 629 nm peak wavelength red phosphors, the Lumen equivalent output of a white LED that includes such phosphors can be increased by, for example, about 30%. Thus, using such a phosphor (along with, for example, a yellow phosphor and a blue LED), a warm white semiconductor light emitting device (e.g., correlated color temperature between 2,700 K and 4,100 K) may be provided that has an overall Lumen equivalent output of, for example, 350-360 Lum\/W-Optical or more.","Unfortunately, when a light emitting device that includes a blue LED and a recipient luminophoric medium that includes a conventional broad-spectrum red phosphor is modified to replace the conventional red phosphor with a lower peak wavelength red phosphor (i.e., one having a peak wavelength closer to the green color spectrum), the CRI of the light emitting device tends to be reduced due to the reduced contribution of spectral energy in the longer wavelength portions of the red color band. However, it has also been discovered that the CRI values of such a light emitting device can be partially or completely recovered by adding one or more \u201cnarrow-spectrum\u201d luminescent materials to the recipient luminophoric medium. Herein, a \u201cnarrow-spectrum\u201d luminescent material refers to a luminescent material that has an emission spectrum having a FWHM width of less than 60 nm. The addition of a narrow-spectrum luminescent material such as, for example, red quantum dots that have an emission spectrum with a peak wavelength of 618 nm and a FWHM width of about 30 nm may significantly increase the CRI value of the light emitting device without significantly degrading its Lumen equivalent output. Moreover, in some embodiments, the narrow-spectrum luminescent material may have an extremely compact emission spectrum such as, for example, an emission spectrum having a FWHM width of less than 20 nm. For example, f-to-f transition phosphors may have emission spectrum with FWHM widths of less than 10 nm. Herein narrow-spectrum luminescent materials that have emission spectrum with a FWHM width of less than 20 nm are referred to as \u201cline-emitter luminescent materials.\u201d","Thus, pursuant to some embodiments of the present invention, semiconductor light emitting devices are provided that emit warm white light having high CRI values with a relatively high Lumen equivalent output. In some embodiments, these light emitting devices may emit light having CRI values that exceed 90, and may have a color point that is within 7 MacAdam ellipses of the black-body locus on a 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram, a correlated color temperature of between about 2500 K and about 4500 K and a Lumen equivalent output of at least 350 Lum\/W-Optical. In other embodiments, semiconductor light emitting devices are provided that emit light having CRI values that exceed 90 and that have a color point that is between 0.385 and 0.485 ccx and 0.380 and 0.435 ccy on the 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram, a correlated color temperature of between about 2500 K and about 4500 K and a Lumen equivalent output of at least 350 Lum\/W-Optical. As noted above, the semiconductor light emitting devices according to embodiments of the present invention may achieve these high CRI and Lumen equivalent output values while providing warm white light.","Example embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed with reference to .  is a graph illustrating the intensity of the radiation emitted by a conventional semiconductor light emitting device which is provided for comparative purposes.  is a graph illustrating the simulated intensity of the radiation emitted by semiconductor light emitting devices according to certain embodiments of the present invention.  is a graph illustrating the intensity of the radiation emitted by another semiconductor light emitting device which may be modified according to embodiments of the present invention to exhibit improved performance.","Turning first to , it can be seen that the simulated emission spectrum (curve ) for the conventional semiconductor light emitting device has a first peak in the blue color range and a second peak that extends across the green, yellow\/orange and red color ranges. The simulation used to generate curve  in  assumed that the semiconductor light emitting device included a blue LED having a peak wavelength of about 460 nm and a recipient luminophoric medium that included a mixture of yellow [YAG:Ce] and red [(CaSr)SiAlN:Eu] phosphor particles (herein semiconductor light emitting devices that include recipient luminophoric mediums that include both a yellow phosphor or other luminescent material and a red phosphor or other luminescent material are referred to as \u201cyellow\/red phosphor\u201d devices). The relative amounts of the yellow and red phosphors were selected to provide a light emitting device having a correlated color temperature of 3,000 K. As can be seen in , the blue light emitted by the LED that passes through the recipient luminophoric medium without conversion generates a narrow peak in the emission spectrum at 460 nm, and the blue light that is converted by the phosphors to yellow, orange or red light generates a broad peak in the emission spectrum that is centered at about 610 nm.","A second curve  is also superimposed on the graph of . Curve  illustrates the response of the human eye to light emitted at each wavelength across the visible spectrum. As shown in curve , this response peaks at about 555 nm (which is about at the intersection of the green and yellow color ranges), and drops off relatively quickly in both directions from this peak. As shown in , a significant portion of the broad peak of curve  falls at wavelengths where the response of the human eye to light is relatively low. As a result, the light that is emitted at such wavelengths provides relatively little contribution to the Lumen equivalent output of the device.","We next turn to , which is a graph having a curve  that illustrates the simulated intensity of the radiation emitted by a yellow\/red phosphor semiconductor light emitting device according to certain embodiments of the present invention. The device that was simulated to generate curve  comprises a blue LED (peak wavelength of 460 nm) that has a recipient luminophoric medium that is similar to the recipient luminophoric medium included in the device simulated in curve  of . However, 25% of the (CaSr)SiAlN:Eu red phosphor that was included in the device used to generate curve  of  was replaced with a narrow-spectrum red luminescent material (which could be, for example, a Y2O2S:Eu3+, (Y,M)VO4:Eu3+, Cd(Se,S) or Zn(Se,S) quantum dots an \u201cf-to-f transition\u201d phosphor or a transition metal such as Mn2+) in order to generate curve  of .","As shown in , the emission spectrum (curve ) of the red\/yellow phosphor semiconductor light emitting device according to embodiments of the present invention has one broad peak, two substantial narrow peaks, and several additional small narrow peaks. In particular, the emission spectrum has a first narrow peak at about 460 nm that results from the unconverted blue light emitted by the LED, a second lower and broader peak that extends across the green, yellow, and much of the red color ranges, and a third narrow peak at about 620 nm that reflects the emission of the narrow-spectrum f-to-f phosphor. Curve  on the graph of  once again illustrates the response of the human eye to light emitted at each wavelength across the visible spectrum. As shown in , the emission spectrum of curve  better falls within the human eye response represented by curve , and hence the device with the emission spectrum of curve  may have an improved Lumen equivalent output.","The conventional yellow\/red phosphor semiconductor light emitting device that was used to generate curve  on the graph of  has a simulated Lumen equivalent output of 322 Lum\/W-Optical and a simulated CRI of 80.1. In contrast, the yellow\/red phosphor device according to embodiments of the present invention that was used to generate curve  on the graph of  has a simulated Lumen equivalent output of 330 Lum\/W-Optical and a CRI of 90. These simulations demonstrate that yellow\/red phosphor semiconductor light emitting device according to embodiments of the present invention may provide both improved light output and color rendering as compared to conventional yellow\/red phosphor semiconductor light emitting devices.","Single-die semiconductor light emitting devices are also currently available that comprise an LED that emits radiation having a peak wavelength in the blue color range and a recipient luminophoric medium that includes a mixture of green and red phosphor particles. These conventional devices may produce warm white light having a significantly higher CRI values such as, for example, CRI values between 84-94. Herein, single-die semiconductor light emitting devices that include recipient luminophoric mediums that include both green and red phosphors (or other luminescent materials) are referred to as \u201cgreen\/red phosphor\u201d devices. While intuitively it might appear that green\/red phosphor devices would also exhibit high Lumen equivalent output values, a higher ratio of red-to-green phosphor particles is required to design a green\/red phosphor device that has a warm white color point than is the ratio of red-to-yellow phosphor particles that is required to design a yellow\/red phosphor device having the same warm white color point. As the Lumen equivalent output of the light emitted in the red color range is significantly lower than the Lumen equivalent output of light emitted in the yellow or green color ranges, the larger amount of the emission that is in the red color range in the green\/red phosphor device (due to the higher percentage of red phosphor particles) may result in a significantly lower Lumen equivalent output for green\/red devices (e.g., 25-30% or more) as compared to comparable yellow\/red phosphor devices. Thus, while green\/red phosphor devices may provide high CRI values, they tend to exhibit relatively poor Lumen equivalent outputs.","In order to provide semiconductor light emitting devices having relatively high CRI values with less reduction in Lumen equivalent output, \u201cgreen\/yellow\/red phosphor devices\u201d have been proposed that include, for example, a blue LED and a recipient luminophoric medium that includes a mixture of broad-spectrum green, yellow and red phosphor particles (or other luminescent materials). Such green\/yellow\/red phosphor devices are disclosed, for example, in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

In some embodiments of these devices, the yellow luminescent material may comprise a YAG:Ce phosphor and the red luminescent material may comprise a (CaSr)SiAlN:Eu red phosphor (or Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+). The green luminescent material may comprise a broad-spectrum luminescent material that has a FWHM emission spectrum that falls into at least part of the cyan color range. In some embodiments, the green luminescent material may comprise a LuAG:Ce phosphor (i.e., cerium doped LuAG), and may have a peak emission wavelength of between 535 and 545 nm, and a FWHM bandwidth of between about 110-115 nm. As such, the FWHM bandwidth of LuAG:Ce phosphors may extend across the entire cyan color range.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["24","25","26","24","25","26","26"]},"Pursuant to further embodiments of the present invention, green\/yellow\/red phosphor semiconductor light emitting devices may be provided that replace some of the broad-spectrum red phosphor that was included in the devices that were used to generate curves - in the graph of  with a narrow-spectrum red luminescent material such as, for example Y2O2S:Eu3+ or Cd(Se,S) or Zn(Se,S) quantum dots.

In this embodiment, the narrow-spectrum cyan luminescent material is added in order to reduce the amount of the broad-spectrum green luminescent material included in the recipient luminophoric medium. The narrow-spectrum cyan luminescent material may provide a device having an improved CRI value, as it can more effectively fill in the gap in the emission spectrum in the cyan region than can the broad-spectrum green luminescent material.

One such process for applying the recipient luminophoric medium will now be discussed with respect to . In this embodiment, each LED chip  is a vertically-structured device that is formed on a substrate  and that has a top contact  and a bottom contact .","Referring to , two LED chips  are shown at a wafer level of their fabrication process. In this particular embodiment, the top contact  is a p-type contact and the bottom contact  is an n-type contact. In other embodiments, the contacts ,  may be arranged differently.","As shown in , a conductive contact pedestal  is formed on the top contact  that is utilized to make electrical contact to the p-type contact  after the LED chips  are coated with a recipient luminophoric medium. The pedestal  can be formed of many different electrically conductive materials and can be formed using many different known physical or chemical deposition processes such as electroplating, mask deposition (e-beam, sputtering), electroless plating, or stud bumping. The pedestal  should extend to or above the top surface of a recipient luminophoric medium that is deposited in a later step.","As shown in , the wafer is blanketed by a recipient luminophoric medium coating  that covers the LED chips , the contacts , and the pedestals . The coating  may comprise a binder and of luminescent materials. The luminescent materials may comprise, for example, the luminescent material combinations discussed above according to embodiments of the present invention. The binder may be a material that is robust after curing and substantially transparent in the visible wavelength spectrum such as, for example, a silicone, epoxy, glass, inorganic glass, spin-on glass, dielectrics, BCB, polymides, polymers and the like. The recipient luminophoric medium coating  can be applied using different processes such as spin coating, dispensing, electrophoretic deposition, electrostatic deposition, printing, jet printing or screen printing. Another suitable coating technique is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/717,048, filed Mar. 3, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The recipient luminophoric medium coating  can be cured using any appropriate curing method (e.g., heat, ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) or air curing).","The coating  can also have different concentrations or loading of luminescent materials in the binder, with a typical concentration being in range of 30-70% by weight. The coating  can comprise multiple layers of different concentrations or types of luminescent materials, and the multiple layers can include different binder materials. One or more of the layers can be provided without luminescent materials. For example, a first coat of clear silicone can be deposited followed by phosphor loaded layers. As another example, the coating may comprise, for example, a three layer coating that includes a first layer having a first luminescent material with a peak wavelength in the green color range that is coated directly on the LED chips , a second layer having a second luminescent material with a peak wavelength in the yellow color range that is coated directly on the first layer, and a third layer having a third luminescent material with a peak wavelength in the red color range that is coated directly on the second phosphor. Numerous other layer structures are possible, including multi-layers that include multiple luminescent materials in the same layer. Intervening layers or elements could also be provided between layers and\/or between the coating and the underlying LED chips .","As shown in , after the recipient luminophoric medium coating  is coated onto the LED chips , the coating  is thinned or planarized to expose the pedestals . Based on the operating characteristics of the LEDs  and the properties of the luminescent materials used, the end thickness of the coating  can be calculated to reach a desired color point\/range and still expose the pedestals . The thickness of the coating  can be uniform or non-uniform across the wafer.","As shown in , the individual LED chips  can thereafter be singulated from the wafer using known methods. Following singulation of the LED chips , a layer of coating  remains on the side surfaces of the LEDs  and light emitting from the side surfaces of the LEDs  also passes through the coating  and its luminescent materials. This results in conversion of at least some of the side emitting light, which can provide LED chips  having more consistent light emitting characteristics at different viewing angles.","The recipient luminophoric mediums according to embodiments of the present invention may also be applied to a light emitting device while the light emitting device is exposed to a curing agent. The curing agent may be, for example, heat, radiation, a material that is present on or in the light emitting device, or other agents that speed up the curing of the recipient luminophoric medium.","Reference is now made to , which is a flow diagram illustrating operations for applying a recipient luminophoric medium onto a light emitting device where heat is applied as a curing agent during the application of the recipient luminophoric medium.

In some embodiments, the light emitting device may be heated and then subsequently processed after the heating operation(s), while in other embodiments, heat may be provided throughout the subsequently described operations. In some embodiments, the light emitting device may be heated by turning on the light emitting device and driving it at a sufficiently high current to generate the necessary heat. However, in many cases it would be necessary to drive the light emitting device at currents that exceed the current rating for the device, so external heat sources may be desired in most situations. In some embodiments, the light emitting device may be heated to a temperature in a range of about 90 degrees Celsius to about 155 degrees Celsius.","A recipient luminophoric medium is applied to the heated light emitting device (block ).

The atomized luminescent solution may be sprayed or otherwise deposited onto the heated light emitting device using the flow of pressurized gas.","In some embodiments, multiple layers may be applied to the light emitting device to form the recipient luminophoric medium. These layers may or may not be the same, and may or may not the same luminescent materials.
