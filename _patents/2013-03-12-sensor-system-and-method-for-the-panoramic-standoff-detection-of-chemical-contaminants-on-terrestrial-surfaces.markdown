Technical Field","The embodiments herein generally relate to chemical detection technology, and more particularly to chemical imaging of suspect chemically contaminated surfaces and standoff detection of subject chemical contaminants.","2. Description of the Related Art","A variety of systems and methods have been developed and used to detect and identify hazardous chemical and biological threat agents in the field. Chemical test kits that employ chemically reactive vapor-samplers and detection papers have long been used to detect chemical nerve agents, blood agents, and blister agents. While chemical kits are generally useful, they are designed to detect a limited range of conventional chemical agents that are toxic in the range of 10g\/person, provide no standoff protection, and may be prone to false negative and positive detections.","Systems that employ Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) in which molecules are ionized and separated according to their differences in velocities through a gas in the presence of an electric field can, in theory, identify and detect a wide variety of chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents. IMS systems, however, require direct exposure to the chemical agent and the instruments typically have insufficient resolving power to identify CBW agents before they have reached casualty producing levels.","Other systems employ passive infrared (PIR) imaging to detect airborne chemical threats such as nerve (GA, GB, and GD) and blister (H and L) agents based on the infrared spectrum of the agent. Currently fielded devices have been reported to detect aerosols at a distance of up to 5 km. Practical PIR detection systems have difficulty detecting low levels of CBW surface target contaminants because the surfaces are typically at thermal equilibrium and provide insufficient contrast to identify target contaminants. Additionally, background radiation and interference encountered in the field can also make detection difficult.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,241,179; 5,708,503; 6,464,392; 6,731,804; 7,038,789, and 7,262,414, the complete disclosures of which, in their entireties, are herein incorporated by reference, provide technologies for chemical threat detection. However, as threats continue to become more sophisticated, enhanced techniques are needed to provide suitable detection capabilities.","The U.S. military seeks, develops, and tests promising technologies capable of solving complex tactical standoff detection problems at a safe range. Scenarios of interest include chemical warfare agents (CWAs) in vapor\/aerosol forms released into the open atmosphere vis-\u00e0-vis ordinance discharge, and surface contamination resulting from deposition and settling of the aerosol mass onto\/into porous soil, sand, roads, bridges, etc. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to develop a sensor applied specifically to these problems.","In view of the foregoing, the embodiments herein provide a pseudo-active chemical imaging sensor including irradiative transient heating, temperature nonequilibrium thermal luminescence spectroscopy, differential hyperspectral imaging, and artificial neural network technologies integrated together. The sensor may be applied to the terrestrial chemical contamination problem, where the interstitial contaminant compounds of detection interest (analytes) comprise liquid chemical warfare agents, their various derivative condensed phase compounds, and other material of a life-threatening nature. The sensor measures and processes a dynamic pattern of absorptive-emissive middle infrared molecular signature spectra of subject analytes to perform its chemical imaging and standoff detection functions successfully.","A chemical imaging sensor is provided for detecting and imaging chemical contaminants comprising analytes, the sensor comprising a first component that performs irradiative transient heating; a second component that performs temperature nonequilibrium thermal luminescence spectroscopy; a third component that performs differential hyperspectral imaging; and a fourth component that performs artificial neural networking, wherein the first, second, third, and fourth component combine to measure and process a dynamic pattern of absorptive-emissive middle infrared molecular signature spectra of the analytes.","The sensor further comprises a spectroradiometer receiver; and a laser transmitter comprising a waveguide laser emitting a linearly-polarized continuous-wave (cw) beam in a stable transverse electromagnetic wave spatial mode comprising energy that is absorbing to the chemical contaminants and lies outside an optical bandwidth of the spectroradiometer receiver.

The spectroradiometer receiver further comprises a collector optic component group comprising a plurality of hyperboloid mirrors. The spectroradiometer receiver further comprises a Schwarzschild objective collimator optics component group comprising a plurality of spherical mirrors.","The spectroradiometer receiver further comprises a stress-solid-state interferometer comprising front and back linear polarizers sandwiching a virtual stack phased-array (VSPA) bar photoelastic modulation (PEM), wherein the VSPA bar PEM comprises a single stress-birefringence ZnSe crystal having an array of ultrasonic-frequency piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) bonded across a length of the crystal, and wherein the VSPA bar PEM is activated by the PZTs generating interferograms at ultrahigh-speed on collimated panoramic field-of-view light incoming from the Schwarzschild objective collimator optics component group collected by the collector optic component group.

It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.","The embodiments herein provide a pseudo-active chemical imaging sensor including irradiative transient heating, temperature nonequilibrium thermal luminescence spectroscopy, differential hyperspectral imaging, and artificial neural network technologies integrated together. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to  through , where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.","As mentioned, it would be advantageous to develop a sensor applied specifically to the various scenarios of interest described. The embodiments herein provide a sensor and technique to address this need. The development of the sensor provided by the embodiments herein initially involves conducting a phenomenological study of the CWA's atmospheric and\/or surface environments, the mechanisms of analyte mass transportation, and the principles of analyte mass detection; i.e., light-matter interactions. This involves using a panoramic-imaging spectroradiometer (PANSPEC) system more specifically, a middle infrared (MIR) PANSPEC chemical cloud-imaging model (PCCM), which is further described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,708,503 and 7,038,789, the complete disclosures of which, in their entireties, are herein incorporated by reference. Various aspects of the PCCM and its concept of use are set forth as follows.","The PCCM prescribes collecting ambient MIR radiance stared at over its panoramic field-of-view (PFOV) object space consisting of the open atmosphere, collimating that radiance into a tight beam sent through an ultrahigh-speed (UHS) no moving parts solid-state interferometer, and imaging the interferometer exitance beam onto an image space occupied by a focal plane array (FPA) of n\u00d7n HgCdTe detector elements. Streaming ninterferogram voltage waveforms output by the FPA are digitized via high-speed electronics and converted into MIR spectral frames, which are subsequently mined for MIR molecular vibration\/vibration-rotation resonance bands whose structure (frequencies and amplitudes of bands) correlate to the subject analyte mass (cloud's toxic chemical vapor\/aerosol constituents) one-to-one. Expert artificial neural network (ANN) pattern recognition algorithms perform the spectral mining task.","The ANN recognizes signature molecular vibration\/vibration-rotation bands of the analyte alternating between negative- and positive-parity amplitudes in difference-spectra, where parity is in reference to the baseline of difference-spectrum measurements. Negative-parity of spectral bands represent MIR radiance passed through the absorbing cloud and stimulating the analytes' molecular vibration\/vibration-rotation states, and positive-parity of spectral bands represent those excited molecules returned to lower energy levels vis-\u00e0-vis Kirchoff's radiation law: good absorbers are good infrared emitters. Amplitudes of the \u00b1 molecular resonance bands change in relation to capacity of the analyte to gain heat via absorption of background solar radiance and lose heat by MIR emissions. Moreover, frequencies (energies) of molecular resonance bands are invariant as long as there is no dissociation amongst the molecular analytes' due to photofragmentation and\/or chemical reactions. This facilitates the ANN algorithm locking into consistent detection metrics.","Accordingly, the PCCM conducts its aerosol\/vapor chemical imaging and tracking steps as follows:","Step 1: Data Acquisition, Preprocessing, and Formatting","The UHS solid-state interferometer of the PCCM incorporates front and back linear-polarizer optics sandwiching three nearly identical stress-birefringence single-window photoelastic modulators (PEMs) generating transient hyperspectral images in the following context. First, a beam of radiance collected then collimated from the PCCM panorama (iPFOV-beam) is incident to the interferometer. The iPFOV-beam in its ambient random polarization state transforms to a linear-polarization state (lpPFOV-beam) on transmission through the front linear-polarizer optic. Second, the polarization axis of the lpPFOV-beam is oriented precisely 45\u00b0 to the birefringence optical axis of the first birefringence ZnSe window element of the interferometer. Third, all three ZnSe window PEM elements of the interferometer with bonded with piezoelectric transductions (PZTs) are cyclically compressed-relaxed at their natural mechanical resonance frequency \u03bd\u02dc30 kHz (UHS designation), thereby transforming the lpPFOV-beam entering the 3-PEM crystals array into a polarization-modulation beam exiting that array (pmPFOV-beam). Fourth, the pmPFOV-beam transforms into an intensity-modulation beam (imPFOV-beam) upon transmission through the back linear-polarizer optic of the interferometer. Filth, a refractive lens elements group images the imPFOV-beam onto the FPA; the latter matched in size to panorama of PCCM. Sixth, electronic preamplification then digitization operators act simultaneously on nvoltage waveform outputs from the FPA (these waveforms were previously called interferograms) produced at the rate of 4\u03bd(2\u03bdif the zero-retardation points of ZnSe PEM retarders double in retardation amplitude). Seventh, the latter streaming interferogram data strings are algorithmically time-stamped, grouped, co-added in groups of tens-to-hundreds producing sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, averaged, and fast Fourier transformed into running MIR spectra (S). Eighth, contiguous Sare subtracted and cast into data set {dS}={S\u2212S\u2200r=2, 3, . . . s}, where Sis the final spectrum measured over the end PZT runtime period of the interferometer. Ninth, the family of curves in {dS} transforms into a differential-hyperspectral imaging map (DHIM)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":",","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"}},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"dS","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"v","mo":",","mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":";","msub":{"mi":"\u03c9","mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}}}}}}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":"i,j ","sup":"2 "},"Step 2: Data Filtration",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"img":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.79mm","file":"US09322768-20160426-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002","he":"3.56mm","wi":"7.37mm","file":"US09322768-20160426-P00002.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.46mm","file":"US09322768-20160426-P00003.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004","he":"3.13mm","wi":"3.56mm","file":"US09322768-20160426-P00004.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}]},"Step 3: Pattern Recognition","Filtered  is preprocessed, formatted, multiplexed in affined slices of dS(\u03c5; t; \u03c9i,j), and then feed-forwarded through an ANN whose architecture accommodates the DHIM data structure. The former preprocessing algorithms comprise linear baseline correction, negative-to-positive spectra parity conversion, normalization, and data formatting operators. The latter ANN processor is a supervised-learning, backward-error propagation (\u201cback prop\u201d) pattern recognition operator trained, tested, and validated against the spectrum detection metrics of known analyte(s), which is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,469, the complete disclosure of which, in its entirety, is herein incorporated by reference.","Step 4: Chemical Imaging Spectroscopy and Analyte Detection","Chemical imaging spectroscopy and analyte standoff detection are functions performed by the PCCM in which positive detection ANN events from step 3 are superimposed on the DHIM from steps 1-2.","Conventional vapor\/aerosol standoff detection modeling efforts may be applicable to the surface contamination problem of chemical defense interest; namely, standoff surveillance of chemically contaminated terrain (CCT) in the battlefield. This tactical field scenario typically presents itself as a final fate of launched-then-detonated CWA ordinance whose payload comprises incapacitating and ultimately lethal nerve agent compounds such as VX (in the organophosphonothiolate class) and blister agent compounds such as Lewisite (in the organoarsenic class), their derivatives (molecular group substitutions), and thickened CWAs of such. On detonation of an ordinance shell its liquid payload disperses as a remnant CWA rain (large-sized droplets) that settle on land below the detonation locus, and as a remnant CWA aerosol cloud (lesser-sized droplets) that are transported by air currents to settle on a downwind surface area swath. Powdered and aerosolized biological warfare agent ordinance payloads present similar if not more potent threats.","The embodiments herein provide a PANSPEC surface contamination model (PSCSM) that overcomes the problems described above using, for example, coupled temperature nonequilibrium phenomena and thermal luminescence (TL) spectroscopy, including technologies described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,241,179, 6,464,392, and 7,262,414, the complete disclosures of which, in their entireties, are herein incorporated by reference. PSCSM and PCCM are similar, with the former encompassing several enhancements and additions including: a virtual stack phased-array (VSPA) interferometer for producing high-resolution DHIMs in very short timeframes (milliseconds); a directed laser transmitter for rapidly pumping TL fluxes from suspect CCT; a modified MIR imager re-optimized for clear demagnified imagery; an unsupervised self-organization map (SOM) pattern recognition and clustering algorithm for deciding on presence\/absence of the CWA surface contaminants; and other modifications.","The unsupervised SOM ANN implements reinforcement competitive learning via a topology-preserving nonlinear clustering map algorithm that passes DHIM data (steps 1 and 2) from its input space of linear nodes (also called processing elements or neurons) onto its output space of latticed nodes. Locations of the neurons so tuned on the discretized output space lattice are \u2018winning neurons\u2019: they form the topological map. In accordance with the embodiments herein, the algorithm adjusts weights as \u201cdistances\u201d computed between exemplars in a 208-D linear input space representing 208 coordinates of dS(\u03c5) of 2 cmresolution, to \u201ccodebook vectors\u201d organized in a 2-D discretized output space where clustering of the CWA surface contaminant analyte is most readily visualized and interpreted (steps 3 and 4). The ability to cluster is a manifestation of the molecular vibration resonance moieties (identification cues) of analyte inherited in dS(\u03c5) measurements (steps 2-3). The molecular species of CWAs possessing strong fingerprint spectra that are unknown or unavailable, such as derivative CWA compounds that may have equal or greater toxicity then their parent, are subject to clustering. Clustering is the sole requirement of CWA standoff detection; an extraordinary capability for detecting both known and unknown analytes.","TLS Surface Contamination Detection","Irradiative transient heating (ITH) is the transfer of energy to and from a body by means of absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation. ITH conveys TL fluxes generated, acquired, and analyzed accordingly: boost the suspect CCT into temperature nonequilibrium via irradiation from, for instance, a 0.102 eV photon energy (also 826 cmspectroscopy units \u03c5, and 12.1 \u03bcm wavelength units \u03bb)COlaser beam (iPM-beam); interferometrically process the concomitant CCT-to-ambient TL flux radiance (step 1 above); transform these data into a hyperspectral data cube  (steps 2-3 above); and mine  for the subject analytes' signature molecular vibration\/vibration-rotation bands (step 4 above).","The Gaussian iPM-beam heating source exhibits strong absorption cross-section \u03a0(\u03bd) defined as the ratio of the amount of field energy removed from the iPM-beam into the CCT material to the beam's total incident energy \u03c5=826 cm. Here, \u03c5 lies just outside the 833.3-1250.0 cmbandwidth of spectroradiometer measuring TL fluxes, thus identifying TLS standoff detection technology as pseudo-active. If the iPM-beam energy were tuned inside 833.3-1250.0 cm cm, then a blinding scattered-beam radiance corona flushes the weak molecular absorptive-emissive resonance bands spectral features carried in the liberated TL fluxes. Moreover, the iPM-beam is preferably polarization-modulated since absorption cross section (\u03a0) is slightly polarization (P) and polarization-modulation ({dot over (P)}) dependent. This phenomenon was observed in experiments, where iPM-beam irradiated CCT at {dot over (P)}=32 kHz in comparison to {dot over (P)}=0 (fixed linear-polarization laser beam) boosts TL flux radiance by approximately 5%, which is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,241,179, the complete disclosure of which, in its entirety, is herein incorporated by reference. That implies preferential absorption in the CCT medium by the iPM-beam's swept continuum of (+\/\u2212) linear-elliptical-circular polarization states, with the desirable effect of increasing  in DHIMs (step 2 above). One can exploit the polarization-modulated beam absorption cause and thermal luminescence fluxes TL({dot over (P)}) effect relationship of ITH by sweeping at various values and discerning one or more frequencies of modulation causing TL({dot over (P)}) to peak. For example, one may conduct an optimization experiment whereby dS are measured (step 1 above) for an iPM-beam of {dot over (P)}=0, (constant linear or random polarization) and {dot over (P)}=10(swept polarization states per s) in {dot over (P)} steps of 1 kHz. Analyses of  (step 4 above) as a function of {dot over (P)} may provide clues toward understanding the \u03a0(\u03bb,P;{dot over (P)}) mechanism and help establish optimum design parameters for the sensor of . Finally, the iPM-beam is dither-stabilized in the spatial transverse electromagnetic wave mode TEM(uniform disk intensity), and that intensity pumps adequate TL fluxes for detection purposes yet below what would cause the CCT to char or burn; 10-50 Wcmis typical for TLS standoff detection at ranges of 5-20 m, respectively.","The iPM-beam pumping of TL fluxes from the CCT (a composite inhomogeneous dielectric medium comprising of strata and contaminant boundary layers randomly distributed) stimulates a pattern of closely associated surface temperature gradients (\u2207T) and emissivity contrasts (\u2202\u2208\/\u2202T) evolving between the CCT's dissimilar dielectric layers. These \u2207T and \u2202\u2208\/\u2202T thermodynamic events rise in phase with each other upon incident iPM-beam exposure, continue to build then peak at some iPM-beam irradiation time (t) when the CCT is in its most advanced thermal nonequilibrium state, and decline toward a near null as the CCT returns to thermal pseudo-equilibrium at elevated temperature with a small temperature oscillation. They can be tracked by a PSCSM-based system measuring a family of graybody emissions spectra G(T, \u03c5, t); emissivity; \u2208=1 for a perfect Planck blackbody object, 0\u2266\u2208<1 for terrestrial graybody objects, increasing in amplitudes and up-shifting in frequencies during ITH), which is further described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,241,179, 6,464,392, and 6,731,804, the complete disclosures of which, in their entireties, are herein incorporated by reference. The period of iPM-beam irradiation in the \u2202G(T, \u03c5, t)\/\u2202\u03c5\u2202t|=0 neighborhood is referred to as a \u2018detection window of opportunity\u2019 (WDO) wherein \u2207T and \u2202\u2208\/\u2202T have peaked. The intelligent PSCSM-based prototype system monitors WDO conditions and collects  data within the WDO via two logical modes of operations: a \u2018background mode\u2019 continually measuring G(T, \u03c5, t; \u03c9) [assume dS(\u03c5; t; \u03c9)=dG(\u03c5; T(t); \u03c9)], and a chemical imaging mode producing DHIMs gated inside the WDO (steps 1-4 above). For example, in a tactical field maneuver the deployed PSCSM-based sensor chemically images interstitial layers of nerve CWA VX=O-ethyl S-[2(diisopropylamino)ethyl]methyl phosphonothioate wetting sand, or any lossy, solid, inhomogeneous dielectric medium. VX is a high viscosity, nonvolatile, extremely toxic liquid with motor oil-like rheology outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Generally, VX serves only one purpose, as a weapon of mass destruction. The sensor must separate weak yet sharp molecular resonance bands of VX (a P\u2014CHrocking normal mode of motion at energy 894 cmand a P\u2014O\u2014C stretching normal mode of motion at energy 1036 cm) from the dominant, broad, and ubiquitous Restrahlen emission band of sand.","TL radiometric spectral band signal intensities (I) of DMMP, DIMP, and SF96 can be observed at approximately the 5 parts per thousand level in reference to the broadband Restrahlen emission band intensity (ICCT); i.e., I\/I\u02dc0.005. Iis superimposed on Iover the entire temporal window of observation (Iis the carrier of I), however, spectral bands of the analyte in Iare observable only in the short WDO timeframe. It can be concluded from these experiments that boosting  by orders of magnitude is necessary for producing viable CCT standoff detection DHIMs (step 4 above). Ergo, a very high rate of interferogram data acquisition (\u0398 in interferograms per second) is helpful, as S\/N is proportional to the number of co-added interferograms to the \u00bd power. An interferometer operating at \u0398greater than or about the WDO timeframe has a low probability of detecting and resolving the transitioning absorption-emission spectral bands of analytes in  (step 1 above). If \u0398is approximately in the range of half to a tenth of the WDO timeframe, then the analyte's transitioning absorption-emission molecular resonance bands of opposite amplitudes can average and null in the dG(T, \u03c5, t contained in the WDO; \u03c9) measurement. Therefore, the interferometer should acquire data in timeframe \u0398<<WDO capturing the absorption-emission bands transients of analyte with adequate temporal resolution.","Continuing constant-intensity iPM-beam irradiation beyond the WDO eventually brings the VX-sand medium back to thermal pseudo-equilibrium at elevated temperature, whereupon \u2207T and \u2202\u2208\/\u2202T had already collapsed and the detection metric of VX sank into a noise abyss of dG(T, \u03c5, t>t), whereby tis the WDO closure time set by the PSCSM-based prototype system running in its background mode detecting sufficiently small threshold values of \u2207T and \u2202\u2208\/\u2202T.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["200","200","205","210","215","220","205","220"]},"PSCSM Transmitter and Zonal ITH:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","200","15","20","25","30","35","40","45","50","15","25","35","40"],"sup":"14","sub":["2 ","00 ","t"]},"The iPM-beam  is polarization-modulated at {dot over (P)}=\u03bdwhen traversed through PEM  (45\u00b0 alignment between the linear polarization axis of the beam output by the laser  and the birefringence axis of the PEM  is assumed for full polarization-modulation of the beam ).

There is some control over the J-parameter, as it depends on energy, intensity, and polarization-modulation states of the iPM-beam . Also, \u03c4is usually modeled from standard atmospheric transmission programs like HITRAN, however, it is set to unity for the relatively low detection ranges of a tactical defense system (TDS)  (of ).

There are nuances of design selection to consider here: increasing (decreasing) EP size increases (decreases) effective focal length thereby increasing (decreasing) FPA image size; NA rarely exceeds 0.5 in practical optical systems; and tis theoretically limited to a maximum value of 0.25. The third bracket of Equation (4) is a figure of merit of the liquid nitrogen cooled FPA called Detectivity (D* in units of mHzW). D* equates to reciprocal noise equivalent power normalized to 8-12 \u03bcm optical spectral bandwidth of the spectroradiometer.
