{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a Continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent Office application Ser. No. 12\/214,302, entitled \u201cNOISE CORRELATION RADAR DEVICES AND METHODS FOR DETECTING TARGETS WITH NOISE CORRELATION RADAR,\u201d filed by the same inventor on Jun. 5, 2008 and which is about to be abandoned.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment by the Government of any royalties thereon.","The present invention pertains generally to radar systems and methods. More particularly, the present invention pertains to surveillance target detection with noise correlation radar.","Radar has a long history of use for military and law enforcement target detection. Due to the very nature of many military and law enforcement missions, the radar user may frequently be exposed to dangerous conditions. There are two types of conventional noise radar systems that are currently available and widely used. One is the ultra wideband band (UWB) noise radar, and the other type is the pulsed noise radar. Each type of radar offers different advantages.","To date, there has been extensive developmental work done with the random signal, UWB, and pulsed waveforms, and each waveform provides certain performance advantages, but they also suffer from a number of drawbacks, disadvantages, and limitations of their waveform characteristics.","The main advantage with the random signal waveform is that this waveform masks its modulated signal characteristics with noise characteristics so that the signal seems to be a channel that is common to all communications systems. Of course, the modulated signal also has a specific structure that can only be deciphered by its intended receiver.","In general, noise radar possess an inherently non-deterministic signal structure that affords a certain level of protection against non-intended, second party receivers. Furthermore, using UWB technology with noise radar offers additional levels of protection since users of such systems can reduce the overall transmit energy during radiation intervals. UWB noise radar requires optical delay lines or matched-filter banks to laboriously assess the presence of a target in each range gate, which is a very time-consuming and cumbersome process that can lead to stale target information.","The UWB waveform also suffers from a few disadvantages and shortcomings. For example, a large number of the UWB noise radar systems implement a linear frequency modulated continuous wave transmit signal. In its most primitive form, a continuous wave signal can be represented by a pure sinusoid, which, when transformed in the frequency domain, results in a discrete frequency response centered about its carrier frequency. However, centering the response on the carrier frequency sacrifices a high resolution capability, which oftentimes results in the inability to resolve reflected signal components subject to channel fading, and so on. Other difficulties with the continuous wave signal are the complex hardware requirements associated with transmit\/receive isolation and separate transmit-receive entities, the need for phase detectors to extract the target range, and the inability to use a multi-channel array. Similarly, the pulsed waveform also suffers from the fact that they impose a high transmit power requirement on their amplifiers. This suggests that more expensive, stable amplifiers are mandatory in order for pulsed waveform implementations to work properly.","Moreover, the typical military and law enforcement mission frequently includes critical security and surveillance requirements that can make unwanted detection both undesirable and dangerous, and the prior art radar arrangements oftentimes fail to satisfy those critical requirements. Thus there has been a long-felt need for a radar signal generation apparatus that overcomes the extensive, costly, and time-consuming hardware disadvantages of prior art systems such as optical delay lines and matched-filter banks, as well as the waveform shortcomings of centering the carrier frequency response and the risks of unwanted detection during extended range surveillance operations.","The concept of noise radar was first introduced in the 1950s by B. M. Horton where challenges surrounding his proposal were predominately due to hardware requirements needed for such a system to work affectively [1]. Due to modem hardware advances, the novelty of noise radar has begun to generate some recent interest. In fact, there has been a reemergence in research focused on using noise as an RF source. Narayanan et al., for example, designed and tested an ultra wideband (UWB) random noise radar (RNR) operating in the 1-2 GHz band at 200 meters in range. Results from this work established a solid basis for the feasibility of using noise as an RF source for the purposes of detecting targets [2]-[6]. Extensive work conducted by the Nanjing University (China) resulted in conclusive analysis describing an ideal waveform hybrid made up of UWB and random signal radar (RSR) waveforms where the authors determined that the best way to achieve a low probability of intercept\/low probability of detect (LPIILPD) system with low power and high resolution would be to combine these two waveforms [7]-[9]. The Russian Academy of Sciences has done extensive exploration on the plausibility of using code spectral modulation for communications systems, a technique first introduced in 1965 by J. L. Poirier [10], in order to insert data onto a random signal carrier where the concept of double spectral processing is exercised to extract the time delay corresponding to the information symbol [11]. Despite the availability of noise radar technology, the broader radar community has not yet fully embraced its attributes. The productivity of this work hopes to shorten this gap. This research is motivated by the belief that a strong majority of conventional radar systems transmit energy openly. This implies an obvious susceptibility to some advanced, non-intended 2nd party passive receivers who might have an interest in understanding what the unsecured RF source's intentions are. It was therefore felt that some research in this area could serve as a means to suggest one possible solution for addressing this concern. It was also felt that the productivity of the research should appreciate two fundamental criteria: a) the proposed waveform should not impede the radar's primary functions e.g. target detection, terrain mapping, and b) the scope of incorporating the proposed waveform should be done with marginal impact to the host waveform structure.","Due to the nature of noise, both its time and frequency domain responses are random making it virtually impossible for the transmitted signal to be recognized and\/or corrupted by non-intended 2nd party passive receivers without having a priori knowledge of the exact structure of the noise signal. However, transmitting noise alone is insignificant unless a carrier signal of specific frequency and phase is used as a reference. One practical approach is to do as Narayanan et al. did and artificially inject time-delayed replicas of the signal into the processing side of the system architecture. This was done in an effort to institute some form of coherence into their waveform while also reducing the overall computational complexity involved with signal processing. By selectively choosing specific time-delays, they in essence only needed to consider the presence of targets at certain ranges. As a result, when the radar returns were present in the candidate range bins, a well correlated signal would result. While what Narayanan et al. performed proved to be quite useful for the noise radar community, their approach only considered a short range test <<10 m) and a longer range test (200 m). Furthermore, their experimental set up suggests that specific hardware needs to be incorporated in order to successfully implement a UWB random noise radar. Because a majority of radar in use today implements a pulse-Doppler waveform structure, Narayanan's approach would impose a drastic impact to the architecture of these types of systems. These points clearly violate the fundamental criteria set forth earlier.","For these reasons, we consider herein a different noise radar approach that employs a composite waveform generated by amplitude modulating a complex pulse-Doppler waveform using noise. This waveform will serve as the basis for the inception of a newly defined noise radar class referred to by the authors as Noise Correlation Radar (NCR). It distinguishes itself from its peers, namely RNR and RSR, since neither a pure noise signal nor a modulated noise signal is transmitted. Instead, a pulse-Doppler waveform using pulse compression and linear frequency modulation (LFM) techniques serves as the host or modulated waveform. The LFM provides the coherence needed for proper correlation during the signal processing as well as the bandwidth necessary for resolving targets. It will be shown that the noise modulated pulse-Doppler waveform embodies the ideal characteristics of both noise radar and pulse-Doppler radar waveform in that it will have a chirped bandwidth (BW), pulse compression gain, masked transmit spectrum, and ideal ambiguity function. Notably, these facts appeal to many radar applications.","In order to overcome the disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of prior art radar target detection, such as costly and sluggish hardware, waveform disadvantages such as centering the carrier frequency response, increasing the probability of detection, and the life-threatening risks of unwanted detection, the pulsed noise correlation radar apparatus of the present invention advantageously uses pulse compression technology, a pulsed linear frequency modulated noise correlation mixer, and a new and innovative noise fused waveform to automatically correlate the pulsed linear frequency modulated noise waveform with the received signal. This eliminates the need for injecting a delayed reference signal correlation. This invention's pulsed noise correlation radar apparatus and system now make it possible to effectively reduce transmitting power, preserve high band widths through oversampling in the receiver, and achieve multi-channel array frequency diversity. This invention's pulsed compression waveform structure with correlated noise radar offers designers and users the choice of reducing processing burdens on system hardware while still preserving the random signal structure and its associated amenities. One essential difference between the prior art and this invention's noise correlation radar is this invention's unique fused waveform, particularly, the linear frequency modulation which allows the pulsed noise correlation radar to take advantage of correlation mixing that allows it to optimally and efficiently detect targets.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pulsed noise correlation radar apparatus.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a pulsed noise correlation radar apparatus that generates a pulsed linear frequency modulated noise fused waveform.","It is still a further object of the present invention to provide methods of detecting targets with pulsed noise correlation radar apparatus that generates a pulsed linear frequency modulated noise fused waveform.","These and other objects and advantages are achieved by this invention's pulsed noise correlation radar apparatus comprising a Gaussian noise signal generator, a frequency modulator generating a pulse train and linear frequency modulated (LFM) noise waveform, a means for sensing targets, a frequency demodulator, and a Transform of a correlated signal y(t) that generates a Y(j\u03c9) signal, calculates power spectral density S(j\u03c9) and generates a pulse compression LFM waveform. Preferably a Fast Fourier Transform can be used according to one embodiment of the invention. The pulse compression LFM noise waveform generated by the pulsed noise correlation radar apparatus rapidly increases its carrier frequency, achieves instantaneous band widths, and better detects a target without being intercepted or detected. Unlike the prior art's cumbersome and time-consuming use of optical delay lines or matched-filter banks, this invention's unique pulsed fused LFM noise waveform uses correlation mixing to optimally and more efficiently detect targets.","The present invention takes advantage of several aspects of pulsed signals to substantially improve radar target detection in military surveillance systems focused on detecting single or multiple targets at extended ranges. The fact that the waveform is pulsed allows the timing control associated with the transmission of successive, coherent pulses to be managed and maintained thereby reducing any isolation faults between the transmission and the reception process. As a result, the same antenna phase center can be used, which makes potential hardware implementations more practical. Furthermore, this synchronization allows for a ranging capability that can be directly defined by the equation:\n\n(2)\u2003\u2003Equation (1)\n\nwhere Ris the unambiguous range, c is the speed of light, and T is the pulse repetition interval.\n","Equation (1) makes it clear that when a target is present, a delay will naturally manifest itself in the returned signal structure. Furthermore, pulsed signals are able to incorporate pulse compression techniques thereby minimizing the burden on the transmitter\/receiver when trying to realize high bandwidth, and their associated narrow pulse widths, for high resolution applications. Pulse compression also maximizes the transmit duty factor keeping the effective radiated power low, as one would expect with a fundamental UWB signal. Lastly, because the pulsed LFM noise transmit signal is stored as a reference, the correlation mixer can be incorporated into the receive side in order to resolve discrete frequency responses induced by the time dilation effect caused by the target's scintillation (reflection, refraction, diffraction) thereby eliminating the need to inject a delayed reference signal through the use of an optical delay line.","It is important to note that the pulsed noise correlation radar and its unique pulsed LFM fused noise waveform exhibit an extremely low probability of being intercepted and a low probability of detection that is highly desired in numerous military and commercial applications. Furthermore, because of the ultra-wide band characteristics of the waveform, the receiver will be practically immune to interference and channel fading typically associated with narrow band signals. Since a pulsed signal is generated, the designer may also introduce frequency diversity with a multi-channel array thereby introducing spatial and temporal degrees of freedom exponentially more powerful than a single phase antenna.","This invention provides a pulsed noise correlation radar apparatus that answers the long-felt need for a pulse compression radar system to overcome the disadvantages, shortcomings, and limitations of prior art radar systems. In accordance with the present invention, both radar target acquisition and high bandwidths are preserved through oversampling, multi-channel array frequency diversity, and substantially increased user security without suffering from the disadvantages, shortcomings, and limitations of prior art devices. The present invention also encompasses a secure pulsed compression noise correlation radar system and methods for undetected target detection with pulsed noise correlation radar and a pulsed LFM fused noise waveform.","The present invention is a pulsed noise correlation radar target detection apparatus that advantageously detects stationary and moving targets by generating a pulsed linear frequency modulated (LFM) noise fused waveform with the ability to linearly increase carrier frequency to realize specific instantaneous band widths. In accordance with the present invention, the pulsed compression noise correlation radar generates a pulse train modulating the signal s(t) to arrive at a pulsed LFM fused noise waveform signal x(t), which is then demodulated and generates the correlated signal y(t). This invention's pulsed noise correlation radar effectively reduces transmit power, preserves high band widths by oversampling, introduces frequency diversity with a multi-channel array, and provides the user with increased security and surveillance capability.","Not only does this invention's pulsed noise correlation radar resolve many long-standing problems with prior art radar arrangements, but it also provides much-needed additional capabilities of storing the pulsed LFM noise transmit signal as a reference and operates in a way that minimizes or completely avoids unwanted detection by an adversary. Storing the pulsed LFM noise transmit signal as a reference allows the user to automatically correlate the transmit signal with the received signal and thereby eliminate the need for injecting a delayed reference signal. And, this invention's use of wide-sense stationary Gaussian noise and pulse compression techniques, effectively reduces the transmit power spectrum and removes any chirp-like characteristics from the waveform that might be intercepted by an unwanted adversary receiver. Another advantage of the present invention is to realize large instantaneous bandwidths during reception which permit the user to resolve targets despite interference and additive white Gaussian noise.","Referring now to the drawings,  is a conceptual diagram of the pulsed noise correlation radar  of the present invention which overcomes the disadvantages, shortcomings, and limitations of prior art radar systems. The pulsed noise correlation radar  comprises a wide sense stationary Gaussian noise signal generator , a means for generating a pulse train , a pulsed LFM fused noise waveform , a frequency demodulator , a means for correlating , and a Fast Fourier Transform  by advantageously generating a pulsed LFM fused noise waveform and auto-correlated signals that provide superior target detection without the dangers of emitting an electronic signature.","The wide sense stationary Gaussian noise signal generator  generates a Gaussian noise signal, indicated by arrow  to provide a normally distributed probability density function and that is also wide sense stationary. A means for generating a pulse train  generates an LFM waveform with the ability to linearly ramp up its carrier frequency in order to realize specific instantaneous band widths. The pulse train generating means  combines the Gaussian noise signal  and LFM waveform and provides an LFM noise waveform s(t). The pulse train generating means  generates a pulse train modulating the signal s(t) and provides a pulsed LFM fused noise waveform x(t), indicated by arrow . The noise modulation aspects of this invention scramble any recognizable transmit signal characteristics and also reduce transmit energy. The pulse train generating means  can be a frequency modulator.","A means for sensing targets  sends a signal  to the target, indicated by box , which generates a range and radar cross section of targets. A received signal r(t), indicated by arrow , is received by a frequency demodulator . The frequency demodulator , having a means for calculations, calculates the time dilation effect induced by target scintillation and includes this effect in the time dilated received signal r(t), indicated by arrow . The time dilated received signal r(t)  is sent to a means for correlation mixing  that advantageously exploits the time dilation effects induced by target scintillation.","In accordance with the present invention, the correlation mixing means  integrates the product over time of the transmitted signal x(t) and the conjugate of the time dilated received signal r*(t), which is denoted by the asterisk in Equation (7) below to provide an auto-correlated signal R(\u03c4), indicated by arrow . The Fast Fourier Transform  converts the auto-correlated signal, R(\u03c4),  into a transformed auto-correlated signal, represented by arrow , having a power spectral density denoted by the expression S(f). The transformed auto-correlated signal  presents discrete frequencies that correspond to the target i.e. f=\u03bc\u00b7\u03c4, allowing the user to advantageously detect the target with reduced transmit power and without being intercepted and emitting a detectable electronic signature.","In operation, the noise modulation aspects of this invention scramble any recognizable transmit signal characteristics and also reduce transmit energy to prevent interference and allow the user to avoid unwanted detection by not emitting a detectable electronic signature. Additionally, the Fast Fourier Transform  mathematically removes all of the temporal content in a particular signal of interest by integrating over a finite interval of existence. The result is a function of frequency only. In accordance with the present invention, the Fast Fourier Transform  identifies strong frequency content associated with target delays so that the user can detect both moving and stationary targets without being intercepted and emitting a detectable electronic signature. Although a Fast Fourier Transform is preferred, other transforms can be utilized.","The following equations define several key elements of the elements of this invention.

This was done in an effort to institute some form of coherence into their waveform while also reducing the overall computational complexity involved with signal processing. By selectively choosing specific time-delays, they in essence only needed to consider the presence of targets at certain ranges. As a result, when the radar returns were present in the candidate range bins, a well correlated signal would result. While what Narayanan et al. performed proved to be quite useful for the noise radar community, their approach only considered a short range test (<10 m) and a longer range test (200 m). Furthermore, their experimental set up suggests that specific hardware needs to be incorporated in order to successfully implement an UWB random noise radar. Because a majority of radar in use today implement a pulse-Doppler waveform structure, Narayanan's approach would impose a drastic impact to the architecture of these types of systems. These points clearly violate the fundamental criteria set forth earlier.","For these reasons, we consider herein a different noise radar approach that employs a composite waveform generated by amplitude modulating a complex pulse-Doppler waveform using noise. This waveform will serve as the basis for the inception of a newly defined noise radar class referred to by the authors as Noise Correlation Radar (NCR). It distinguishes itself from its peers, namely RNR and RSR, since neither a pure noise signal nor a modulated noise signal is transmitted. Instead, a pulse-Doppler waveform using pulse compression and linear frequency modulation (LFM) techniques serves as the host or modulated waveform. The LFM provides the coherence needed for proper correlation during the signal processing as well as the bandwidth necessary for resolving targets. It will be shown that the noise modulated pulse-Doppler waveform embodies the ideal characteristics of both noise radar and pulse-Doppler radar waveform in that it will have a chirped bandwidth (BW), pulse compression gain, masked transmit spectrum, and ideal ambiguity function. Notably, these facts appeal to many radar applications.","A block diagram of the NCR is shown in . The transmitted pulse train x[n] consists of K coherent pulses over a predefined receive window (time) producing N samples per pulse. The conventional signal considered is a complex, discrete-time equivalent pulse-Doppler waveform s[n] that is amplitude modulated by an aperiodic noise \u03bd[n]. Both signals have identical lengths thereby allowing the noise signal to assume the same instantaneous bandwidth as the chirped signal. Within the pulse generator, we will assume that the timing control associated with the transmission of successive pulses is managed and maintained thereby reducing any isolation faults between the transmit-receive process. By synchronizing this process, we can successfully perform LFM demodulation to expose the presence of targets since they will induce delays (or frequency shifts) that reside in the received signal structure r[n]. The correlation between the transmit and receive signal results in the correlator output yrz[\u03b7] that is then ingested into the spectrum analyzer to produce the instantaneous frequency response.","The discrete pulse-Doppler waveform is modeled as

sample can be directly modulated by the noise signal without altering the transmit pulse duration. Because of this, the pulse compression gain is unabated since it is a function of the transmit pulse. On the other hand, trying to preserve the transmit energy is a little more challenging since the dynamic range of our noise modulated signal fluctuates so much. This point is illustrated in  where both the modulated transmit pulse and unmodulated pulse are plotted. We did find that by normalizing the modulating noise signal by its expected value, which is readily acquired by calculating the sample mean of the noise signal, we were able to arrive at a very similar power profile that suggests the same transmit energy as the unmodulated case. The fact that we have a large dynamic range between samples despite our normalization technique still poses a challenge to the transmitter and the power amplifier since there is no constant envelope as is the case with traditional pulse-Doppler radar waveform. One possible approach to mitigate this was introduced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where they suggested the possibility of reducing the peak to average power by using an iterative algorithm that allows a more efficient form of linear amplification resulting in less transmitter power consumption by a factor of three at low signal-to-noise [12].","The masking effectiveness of the noise modulating signal is a critical component of the NCR.  show the transmit pulse (amplitude only) as having a 30% duty placing energy in the first 60 \u03bcsec of its 200 \u03bcsec PRI. This is similar to what many pulsed radar systems do, however, the amplitude and phase (not shown) of the pulse shown on the right is completely random and lacks the constant envelope typically associated with chirped waveform. This, in essence, is the masking effect introduced by the noise modulating signal. The transmit pulse width for both waveforms in  is 60 \u03bcsec or 30% of the full 200 \u03bcsec PRI. By introducing the amplitude modulating noise signal, we impart a masking effect that distinguishes the noise modulated pulse-Doppler waveform from the traditional unmodulated pulse-Doppler waveform distinguished by its constant envelope. Because there are 2844 time samples per pulse, the abscissa is shown using a logarithmic scale and enables us to see the deviations between waveforms.","The CPI consisting of the 16 pulses used in our simulation is shown in . This was done to illustrate the fact that each pulse has a completely random and different amplitude. The resultant transmit frequency spectrum of x[n] is also included and is shown in . As expected, the spectrum of the transmitted signal is completely random, and is in agreement with the duality of noise's random nature across both the time and frequency domains. The random nature of the signal makes recognition of the modulated pulse-Doppler waveform virtually impossible for unintended 2party passive receivers trying to understand the intentions of the transmitted signal. Furthermore, this spectrum still embodies the chirped waveform necessary for resolving targets.","Both the Pennsylvania State University and the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences have done extensive work with characterizing noise radar implementation. One notable discovery pertained to the fact that noise radar exhibit a \u201cthumb tack\u201d-like ambiguity response [5], [13]-[18]. This has obvious performance appeal since it essentially says that the transmitted waveform minimizes the number of occurrences in which time-frequency combinations can be wrongly associated. An essential part in establishing the feasibility of our noise modulated pulse Doppler waveform needed to include some quantifiable measure of the radar ambiguity function. Therefore, by tailoring the classic radar ambiguity function to that of our waveform design, we arrived at the following definition,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00009","num":"00009"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msup":[{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c7","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b7","mo":";","msub":{"mi":["f","d"]}}}}},"mn":"2"},{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u221e"}},{"mo":"+","mi":"\u221e"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"n"}},{"msup":{"mi":"x","mo":"*"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["n","\u03b7"],"mo":"-"}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"j2\u03c0"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["f","d"]},"mfrac":{"mi":["n","T"]}}}}}},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"11"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["t ","d "],"figref":"FIGS. 16 and 17","sup":["2","2 "]},"The target detection approach was conducted in simulation by way of classical correlation mixing techniques.
