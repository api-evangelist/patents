In some embodiments, the operator network  provides both broadcast programming in the form of multiplexed broadcast channels and multicast and\/or VOD programming.","The video receiver  includes a tuner , which may be broadly understood to include both conventional tuning devices for selecting a channel in a frequency multiplexed broadcast environment and an IP interface for subscribing to a multicast stream or requesting and receiving a VOD program. The tuner  outputs video for a selected channel or program to a display device . The display device may include a television, a video monitor, a computer, or other visual display device. In some instances, the display device  and video receiver  are an integrated unit. In some cases, the video receiver  is integrated with other video system, such as a video disc player (e.g. DVD, Blu-ray, etc.).","The video receiver  may be controlled using a remote control . The remote control  includes a number of buttons or other input devices that a user may activate to send commands to the video receiver . The remote control  typically transmits commands using infrared signals. The video receiver  includes an infrared sensor  for receiving infrared signals from the remote control .","The video receiver  has assigned a public or private IP address . One or more operator servers  may send and receive messages with the video receiver  over the operator network . The operator server  may be configured to provide the video receiver  with VOD programs, an electronic program guide (EPG), program metadata, and other such information. In some instances, the operator server  may be configured to receive request messages from the video receiver  for a VOD or PPV program, login or passcode information, and to process billing associated with the VOD or PPV program.","In some situations, the video receiver  may be equipped with a short range communication subsystem , such as Bluetooth\u2122 or WiFi (IEEE 802.11) functionality, to enable short range communications with other computing devices.","Referring still to , in accordance with one aspect of the present application the system  includes a mobile device . The mobile device  may, in some embodiments, include a handheld mobile smartphone, a laptop, a netbook, or a tablet. In the example embodiments described below, the mobile device  may be referred to and described as a tablet device, however the present application is not limited to tablet devices and may include any mobile device configured to have the functionality described herein.","The mobile device  includes a wireless communication subsystem  for sending and receiving communications with a wireless network . The wireless network  may include wireless wide area networks (WWAN), including GSM, GPRS, EDGE\/3GPP, UMTS, EvDO CDMA 2000, HSDPA, LTE (E-UTRA), WiMAX (802.16m), Mobile WiMAX (802.16e), or any other such mobile network protocol. The wireless network  may include wireless local area networks (WLAN), such as those conforming to one or more of the IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as WiFi). Other wireless network protocols may also be used by the wireless network .","The wireless network  connects to a public network , such as the Internet.","A gateway server  is connected to both the public network  and the operator network . The gateway server  is configured to communicate with the video receiver  via the operator network  and with the mobile device  via the public network  and wireless network . In some instances, the wireless network  may include an access point connected via cable modem or DSL to the operator network  and through a relay therein to the public network ; however, for ease of illustration, the wireless network  is illustrated as being separate from the operator network  in this embodiment. As will be described in greater detail below, the gateway server  stores an association or pairing between the mobile device  and the video receiver .","The mobile device  includes a remote control application . The remote control application  provides a graphical user interface (GUI) on the mobile device  through which the video receiver  may be controlled. In addition, the GUI provides additional feature-rich content associated with the programs available at the video receiver . For example, the GUI may provide an interactive program guide (IPG) through which available programming may be browsed, selected, and searched. In some embodiments, the GUI may adapt the layout and content of the IPG to viewer preferences, usage patterns, content popularity, etc. The GUI enables channel change through selection of an icon, tile or other graphical element associated with a program or channel. In response, the mobile device  is configured to send a channel change request message to the gateway server  which then relays the channel change request message to the paired video receiver . The remote control application  further enables integration of content from multiple providers; for example, it may enable related content search and display. In the latter example, a request for related content associated with one of programs may be received through the GUI. The mobile device  sends a related content message to the gateway server , which then formats and sends a request to one or more content servers in the public network . The content servers respond with search results, which the gateway server  then relays to the mobile device . It will be appreciated that the gateway server  may act as a proxy server for the mobile device  in receiving and sending related content requests.","Reference is now made to , which shows, in block diagram form, an example embodiment of the mobile device . The mobile device  includes at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the mobile device  and the execution of computer-readable instructions.

The memory  may store operating system software  and software applications , which may include, for example, a web browser and a messaging application.","The memory  stores the remote control application . In some embodiments the remote control application  may include a chat component , a search component , and a related content search component . Although, for ease of illustration, these are described as components they may be integrated within the remote control application  and may not be readily identifiable as separate components of the remote control application  in some embodiments. The components may also be standalone components or part of another application, in some embodiments. For example, the chat component  may be implemented as a standalone or separate component or module and may be integrated within the GUI of the remote control application  using suitable APIs.","The memory  further stores IPG data . The IPG data  may be updated, refreshed and replaced from time to time based upon the current time and the timespan of IPG data the remote control application  is configured to maintain available. In one embodiment, the IPG data  is obtained by the mobile device  from the gateway server , which in turn obtains IPG data from the operator server . The gateway server  may maintain full IPG data and may send the mobile device  a subset of the data, such as three hours of IPG data from the current time onwards. The subset may include a subset of channels based upon a current channel to which the video receiver  is tuned. As a user browses or searches the IPG through the GUI, further requests for IPG data are sent from the mobile device  to the gateway server , and the gateway server  provides the additional IPG data  for scrolling, panning or otherwise navigating the IPG on screen.","Reference is now made to , which shows, in simplified block diagram, an example embodiment of the gateway server . The gateway server  may include one or more processors  and memory . The memory  stores IPG data for responding to requests from mobile devices for additional IPG data. The gateway server  further includes a private network interface  for exchanging communications with the operator network  (), and a public network interface  for exchanging communications with the public network  ().","The memory  in the gateway server  further includes pairing information . The pairing information  associates a mobile device with a video receiver. In this manner, messages received from the mobile device, such as a channel change request, may be routed appropriately to the associated video receiver through the operator network. The association may include an identifier for the mobile device and an identifier for the video receiver. For example, the association may include the public IP address of the mobile device and the private IP address of the video receiver. The association may also or alternatively include other higher layer unique address information for the mobile device and the video receiver, such as a SIP URI or other identifier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["50","12","50","54","50","50","1020","60","1020","50","60"]},"The pairing request message  includes at least an identifier for the mobile device . The identifier may include a mobile device address, such as an IP address, a phone number, a SIM number, a SIP URI, or other unique identifier. More than one identifier may be present in the pairing request message .","In some cases, the pairing request message  may include information identifying the video receiver to which the mobile device  wished to be associated. The information identifying the video receiver may include an IP address or serial no. In some cases, the information identifying the video receiver may only be associated with the receiver, such as a telephone number associated with the premises, network operator billing account number, or other such identifier.","In some embodiments, the gateway server  may send a prompt message  soliciting identification or login information, so as to authenticate the mobile device . The mobile device  may respond with login or identifying information  which the gateway server  may then authenticate. For example, the video receiver or a billing account associated with the video receiver may have a password, passcode, or other authentication data stored at or accessible to the gateway server . In short, through this authentication the gateway server  may ensure that the mobile device  user is authorized to control the video receiver by confirming that the user can provide the authentication data associated with the video receiver. Otherwise, third parties could assume control over another person's video receiver without authorization.","In some embodiments, the identification and login information provided in message  may be provided in the pairing request message , or later in the signalling sequence, such as after selection of a particular video receiver, as will be described below.","In some embodiments, the gateway server  may not require login or identifying information in circumstances where there is an apparent authorization. For example, if the mobile device  provides the video receiver IP address, serial number, or international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) in the pairing request message , that may indicate a sufficient relationship and authority to pair the mobile device  to the receiver.","Referring still to , having received the pairing request message  and identification or login information (if any) then the gateway server  identifies the video receiver(s) to which the mobile device may be paired in operation . In some instance, a single video receiver may be identified. For example if the pairing request message  includes an IP address or receiver serial no., then a unique video receiver may be identified. Similarly, if the pairing request message  provides a phone number or billing account number with which a single video receiver is associated, then the gateway server  identifies that single video receiver. In other situations, more than one video receiver may be identified. For example, a phone number or billing account number may be associated with premises that have two or more video receivers. Accordingly, the gateway server  identifies all such video receivers that may be paired to the mobile device .","In message , the gateway server  may send the mobile device  the identities of the one or more video receivers identified. The mobile device  may be configured to present, graphically or otherwise, the video receivers and to receive a selection of one of the receivers. The GUI on the mobile device  may request confirmation of the intention to pair the mobile device  to the selected video receiver. In some embodiments, message  may include model, make, or type of receiver, and the GUI may display icons corresponding to the model, make or type of receiver. In some cases, individual receivers may be named or otherwise identified, such as \u201cFamily Room Set Top Box\u201d. Names may have been assigned to the receivers upon installation and configuration, for example using the remote control and a receiver interface screen. In message , the mobile device  sends the identity of the selected video receiver to the gateway server . The gateway server  then stores the association between the selected video receiver and the mobile device , and sends a confirmation message  to the mobile device .","After creation of the association the mobile device  and, in particular, the remote control application , is capable of controlling the selected video receiver by sending command messages to the gateway server , which then relays those commands to the video receiver based upon the stored association.","It will be appreciated that aspects of the pairing process may be varied from the example described above without materially affecting the creation of an association at the gateway server  between the mobile device  and a selected video receiver.","Reference is now made to , which show aspects of an example GUI  for the remote control application  (). In this example illustration, the mobile device  is presumed to be a touchscreen tablet device, however the present application is not necessarily limited to touchscreen devices in particular, or to tablet devices.  illustrates the GUI  on the display screen of a tablet device .","The GUI  includes a header bar  in this example. The header bar  provides navigational icons  and, in this example, category tabs . The remainder of the GUI  displays IPG program information in a tile format. Each individual tile  indicates a program on a particular channel. The location and length of each tile  may represent the start time and duration of the program in some embodiments. In the present embodiment, the GUI  may be navigated using touchscreen movements such as swipes to left or right, up or down, to scroll through the channels and time slots of the IPG. The category tabs  in the header bar  may be selected to cause display of a subset of the channels or programs based upon the category. For example, one of the categories may be for \u201csports\u201d, in which case selection of that category tab  would result in display of only the programs and channels that relate to sports content. The GUI may also include an overlay sidebar (not shown) for displaying shortcuts for particular channels or operations.","In some embodiments, other gestures or movements on the touchscreen may cause other operations. For example, tapping or otherwise selecting one of the tiles may initiate transmission of a channel change message from the mobile device  to the video receiver . In some cases, pinching or spreading movements may cause zoom operations to occur. In some example embodiments, pinching or spreading or other such touchscreen gesture movements in connection with a tile may initiate live streaming of the program to the mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["210","210","212","214","210","216","215","215","218","210"]},"The tile  may also include a graphic image . The graphic image  is related to the program and may include a logo or photo related to the program. In some instances the graphic image  may include an animation, such as an animated GIF or other such video, related to the program. In one embodiment, the graphic image  may appear as a still image (i.e. PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, or other image format) in all the tiles , but may be selectable in the GUI . When the graphic image  is selected, the mobile device  may be configured to display a short preview video or animated clip in place of the graphic image . In some instances, the preview video or animated clip may be shown in a window or display tiled on top of the GUI . In some cases, the preview video or animated clip may be a small video shown within the graphic image  area in the tile . Selection of the graphic image  to initiate display of the video or clip may include the mobile device  sending a video request message to the gateway server  and receiving the video data in response, whether streamed or downloaded.","The GUI  operates as an IPG and a remote control for the video receiver with which the mobile device is associated. Accordingly, selection of one of the tiles  on the GUI  causes the remote control application  to generate a channel change request message to the gateway server , which relays the message to the video receiver, which then tunes the requested channel. In one example embodiment, the GUI  is configured to operate as a \u201cone-click\u201d remote control, meaning that a single tap on one of the tiles  causes a channel change to that program or channel. In some embodiments, the GUI  may be configured to recognize another type of selection of one of tiles, through a different touchscreen movement, like a double-tap versus a single-tap, or other gestures, that results in a request for related content. Requests for related content are described in greater detail below.","In one embodiment, the GUI  may be configured to modify the display based upon information from the gateway server  regarding viewership statistics. For example, the gateway server  may provide the mobile device  with data regarding current viewership for channels. The GUI may indicate the relative popularity of currently live channels some manner. For example, in one embodiment the GUI  may display the channels in order of increasing or decreasing popularity. In one example the GUI  may offer a button or other input which, when selected, displays a list of the current most popular channels. In another example, the GUI  may be configured to only highlight channels that have above a present threshold of viewership as a way of highlighting live currently popular programs or events. In yet another example, the colours of the tiles associated with the programs may be modified based upon their relative popularity. For example, the top five programs with the most current viewers may be highlighted or displayed in different colours so as to draw attention to them. In yet a further example, viewership statistics may be displayed on the tiles for current live programs. The viewership statistics may include a total number of viewers on the operator network , or a percentage share, or a relative ranking based upon total number of viewers. In another example, the GUI  may distinguish between standard definition, high definition and 3D channels, such as through use of different colours, fonts, backgrounds, or symbols. Yet other example implementations are also contemplated.","In another embodiment, the GUI  and gateway server  may provide chat functionality in connection with current live programs. For example, the GUI  may permit launch of an embedded or stand alone chat application on the mobile device . The chat application may be part of the remote control application  in some implementations. The chat application may connect to the gateway server  to establish a chat session. The chat session may be associated with a program selected on the mobile device . In this manner, the user of the mobile device  is provided with access to live chat regarding a program currently being viewed on the video receiver .","Reference is now made to , which shows an example signalling diagram  for changing channels and searching programs. The mobile device  receives selection of a program via the GUI. For example, in one embodiment the use may single tap the tile corresponding to the desired program. If the program is currently available, i.e. it is a live broadcast on that channel, then the mobile device  may initiate a channel change request. In some instances, the program may not be live: it may be scheduled for broadcast at some time in the future or it may be a video-on-demand offering. In these circumstances, the mobile device  may prompt for additional input, such as whether the user wishes to switch to that channel now despite the fact that the program is not currently available, or whether the user wishes to configure the video receiver  to record that program when it airs, or whether the user wishes to order that VOD offering if it is available in that format.","A channel change request message  is sent from the mobile device  to the gateway server . The channel change request message  includes an identifier for the program or the channel or both. The gateway server  receives the channel change request message  and, at , identifies the video receiver associated with the mobile device . In other words, based on the identity of the mobile device  that sent the channel change request message , the gateway server  locates the stored association that pairs the mobile device  to a particular video receiver . Once the associated video receiver  has been identified the gateway server  sends a relay request message  to the video receiver  via the operator network  (). The relay request message  passes the channel change request; that is, the relay request message  identifies the requested channel or program or both and includes a command or instruction that the video receiver  is configured to interpret as a channel change instruction. The relay request message  may, in some instances, be in a proprietary format.","In one example embodiment, communications from the gateway server  to the video receiver  may include UDP messages addressed to a particular port on the video receiver . The UDP message may include command instructions that the video receiver  is configured to recognize and interpret appropriately. In particular, the video receiver  may include an agent or other software module configured to receive command instructions and to cause associated hardware in the video receiver  to implement the command. In one example, the agent may be a \u201cSARA Resident Application\u201d, which is proprietary to Cisco Systems, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. In other example implementations other agents may be used. The agent may, in some cases, be developed using the OCAP platform using the OCAP API remote control operations. Communications between the gateway server  and video receiver  may be implemented using XML, SOAP, RPC, REST, JSON, or any other such communications protocol.","The video receiver , on receiving the relay request message , tunes the requested channel .","Also shown in  is a signalling sequence for the circumstance in which the user selects recordal of a program. This may include a live program or a scheduled future program. Through the GUI, the mobile device  receives an instruction or command to record a selected program. This may include an instruction to establish multiple recordings, such as regularly scheduled recordings of a time slot, program, etc. The mobile device  generates and sends a record request message  to the gateway server . The record request message  includes details of the program, channel or schedule for the recordings.","As described above, the gateway server  identifies the video receiver  associated with the mobile device  and relays the recordal request in a relay record request message  addressed to the video receiver. The video receiver , on receiving the relay record request message  is configured to implement the record instruction by recording a channel or scheduling the future recording of a channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["50","320","320","320"]},"The mobile device  generates and sends a search request message  to the gateway server . The gateway server  performs the search  of the IPG based on the search parameters in the search request message . In some implementations, the gateway server  may instruct the operator server  to perform the search and may receive results from the operator server . In any case, the gateway server  obtains search results. The search results include programs or channels that meet the search parameters. The search results are packaged and provided to the mobile device  in a search results message . In some implementations, the search results message  may include a list of programs or associated identifiers. The list may be ordered, perhaps for a measure of relevance to the search query. The search results message  may further include, either together with the list or separately, even in a separate message, IPG data that the mobile device  may require to display the search results. The IPG data that the device  may want might include logos or images, details, and time sltos for the programs, to the extent that they have not already been provided to the mobile device  in the IPG data  () stored on the mobile device . Other IPG related data for displaying the search results may also be included.","The mobile device  displays the search results  on the display. The display of the search results may include providing a ranked list of programs, where each program is represented by a tile such as the tile  (). The display may include display of the GUI  () with the programs identified in the search results highlighted or marked in some manner. For example, the tiles of those programs identified in the search results may be rendered in a different background color than the other tiles. Other mechanisms for displaying the search results are also contemplated herein.","Reference is again made to . The public network  may include one or more content providers . Content providers  include sites that offer multimedia content, such as music, video, games, news, or other content. Examples include Youtube\u2122, Rogers On-Demand Online\u2122 (RODO\u2122) Hulu\u2122, Netflix\u2122, Metacafe\u2122, Cineplex\u2122, etc. Some content providers, like Youtube\u2122, aggregate content from a number of sources and may include content that is related to programming available through the video receiver . Accordingly, the remote control application  is configured to enable related content retrieval to the mobile device  via the GUI  ().","Reference is now made to , which shows a signalling diagram  for retrieving related content. Through the GUI  () the mobile device  receives a related content request . The related content request  is made in association with one of the programs displayed in the GUI . For example, the related content request  may be detected by the mobile device  on the basis of receiving a predefined touchscreen gesture in association with the tile for a particular program. In one embodiment, the gesture may be a double tap on the tile associated with a program. In another embodiment, the gesture may be a swipe, pinch, or other gesture. The GUI  may be configured to interpret other gestures, touches, or inputs as requests for related content.","The mobile device  generates and sends a related content request message  to the gateway server . The related content request message  identifies the program with which the request is associated. For example, it may include the title of the program, a program identification number, a channel number, or other such identifiers.","The gateway server  then sends a search query  to the content provider . The search query  may include one or more terms or phrases associated with the program identifies in the related content request message . These search terms and phrases may be preconfigured in the gateway server  in association with particular programs. The search terms may include the title of the program, the names of one or more actors, the genre of the program, an episode number or identifier, or other such data. In some cases, the gateway server  may receive and include additional search terms or parameters from the mobile device . Historical data may be used to identify more relevant content by utilizing usage statistics for a particular event or program. In many embodiments, the content provider  may provide an API or other interface through which it can receive search queries.","The content provider  returns a search results message . In some cases, the gateway server  may parse the search results message  to extract search results and provide them to the mobile device . In other embodiments, the gateway server  may forward the search results message  without modification to the mobile device . In any event, a relayed search results message  is sent from the gateway server  to the mobile device . The mobile device  then displays the search results and, in some instance, the related content identified in the search results.","In one example embodiment the mobile device  and remote control application  may be configured to perform related content searching directly using content providers' APIs, bypassing the gateway .","The GUI  is configured to display content received in the search results or as a results of selection of one of the search results. For example, the GUI  may be configured to display related Youtube\u2122 videos associated with a selected program. In another example, the GUI  may be configured to display iTunes\u2122 music available for purchase and download that is associated with the program, perhaps due to its use in the soundtrack. In yet another example, the GUI  may be configured to launch a chat interface hosted on by the content provider , where the chat relates to the selected program. In yet a further example, the GUI  may be configured to provide the latest Twitter\u2122 feeds, blog entries, or news items relating to the program.","It will be appreciated that in many implementations the gateway server  is acting as a proxy server for related content searching on behalf of the mobile device . In some respects, the gateway server  may perform enhanced proxy services, in that the gateway server  may be configured to generate the search query message  based on the identity of the program selected for related content searching. In some implementations, depending on the nature of the content provider  and the related content, the gateway server  may perform other proxy services, such as establishing a session between the mobile device  and the content provider . SIP signalling or similar such protocols may be used by the gateway server  to set-up, monitor, and tear-down such real-time related content sessions.","Although the term \u201cmessage\u201d is used herein when describing signalling between elements, it should be understood that message may include a wide variety of signals and protocols and is not intended to be limiting.","Reference is now made to , which shows an example signalling diagram  for viewing a program on the mobile device . In this example, the mobile device  and video receiver  are configured to permit viewing of program content on the mobile device . In this particular example, the video receiver  and mobile device  are both equipped with short range wireless communication capabilities, such as Bluetooth\u2122, WiFi, etc., such that the video receiver  is capable of streaming program content to the mobile device . In another example, the mobile device  may receive the program content from the gateway server  via the wireless network .","In this example, the mobile device  receives an on-device program selection  identifying the selected program. This selection may be received via the GUI  (). The mobile device  sends the on-device program request  to the gateway server , which then relays the request as a relayed on-device program request  to the associated video receiver . The video receiver  may tune the selected channel , and then streams the channel to the mobile device . It will be appreciated that the video receiver  may be configured to send or stream the selected channel in its undecoded compressed format, provided the mobile device  is configured with a suitable decoder for viewing the program. The streamed program may be transmitted over a short range link from the video receiver  to the mobile device . In some embodiments, the video receiver  is equipped with the capability of tuning more than one channel, thereby enabling display of one program on its display device  and a different program on the mobile device .","The above-described embodiments of the present disclosure are intended to be examples only.
