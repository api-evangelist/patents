{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application claims priority to the following U.S. Provisional Patent applications 61\/764,060, filed Feb. 13, 2013, U.S. 61\/771,083, filed Mar. 1, 2013.","A. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to mattresses of the type used to support a recumbent human. More particularly, the invention relates to novel air mattresses which use a matrix array of air bladder cells that are individually inflatable and deflatable in time varying sequences which cause quiescent support forces for a human body lying on the mattress to have superimposed thereon spatially moving, time varying traveling waves of support force which correspond to traveling waves of air pressure pulses input to the air bladder cells. The body support forces waves can be programmed to travel longitudinally, laterally or obliquely on the upper support surfaces of the air bladder cells, according to pre-determined patterns which can be used to minimize formation of decubitus sores on a patient's body and alternatively to simulate comforting motions such as floating on a rolling water wave, or rocking in a boat, which simulations may optionally be accompanied by appropriate music and\/or environment-simulating sounds.","B. Description of Background Art","Pressure sores, which are also known as decubitus ulcers or bed sores occur in the outer tissues of a person's body if they are subjected to relatively large pressures and\/or shear forces for long periods of time. Such sores are caused by reduction in blood circulation caused by surface force pressures which exceed the person's capillary blood pressure. The problems with bed sores forming on the skin of persons with medical conditions which require them to be in relatively immobile positions on a hospital bed or in a wheel chair can be severe, resulting in painful, difficult to treat conditions, loss of limbs, or even death.","For the foregoing reasons, hospitals, nursing homes and other such health care providers which provide care giving to ailing or elderly people are keenly aware of the necessity to carefully monitor people under their care to prevent formation of bed sores. A commonly used method to minimize the possibility of bed sore formation is to turn the patient periodically, i.e., to re-adjust the patient's position on a bed mattress or in a wheel chair so that long-term pressures can be relieved from parts of a patient's body. However, turning invariably results in renewed higher pressures on other parts of the body, so the turning process must be repeated usually at least on a daily basis.","Presumably in response to a perceived need to reduce problems of bed sore formation, a variety of devices and methods have been proposed to reduce long-term, large force or pressure concentrations on a person's body. For example, Cottner et al, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,243,723, Sep. 17, 1993, Multi-Chambered Sequentially Pressurized Air Mattress With Four Layers discloses an air mattress which has two lower layers constantly pressurized at about 1 psi gauge, and two upper layers that each have serpentinely shaped, transversely disposed interdigitated membrane areas which are cyclically and alternately pressurized with varying air pressure in a push-pull fashion which creates a standing wave of variation in support force for a patient, with the intended purpose of minimizing formation of decubitus sores. The standing waves produced by alternate inflation and deflation of adjacent interdigitated members shifts support forces up and down, leaving the average maximum reaction support force concentrations on parts of a patient's body unchanged.","The present invention was conceived of to provide air mattresses which provide traveling waves of support-forces for the body of a person supported by the mattress, which can reduce maximum force concentrations.","An object of the present invention is to provide a traveling wave air mattress apparatus which includes an inflatable air mattress that has a multiplicity of hermetically isolated air bladder cells and a pressure pulse generator which dynamically varies inflation pressures in the cells to thus create a traveling wave of support-force which travels on the upper surface of the mattress.","Another object of the invention is to provide a traveling wave air mattress apparatus which includes a mattress that has a multiplicity of laterally disposed, hermetically isolated air bladder cells, and an air pressure pulse generator which sequentially varies air pressure in the cells to thus create longitudinally traveling body support-force waves on the upper surfaces of the air bladder cells.","Another object of the invention is to; provide a traveling wave air mattress comprised of a planar matrix of air bladder cells which are hermetically isolated from one another, and a pressure pulse generator for varying air pressures in the cells by pressure pulses which are applied sequentially to individual cells or groups of cells to create on the upper surfaces of the cells traveling waves of support-force for the body of a person supported by the mattress, the traveling waves being directable longitudinally, laterally or obliquely on the surface of the mattress.","Another object of the invention is to provide a traveling wave air mattress which has a matrix of air bladder cells, each of which has associated therewith a surface reaction force-sensor, the sensors being useable to calculate a gradient vector of surface reaction forces measured by the sensors, and a pressure pulse generator for directing waves of negative pressure pulses to air bladder cells along the path of the gradient vector to thus create a traveling wave of support force reduction which travels in the direction the gradient vector.","Another object of the invention is to provide a traveling wave air mattress apparatus which has a multiplicity of individually inflatable and deflatable air bladder cells which are hermetically isolated from one another, and a wave generator including a pressure pulse generator and selector values which introduces a wave of air pulses into selected cells to thus create a traveling wave of support force reduction directed along the gradient path.","Another object of the invention is to provide a traveling wave air mattress apparatus which has a multiplicity of individually inflatable and deflatable air bladder cells which are hermetically isolated from one another, and a wave generator which includes a pressure pulse generator and selector valve mechanism which introduces pulses of air pressure into selected air bladder cells in a sequential fashion that produces a traveling pressure wave in the air bladder cells which in turn causes the upper surfaces of the air bladder cells to produce thereon a corresponding traveling wave of support force for a body supported on the upper surface of the air mattress.","Various other objects and advantages of the present invention, and its most novel features, will become apparent to those skilled in the art by perusing the accompanying specification, drawings and claims.","It is to be understood that although the invention disclosed herein is fully capable of achieving the objects and providing the advantages described, the characteristics of the invention described herein are merely illustrative of the preferred embodiments. Accordingly, I do not intend that the scope of my exclusive rights and privileges in the invention be limited to details of the embodiments described. I do intend that equivalents, adaptations and modifications of the invention reasonably inferable from the description contained herein be included within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.","Briefly stated, the present invention comprehends a method and apparatus for alleviating formation of bed sores or decubitus sores on parts of the body of a person such as a medical patient who is supported in a relatively immobile recumbent position on a hospital bed for long periods of time. The apparatus according to the present invention includes an air mattress which is constructed from individually inflatable and deflatable air bladders cells which are arranged in a rectangular array having an upper horizontal patient support surface. The individual air bladder cells are inflated to suitable quiescent pressure levels which provide comfortable support for the body of a recumbent patient. Preferably, the quiescent or bias pressure levels of the several air bladder cells are individually adjusted to values which minimize the sum of maximum reaction force concentrations exerted on the body of a patient, as measured by an array of force or pressure sensors which is associated with the array of air bladder cells.","According to the invention, air pressure in each of the cells is cyclically varied in a manner which causes the support forces afforded by the mattress to a human body to have superimposed on quiescent static or bias values time-varying components to thus produce traveling waves of support force superimposed on the static support forces. The traveling wave component of the support force is produced by varying in a pre-determined time sequence air pressure in sequences of individual air bladder cells according to pre-determined programs which control pressurized air inlet to and exhausted from individual air bladder cells via electrically controlled valves.","For example, to produce a traveling wave of support force reduction which travels from the head-end towards the foot-end of the mattress, air pressure in a laterally disposed zone of air bladder cells located at an end of the longitudinal axis of the mattress near the patient's head is momentarily reduced to produce a pressure reduction pulse, followed by a reduction of air pressure in longitudinal zones successively closer to the foot-end of the mattress, and so forth, until a pressure reduction pulse occurs in the longitudinal zone of air bladder cells nearest the foot-end of the mattress. The traveling pressure wave pulse cycle and resultant traveling support force wave cycle can be activated intermittently, such as once every hour, continuously in groups of several cycles periodically or in response to sensor measurements of reaction forces exerted on a patient.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the air bladder cell matrix will have at least two and preferably three parallel longitudinally disposed zones located side-by-side, and preferably have 4 or more laterally disposed zones. For example, a 3 column\u00d74 row array of 12 air bladder cells which has four longitudinally arranged, laterally disposed zones each three cells wide enables traveling support force waves to be propagated longitudinally, i.e., head-to-foot, or foot-to-head, laterally, i.e., left-to-right and right-to-left, and obliquely.","Under computer program control, the air pressure in individual air bladder cells, or in groups of cells, such as in all or some of the cells in a row or column, can be temporarily varied from quiescent values of air pressure in a wide variation of time sequences to thus produce a wide variety of waves of patient support forces which travel over the upper surface of the mattress. The traveling support wave patterns can be optimized to alleviate or minimize the formation of decubitus sores which can result from long periods of large static support pressures on parts of a patient's body.","In a simple example, the pressure in all three of the laterally arranged air bladder cells in the first, head-end longitudinal zone of a 3\u00d74 matrix air mattress may be reduced from quiescent steady state values by a pulse of negative air pressure input to the cells in that zone for a period of several seconds. At the end of the first air pressure pulse, air pressures in the cells may be restored to their original bias or quiescent values, which have been previously adjusted to provide comfortable support of a patient.","After an initial pressure pulse has been applied to a first air bladder cell or group of cells, similar pressure reduction pulses are applied to longitudinal zones ,  and . This sequence of air pressure reduction pulses results in a traveling wave of support forces reduction which travels from the head-end to the foot-end of the mattress.","The traveling waves of air pressure reduction pulses in the air bladder cells can be performed as a single cycle, at pre-determined times, repeated for several cycles, or performed continuously for pre-determined time periods. Also, the time interval between an air pressure reduction pulse in one zone of air bladder cells and the initiation of a negative or pressure pulse in a next zone in a pre-selected spatial sequence need not be zero, as it would be in a traveling wave which characterizes water waves, but may, for example, have a finite, selectable, value. In other words, the duty cycle of a pulse generator used to activate air pressure control valves to thus apply a sequence of air pressure pulses to a sequence of air cell bladder zones can be as small as desired. Or, put another way, the time interval between successive pressure pulses applied to successive cells or group of cells, can be as long as desired.","According to the invention, traveling waves of air pressure pulses which decrease for pre-determined time intervals and repetition rate, the maximum reaction force concentrations on parts of a human body can be programmed to travel longitudinally from head-to-toe, as described in the simplified example above, or in the opposite, toe-to-head longitudinal direction on the mattress surface. As stated above, longitudinal traveling body support force waves are produced by varying the air pressure simultaneously in each air bladder cell in a first transverse row of cells, subsequently varying the air pressure in the air bladder cells in a longitudinally adjacent row of cells, and so forth, until the wave of support forces on parts of a patient's body has traversed the entire length or a selected segment of the length of the mattress.","In an exactly analogous fashion, air pressure in laterally adjacent or spaced apart longitudinally disposed columns of adjacent air bladder cells may be varied to produce laterally traveling waves of body support forces. Also, by sequentially varying air pressure in obliquely located air bladder cells, obliquely traveling waves of body support forces may be generated using the traveling wave air mattress according to the present invention.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a force sensor array is optionally provided which has an individual surface reaction force sensor that is associated with each individual air bladder cell, in vertical alignment with the cell. The array of reaction force sensors, which produce electrical signals proportional to reaction forces exerted by the mattress on various parts of a patient's body supported by the individual cells, may be used to create a map of body reaction force concentrations.","The measured values of reaction forces may also be used to create a segmented measured reaction force gradient vector. The reaction force gradient vector may then be used to calculate a path sequence for producing a traveling wave of air pressure in a sequence of air bladder cells along the reaction force gradient vector.","Since a measured reaction force gradient vector may not necessarily include all of the air bladder cells in an array, and may in some cases be directed between non-adjacent air bladder cells, traveling waves of air pressure may be directed individually to only a small number of the total air bladder cells in an array, some or all of which cells may be non-adjacent. In this way, patient body support reaction forces exerted by the air mattress may be momentarily and periodically reduced in an efficient manner which does not require varying air pressure in all of the air bladder cells in an array.","For example, if reaction force sensors determine that a maximum reaction force is exerted by a first cell, and the force gradient vector from that maximum is directed through three additional cells, some of which may be non-adjacent, an air pressure wave need be directed only to those four air bladder cells to thus create a traveling support force reduction wave which travels over just the four cells. For reasons stated above, the four cells need not necessarily be vertically or horizontally aligned, or adjacent to one another.","According to the invention, a basic embodiment of the traveling wave air mattress, which need not have reaction force sensors, may also be programmed to simulate relaxing motions. Thus, longitudinal traveling support pressure waves in the mattress may be programmed to simulate motions corresponding to floating on a surf wave, and may be accompanied by surf sounds. Also, laterally traveling support force pressure waves can be programmed to simulate gentle rolling or rocking motions of a boat and may be accompanied by water sloshing sounds and\/or sounds simulating creaking oarlocks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","20","27","20","20"]},"As shown in , mattress  has a generally flat rectangular base panel  which may be made of a sheet of a durable flexible plastic material such as polyurethane or polyvinyl. Base panel  has protruding upwards therefrom a longitudinally arranged series of laterally elongated, rectangular plan view air bladder cells . As shown in , each air bladder cell  extends from the left-hand longitudinally disposed edge  to the right-hand edge  of mattress . As is also shown in , when air bladder cells  are inflated, e.g., to a pressure of about 1 psi gauge, the cells have in a vertical longitudinal sectional view generally the shape of a laterally elongated semi-cylinder which has an arcuately curved, convex upper semi-cylindrical surface  that extends upwards from base panel .","Although the transverse cross-sectional shape and size of air bladder cells  is not critical, a typical size and shape for use in a 80 inch\u00d736 inch mattress having 6 laterally disposed air cells would be a semi-cylinder having a base diameter of about 13 inches and a length of about 36 inches, as shown in .","Confronting laterally disposed edges  of the air bladder cells  may contact each other, or as shown in , edges  may optionally be spaced longitudinally apart a short distance, e.g., 1 inch.","Referring to , it may be seen that traveling wave air mattress apparatus  includes a mattress inflation control apparatus  for inflating and deflating air bladder cells  to individual pressure levels which provide comfortable support for a person supported by mattress . Apparatus  also includes a wave generator apparatus  for varying air pressure in inflatable air bladder cells  in a manner which results in a traveling wave of support-force to propagate on the upper surface  of the mattress formed by the upper surfaces  of air bladder cells . Preferably mattress  is enclosed by a soft fabric mattress cover, and an optional thin layer of foam rubber between the upper surface of air bladder cells  and an inside surface of the mattress cover.","According to the invention, wave generator apparatus  is used to produce a traveling wave of support force for the body of a person supported on the upper surface  of mattress  by sequentially varying the air pressure in selected paths of individual air bladder cells , for example from the head-end to the foot-end of the mattress, in predetermined time sequences.","As shown in , mattress inflation level control apparatus  includes a source of pressurized air , which is preferably an air compressor but may optionally be a tank containing a pressurized gas such as air or nitrogen. Air pressure source , which is preferably a compressor driven by an electric motor , has an outlet port  connected through an outlet tube  to the inlet port  of a manifold . Manifold  has multiple outlet ports , e.g., six outlet ports -, -, -, -, - and -, which are individually connected through tubes to the inlet ports - through - of a group of cell selector valves - through -.","Each cell selector valve , which may be a simple on\/off gate valve, has an outlet port  which is connected to a first, upper inlet tube port  of a Y-tube coupler . Each Y-tube coupler  has a second, lower inlet tube port  and an outlet tube port  which is connected to an inflation port  of an individual air bladder cell . Thus for example, outlet tube port - of Y-tube coupler - is connected with air pressure-tight fittings to air inlet port - of the first, head-end air bladder cell - of traveling wave air mattress , and so forth.","As will be explained in further detail below, each cell inflation selector valve  is controlled by electrical signals issued by an electronic control module  to inflate and deflate individual air bladder cells  to quiescent values which provide comfortable support for a person reclining on mattress .","Referring still to , it may be seen that wave generator apparatus  includes a pressure pulse generator  for creating negative and optionally positive pulses of air pressure in an outlet port  which are conducted to second, lower inlet port tubes  of Y-tube couplers . The output port  of pressure pulse generator  communicates with a source of pressurized air, such as a closed chamber part of a cylinder located on a side of a piston or diaphragm which is longitudinally movable in the cylinder in response to forces exerted on the piston by a linear actuator.","Wave generator apparatus  includes a wave generator controller A for issuing electrical command signals to pressure pulse generator  and other components of the wave generator apparatus. Wave generator controller A is preferably a computer or programmable logic controller (PLC), and preferably communicates with or is optionally replaced by a computer  of inflation control apparatus .","The magnitude of the negative air pulses need not be any greater than the maximum intended inflation pressure of any air bladder cell . For example, if the intended maximum inflation pressure of any of air bladder cells - through - is 1 psi, the negative pulse-generating capability of pressure pulse generator  should be sufficient to draw all of the air from an air bladder cell , e.g., about 1.38 cubic feet, within a pre-determined maximum time limit, e.g., 10 seconds. In actuality, the exhaustion rate of pressure pulse generator  may be less, since operation of the invention envisions only a fractional reduction of the pressure in an air bladder cell  from a quiescent value, e.g., one-half.","According to the invention, after a negative pressure pulse has been applied to an air bladder cell , the air pressure in that cell may be changed to a quiescent or bias valve different than pressure at the beginning of the pulse, but is typically restored to the original bias pressure valve. In either case, a single pressure pulse generator  within wave generator  may be used in conjunction with pulse selector valve array  to route negative or positive pulses of air pressure to selected air bladder cells . Thus, as shown in , pressure pulse generator  has a single outlet port  which is connected through a manifold  and pressure pulse selector valves  of valve array  to second, lower inlet port tubes  of selectable Y-tube couplers . Each pulse selector valve , which may be a simple on\/off gate valve, is controlled by electrical signals issued by wave generator controller A.","Referring to , it may be seen that mattress inflation control apparatus  includes an electronic control module  for adjusting the static or quiescent inflation pressure levels of air bladder cells  to values which provide comfortable support to a person lying on the upper surface  of air mattress , and for controlling functions of wave generator .","As shown in , electronic control module  preferably includes a computer  or a similar programmable electronic component such as a microprocessor or programmable logic controller (PLC) which emits through an interface module  command signals for actuating various components of the apparatus , such as compressor , cell inflation selector valves  and optionally pulse selector valves . Computer  also receives through interface module  various feedback signals such as valve configuration and compressor outlet pressure from a pressure transducer , etc.","Depending upon whether mattress system  is to be configured as a relatively inexpensive, relaxation-inducing system, or a precision therapeutic system for use in hospitals and similar locations, the system  may include less or more complexity and cost-increasing components. For example, while a low-cost traveling wave mattress  intended for recreational or relaxation purposes according to the present invention would not require body support-force sensors, embodiments of the invention intended for use in hospital environments would desirably include a force sensor array that used at least one force sensor associated with each air bladder cell of the mattress, to monitor reaction support forces exerted by the air bladder cells on the body of a patient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIGS. 1 and 2A"],"b":["10","10","22","20","43","43","49","40","37","43","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIGS. 1 and 2A"],"b":["22","10"]},"Referring to , mattress inflation control apparatus  is first directed by computer  to switch on electrical power to drive motor  of air compressor . By employing command signals issued from computer  through interface module  to air bladder cell selector valves , individual air bladder cells -, -, -, -, - and - may be inflated to pre-determined air pressure values monitored by compressor pressure transducer . As shown in , the initial quiescent or bias values of pressure to which individual air bladder cells  are inflated need not all be the same.","After the individual air bladder cells - through - have been inflated to pre-determined quiescent values, command signals may be initiated by computer  and issued through interface module  and a wave generator controller A to initiate operation of wave generator . For example, a first step in the operation of wave generator  would be to actuate a first pressure pulse selector valve  of pressure pulse generator  to thus provide an air flow path between outlet port  of pressure pulse generator  through lower inlet port tube - of Y-tube coupler - to air inlet port - of first air bladder cell -.","Next, as shown in line  of , pressure pulse generator  is powered on at a time T1 in response to a command signal from computer . Applying power to pressure pulse generator  causes a solenoid, pneumatic actuator cylinder or stepper motor-driven linear actuator to move a diaphragm or piston  in a closed cylinder  which has on a first active side  of the piston  a port  connected through a pulse selector valve  of pulse selector valve array  to the second, lower inlet port tube - of Y-junction coupler - connected to inflation port - of air bladder cell -. Pressure pulse generator  may also have located on a second, down-stroke side of piston  a second, storage chamber , which may be optionally connected through air-tight fittings and an optional valve to a pneumatic accumulator .","As shown in , a first air pressure pulse  emitted by pressure pulse generator  and conducted to a first air bladder cell - has generally an amplitude which varies as a function of time as the negative half of a sine wave. However, the shape of air pressure pulse  may optionally be varied under computer control to approximate that of a rectangle, trapezoid, triangle, or other such shape.","The magnitude of air pressure pulse  is variable under computer control to a desired value, but typically would be about half or less than the maximum quiescent or bias pressure level in a given air bladder cell or group of air bladder cells. For example, for a quiescent air pressure level of 1 psi in a cell  of mattress , the amplitude of air pressure pulse  would typically be about 0.5 psi or less.","As shown in , first air pressure pulse  is a negative-going pulse that temporarily reduces the air pressure in air bladder cell -. It is envisioned that for use of mattress  in hospital beds or other such therapeutic applications, the pulse of air pressure produced by pressure pulse generator  would typically be negative, to thus temporarily reduce the reaction force exerted on a patient's body by a particular air bladder cell  or a group of air bladder cells . However, as shown in , the pulse generator  can be configured and commanded to alternatively produce positive-going pressure pulses, for applications such as relaxational uses of mattress .","The period of pulse  may be adjusted to any suitable value under computer control. Thus, the time interval between the beginning, T1 and the end, T2 of pressure pulse  shown in line  of  can be any desired value, e.g., several seconds to several minutes or longer.","Referring now to line  of , it may be seen that pulse generator  is used to apply a second air pressure pulse  in a sequence of air pressure pulses to a second air bladder cell - at a programmable time T3. Beginning time T3 of second pulse  may be coincident with the end of pulse , or delayed to occur at any desired programmable time period later than T2, e.g., 1 second, several seconds, or longer. In exactly the same manner, successive air pressure pulses , ,  and  may be applied to air bladder cells -, -, - and -, which cells are located progressively further towards the foot-end of air mattress  from the head-end air bladder cell -.","As shown in lines - of , a negative pressure wave is produced in a continuous sequence of air bladder cells - through - to thus produce a traveling wave of reduction in support force for the body of a person supported by air mattress . However, it should be understood that characteristics of the traveling pressure wave produced by pressure pulse generator  of pressure wave generator  and hence characteristics of traveling body force support waves may readily be modified in real time by suitably programming computer . For example, referring to , the traveling pressure wave may be programmed to skip over selected air bladder cells, such as even cells -, -, by not applying negative pressure pulses to those cells. In fact, apparatus  may be programmed to produce sequences of air pressure pulses which travel in any arbitrary path between air bladder cells .","As may be readily understood, as shown in , the pressure pulses produced by pressure pulse generator  may optionally be positive-going rather than negative-going, provided the quiescent pressure levels of air bladder cells  are initially adjusted to values less than maximum inflation levels.","Also, pressure wave generator  may optionally be directed by computer  to produce overlapping pressure pulses, parts of which are applied simultaneously to more than two cells or zones of cells to thus produce an overlapping body support-force wave. For example, referring to , the initiation time T3 of a of second air pressure pulse  may occur between beginning and ending times T1 and T2 of first air pressure pulse , to thus produce a composite traveling support wave pulse which begins at T1 and ends at T4, and is longer than the individual pulses shown in .","As shown by the dashed lines in , the pulse generator  may be programmed to cause some or all of the air bladder cells  that have received a pulse of air to retain the pressure level in the cell at its maximum changed value, or at a value intermediate between the initial quiescent level and the maximum changed level.","Pressure wave generator  may also be directed by computer  to produce two or more traveling support force waves which travel simultaneously on the upper surface  of mattress . Thus, for example, by programming computer  to direct wave generator  to sequentially apply air pressure pulses to longitudinally descending and ascending pairs of air bladder cells, a first traveling wave of support force may be launched on upper surface  an air mattress , which travels from the head-end to the foot-end of the mattress, and a second traveling wave of support force launched simultaneously, which travels from the foot-end to the head-end of the mattress. The foregoing pair of simultaneous traveling support waves may be produced by simultaneously applying pulses of air pressure to the following pairs of cells; (- and -), (- and -), (- and -), (- and -), (- and -), and (- and -).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 2A"],"b":["20","20","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1 and 2A"],"b":["20","20","22"]},"As discussed above, the traveling wave air mattress apparatus according to the present invention may be programmed to launch pairs of support force waves which travel simultaneously in opposite directions on the upper surface of the air mattress. From this discussion, it will be readily understood that pressure wave generator  may be directed by computer  to produce laterally moving traveling support force waves on the surface of an air mattress having multiple columns of air bladder cells, such as the mattresses shown in . Moreover, it will be readily understood that according to the present invention, two or more traveling support waves may be simultaneously launched on the mattresses having multiple columns, and these waves can include simultaneously existing pairs of longitudinally traveling waves, laterally traveling waves, or combinations of simultaneous longitudinally and laterally traveling waves.","As shown in , wave generator apparatus  may be used as an accessory with an existing air mattress apparatus which includes a multi-cell air mattress  and an associated inflation control apparatus , by interconnecting the wave generator apparatus to the inflation control apparatus using Y-couplers . In this accessorized configuration, computer  of inflation controls module  can provide a signal to wave generator controller A indicating when adjustment of quiescent air pressures in air bladder cells  has been achieved by the inflation control apparatus , whereupon pulse pressure sequences causing traveling wave support force waves may be initiated by pressure pulse generator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7A","b":["110","10"]},"As shown in , modified traveling wave apparatus  includes a mattress  which may be similar in construction to the basic mattress embodiment  shown in  and described above. For ease of explanation, the mattress shown in  is shown to have 6 transversely disposed, non-subdivided air bladder cells. However, mattress  actually includes a rectangular matrix of air bladder cells  as shown in , rather then a single column of transversely disposed rows of air bladder cells, which enables air pressure and hence body support forces to vary only in a single, longitudinal head-to-toe direction.","According to the invention, air mattress  intended for use in hospitals would have as shown in  at least two and preferably three or four separate laterally disposed columnar zones of air bladder cells, as shown in .","As shown in ,  and A, an example air mattress  has six different transversely disposed, longitudinally ordered zones which span the head-to-toe length of the mattress. Each of the six transversely disposed rows of air bladder cells  is partitioned into four rectangular air bladder cells, each of which is hermetically isolated from all other air bladder cells.","Thus, in the example embodiment of air mattress  shown in , there is a rectangular matrix array of 24 rectangularly-shaped air bladder cells - through -, each of which is hermetically isolated from all of the other air bladder cells in the array. This construction enables each of the air bladder cells - through - to be separately inflated and deflated to individually adjustable bias or quiescent levels.","Apparatus  also has an inflation control apparatus  and a pressure wave generator  that enables air pressure pulses to be applied to individual air bladder cells  or groups of cells, in any desired combination and sequence.","Preferably, as shown in , traveling wave air mattress  includes a force sensor array . Force sensor array  is comprised of a group of individual flexible surface reaction force sensors - through -, each of which is fastened in vertical alignment with a separate one of air bladder cells - through -. Each sensor - through - is a two-terminal device which has a first output terminal --- that is connected to an individual lead wire - through -. Each sensor  also has a second output terminal --- which is connected to an individual lead wire - though -. Alternatively, the sensors - through - may be interconnected in an X-Y matrix, using 6 row-connector lead wires - through -, and 4 column-connector lead wires - through -.

As described above, the air bladder cell air pressure reduction traveling wave is directed to follow the patient reaction support force gradient vector. Accordingly, by temporarily reducing the inflation pressure of air bladder cells which are exerting the greatest support force concentrations on a patient's body, these forces, which could cause decubitus sores if left unabated for long periods of time, will be substantially reduced for time periods proportional to the product of the length of pressure reduction pulse  and the number of times per day that the traveling pressure pulse wave cycle is repeated.","In general, during the generation of a traveling body support-force wave by a sequence of pressure reduction pulses applied to air bladder cells , pressures exerted on a patient's body by other air bladder cells, in contrast to total support forces, may increase, since the total support-forces are proportional to the fixed weight of a patient supported by the mattress and hence are constant over time intervals.

Thus, if piston drive shaft  is pivotably joined to piston , force actuator  may consist of a rotary motor coupled to the outer end  of piston drive shaft  by an eccentric coupler such as a crank. However, in a preferred embodiment of pressure pulse generator , force actuator  has a different design and construction which provides more control of the characteristics of pressure pulses produced by movement of piston  in cylinder .","Thus, as shown in , piston drive shaft  of pressure pulse generator  has a hollow tubular construction which includes an elongated circular cross-section bore  that extends through the outer, rear transverse annular end wall  of the piston drive shaft.

Thus, as shown in , outlet port  of pressure pulse generator  is connected through a cylinder isolation valve  through a tubular connector fitting  to the inlet port  of a pulse selector valve array manifold . Cylinder isolation valve  has a value actuator control input terminal lead  which is connected to a command signal output terminal of wave generator controller A.","The pressure pulse generator  includes a cell pressure sampling pressure transducer  which has a pressure probe  that communicates with a hollow cylindrical bore space  of tubular fitting  that is located between pulse selector valve array manifold  and cylinder isolation valve .

If the measured air pressure in cylinder active chamber  is less than the quiescent air pressure in a selected air bladder cell , a command signal is issued to stepper motor controller  which causes piston drive shaft  and piston  to be extended forward within cylinder  to increase air pressure in active chamber  of the cylinder until it is equal to the quiescent air pressure in the selected air bladder cell .","For example, piston  may be extended forward in cylinder bore  from position  to position  in . This longitudinal position of piston , where the pressures in cylinder  and a selected air bladder cell  are equalized, is defined as a first home position for the piston, prior to production of a pulse of pressurized by air pressure pulse generator , and introduction of the pulse of pressurized air into a selected air bladder cell . Cylinder bleed valve  may also receive command signals from wave generator controller A to enable air flow between cylinder chamber  and the atmosphere, to thus facilitate pressure equalization.","Fifth, as shown in , cylinder isolation valve  is opened in response to a command signal issued through waves generator controller A by computer , which also causes a command signal to issue to stepper motor driver . If the command signal from computer  is to reduce air pressure in a selected air bladder cell  by producing a negative pressure pulse, piston  is retracted to a position such as positions ,  or . If the command signal from computer  is to increase pressure in a selected air bladder cell , piston  is extended forward to a longitudinal location such as position  in . In either case, cylinder isolation valve  and optional manifold isolation valve  remain open during the initial movement of piston .","Sixth, at a predetermined time at which a pulse of air pressure into an air bladder cell is to be terminated, piston  is commanded to move in a direction opposite to its direction at the beginning of an air pressure pulse. For example, if the air pressure in a selected air bladder cell is to be restored to the value which it had at the beginning of a pressure pulse, piston  would be returned to the initial home position, such as location  in . However, if it is desired to return the air pressure in a selected air bladder cell  to a new quiescent value different from an original quiescent value, piston  is moved to a different location at the end of a pressure-pulse cycle.","Seventh, at a predetermined time period after piston  has ceased movement at the end of a pressure pulse cycle, pulse selector valve , optional manifold isolation valve , and cylinder isolation valve  are closed in response to command signals received from wave generator controller A.","As shown in , the output port of each pulse selector valve  is coupled to the inlet port  of an air bladder cell  through the input tube  and a Y-coupler  which also has an input tube  which is coupled to an inflation control apparatus  that is used to initially inflate the air bladder cells to initial quiescent pressure values which provide comfortable support to a patient. However, pressure pulse generator  may optionally be used to inflate and deflate air bladder cells  to initial quiescent pressure values prior to initiation of the seven-step wave generation process described above.","With this optional configuration, pulse selector valves  perform a dual function, initially adjusting quiescent pressure levels in individual air bladder cells , and subsequently introducing a sequence of pressure pulses into the air bladder cells to create a traveling support force wave. Thus, with this optional configuration, the requirement for a separate inflation control apparatus  and Y-couplers  is eliminated, and each pulse selector valve  is connected directly to the port  of an air bladder cell .","The pressure pulse generator  of the pressure wave generator  described above requires a piston\/cylinder displacement volume at least as large as the maximum volume of air which is intended to be simultaneously input to or removed from one or more air bladder cells  or  Consequently, pressure pulse generator  is ideally suited for use with air mattresses having a relatively large number e.g., 12 to 24 or more, of relatively small air bladder cells. However, for air mattresses which have a relatively small number, e.g.,  to  of relatively large air bladder cells, the displacement requirements for single piston stroke deflation or inflation of one or more air bladder cells may require that the displacement volume and hence size of cylinder  of air pulse generator be undesirably large for some applications.","For example, for an air mattresses  of the type shown in  which has 6 air bladder cells  which have a semi-cylindrical shape when inflated to a normal bias pressure of 14.7 lbs.\/in(101.3 kPascals), i.e., 1 atmosphere, a diameter of 13 inches and a lateral length of 3 feet, the volume of each air bladder cell would be about 1.276 cubic feet. Therefore, the volume of cylinder  of air pulse generator  shown in  would need to be 1.276 cubic feet or larger, if operation of the pulse generator required complete deflation or re-inflation of a single air bladder cell  with a single stroke of piston  within cylinder . An embodiment of a wave generator of the present invention which is useful for creating traveling support force waves in air mattresses having relatively large air bladder cells is shown in .","As shown in , an embodiment of wave generator  for deflating and re-inflating air bladder cells  of a relatively large air mattress  of the type shown in  has an air pulse generator  that includes an air pump  which has a vacuum inlet port  and a pressure output port . An example of a suitable type of air pump  for use in the present application is a linear air pump which uses a magnet moving in response to time varying electromagnetic force fields produced by an alternating current to drive a piston in a reciprocating motion within a cylinder. Such pumps are described in further detail in \u201cMechanisms And Mechanical Devices Sourcebook.\u201d 5Edition by Neil Sclater, McGraw-Hill, New York 2011, page 374.","As can be envisioned by referring to , when a piston  moves inwardly within cylinder  of air pump  in response to an attractive electromagnetic force, a negative pressure occurs in pump inlet port , which may draw air through the inlet port  and past an inlet flapper valve  into the head-space  between the piston  and the inlet port. During this first, inlet part of the air pump cycle, negative pressure within head space  of air pump  also draws an outlet flapper valve  inwardly to a closed position which seals off communication between the pump head-space and outlet port .","Conversely, when piston  moves outwardly in response to a repulsive electromagnetic force, a positive pressure pulse is produced in head space  of cylinder . The positive pressure closes input flapper valve  and opens output flapper valve , through which a pulse of air at positive pressure is expelled through outlet port  of the air pump.","From the foregoing description, it can be readily understood that powering air pump  with alternating current at a 60 Hz line frequency results in 60 pulses per second of negative air pressure occurring in inlet port  of the pump, and positive pulses of air pressure occurring in outlet port  at the same frequency but shifted 180 degrees in phase from the negative air pulses at inlet port .","As shown in , traveling wave generator  includes a pressure pulse routing assembly  comprised of routing valves and air conduits which are interconnected between linear air pump  of air pulse generator , and pulse selector valves  on pulse selector manifold . Pressure-pulse routing assembly  connects negative air pressure inlet port  of air pump  to a selected air bladder cell  during the initial, negative-going part of a negative pressure pulse applied to an air bladder cell, and connects the air bladder cell to positive pressure at outlet port  of the pump during the final, positive-going part of a negative pressure pulse.","As shown in , pressure-pulse routing assembly  includes three 2-way or diverter-type valves which are all similar in construction and function. Thus, as shown in , wave generator apparatus  includes a first, pump inlet router valve  which has an output port  that is connected to inlet port  of pump  by a tubular pressure-tight tube . Pump inlet router valve  has a first, upper selector-manifold inlet port  which is connected to a second, selector manifold router valve . Selector manifold router valve  is connected to inlet port  of manifold  by a tubular pressure-tight tube . Pump inlet router valve  also has a second, supply-air inlet port .","As shown in , pump inlet router valve  has an internal valve plate  which is pivotably movable by a solenoid actuator  in response to an electrical control signal input to an input terminal  of the actuator, which is connected by an electrical wire to a first valve control output port  of wave generator controller A.","As shown in , valve plate  has a first pivotable position in which the valve plate is pivoted counterclockwise to block air flow to supply-air inlet port , and to permit air flow between selector manifold inlet port  and outlet port  of the valve. In this position, negative air pressure pulses at inlet port  of pump  are transmitted through pump inlet router valve , through selector manifold router valve , and through a pulse selector valve  of pulse selector manifold  to a selected air bladder cell , thus enabling air to be withdrawn from the air bladder cell through the port  of the air bladder cell, which is connected to the selector valve during the first, negative going part of a negative pressure pulse produced by air pump .","Since, as pointed out above, the air pump  produces a sequence of pressure pulses at a line frequency rate, e.g., 60 Hz, a negative pressure pulse selected by wave generator controller A to have a length of 1 second, for example, will actually consist of 1 second long pulse modulated at 60 Hz, i.e., a one-second long train of 60 pulses.","As shown in , air flow from a selected air bladder cell  and pulse selector valve  is routed through selector manifold router valve . Pulse selector manifold router valve  has a common outlet port  which is connected by a hermetically sealed coupling to input port  of pulse selector manifold . Pulse selector manifold router valve has a first, upper outlet port  which is connected to upper inlet port  of pump inlet router valve  by a tubular pressure-tight coupler . Pulse selector manifold router valve  also has a second, lower outlet port .","As shown in , pulse selector manifold router valve  has an internal valve plate  which is pivotably moveable by a solenoid actuator  in response to an electrical control signal input to an input terminal  of the actuator which is connected by an electrical wire to a second valve control output port  of wave generator controller A.","As shown in , valve plate  has a first pivotable position in which the valve plate is pivoted clockwise to block air flow between lower output pulse selector manifold port  and lower port  of pulse selector manifold router valve . As shown in , with valve plate  in this position, there is an unobstructed air flow path between manifold output port , through valve  to input port  of pump inlet valve , and thence into inlet port  of pump ,","Referring again to , it may be seen that pulse routing assembly  of wave generator  includes a third, pump outlet router valve  which has an inlet port  that is connected to outlet port  of pump  by a tubular pressure-tight tube . Pump outlet router valve  has a first, upper outlet port  which is connected by a tubular pressure-tight tube  to the lower inlet port  of pulse selector manifold router valve .

A second port  of coupler  is coupled through a tube  to lower input port  of pump inlet router valve . A third port of coupler  is coupled through a tube  to the inlet port  of a pneumatic accumulator or receiver . Thus, as shown in , during the initial, negative-going half of a negative air pressure pulse applied to an air bladder cell  to withdraw air and reduce the inflation pressure of the cell, withdrawn air is routed into accumulator . Optionally, accumulator  may consist of one or more separate air bladder cells which are similar in construction to the individual air bladder cells  of air mattress .

Thus, as shown in , flip-flop FF2 may be toggled at the end of each 10 or 20 pulses  to thus switch between active and passive deflation modes as desired to thereby increase resolution in determination of the of differences in weight loading of the air bladder cells .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0235","num":"0252"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["510","2","3","5","6"]}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","Wave Generator Operation Sequence"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 11A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 11B","FIG. 11A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 21A","FIG. 17","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 21B","FIG. 21A","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 21C","FIG. 17","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 21D","FIG. 17"],"b":["1","3","19","2","4","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 21E","FIG. 21B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 21F","FIG. 21A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIGS. 12 and 18"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
