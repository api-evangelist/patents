title: Selective state transitions of a user equipment within a wireless communications system
abstract: In an embodiment, a user equipment (UE) determines that a client application has entered a period of transmission inactivity whereby the UE will not be required to transmit data on behalf of the client application. The UE selectively transmits a transmission inactivity notification to an access network (AN) to notify the AN of the transmission inactivity period. The AN receives the transmission inactivity notification and determines to transition the UE from a first state to a second state based at least in part on the received transmission inactivity notification, the second state associated with lower-power consumption of the UE than the first state. The AN sends instructions to the UE to facilitate the transition of the UE from the first state to the second state. In another embodiment, the AN can send instructions to the UE to prohibit the UE from sending transmission inactivity notifications.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the invention relate to selective state transitions of a user equipment (UE) within a wireless communications system.","2. Relevant Background","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In W-CDMA wireless communication systems, user equipments (UEs) receive signals from fixed position Node Bs (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Node Bs provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the Node Bs generally interacts with UEs through an over the air interface and with the RAN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as W-CDMA, CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (e.g., UEs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","In an embodiment, a user equipment (UE) determines that a client application has entered a period of transmission inactivity whereby the UE will not be required to transmit data on behalf of the client application. The UE selectively transmits a transmission inactivity notification to an access network (AN) to notify the AN of the transmission inactivity period. The AN receives the transmission inactivity notification and determines to transition the UE from a first state to a second state based at least in part on the received transmission inactivity notification, the second state associated with lower-power consumption of the UE than the first state. The AN sends instructions to the UE to facilitate the transition of the UE from the first state to the second state. In another embodiment, the AN can send instructions to the UE to prohibit the UE from sending transmission inactivity notifications.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as user equipment (UE), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more access points (APs), which may be referred to as Node Bs. A UE transmits and receives data packets through one or more of the Node Bs to a Radio Network Controller (RNC). The Node Bs and RNC are parts of a network called a radio access network (RAN). A radio access network can transport voice and data packets between multiple UEs.","The radio access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio access network, such core network including specific carrier related servers and devices and connectivity to other networks such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, public switched telephone network (PSTN), a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN), a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN), and may transport voice and data packets between each UE and such networks. A UE that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more Node Bs may be referred to as an active UE, and can be referred to as being in a traffic state. A UE that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel (TCH) connection with one or more Node Bs can be referred to as being in a connection setup state. A UE may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel. A UE may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash device, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the UE sends signals to the Node B(s) is called an uplink channel (e.g., a reverse traffic channel, a control channel, an access channel, etc.). The communication link through which Node B(s) send signals to a UE is called a downlink channel (e.g., a paging channel, a control channel, a broadcast channel, a forward traffic channel, etc.). As used herein the term traffic channel (TCH) can refer to either an uplink\/reverse or downlink\/forward traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless communications system  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote UEs, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, core network , the Internet, PSTN, SGSN, GGSN and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a RNC . The RNC  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN) and the UEs \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the RNC  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the RNC  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The core network  may communicate with the RNC  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the RNC  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the core network  and the RNC  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The RNC  can be connected to multiple Node Bs . In a similar manner to the core network , the RNC  is typically connected to the Node Bs  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The Node Bs  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the UEs, such as cellular telephone . The Node Bs , RNC  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the RNC  and one or more of the Node Bs  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the RNC  and the Node B(s) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["126","126","160","165","175","175"]},"Generally, GPRS is a protocol used by Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) phones for transmitting Internet Protocol (IP) packets. The GPRS Core Network (e.g., the GGSN  and one or more SGSNs ) is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W-CDMA based 3G networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network, provides mobility management, session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W-CDMA networks.","The GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users (e.g., access terminals) of a GSM or W-CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the internet as if from one location at the GGSN . This is achieved transferring the subscriber's data from the subscriber's current SSGN  to the GGSN , which is handling the subscriber's session.","Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network; namely, (i) GTP-U, (ii) GTP-C and (iii) GTP\u2032 (GTP Prime). GTP-U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol (PDP) context. GTP-C is used for control signaling (e.g., setup and deletion of PDP contexts, verification of GSN reach-ability, updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another, etc.). GTP\u2032 is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.","Referring to , the GGSN  acts as an interface between the GPRS backbone network (not shown) and the external packet data network . The GGSN  extracts the packet data with associated packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or PPP) from the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN , and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN  to the SGSN  which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer (RAB) of the destination UE served by the RAN . Thereby, the GGSN  stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and his\/her profile in its location register (e.g., within a PDP context). The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected UE. The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.","The SGSN  is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network , in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN  includes packet routing and transfer, mobility management (e.g., attach\/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, PDP address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN , for example, within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus, SGSNs are responsible for (i) de-tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN , (ii) uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN , (iii) carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and (iv) billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, aside from (i)-(iv), SGSNs configured for GSM\/EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W-CDMA networks.","The RAN  (e.g., or UTRAN, in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) system architecture) communicates with the SGSN  via a Iu interface, with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN  communicates with the GGSN  via a Gn interface, which is an IP-based interface between SGSN  and other SGSNs (not shown) and internal GGSNs, and uses the GTP protocol defined above (e.g., GTP-U, GTP-C, GTP\u2032, etc.). While not shown in , the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System (DNS). The GGSN  is connected to a Public Data Network (PDN) (not shown), and in turn to the Internet , via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway.","The PDP context is a data structure present on both the SGSN  and the GGSN  which contains a particular UE's communication session information when the UE has an active GPRS session. When a UE wishes to initiate a GPRS communication session, the UE must first attach to the SGSN  and then activate a PDP context with the GGSN . This allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN  that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN  serving the UE's access point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["100","1","120","1","3","120","162","162","188","175","182","184","186","170","2","5","120","164","162","164","188","175","182","184","186","170","4","175","175"]},"Referring to , UEs ,  and  . . . N are illustrated as wireless cell-phones, UE  is illustrated as a wireless tablet-PC and UE  is illustrated as a wired desktop station. However, in other embodiments, it will be appreciated that the wireless communication system  can connect to any type of UE, and the examples illustrated in  are not intended to limit the types of UEs that may be implemented within the system. Also, while the AAA , the provisioning server , the IMS\/SIP registration server  and the application server  are each illustrated as structurally separate servers, one or more of these servers may be consolidated in at least one embodiment of the invention.","Further, referring to , the application server  is illustrated as including a plurality of media control complexes (MCCs)  . . . N B, and a plurality of regional dispatchers  . . . N A. Collectively, the regional dispatchers A and MCCs B are included within the application server , which in at least one embodiment can correspond to a distributed network of servers that collectively functions to arbitrate communication sessions (e.g., half-duplex group communication sessions via IP unicasting and\/or IP multicasting protocols) within the wireless communication system . For example, because the communication sessions arbitrated by the application server  can theoretically take place between UEs located anywhere within the system , multiple regional dispatchers A and MCCs are distributed to reduce latency for the arbitrated communication sessions (e.g., so that a MCC in North America is not relaying media back-and-forth between session participants located in China). Thus, when reference is made to the application server , it will be appreciated that the associated functionality can be enforced by one or more of the regional dispatchers A and\/or one or more of the MCCs B. The regional dispatchers A are generally responsible for any functionality related to establishing a communication session (e.g., handling signaling messages between the UEs, scheduling and\/or sending announce messages, etc.), whereas the MCCs B are responsible for hosting the communication session for the duration of the call instance, including conducting an in-call signaling and an actual exchange of media during an arbitrated communication session.","Referring to , a UE , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the core network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) , or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (API)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include a UE including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the UE  in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the UE  or  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), W-CDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. For example, in W-CDMA, the data communication is typically between the client device , Node B(s) , and the RNC . The RNC  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the core network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, a SGSN, a GGSN and the like, thus allowing the UE  or  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.","Below, embodiments of the invention are generally described in accordance with W-CDMA protocols and associated terminology (e.g., such as UE instead of mobile station (MS), mobile unit (MU), access terminal (AT), etc., RNC, contrasted with BSC in EV-DO, or Node B, contrasted with BS or MPT\/BS in EV-DO, etc.). However, it will be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art how the embodiments of the invention can be applied in conjunction with wireless communication protocols other than W-CDMA.","In a conventional server-arbitrated communication session (e.g., via half-duplex protocols, full-duplex protocols, VoIP, a group session over IP unicast, a group session over IP multicast, a push-to-talk (PTT) session, a push-to-transfer (PTX) session, etc.), a session or call originator sends a request to initiate a communication session to the application server , which then forwards a call announcement message to the RAN  for transmission to one or more targets of the call.","User Equipments (UEs), in a Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) (e.g., the RAN ) may be in either an idle mode or a radio resource control (RRC) connected mode.","Based on UE mobility and activity while in a RRC connected mode, the RAN  may direct UEs to transition between a number of RRC sub-states; namely, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH, CELL_FACH, and CELL_DCH states, which may be characterized as follows:\n\n","Accordingly, URA_PCH State (or CELL_PCH State) corresponds to a dormant state where the UE periodically wakes up to check a paging indicator channel (PICH) and, if needed, the associated downlink paging channel (PCH), and it may enter CELL_FACH state to send a Cell Update message for the following event: cell reselection, periodical cell update, uplink data transmission, paging response, re-entered service area. In CELL_FACH State, the UE may send messages on the random access channel (RACH), and may monitor a forward access channel (FACH). The FACH carries downlink communication from the RAN , and is mapped to a secondary common control physical channel (S-CCPCH). From CELL_FACH State, the UE may enter CELL_DCH state after a traffic channel (TCH) has been obtained based on messaging in CELL_FACH state. A table showing conventional dedicated traffic channel (DTCH) to transport channel mappings in radio resource control (RRC) connected mode, is in Table 1 as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0053"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"DTCH to Transport Channel mappings in RRC connected mode"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"RACH","FACH","DCH","E-DCH","HS-DSCH"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["CELL_DCH","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":["CELL_FACH","Yes","Yes","No","Yes (rel. 8)","Yes (rel. 7)"]},{"entry":["CELL_PCH","No","No","No","No","Yes (rel. 7)"]},{"entry":["URA_PCH","No","No","No","No","No"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Communication sessions arbitrated by the application server , in at least one embodiment, may be associated with delay-sensitive or high-priority applications and\/or services. For example, the application server  may correspond to a PTT server in at least one embodiment, and it will be appreciated that an important criterion in PTT sessions is fast session set-up as well as maintaining a given level of Quality of Service (QoS) throughout the session.","As discussed above, in RRC connected mode, a given UE can operate in either CELL_DCH or CELL_FACH to exchange data with the RAN , through which the given UE can reach the application server . As noted above, in CELL_DCH state, uplink\/downlink Radio bearers will consume dedicated physical channel resources (e.g., UL DCH, DL DCH, E-DCH, F-DPCH, HS-DPCCH etc). Some of these resources are even consumed for high speed shared channel (i.e., HSDPA) operations. In CELL_FACH state, uplink\/downlink Radio bearers will be mapped to common transport channels (RACH\/FACH). Thereby, in CELL_FACH state there is no consumption of dedicated physical channel resources.","Conventionally, the RAN  transitions the given UE between CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH based substantially on traffic volume, which is either measured at the RAN  (e.g., at the serving RNC  at the RAN ) or reported from the given UE itself in one or more measurement reports. Specifically, the RAN  can conventionally be configured to transition a particular UE to CELL_DCH state from CELL_FACH state when the UE's associated traffic volume as measured and\/or reported in the uplink or as measured and\/or reported in the downlink is higher than the one or more of the Event thresholds used by the RAN  for making CELL_DCH state transition decisions.","As noted above, the UE's state (e.g., CELL_DCH, CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH) can be determined based in part on the amount of uplink data to be sent by the originating UE. For example, the standard defines an Event threshold for triggering a Traffic Volume Measurement (TVM) report. The Event threshold is specified in the standard, and is used by the UE for triggering Traffic Volume Measurement Report, which summarizes the buffer occupancy of each uplink Radio Bearer.","Other parameters which are not defined in the standard are an uplink Event threshold for triggering the state transition of a given UE to CELL_DCH state, and a downlink Event threshold for triggering the state transition of the given UE to CELL_DCH state. As will be appreciated, the uplink and downlink Event thresholds being \u2018undefined\u2019 in the standard means that the respective thresholds can vary from vendor to vendor, or from implementation to implementation at different RANs.","Referring to the uplink Event threshold, in CELL_FACH state, if the reported uplink buffer occupancy of each Radio Bearer exceeds the uplink Event threshold, the RNC  moves the UE to CELL_DCH. In an example, this decision may be made based on the aggregated buffer occupancy or individual Radio Bearer buffer occupancy. If aggregated buffer occupancy is used for deciding the CELL_DCH transition, the same threshold for triggering TVM can be used. Similarly, referring to the downlink Event threshold, in CELL_FACH state, if the downlink buffer occupancy of the Radio Bearers of the UE exceeds the downlink Event threshold, the RNC  moves the UE to CELL_DCH state. In an example, this decision may be done based on the aggregated buffer occupancy or individual Radio Bearer buffer occupancy.","As will be appreciated, UEs generally consume more power during operation in CELL_DCH state as compared to CELL_FACH state, and UEs also generally consume more power during operation in CELL_FACH state as compared to CELL_PCH and\/or URA_PCH states. Thus, aside from consuming more system resources, maintaining UEs in more active RRC-states decreases their associated battery life.","Conventionally, the RAN  (i.e., the serving RNC for a particular UE) does not evaluate application-specific information for determining RRC-state transitions. Instead, the serving RNC simply evaluates the UL or DL traffic volume as noted above, or alternatively maintains a traffic inactivity timer associated with the UE's RRC-connection. Embodiments of the invention are directed to using application-specific information in order to improve the RRC-state transition decisions at the RAN  so as to increase battery life associated with UEs. For example, UEs in CELL_DCH state to support a communication session for a Web-browsing client application may benefit from a relatively long traffic inactivity timer before the RAN  triggers a RRC-state transition of the UEs to CELL_FACH state, CELL_PCH state and\/or URA_PCH state. On the other hand, UEs in CELL_DCH state that are executing a client application associated with bursty-traffic (e.g., periodically pulling E-mails from an E-mail server, sending periodic keep-alive packets, etc.) can operate with a shorter traffic inactivity timer so as to conserve battery life at the UEs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","170","120","405","120","170","410","405","410","170","170","405","410","170"]},"Referring to , the given client application determines to stop transmitting the periodic data in A. In other words, one particular instance of the periodic data transmission completes or terminates, and the given client application does not have additional data to send at this point (at least, until a next periodic data transmission). The given client application may subsequently notify the RRC protocol in the given UE about the periodic data transmission termination plus the next point in the time, if known or configured, that the given client application is expected to have data to transmit to the application server  (i.e., an estimated duration of the transmission inactivity period), A.","The given UE compares the estimated duration of the transmission inactivity period, as indicated by the given client application, with a transmission inactivity period threshold to determine whether to report the estimated transmission inactivity period to the given UE's serving RNC at the RAN , A. For example, it will be appreciated that transitions from CELL_DCH state to another RRC-state (e.g., CELL_FACH state, CELL_PCH state, URA_PCH state, etc.) take a certain amount of time to complete (e.g., 100 ms), such that it is inefficient to transition the given UE to another RRC-state if the given UE is expected to be transmitting data again before the transmission inactivity period threshold. As will be described below with respect to , the transmission inactivity period threshold can be established at the given UE based on instructions from the serving RNC at the RAN .
