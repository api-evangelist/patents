In particular, the present technology relates to methods and compositions for screening, identifying and designing compounds that interact with human mitoNEET.","Diabetes is the fifth most common cause of death and was responsible for over 5% of worldwide deaths in 2000 (Roglic, G.: Unwin, N.; Bennett, P. H.; Mathers, C.; Tuomilehto, J.; Nag, S.; Connelly, V.; King, H; 2005, 28, 2130-2135). Type II Diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance of the peripheral tissues, including the skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose. The resulting hyperglycemia is often accompanied by defective lipid metabolism that can lead to cardiovascular complications such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. Accordingly, it often leads to serious complications such as renal disease, blindness, heart disease and stroke, and the treatment of diabetes annually incurs nearly 100 billion dollars of medical costs in the United States alone (Saltiel, A. R.; 2001, 104, 517-529).","The most broadly successful class of drugs used to treat type II diabetes is the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), some examples of which are pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (trade names Actos and Avandia, respectively). The antidiabetic activity of TZDs was first elucidated in the 1970s, where they were first identified as high affinity ligands for the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) (Colca, J. R.; Kletzien, R. F.; 2006, 15, 205-210, Lehmann, J. M.; Moore, L. B.; Smitholiver, T. A.; Wilkison, W. O.; Willson, T. M.; Kliewer, S. A., 1995, 270, 12953-12956).","However, the link between TZDs, PPAR\u03b3, and antidiabetic benefits came into question and ultimately led to the identification of a previously unknown outer mitochondrial membrane protein that directly binds to TZDs (Colca, J. R.; Kletzien, R. F., 2006, 15, 205-210, Also known as CISD1 (CDGSH Iron Sulfur Domain 1), ZCD1, C10orf70, MGC14684, MDS029, Colca, J. R.; McDonald, W. G.; Waldon, D. J.; Leone J. W.; Lull, J. M.; Bannow, C. A.; Lund, E. T.; Mathews, W. R., 2004, 286, E252-E260). The outer mitochondrial membrane protein was named mitoNEET based on its subcellular localization (mito) and the presence of the amino acid sequence Asn-Glu-Glu-Thr (NEET).","MitoNEET is an integral protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), as shown by immuno-electron microscopy and fractionation of highly purified rat liver mitochondria. An amino terminal signal sequence within the first 32 residues, containing a predicted transmembrane domain, targets mitoNEET to the outer membrane. The orientation of mitoNEET towards the cytoplasm was established by proteolytic digestion of the protein on intact rat liver mitochondria.","Mitochondrial dysfunction has been further associated with insulin resistance and the development of type II diabetes (Stark, R. & Roden, M. (2007) 37, 236-248). Some studies indicate that disease pathogenesis involves diminished mitochondrial oxidative capacity in insulin sensitive tissues, and agents, such as TZDs, are known to enhance oxidative capacity and normalize lipid metabolism (Bandyopadhyay, G K, Yu, J G, Ofrecio, J, & Olefsky, J M (2006) 55, 2277-2285; Bogacka, I, Xie, H, Bray, G A, & Smith, S R (2005) 54, 1392-1399). Moreover, deficiency of mitoNEET in mice results in a compromise in the respiratory capacity of heart mitochondria (Wiley, S E, Murphy, A N, Ross, S A, van der Geer, P, & Dixon, J E (2007) 104, 5318-5323). Accordingly, mitoNEET is a candidate target for drugs to treat several disorders including type II diabetes.","Some embodiments relate to a crystal containing a human mitoNEET protein, in which the crystal effectively diffracts X-rays for the determination of the atomic coordinates of the mitoNEET protein to a resolution of greater than about 1.5 \u212b. In some such embodiments, the human mitoNEET protein includes SEQ ID NO: 1, or an amino acid sequence having at least 85% amino acid identity to the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 1.","In more embodiments, a crystal can have an orthorhombic space group P212121 and unit cell dimensions of about a=46.8 \u212b, b=49.6 \u212b, and c=59.0 \u212b. In even more embodiments, a crystal can have a three dimensional structure characterized by the atomic coordinates of Table 2. In certain embodiments, a crystal can contain a human mitoNEET protein having tertiary structure containing a NEET fold. In exemplary embodiments, a crystal can contain a truncated human mitoNEET protein.","Some methods relate to methods for designing a compound that binds human mitoNEET protein with steps that can include: accessing at least a portion of the data of Table 2; and modeling the binding of the compound to human mitoNEET utilizing the data. In more methods, the modeling further includes predicting the likelihood of the compound increasing 2Fe-2S cluster stability in a human mitoNEET protein. More embodiments include methods further including testing the stability of the 2Fe-2S cluster in the presence of the compound.","In some methods the compound is designed de novo. In other embodiments, the compound is designed from a known chemical entity or a fragment thereof. In some such methods, the known chemical entity or a fragment thereof includes a thiazolidinedione. In further embodiments, the thiazolidinedione is selected from the group consisting of pioglitazone, troglitazone, rivoglitazone, and rosiglitazone.","Some embodiments relate to methods for identifying a compound for use in the treatment of a mitoNEET-associated disorder that include the steps of accessing at least a portion of the data of Table 2; and modeling the binding of the compound to human mitoNEET utilizing the data, in which the mitoNEET-associated disorder is selected from the group consisting of type II diabetes, insulin resistance, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Some embodiments relate to compounds identified by accessing at least a portion of the data of Table 2; and modeling the binding of the compound to human mitoNEET utilizing the data.","More embodiments relate to computer readable media containing the atomic coordinates of Table 2. Even more embodiments relate to methods for using computer readable media containing the atomic coordinates of Table 2 with steps that include: loading the co-ordinates of Table 2 into memory; processing the co-ordinates to create a three dimensional representation; and displaying the three dimensional representation on a display.","Some embodiments relate to methods for screening for an agent that modulates 2Fe-2S cluster stability in mitoNEET with steps that include: selecting or designing a candidate agent by performing structure based drug design with a computer system encoded with computer readable data containing atomic coordinate data or binding site data or both, in which the selecting step is performed in conjunction with computer modeling; contacting the candidate agent with mitoNEET; and detecting the ability of the candidate agent to modulate 2Fe-2S cluster stability.","Certain embodiments relate to methods for identifying a compound which stabilizes the 2Fe-2S cluster with one or more steps that include comparing the stability of said 2Fe-2S cluster in the presence and absence of said compound. In some such methods, the stability is measured in vitro, and in particular, using spectroscopic methods.","The present technology relates to methods and compositions for screening, identifying, and designing compounds that interact with mitoNEET. Such methods include identifying compounds that can be useful to treat metabolic dysfunctional disorders, such as type II diabetes. More methods can include screening, identifying, and designing compounds that stabilize the 2Fe-2S cluster of mitoNEET.","Iron sulfur (Fe\u2014S) proteins are key players in vital processes involving energy homeostasis and metabolism from the simplest to most complex organisms. Described herein is a 1.5 \u212b X-ray crystal structure of mitoNEET, an outer mitochondrial membrane Fe\u2014S protein.","The mitoNEET protein is composed of two protomers intertwined to form a dimeric structure that contains a NEET fold. The protomers form a two-domain structure with a beta cap domain and a cluster binding domain. The cluster binding domain is composed of 3 cysteine residues and 1 histidine residue, and coordinates two acid-labile 2Fe-2S clusters (). This domain is unique among 2Fe-2S cluster binding proteins, which have previously been observed primarily with 4(Cys) or 2(Cys)2(His) ligation environments, referred to as ferredoxins and Rieske-type proteins, respectively.","The biophysical properties of mitoNEET suggest that it may play a role in metal-cluster transfer or electron transfer reactions (Paddock, M. L.; Wiley, S. E.; Axelrod, H. L.; Cohen, A. E.; Roy, M.; Abresch, E. C.; Capraro, D.; Murphy, A. N.; Nechushtai, R.; Dixon, J. E.; Jennings, P. A.; 2007, 104, 14342-14347). In both cases, the protonation state of the ligating histidine residue is significant because the cationic form of the residue at low pH likely facilitates release of the metal cluster and different protonation states may tune the redox potential (Beharry, Z. M.; Eby, D. M.; Couter, E. D.; Viswanathan, R.; Neidle, E. L.; Phillips, R. S.; Kurtz, D. M.; 2003 42, 13625-13636).","Initial spectroscopic work has been performed on mitoNEET using techniques such as visible absorption, NMR, EPR, and mass spectrometry (Paddock, M. L.; Wiley, S. E.; Axelrod, H. L.; Cohen, A. E.; Roy, M.; Abresch, E. C.; Capraro, D.; Murphy, A. N.; Nechushtai, R.; Dixon, J. E.; Jennings, P. A.; 2007, 104, 14342-14347; Wiley, S. E.; Paddock, M. L.; Abresch, E. C.; Gross L.; van der Geer, P.; Nechushtai, R.; Murphy A. N.; Jennings, P. A.; Dixon J. E.; 2007, 282, 23745-23749). The absorption spectrum of mitoNEET has a peak near 460 nm attributed to the 2Fe-2S cluster that is reversibly reduced by dithionite and oxygen. The cluster is labile at pH\u22668.0 as shown by the loss of the spectral signature and of the 2Fe and 2S as shown by mass spectroscopy (Wiley, S E, Paddock, M L, Abresch, E C, Gross, L, van der Geer, P, Nechushtai, R, Murphy, A N, Jennings, P A, & Dixon, J E (2007) J Biol. Chem., 282 (33): 23745-9).","The mitoNEET protein interacts with pioglitazone, a member of the TZD family of compounds. TZDs have been used to treat disorders including type II diabetes. As described further herein, binding of pioglitazone, stabilizes mitoNEET against 2Fe-2S cluster release. Without wishing to be bound to any one theory, such stabilization may be a mechanism by which compounds such as TZDs can have a therapeutic effect. However, stabilization of the 2Fe-2S cluster in mitoNEET may be one of several effects that compounds such as TZDs can have on mitoNEET.","The following description includes methods and compositions for screening, identifying, and designing compounds that interact with mitoNEET.","MitoNEET Crystals","Some embodiments disclosed herein relate to crystals of mitoNEET. The crystals can contain a structure that can be characterized as a NEET fold. An example of preparing crystals can be found in Example 1.","In some embodiments a crystal can contain the human mitoNEET protein in which the crystal can be used to diffract X-rays to determine the atomic coordinates of the mitoNEET protein to a resolution less than about 5 \u212b, less than about 2 \u212b, less than about 1.5 \u212b, less than about 1 Angstrom. In such embodiments, the human mitoNEET protein can comprise a polypeptide with at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, and at least 99%, identity to SEQ ID No.: 1. In more embodiments, a mitoNEET crystal can comprise a polypeptide with 100% identity to SEQ ID No.: 1. In more embodiments, the polypeptide can contain insertions, deletions, and\/or mutations.","MitoNEET X-Ray Crystallography Data","Some embodiments relate to methods utilizing data obtained from mitoNEET crystals. Specific details of crystallographic analysis can be found in Example 1. A summary of crystal parameters for an exemplary mitoNEET polypeptide can be found in Example 1, Table 1; crystal coordinates are provided in Table 2. Table 2 contains header information describing the structure determination in rows beginning with \u201c\u201cREMARK,\u201d \u201cCISPEP,\u201d and \u201cSCALE.\u201d Subsequent to these headers, Column 1 indicates the presence of an atom, Column 2 shows the serial number or atom number, Column 3 the atom name, Column 4 the residue name and polypeptide chain A or polypeptide chain B, Column 5 the residue number, Column 6 the X coordinate, Column 7 the Y coordinate, Column 8 the Z coordinate, Column 9 the atomic occupancy, Column 10 the temperature factor, and Column 11 the chain ID. Figures were generated using the X-ray crystallographic data, including , , A-C, A-F, and A-B.","The crystal coordinates shown in Table 2 provide a measure of atomic location in \u212b. The coordinates are a relative set of positions that define a shape in three dimensions. An entirely different set of coordinates having a different origin and\/or axes may define a similar or identical shape. However, varying the relative atomic positions of the atoms of the structure so that the root mean square deviation of the conserved residue backbone atoms, namely, the nitrogen-carbon-carbon backbone atoms of the protein amino acid residues, is less than 1.5 \u212b, when superimposed on the coordinates provided in Table 2 for the conserved residue backbone atoms, may generally result in structures which are substantially the same as the structure defined by Table 2 in terms of both its structural characteristics and its usefulness for structure-based drug design. Thus, in some embodiments the coordinates of Table 2 can be transposed to a different origin and\/or axes; the relative atomic positions of the atoms of the structure are varied so that the root mean square deviation of conserved residue backbone atoms is less than 1.5 \u212b, when superimposed on the coordinates provided in Table 2 for the conserved residue backbone atoms; and\/or the number and\/or positions of water molecules is varied. References herein to the coordinates of Table 2, thus includes the coordinates in which one or more individual values of the Table 2 are varied in this way.","Modifications in the mitoNEET crystal structure due to, for example, mutations, additions, conservative and non-conservative substitutions, and\/or deletions of amino acid residues may account for variations in the mitoNEET atomic coordinates.","Identifying Compounds in Silico","Some embodiments described herein relate to methods for screening, identifying and\/or designing compounds that interact with mitoNEET. Such methods can include the step of accessing any portion of the data contained in Table 2, and modeling one or more compounds using that data. The modeling can include, for example, predicting the interactions between a compound and the mitoNEET protein. More exemplary embodiments can include predicting the interactions between a compound and a modified mitoNEET protein. The modified mitoNEET protein can be modified with one or more insertions, deletions and\/or mutations. Even more exemplary embodiments can include predicting the interactions between the mitoNEET protein and a TZD, such as pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, troglitazone, ciglitazone, or rivoglitazone. Even more exemplary embodiments can include predicting the likelihood of a compound increasing the stability of the 2Fe-2S cluster of mitoNEET.","Some embodiments include designing compounds using techniques of structure-based drug design. Structure-based drug design involves the rational design of ligand molecules to interact with the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of target receptors; the ultimate goal being to identify or design molecules with 3-D complementarity to the target protein, namely, mitoNEET (Kirkpatrick et al. (1999) Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2: 211-21). The accuracy required of a protein structure depends on the question addressed by the design process, with some processes predicated on the assumption that a lead molecule will need to complement a known binding site for a ligand precisely, or match the presumed transition state structure of a reaction closely (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75). Such cases call for an accurate model at the highest resolution possible. Alternatively, the design process may exploit the structure to indicate the general availability of space to fill, hydrogen bonds to make, or electrostatic interactions to optimize, in which case knowledge of the general topography of the binding site is often useful (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75).","Factors that affect the accuracy of structure-based drug design include aspects of the determination of the 3-D structure of proteins such as refinement, resolution, the number of restraints introduced in the structure analysis, statistical indicators of agreement between the model and the experimental data, and the conformity of the model to stereochemistry found in proteins in general (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75).","Most statistical parameters can be optimized, at least within the constraints of the data. However, if the data is of poor quality or the conformations are incorrect, particularly for the sidechains and loops, then it is difficult to optimize all of the parameters at the same time (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75). Computer programs are available to introduce a check on such parameters, including PROCHECK\u2122, which analyzes the distribution of a range of conformational parameters and compares them with expected distributions (Laskowski et al. (1993). J Appl. Crystallogr. 26:283).","Sequence-dependent indications of the probability that the structure is correct can be derived through a comparison of the local environment in the proposed structure to the propensity of an amino acid (Luthy et al. (1991) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 10: 229; Novotny et al. (1988) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 4: 19), the knowledge-based potential (Hendlich et al. (1990) J Mol. Biol. 216: 167), or the probability of amino acid substitution (Overington et al. (1990) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 241: 132; Topham et al. (1991) Biochem. Soc. Syrup. 57: 1) in the proposed structure.","Protein structures cannot generally be predicted by simulation of the folding pathway due to the fact that the forces between the atoms of the protein, and particularly with the surrounding solvent and counter-ions, are not well described (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75). However, some proteins belong to families with a common fold, including more than 1500 groups of homologous proteins that can be recognized by sequence searches alone, and over 500 that have common topologies or folds (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75).","Profiles or templates are useful in the search for the common fold and alignment of sequences for proteins with sequence identities of <30% (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75). Structural information can be used to identify key features in protein architecture and then to associate these with invariant or conserved sequences (Bedarkar et al. (1977) Nature 270: 449; Eigenbrot et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 221; 15). Projection of the restraints of the 3-D fold onto the one dimension of the sequence and comparison to sequence templates or profiles provides a more systematic approach (Sali et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 212: 403).","The template search can also be approached by determining the propensity of an amino acid to occur in each class of local structural environment defined by solvent accessibility and secondary structure, or by calculation of amino acid substitution tables as a function of local environment (Bowie et al. (1991) Science 253: 164; Johnson et al. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 231: 735; Luthy et al. (1991) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 10: 229; Overington et al. (1990) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 241: 132).","The 3-D structure of a protein can also be predicted by using information derived from the identification of a new sequence with a known fold (Summers et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196: 175; Sutcliffe et al. (1987) Protein Eng. 1: 385). Some methods depend on the assembly of rigid fragments to select sets of fragments that define the framework: the structurally variable (mainly loop) regions and the sidechains (Blundell et al. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 172: 513; Blundell et al. (1987) Nature 326: 347; Claessens et al. (1989) Protein Eng. 2: 335; Jones et al. EMBO J. 5: 819; Topham et al. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 229: 194). Such modeling procedures are very successful when the percentage sequence identity to the unknown is high (greater than 40%) and when the known structures cluster around that to be predicted (Srinivasan & Blundell (1993) Protein Eng. 6: 501).","Where a common fold is not known, combinatorial approaches that depend upon the identification of secondary-structure elements using conformational propensities and residue patterns can be valuable (Presnell et al. (1992) Biochemistry 31: 983). The elements of secondary structure are then assembled by docking and\/or by using rules concerning supersecondary structures (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75).","Computational Approaches to Structure Based Drug Design","Once the 3-D structure of a target protein has been defined, computational procedures may be used to suggest ligands that will bind at the active site. Any compound can be a candidate as a putative ligand to mitoNEET. In some embodiments, a compound can be designed de novo. In more embodiments, a compound can be designed using the structure of a compound known to interact with the mitoNEET protein.","Interactive graphics approaches explore new ligand designs manually in ways that might involve, for example, modification of groups on the ligand to optimize complementarity with receptor\/enzyme subsites, optimization of a transition state to reflect data from mechanistic studies, replacement of peptide bonds with groups that improve hydrolytic stability while maintaining key hydrogen bond interactions, or linking of adjacent side groups to increase the rigidity of the ligand (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75). Most of these steps can now be done using systematic computational approaches that fall into three classes: 1) automated docking of whole molecules into receptor sites; 2) precalculating potentials at grid points and fitting molecules to these potentials; and 3) docking fragments and either joining them or growing them into real molecules (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75).","Attempts at automated docking through the evaluation of electrostatic, steric, or more complex energy states during a systematic search of rotational and translational space for the two molecules has been successful, but the simplification of energy functions required to achieve reasonable computational times has proved limiting (Kuntz et al. (1982). J Mol. Biol. 161: 269; Wodak (1978) J Mol. Biol. 124: 323; Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct 23: 349-75). Interactive or manual docking involving the positioning of molecules with constant feedback of the energy has been used as an alternative, but the many degrees of freedom and modes of interaction, however, have imposed their own limitations on the utility of this approach (Busetta et al. (1983) J Appl. Crystallogr. 16: 432; Pattabiraman et al. (1985) J Comput. Chem. 6: 432; Tomioka et al. (1987) J Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1: 197).","Precalculating terms for each point on a grid can be used to identify hydrogen-bonding sites within enzyme active sites and also significantly reduces computational time (Goodford (1985) J Med. Chem. 28: 849). A similar approach involves the use of pseudoenergies calculated from pairwise distributions of atoms in protein complexes or crystals of small molecules, with probe molecules then fitted to these potentials and ranked according to energy (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75). For example, software such as DOCK (available from University of California, San Francisco), creates a negative image of the target site by placing a set of overlapping spheres so that they fill the complex invaginations of the proposed binding site, and the putative ligands are then placed into the site by matching X-ray or computer derived structures on the basis of a comparison of internal distances (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75). The candidates are then ranked on the basis of their best orientations.","Other methods include a directed version of DOCK that allows for hydrogen-bond information to be used and conformational flexibility to be allowed, and a method that uses least squares fitting to maximize overlap of enzymes and putative ligands (Leach & Kuntz (1992) J. Comput. Chem. 13: 730; Bacon & Moult (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 225: 849).","Still further methods involve the use of genetic algorithms and graph theory to generate molecular structures within constraints of an enzyme active site or a receptor binding site (Payne & Glen (1993) J Mol. Graph. 11: 76; Lewis (1993) J Mol. Graph. 10: 131). For all of these methods to be useful in drug discovery, however, they must depend upon the existence of large data bases of small molecule structures, such as the Cambridge Structure Data Base and the Fine Chemicals Directory (Allen et al. (1979) Acta Oyst. B 35: 2331; Rusinko et al. (1989) J Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 29: 251).","Methods involving fragment docking and then developing algorithms to grow them into larger structures to fill the space available depend upon the exploration of electrostatic, van der Waals, or hydrogen bonding interactions involved in molecular recognition (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75). Many of these methods incorporate the GRID algorithm as a starting point, and then use GenStar and\/or GroupBuild to generate chemically reasonable structures to fill the active sites of enzymes (Rotstein and Murcko (1993) J Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 7: 23; Rotstein and Murcko (1993) J Med. Chem. 36: 1700). Alternatively, the program can start with a docked core or the structure of a fragment from an inhibitor complex and for each atom generated, several hundred candidate positions, representing different bond lengths and torsion angles, are scored on the basis of contacts with the enzyme (Whittle and Blundell (1994) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 23: 349-75).","Numerous computer programs are available and suitable for rational drug design and the processes of computer modeling, model building, and computationally identifying, selecting and evaluating potential inhibitors in the methods described herein. These include, for example, SYBYL (available from TRIPOS, St. Louis Mo.), DOCK (available from University of California, San Francisco), GRID (available form Oxford University, UK), MCSS (available from Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, Mass.), AUTODOCK (available from Oxford Molecular Group), FLEX X (available from TRIPOS, St. Louis Mo.), CAVEAT (available from University of California, Berkeley), HOOK (available from Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, Mass.), and 3-D database systems such as MACCS-3D (available from MDL Information Systems, San Leandro, Calif.), UNITY (available from TRIPOS, St. Louis Mo.), and CATALYST (available from Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, Mass.).","Potential interactive compounds may also be computationally designed de novo using such software packages as LUDI (available from Biosym TechMA), and LEAPFROG (TRIPOS Associates, St. Louis, Mo.). Compound defamation energy and electrostatic repulsion, may be evaluated using programs such as GAUSSIAN 92, AMBER, QUANTA\/CHARMM, and INSIGHT II\/DISCOVER.

In such embodiments, crystals of mitoNEET can be exposed to a candidate compound or mixture of compounds. In other embodiments, mitoNEET can be co-crystallized with a candidate compound. Acquisition and analysis of X-ray diffraction data from these crystals may then be performed using standard methods. If a compound interacts with mitoNEET then positive difference electron density will be observed in the Fourier maps calculated using the X-ray diffraction intensities and phases obtained from the mitoNEET model presented herein. Models of the chemical entities may then be built into the electron density using standard methods, and the resulting structures may be refined against the X-ray diffraction data, providing experimental data describing the interaction of the compounds of interest. Those skilled in the art may use these models to design compounds based either on purely structural data; or on combination of structural data, biological\/chemical activity based structure-activity relationship, and in silico drug design. The compounds that are thus designed or selected may further be tested in in vitro and in vivo assays to determine if they regulate mitoNEET. Examples of such assays are described herein.","Identifying Compounds that Interact with MitoNEET In Vitro","Some embodiments described herein relate to in vitro methods for screening and identifying compounds that interact with mitoNEET. In particular embodiments, such compounds can stabilize the 2Fe-2S cluster of mitoNEET. The increase in stability of a 2Fe-2S cluster of a mitoNEET protein associated with a stabilizing compound compared to the stability of a 2Fe-2S cluster of a mitoNEET protein not associated with a stabilizing compound can be an increase of more than about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold, about 10-fold, about 20-fold, and about 100-fold.","Any compound can be screened to identify a compound that can stabilize the 2Fe-2S cluster of mitoNEET, and a variety of methods can be used to identify compounds that interact with mitoNEET. Such methods can include spectroscopic methods for example, optical spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Examples of using optical spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy to identify and characterize a compound that can interact with mitoNEET are described in Example 1. Briefly, in one embodiment, the presence of a candidate compound can cause an increase in the stability of a mitoNEET species at an absorbance of 460 nm at pH 6.0. An example of using Raman spectroscopy to identify and characterize a compound that interacts with mitoNEET is described in Example 2.","In some embodiments, the mitoNEET protein used to identify a compound that can stabilize the 2Fe-2S cluster of mitoNEET can be a modified mitoNEET protein. Such modified mitoNEET proteins can contain mutations that increase the sensitivity of a method used to identify a stabilizing compound. For example, mitoNEET can be modified to modulate binding of the 2Fe-2S cluster, such as a D84N modified mitoNEET where a two-fold increase in stoichiometric in iron\/protein be observed; H87Q modified mitoNEET where a lack of stoichiometric iron\/protein can be observed; and H87C modified mitoNEET where different Raman spectra can be observed (Wiley et al., The outer mitochondrial membrane protein mitoNEET contains a novel redox-active 2Fe-2S cluster, J. Biol. Chem. 282: 23745-23749 (Aug. 17, 2007)).","Treatment of mitoNEET Associated Disorders","Some embodiments relate to the use of compounds that are identified using the atomic coordinates of any portion of Table 2, namely the 3-D coordinates of mitoNEET, for the treatment of mitoNEET-associated disorders in mammals. Such disorders can include metabolic dysfunctional diseases or conditions including, but not limited to, those thought to be PPAR\u03b3 associated diseases or conditions, diabetes, type II diabetes, or syndrome X, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and inflammatory diseases.","Syndrome X (including metabolic syndrome) is loosely defined as a collection of abnormalities including hyperinsulemia, obesity, elevated levels of triglycerides, uric acid, 20 fibrinogen, small dense LDL particles, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and decreased levels of HDL. Similar metabolic conditions include dyslipidemia including associated diabetic dyslipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia, heart failure, hypercholesteremia, cardiovascular disease including atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and hypertriglyceridemia, type II diabetes mellitus, type I diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, epithelial hyperproliferative diseases including eczema and psoriasis and conditions associated with the lung and gut and regulation of appetite and food intake in subjects suffering from disorders such as obesity, anorexia bulimia, and anorexia nervosa. In particular embodiments, the compounds identified using methods described herein can be useful in the treatment and prevention of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and conditions including hypertension, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and mixed dyslipidaemia.","In more embodiments, compounds that are identified herein can be useful in the treatments of disorders treated with TZDs, such as rosiglitazone or pioglitazone. For example, pioglitazone has been demonstrated to be a potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis (Feinstein, D. L. et al. (2002) Ann Neurol. 51, 694-702; Pershadsingh, H. A., et al. (2004) J. Neuroinflammation 1, 3; Klotz, L., Schmidt, M., Giese, T., Sastre, M., Knolle, P., Klockgether, T., and Heneka, M. T. (2005) J. Immunol. 175, 4948-4955), Alzheimer disease (Heneka, M. T., Sastre, M., Dumitrescu-Ozimek, L., Hanke, A., Dewachter, I., Kuiperi, C., O'Banion, K., Klockgether, T., Van Leuven, F., and Landreth, G. E. (2005) Brain 128, 1442-1453), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\u25a1 Schutz, B., Reimann, J., Dumitrescu-Ozimek, L., Kappes-Hom, K., Landreth, G. E., Schurmann, B., Zimmer, A., and Heneka, M. T. (2005) J. Neurosci. 25, 7805-7812; Kiaei, M., Kipiani, K., Chen, J., Calingasan, N. Y., and Beal, M. F. (2005) Exp. Neurol. 191, 331-336). Moreover, TZDs have been found to be efficacious inducers of differentiation in cultured pre-adipocyte cell lines (Hiragun et al., J. Cell Physiol. 134:124-130, 1988; Sparks et al., J. Cell. Physiol. 146:101-109, 1991; Kletzien et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 41:393-398, 1992). Treatment of pre-adipocyte cell lines with pioglitazone results in increased expression of the adipocyte-specific genes aP2 and adipsin as well as the glucose transporter proteins GLUT-1 and GLUT-4. These data suggest that the hypoglycemic effects of TZDs seen in vivo may be mediated through adipose tissue. However, as estimates of the contribution of adipose tissue to whole body glucose usage range from only 1-3%, it remains unclear whether the hypoglycemic effects of TZDs can be accounted for by changes in adipocytes only. Furthermore, adipose tissue may not be required for the pharmacology of these compounds (Burant, et al. J Clin Invest 100: 2900-2908, 1997). Additionally, thiazolidinediones have been implicated in appetite regulation disorders, see PCT patent application WO 94\/25026 A1, and in increase of bone marrow fat content, (Williams, et al, Diabetes 42, Supplement 1, p. 59A1993).","Construction of Bacterial Expression Plasmid and Purification of mitoNEET","The portion of the human mitoNEET cDNA corresponding to amino acids 33-108 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pet21a+ vector. Expression in BL21-CodonPlus-R1L and purification was carried with the time after induction extended to 18 hr at 22\u00b0 C. as previously described in Wiley, S E, Paddock, M L, Abresch, E C, Gross, L, van der Geer, P, Nechushtai, R, Murphy, A N, Jennings, P A, & Dixon, J E (2007) J Biol. Chem., 282 (33): 23745-9, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. We included an additional cation exchange chromatography step using HiTrap (GE Healthcare) to achieve crystal quality purification. The purified material had a peak centered at 458 nm and an optical ratio (A\/A) of 2.3-2.4 under these buffer conditions. Optical spectra were measured on a Cary50 spectrometer (Varian, Walnut Creek, Calif.).","Pioglitazone Binding to mitoNEET","Pioglitazone was solubilized in 0.1 N HCI to a concentration of 3.5 mM. Protein samples containing 15 \u03bcM 2Fe-2S centers (7.5 \u03bcM dimeric mitoNEET=15 \u03bcM monomeric mitoNEET) were measured in 200 mM phosphate-HCI, pH 7.5 with and without stoichiometric (\u00b110%) pioglitazone (25 DC). The stability of the 2Fe-2S clusters were determined from monitoring their characteristic absorbance at 460 nm (\u03bbat pH 6.0) as a function of time (Wiley, S E, Paddock, M L, Abresch, E C, Gross, L, van der Geer, P, Nechushtai, R, Murphy, A N, Jennings, P A, & Dixon, J E (2007) J Biol. Chem., 282 (33): 23745-9). Measurements performed in the NMR buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM Tris at pH 7.8) gave the same results. The measured pH was the same at the beginning and end of each experiment. Control experiments using equal volume addition of 0.1 N HCl did not change the solution pH (\u00b10.01 units) nor alter the physical and spectral properties (\u00b12%) of the protein.","NMR Spectroscopy of mitoNEET","NMR samples of 0.4 mM mitoNEET (protomer concentration) were prepared in 98% D0 or 90% HO\/10% D20, 50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM Tris at pH 7.8. Similar results were obtained in buffers at pH 7.5 and 8.0. Ten \u03bcl of pioglitazone was added in 1 \u03bcl incremental amounts to 450 \u03bcl of mitoNEET sample. This was necessary to avoid locally high acidic spots that would destabilize the 2Fe-2S cluster. Following temperature equilibration, NMR spectra were acquired at 36\u00b0 C. using Bruker DMX 500 MHz and Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometers. Homonuclear IH 2D NOESY spectra were acquired with a mixing time of 400 ms. Spectral processing was performed using Felix Software (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.).","Crystallization of mitoNEET","Initial crystallization screening was performed both in house and at Hauptman-Woodward Institute (Buffalo, N.Y.). Screens were attempted around initial conditions that yielded crystals. Final conditions were 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 100 mM NaCl and 30-32% PEG3000 in the reservoir. Samples were frozen (77 K) after 1 minute soak in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 40% PEG3000 sent frozen (77 K) to SSRL in an SSRL supplied cassette system for data collection and analysis.","X-Ray Diffraction of mitoNEET","Frozen crystals were screened using the Stanford Automated Mounter operated by Blu-Ice (Cohen, A E, Ellis, P J, Miller, M D, Deacon, A M, & Phizackerley, R P (2002) J Appl Crystallogr 35, 720-726; McPhillips, T M, McPhillips, S E, Chiu, H J, Cohen, A E, Deacon, A M, Ellis, P J, Garman, E, Gonzalez, A, Sauter, N K, Phizackerley, R P, et al. (2002) J Synchrotron Radiat 9, 401-406). The data were recorded on a 325 mm Marmosaic CCD detector. Datasets were collected from two crystals. A 1.5 \u212b resolution dataset, used for structure refinement, was collected at SSRL BL11-1 from a 0.9 mm\u00d70.075 mm\u00d70.075 mm crystal. Data was collected from two locations on opposite ends of this crystal using a 0.1\u00d70.075 mm beam size. A 3 wavelength Fe-MAD dataset, used for initial phasing, was collected at SSRL BL9-2 from a 1.0 mm\u00d70.2 mm\u00d70.1 mm crystal. The wavelengths for data collection were selected using a plot of f and f\u2032 calculated with the program CHOOCH from the X-ray fluorescence spectrum of the crystal (Evans, G & Pettifer, R F (2001) J Appl Crystallogr 34, 82-86). A total of 360\u00b0 were collected at each wavelength following the inverse-beam method with a wedge size of 30\u00b0. All data were processed with XDS (Kabsch, W (1993) J Appl Crystallogr 26, 795-800).","Structural Determination of mitoNEET","The structure of mitoNEET was determined by MAD phasing (Pahler, A, Smith, J L, & Hendrickson, W A (1990) 46 (Pt 7), 537-540; Terwilliger, T C & Berendzen, J (1999) Acta Crystallogr D 55, 849-861). Data reduction and primary phasing at a resolution of 2 \u212b were accomplished using an automated MAD script developed by Ana Gonzalez (SSRL) that integrates [MOSFLM] (Leslie, A G W (2006) Acta Crystallogr D 62, 48-57) and scales [SCALA] (Bailey, S (1994) Acta Crystallogr D 50, 760-763) the data, phase the structure [SOLVE] (Terwilliger, T C & Berendzen, J (1999) Acta Crystallogr D 55, 849-861), and auto builds a partial model [RESOLVE] (Terwilliger, T C (2000) Acta Crystallogr D 56, 965-972). Several rounds of automated model-building and refinement were implemented using ARP\/wARP (Perrakis, A, Morris, R, & Lamzin, V S (1999) Nat Struct Biol 6, 458-463) which resulted in significantly improved electron density maps and placement of 97 amino acid sidechains into electron density.","The data from several independent sets were processed using an automated script developed by Qingping Xu at the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (SSRL) that runs XDS (Kabsch, W (1993) J Appl Crystallogr 26, 795). Model completion and refinement were performed in COOT (Emsley, P & Cowtan, K (2004) Acta Crystallogr D 60, 2126-2132) and REFMAC5 (Winn, M D, Murshudov, G N, & Papiz, M Z (2003) Methods Enzymol 374, 300-321) respectively. Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the models were accomplished using an automated validation server developed by Chris Rife at the JCSG (SSRL) implementing MolProbity (Lovell, S C, Davis, I W, Arendall, W B, 3rd, de Bakker, P I, Word, J M, Prisant, M G, Richardson, J S, & Richardson, D C (2003) Proteins 50, 437-450), ADIT (Yang, H W, Guranovic, V, Dutta, S, Feng, Z K, Berman, H M, & Westbrook, J D (2004) Acta Crystallogr D 60, 1833-1839), and WHATIF 5.0 (Vriend, G (1990) J Mol Graphics 8, 52-56). Structural Figures were rendered with PyMol (Delano, W L & Lam, J W (2005) Abstr Pap Am Chem S 230, U1371-U1372).","Structure and Domain Topology of mitoNEET","A soluble form of recombinant human mitoNEET corresponding to amino acids 33-108 (lacking the amino-terminal targeting and transmembrane sequences) was produced for structural analysis. The isolated recombinant protein crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a=46.81 \u212b, b=49.62 \u212b, c=59.01 \u212b.

Within the cluster-binding domain, the polypeptide backbone chain from Cys72-Gly85 folds into a coil that contains the three coordinating Cys ligands\u2014Cys72, Cys74, Cys83\u2014and cradles the 2Fe-2S cluster (). The fourth ligand for the 2Fe-2S cluster (His87) lies at the N-terminus of the a-helix within cluster-binding domain (Ala86-Thr94). mitoNEET shares this unusual 3Cys cluster coordination with the structurally unrelated cluster scaffold protein IscU (Li, K, Tong, W H, Hughes, R M, & Rouault, T A (2006) J Biol Chem 281, 12344-12351; Ramelot, T A, Cort, J R, Goldsmith-Fischman, S, Komhaber, G J, Xiao, R, Shastry, R, Acton, T B, Honig, B, Montelione, G T, & Kennedy, M A (2004) J Mol Biol 344, 567-583). The 3Cys-1His coordination seen here is in agreement with the conclusions of previous solution studies of mitoNEET (Wiley, S E, Paddock, M L, Abresch, E C, Gross, L, van der Geer, P, Nechushtai, R, Murphy, A N, Jennings, P A, & Dixon, J E (2007) J.

The binding coils, one from each protomer, protrude away from the core of the dimer and the non-crystallographic dyad axis (). The cluster binding domain, and specifically the C-terminus of each a-helix is predicted to be situated near the OMM in vivo.","Pioglitazone Stabilizes the 2Fe-2S Cluster","Pioglitazone, a member of the TZD class of insulin-sensitizer drugs, binds to mitoNEET in vitro as demonstrated by photoaffinity labeling (Colca, J R (2006) Biochem Pharmacol 72, 125-131; Colca, J R & Kletzien, R F (2006) Expert Opin Investig Drugs 15, 205-210; 18-Hofmann, C A & Colca, J R (1992) Diabetes Care 15, 1075-1078; Colca, J R, McDonald, W G, Waldon, D J, Leone, J W, Lull, J M, Bannow, C A, Lund, E T, & Mathews, W R (2004) Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 286, E252-260). To observe the effects of pioglitazone binding on the protein stability of mitoNEET, the characteristic absorbance of the 2Fe-2S cluster at 460 nm was measured as a function of time at pH 6.0 under conditions known to lead to cluster release (Wiley, S E, Paddock, M L, Abresch, E C, Gross, L, van der Geer, P, Nechushtai, R, Murphy, A N, Jennings, P A, & Dixon, J E (2007) J Biol. Chem., 282 (33): 23745-9).  illustrate that the binding of pioglitazone to mitoNEET stabilizes the Fe\u2014S cluster. As  shows, the stability of the 2Fe-2S cluster of mitoNEET was increased in the presence of pioglitazone. Here, the change in the signature absorbance spectrum (460 nm) of the 2Fe-2S cluster was monitored as a function of time at pH 6.0 in the absence and presence of stoichiometric pioglitazone (15 \u03bcM). The binding of the insulin sensitizing drug pioglitazone increased the observed half life by 10-fold. Accordingly, the presence of pioglitazone (stoichiometric to the total 2Fe-2S cluster concentration) increased the stability by \u02dc10-fold compared to the control sample lacking pioglitazone ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 7B"],"sub":["2","1 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B"},"Putative Functions of mitoNEET","Although more than 650 structures of Fe\u2014S containing proteins are currently available, the structure of mitoNEET presented here is unique among all known structures (over 44,200 structures currently).  illustrates putative functions for MitoNEET in vivo. MitoNEET is shown linked to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (not to scale). Without wishing to be bound to any one theory, two possible functions of mitoNEET can be suggested: (1) cluster transfer; and (2) and electron transfer.","With respect to electron transfer, the 2Fe-2S cluster can be reduced (1\u2032) and reoxidized (2\u2032) (Wiley, S E, Paddock, M L, Abresch, E C, Gross, L, van der Geer, P, Nechushtai, R, Murphy, A N, Jennings, P A, & Dixon, J E (2007) 282 (33): 23745-9). The 2Fe-2S cluster of recombinant mitoNEET is reversibly reduced\/oxidized at pH 8.0 (), consistent with a function for mitoNEET that involves electron transfer. Such functions could include redox reactions with metabolic intermediates, cofactors and\/or proteins localized at the OMM. As mitoNEET regulates maximal respiratory capacity in mouse heart mitochondria, it is possible that the protein acts as a sensor, adjusting oxidative capacity through participation in a redox-sensitive signaling pathway (Wiley, S E, Murphy, A N, Ross, S A, van der Geer, P, & Dixon, J E (2007) PNAS 104, 5318-5323).","With respect to cluster transfer, the 2Fe-2S cluster dissociates from the protein upon protonation of His87. Accordingly, changes in the interaction of His87 with the cluster are likely related to its function. In vivo this unique fold of mitoNEET stabilized by pioglitazone interaction may be broken by docking of another protein thereby providing a convenient trigger for cluster release. Binding of pioglitazone to mitoNEET () increases the stability of the 2Fe-2S cluster thereby inhibiting release of the cluster.","His87 may not serve as a stabilizing ligand for the 2Fe-2S when protonated because His87 resides at the N-terminus of the helical sequence AHTKH (SEQ ID No: 2) that is predicted to have only marginal helical content in solution but is likely stabilized by cluster binding (Mufioz, V & Serrano, L (1997) Biopolymers 41, 495-509). However, protonation of the His87 may destabilize the helix facilitating cluster release\/transfer. A second histidine (His58) that forms an unusual interprotomer hydrogen bond with Arg73 () is also located near the cluster. Disruption of this hydrogen bond would weaken the interprotomer interaction. Since Arg73 is located sequentially between the Cys ligands of the innermost Fe of the cluster (), perturbation of its interaction with His58 will likely lead to reorientation of the inner sphere Cys ligands potentially providing additional conformational control of binding. Below pH 8 in vitro, the 2Fe-2S cluster is labile; the 2Fe-2S cluster is less stable at physiological pH than other 2Fe-2S proteins (Wiley, S E, Paddock, M L, Abresch, E C, Gross, L, van der Geer, P, Nechushtai, R, Murphy, A N, Jennings, P A, & Dixon, J E (2007) J. Biol. Chem., 282 (33): 23745-9). Modulation of the destabilization\/stabilization of cluster binding in vivo could be achieved under physiological conditions upon docking of another protein. This would provide a convenient trigger for controlling cluster release.","Modulation of the destabilization\/stabilization of cluster binding in vivo suggests that mitoNEET participates in Fe\u2014S cluster assembly, potentially facilitating cluster shuttling between proteins in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. Proteins that act as scaffolds for Fe\u2014S cluster assembly are within the mitochondrial matrix and cytoplasm of yeast and mammalian cells, although matrix synthesis is believed to predominate (Li, K, Tong, W H, Hughes, R M, & Rouault, T A (2006) J Biol Chem 281, 12344-12351; Netz, D J, Pierik, A J, Stumpfig, M, Muhlenhoff, U, & Lill, R (2007) Nat Chem Biol 3, 278-286). Although several proteins involved in the export of clusters synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix have been identified in yeast (Lill, R & Muhlenhoff, U (2006) Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 22, 457-486, Lill, R, Dutkiewicz, R, Elsasser, H P, Hausmann, A, Netz, D J, Pierik, A J, Stehling, 0, Urzica, E, & Muhlenhoff, U (2006) Biochim Biophys Acta 1763, 652-667), the mechanism by which clusters are transported across the OMM and shuttled to cytosolic apoproteins in yeast and in higher organisms is unknown. MitoNEET is uniquely positioned to possibly receive and then transfer a cluster that has crossed the outer membrane, or alternately may serve as a Fe\u2014S cluster reservoir or storage protein ().","Pioglitazone is a highly hydrophobic molecule that is largely bound to serum albumin after patient ingestion and prior to cellular uptake and binding to its intracellular targets (Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, www.fda.gov\/cder\/foi\/label\/2005\/0218421bl.pdf). In addition to hydrophobic interactions, binding of pioglitazone increases stability of the 2Fe-2S cluster and of hydrogen bonding interactions within the protein. Taken together with the unique distribution of hydrophobic residues in the dimer (), the structural results described herein have important implications for both mechanisms of drug action and optimization of TZDs. Although these compounds may activate peroxisome proliferator-activating receptors, data has accumulated suggesting alternative modes of action involving mitochondria (Feinstein, D L, Spagnolo, A, Akar, C, Weinberg, G, Murphy, P, Gavrilyuk, V, & Dello Russo, C (2005) Biochem Pharmacol 70, 177-188). In view of the foregoing, mitoNEET is a desirable target for designing drugs.","The visible resonance Raman spectra were obtained for native mitoNEET, a H87C mitoNEET mutant, and TZD-bound mitoNEET. Measurements were made at several pH levels. Identities of vibrational modes were assigned by comparison with previous ferredoxin and Rieske protein studies. The resonance Raman spectra presented here are the first of their kind for a naturally occurring FeS(His)(Cys)cluster binding system.","A key pH-dependent mode influenced by the Fe\u2014N bond character was identified, supporting observations in which increased cluster stability was observed at high pH values (Wiley, S. E.; Paddock, M. L.; Abresch, E. C.; Gross, L.; van der Geer, P.; Nechushtai, R.; Murphy, A. N.; Jennings, P. A.; Dixon, J. E.; 2007, 282, 23745-23749). pH-dependence studies as well as measurements of the H87C mutant enabled the identification of key bands with significant contributions from Fe\u2014N motions. These assignments support one hypothesis that the observed pH-dependence of the rate of metal cluster loss is due to Nprotonation of the H87 residue. In the presence of pioglitazone, the Raman spectra exhibit similar characteristics to those observed at high pH, lending molecular support to the increased cluster stability observed through optical kinetics studies under similar conditions (Paddock, M. L.; Wiley, S. E.; Axelrod, H. L.; Cohen, A. E.; Roy, M.; Abresch, E. C.; Capraro, D.; Murphy, A. N.; Nechushtai, R.; Dixon, J. E.; Jennings, P. A.; 2007, 104, 14342-14347).","Preparation of Native and Mutant mitoNEET","Cytoplasmic domains of native and H87C mutant mitoNEET were constructed, expressed and purified as described herein, and in Paddock, M. L.; Wiley, S. E.; Axelrod, H. L.; Cohen, A. E.; Roy, M.; Abresch, E. C.; Capraro, D.; Murphy, A. N.; Nechushtai, R.; Dixon, J. E.; Jennings, P. A.; 2007, 104, 14342-14347; and Wiley, S.

E.; 2007, 282, 23745-23749, hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. The single histidine ligand H87 of the 2Fe-2S cluster was replaced by cysteine in the H87C mutant creating a 2Fe-2S cluster bound by four cysteines. This mutation retains the 2Fe-2S cluster and is less labile as described herein. The optical ratio A\/Awas near 2.3 and crystals were grown from the H87C mutant, indicating of a high level of purity. Stock protein solutions were stored at >1 mM concentration and diluted to between 100 and 200 \u03bcM in 100 mM phosphate buffer at the indicated pH for resonance Raman measurements. All samples were measured in the oxidized state as isolated. ferredoxin (mFd) was expressed and purified as previously described (Fish, A.; Lebendiker, M.; Nechushtai, R.; Livnah, O.; Acta Crystallogr., Sect. D 2003, 59, 734-736). Pioglitazone was purchased from Bosche Scientific (New Brunswick, N.J.) and solubilized in 0.1N HCI to \u02dc3 mM.","Stability of the 2Fe-2S Cluster","The 2Fe-2S cluster of native mitoNEET is labile and the rate of cluster loss is inversely related to the pH, namely, k=k10(Wiley, S. E. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2007, 282, 23745-23749). Since the 2Fe-2S center has strong visible absorption bands, the cluster loss was assayed by disappearance of the visible absorbance peak near 460 nm. The majority of the decay (>80% of the signal loss) could be adequately fit to a single exponential. Due to the change in buffer from tris to phosphate, the rates of decay in the current study are slower than other reports, but are still inversely related to the pH (Wiley, S. E.; Paddock, M. L.; Abresch, E. C.; Gross, L.; van der Geer, P.; Nechushtai, R.; Murphy, A. N.; Jennings, P. A.; Dixon, J. E.; 2007, 282, 23745-23749).","Resonance Raman Spectroscopy on mitoNEET","Laser excitation was provided by the 514.5 nm line of a mixed-gas Kr\u2014Ar laser (Spectra-Physics Stabilite). The 50-75 watt beam was focused (spot size \u02dc10 \u03bcm diameter) into a 1.5-1.8 mm OD capillary that contained protein sample. Experiment durations ranged from 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the applied power. For low pH experiments, the capillary was translated horizontally across the laser focus during data acquisition. Room temperature Raman spectra of buffered protein solutions and buffer-only solutions were acquired. Scattered photons were collected in a right-angle geometry by a camera lens and focused onto the 170 \u03bcm entrance slit of an F\/6.9 spectrograph (Spex Industries 1700). Rayleigh scattering was rejected by a 514.5 nm long-pass edge filter (Semrock RazorEdge) whose angle was tuned by optimizing the intensity of the 460 cmCClsignal. The spectrometer was equipped with a 1200 groove\/mm diffraction grating (Horiba Jobin Yvon) blazed at 500 nm. Dispersed light was imaged onto a peltier-cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments Pixis 256). Wavelength calibration was performed with a neon lamp. Reported energies are accurate to \u00b12 cmand the entrance slit bandpass was 7 cm.","Data Analysis","Data collection periods were divided into one-minute segments to monitor photodamage and manage interference from cosmic rays. Although sequential minute long spectra exhibited a gradual decrease in baseline intensity (as much as 40%), no peak shifts, relative intensity changes, or new peaks were observed during the entire course of a 20-30 minute experiment. Individual one minute spectra were summed over the total acquisition time to obtain a single spectrum. Appropriate buffer-only spectra were subtracted from sample spectra to remove signal from the buffer and isolate scattering contributions due to the protein. Differences in the Raman spectra of protein and buffer-only solutions as a function of pH were evident; systematic changes in the buffer-only spectra provided a convenient measurement of the pH of the <40 \u03bcL solution in the capillary. The residual fluorescence and scattering background in each spectrum was removed by baseline interpolation. Raman features were modeled as sums of Gaussian peaks and decompositions were performed using a least-square fitting technique. All data analysis was performed using WaveMetrics Igor Pro 5.01.","Resonance Raman Spectra of Oxidized mFd and mitoNEET","Published ferredoxin spectra exhibit wide variety of spectral shapes and peak positions (Yachandra, V.

The band at 276 cmshifted to higher energy and was observed at 279 cm. The peak at 262 cmalso shifted to 265 cm. Although a shift in the location of this peak was not observed at pH 7.5, in the absence of the drug, the peak was observed at lower energy at pH 6.2 compared to pH 8 7.5. Modifications in intensity ratios were similar to those seen at pH 7.5. While the relative intensity ratios I\/Iand I\/Iwere 1.5 and 1.1 in the absence of pioglitazone, addition of the drug decreased both of these ratios to 0.5. The spectra of mitoNEET with and without pioglitazone in region II were essentially equivalent. The one notable change in region III was the shift of the peak at 378 cmto 382 cmupon addition of pioglitazone. In addition, I\/Idecreased, as was observed at pH 7.5.","The naturally occurring FeS(His)(Cys)motif in mitoNEET is unique. While several related and engineered ferredoxin-like and Rieske-like molecules have been studied by a variety of spectroscopic techniques, including resonance Raman, X-ray absorption, and circular dichroism, the current example is the first resonance Raman study of a naturally occurring (His)(Cys)binding motif in 2Fe-2S cluster binding proteins (Kounosu, A. et al. J. Biol. Chem 2004, 279, 19-12528; Yachandra, V. K. et al. J. Am Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 6462-6468; Kuila, D. et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1992, 1140, 175-183; Kuila, D. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 1559-1561; Spiro, T. G. et al. In Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy; Spiro, T. G., Ed. 1988, Vol. 3, p. 523-553; Rose, K. et al. J. Am Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 2353-2363; Cosper, N. J. et al. Prot. Sci. 2002, 11, 2969-2973; Iwasaki, T. et al J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271, 27659-27663, Fu, W. G. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1992, 267, 15502-15510). The visible absorption bands of Rieske proteins, ferredoxins, and presumably mitoNEET arise from a ligand-to-metal charge transfer, and Fe\u2014S and Fe\u2014N normal modes are observed in resonance Raman spectroscopy (Yachandra, V. K. et al. J. Am Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 6462-6468; Rotsaert, F. A. J. et al. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 8, 318-326; Han, S. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989, 111, 3505-3511; Kuila, D. et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1992, 1140, 175-183; Fu, W. G. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1992, 267, 15502-15510; Tang, S. P. W. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm 1973, 53, 869-874). The absorption spectra of native and H87C mutant mitoNEET are similar at wavelengths above 500 nm (, inset). In addition, the absorption spectra of native mitoNEET with and without pioglitazone are identical in the visible region (, inset). Because of the similarity in absorption cross-sections at the excitation wavelength of 514 nm, we do not anticipate major alterations in Raman scattering intensities due to changes in enhancement factors.","Primary Modes of Interest with Fe\u2014N Vibrations","Primary modes of interest are those with contributions from Fe\u2014N vibrations and are expected to be found in the 200-300 cmregion, and other work on Rieske proteins have made Fe\u2014N mode assignments in the 266-300 cmregion (Kuila, D.; Fee, J. A.; Schoonover, J. R.; Woodruff, W. H.; Batie, C. J.; Ballou, D. P.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 1559-1561; Kuila, D.; Schoonover, J. R.; Dyer, R. B.; Batie, C. J.; Ballou, D. P.; Fee, J. A.; Woodruff, W. H.; Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1992, 1140, 175-183; Iwasaki, T.; Imai, T.; Urushiyama, A.; Oshima, T.; J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271, 27659-27663). Specifically, the peak near 266 cmis attributed to having contributions from the neutral ligating histidine, shown as the \u201cmoderate pH\u201d species in . Other studies have also suggested the presence of Fe\u2014S peaks in this region (Rotsaert, F. A. J.; Pikus, J. D.; Fox, B. G.; Markley, J. L.; Sanders-Loehr, J.; J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 8, 318-326; Kounosu, A.; Li, Z. R.; Cosper, N. J.; Shokes, J. E.; Scott, R. A.; Imai, T.; Urushiyama, A.; Iwasaki, T.; J. Biol. Chem 2004, 279, 19-12528). These other studies, coupled to the disappearance of the band near 265 cmin the H87C mutant, make it feasible to tentatively assign 265 cmas a mode with significant Fe\u2014N contribution. With a pKvalue of 6.0-6.5 when not bound to a metal, the population of doubly protonated histidine residues should increase as pH decreases, shown in  (Yue, K. T.; Lee, M. H.; Zheng, J.; Callender, R.; Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1991, 1078, 296-302). The current observation that the relative intensity of the 265 cmpeak decreases with a drop in pH is consistent with this prediction and further supports the claim that the 265 cmis heavily influenced by Fe\u2014N motion.","The intensity of the 275 cmmode also decreases as a function of pH. Therefore, it is likely that this mode is sensitive to the protonation state of the ligating histidine group. However, its persistence in the H87C mutant spectra implies that its nature is more complicated than a pure Fe\u2014N mode. Neutral and high-pH resonance Raman studies of Rieske-type proteins have reported pH-dependent changes in the spectra that were attributed to a change in protonation state of the ligating histidine N atom () (Kuila, D.; Schoonover, J. R.; Dyer, R. B.; Batie, C. J.; Ballou, D. P.; Fee, J. A.; Woodruff, W. H.; Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1992, 1140, 175-183; Kuila, D.; Fee, J. A.; Schoonover, J. R.; Woodruff, W. H.; Batie, C. J.; Ballou, D. P.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 1559-1561; Iwasaki, T.; Imai, T.; Urushiyama, A.; Oshima, T.; J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271, 27659-27663). Kuila et al. suggested that the binding of Fe to the N atom of histidine in Rieske proteins lowers the pKof N to \u02dc9, thereby rationalizing the assignment of the peak near \u02dc274 cmto the Fe\u2014N stretch of a deprotonated, ligating histidine residue (Kuila, D.; Schoonover, J. R.; Dyer, R. B.; Batie, C. J.; Ballou, D. P.; Fee, J. A.; Woodruff, W. H.; Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1992, 1140, 175-183). Other studies, based on both experiment and calculation, have determined histidine NpKvalues for Rieske proteins ranging from 7.5-11.5 (Lin, I. J.; Chen, Y.; Fee, J. A.; Song, J. K.; Westler, W. M.; Markley, J. L.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 10672-10673; Klingen, A. R.; Ullmann, G. M.; Biochemistry 2004, 43, 12383-12389). Another report contradicted the assignment of 274 cmto Fe\u2014N(deprotonated) and instead attributed it to backbone deformations (Iwasaki, T.; Kounosu, A.; Kolling, D. R. J.; Crofts, A. R.; Dikanov, S. A.; Jin, A.; Imai, T.; Urushiyama, A.; J. Am Chem Soc. 2004, 126, 4788-4789). Since the conditions of the experiments here reported are unlikely to result in deprotonatation of the ligating histidine residue, the possibility that the 275 cmpeak arises from an anionic histidine ligand is excluded. Therefore, is it noted that there are at least two possible interpretations of the 275 cmpeak. First, this peak may reflect a mode that is primarily composed of Fe\u2014S vibration and is highly sensitive to the protonation state of the ligating histidine residue; its persistence in H87C is consistent with this interpretation. Alternatively, the 275 cmmode may primarily reflect the Fe\u2014N (neutral histidine) moiety that disappears in H87C; a new Fe\u2014S peak then appears in the same region in the H87C spectrum.","The final peak in region I of native mitoNEET is located near 292 cm. Based on other assignments of Fe\u2014S modes and the observed invariance of this peak position or intensity as a function of pH, the 292 cmpeak is tentatively assigned to an Fe\u2014S mode (Yachandra, V. K.; Hare, J.; Gewirth, A.; Czernuszewicz, R. S.; Kimura, T.; Holm, R. H., Spiro, T. G.; J. Am Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 6462-6468; Rotsaert, F. A. J.; Pikus, J. D.; Fox, B. G.; Markley, J. L.; Sanders-Loehr, J.; J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 8, 318-326; Han, S.; Czernuszewicz, R. S.; Kimura, T.; Adams, M. W. W.; Spiro, T. G.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989, 111, 3505-3511, Fu, W. G.; Drozdzewski, P. M.; Davies, M. D.; Sligar, S. G.; Johnson, M. K.; J. Biol. Chem. 1992, 267, 15502-15510; Tang, S. P. W.; Spiro, T. G.; Mukai, K.; Kimura, T.; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm 1973, 53, 869-874). The absence of a 292 cmmode in the H87C mutant may be explained by (1) the 292 cmmode shifts to 283 cmupon the H87 C mutation; or (2) the change in symmetry of the metal cluster results in different sets of Raman-active modes. Peaks in this \u02dc290 cmarea have been observed in ferredoxins and ferredoxin model complexes and therefore support our tentative assignment of the 292 cmmode to the Fe\u2014S group (Yachandra, V. K.; Hare, J.; Gewirth, A.; Czernuszewicz, R. S.; Kimura, T.; Holm, R. H., Spiro, T. G.; J. Am Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 6462-6468).","The relative intensity variations of the Fe\u2014N peaks in region I suggest that the changes to the nature of the Fe\u2014N bond that occur with decreasing pH compose an integral step of the process that leads to the loss of the active cluster, a process evidenced by the disappearance of visible absorption. There are three additional histidine residues in each monomer unit of mitoNEET: H90 is located within 10 \u212b of the 2Fe-2S cluster while the H48 and H58 side chains are located >10 \u212b from the metal cluster. Based on the fact that the H87C mutant, which still contains these 3 peripheral His residues, showed no major spectral changes as a function of pH, it is unlikely that global protein conformational changes arising from protonation of one of the non-ligating histidine residues is independently responsible for the loss in metal cluster or observed changes in native mitoNEET resonance Raman spectra.","Energetic considerations and previous work with ferredoxins and Rieske-type proteins, suggest that regions II and III are expected to be composed primarily of Fe\u2014S modes (Yachandra, V. K.; Hare, J.; Gewirth, A.; Czernuszewicz, R. S.; Kimura, T.; Holm, R. H., Spiro, T. G.; J. Am Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 6462-6468; Rotsaert, F. A. J.; Pikus, J. D.; Fox, B. G.; Markley, J. L.; Sanders-Loehr, J.; J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 8, 318-326; Han, S.; Czernuszewicz, R. S.; Kimura, T.; Adams, M. W. W.; Spiro, T. G.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989, 111, 3505-3511; Kuila, D.; Schoonover, J. R.; Dyer, R. B.; Batie, C. J.; Ballou, D. P.; Fee, J. A.; Woodruff, W. H.; Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1992, 1140, 175-183; Kuila, D.; Fee, J. A.; Schoonover, J. R.; Woodruff, W. H.; Batie, C. J.; Ballou, D. P.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 1559-1561; Han, S.; Czernuszewicz, R. S.; Spiro, T. G.; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989, 111, 3496-3504). The observed invariance in peak positions and relative intensities at all pH values between the native and H87C forms of mitoNEET supports these assignments for mitoNEET. Disappearance of the peak near 382 cmand appearance of a new peak near 404 cmupon replacement of the ligating His87 to Cys in mitoNEET may be explained in terms of a peak shift from 382 to 404 cm. The 382 and 404 cmpeaks are beyond the expected energy range for Fe\u2014N modes, and therefore likely reflect Fe\u2014S vibrations. These and other observed alterations of Fe\u2014S modes upon ligand replacement are likely due to changes in cluster geometry.","Resonance Raman changes were observed upon addition of pioglitazone (). At both pH 7.5 and 6.2, addition of pioglitazone altered region I. Specifically, the relative intensity of the Fe\u2014N peak near 265 cmincreased while the peak near 275 cmdecreased. Additionally, the intensity of the peak near 292 cmincreased. As demonstrated herein, the addition of pioglitazone enhances the stability of the cluster, suggesting that the drug inhibits the rate of cluster release. The observed rise in the 265 cmband intensity upon drug-binding supports this idea; it may decrease the pKof the Nhistidine thereby increasing the steady state population of stable mitoNEET species. Crystal structure data indicate that the H87 side chain is approximately 35% surface exposed, making direct interaction between the side chain and TZDs a distinct possibility. Alternatively, drug binding may directly alter the metal cluster structure such that scattering cross-sections are modified or binding may occur allosterically and indirectly alter geometry of the metal cluster via global protein conformational changes. However, since no changes in the optical spectra of mitoNEET+pioglitazone were observed at wavelengths above 300 nm, these two mechanisms are considered to be less likely than the first proposed. Other minor shifts in peak positions and intensities are observed in regions II and III.","MitoNEET levels in the livers of diabetic rats correlates with the measured blood glucose in control and rosiglitazone-treated rats, further establishing the involvement of mitoNEET in diabetes. The mitoNEET protein level were examined in liver tissues obtained from diabetic ZDF rats treated or not treated (control) with rosiglitazone.","Animal Study","Sixteen male ZDF rats were housed in filter cages, 2 or 3 animals per cage. Weight and blood glucose levels were measured every week. The blood glucose was measured at the fed state (07:30 am) and after 6 hours fast (1:30 \u03bcm). The Animals were divided into two groups: a control group, and a rosiglitazone-treated group. Animals were treated daily for 3 weeks once a day, 5 times a week, with rosiglitazone, 10 mg\/kg by gavage (0.7 ml) for the rosi-treated rats; or 0.7 ml saline for the control rats. After three weeks, liver, muscle and epididymal fat were collected and immediately frozen.","Summary of the Glucose Blood Levels","The average glucose blood level after fed of the control group was >240 mg\/dl; in the rosiglitazone-treated rats some responded in a medium manner to the treatment; after three weeks of rosiglitazone treatment their glucose blood levels after fed was \u02dc120-140 mg\/dl and some rats responded very well to rosiglitazone treatment and after three weeks their glucose blood levels after fed was \u02dc80 mg\/dl. The average levels of blood glucose in these three groups are shown in .","Extraction of Total Proteins from Livers of Control and Rosiglitazone-Treated Rats","From each rat liver, a piece about 100 mg of tissue was homogenized in liquid nitrogen to microscopic pieces (like sand) and resuspended in \u02dc800 \u03bcl of STN buffer (0.4 M Sucrose; 10 mM Tricin-NaOH, pH 8.0; 10 mM NaCl that contained 1 mM of PMSF Amino Caproic Acid and Benzamidine). Homogenized samples were stored in liquid nitrogen till their sonication. Sonication was for 5 cycles of 30 seconds each, on ice. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford Protein Assay and samples at equal protein concentration were taken. To \u02dc100 \u03bcl sample, SDS and BME were added, to a final concentration of 2%. Samples were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. SDS-PAGE dissociation buffer was added and the samples were further incubated for 1 hour at 50\u00b0 C.","Western Blots Analysis with Anti-mitoNEET Antibody","A 12% SDS-PAGE gel was loaded with samples, molecular weight markers, and pure mitoNEET controls. The total protein applied to each lane varied from 50 \u03bcg to 150 \u03bcg. Each gel was run in duplicate; one gel was stained be Commassie blue and the other gel was electro transferred. Electro-transfer was in a semi-dry cell for 30-45 minutes transfer at 15 V and 2 mA. The latter was incubated (1 hour) with blocking buffer, followed by 2 hours incubation with anti-mitoNEET at 1:125 dilution followed by incubation with Goat anti-rabbit second antibody. ECL reagent was used to detect the antibody-antigen reaction in the Image reader of Fuji. The density at each detected band was evaluated by the specific software.  indicates the density of representatives of the anti-mitoNEET-mitoNEET interacting bands in the three rats groups; control; medium; well responding rats to rosiglitazone-treatment.","All the analyzed results exhibited the same pattern: control diabetic rats that were not treated with rosiglitazone maintained high blood glucose and showed high mitoNEET levels; rats that responded in a medium manner to the rosiglitazone-treatment with respect to their blood glucose levels, showed medium mitoNEET levels; and rat that responded well to the rosiglitazone-treatment with respect to their blood glucose levels, showed very low mitoNEET levels. Accordingly, mitoNEET levels in the livers of diabetic rats correlates with the measured blood glucose in control and rosiglitazone-treated rats, further establishing the involvement of mitoNEET in diabetes.","The above description discloses subject matter including several embodiments for methods and compositions.
