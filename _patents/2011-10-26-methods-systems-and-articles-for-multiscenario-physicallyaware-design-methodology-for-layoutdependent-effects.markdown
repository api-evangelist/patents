No. 13\/282,426 and, filed concurrently and entitled \u201cMETHODS, SYSTEMS, AND ARTICLES FOR IMPLEMENTING EXTRACTION AND ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS-DRIVEN MODULE CREATION\u201d, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/282,177 and, filed concurrently and entitled \u201cMETHODS, SYSTEMS, AND ARTICLES OF MANUFACTURE FOR CREATING OR MANIPULATING ELECTRICAL DATA SETS FOR AN ELECTRONIC DESIGN\u201d. The content of both applications is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The recent advances in very deep sub-micron (VDSM) integrated circuits (ICs) have brought new challenges in the physical design methodology process of integrated systems. In modern electronic circuits, geometries become smaller; clock frequencies increase; and on-chip interconnections gain increased importance in the prediction of performance. Nonetheless, it has been found that from 0.13 \u03bcm and below, the layout of an electronic design exhibits profound impacts on device electrical parameters, especially in sub-45 nm nodes. For example, stress effects caused by the length of oxide (LOD) definition or shallow trench isolation (STI) features impact the mobility (\u03bc), carrier saturation velocity (V), or threshold voltage (V) of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors. Well-proximity effect (WPE) also cause significant variation in the threshold voltages depending on the proximity of CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) transistors to an implant well boundary. In addition, a typical design flow often uses various design rules and layout guidelines such as dummy components in module, well creation guidelines, device matching guidelines, etc. to minimize such layout dependent effects by verifying the physical design during sign-off via extraction and re-simulation through multiple iterations. If such verification fails, the design process reverts back to the layout or even back to the schematic design stage and repeats the schematic, layout, and verification process flow iteratively in order to meet a final layout with acceptable performance or manufacturing criteria.","Thus, there exists a need for implementing multi-scenario physically-aware design of an electronic circuit design that captures layout dependent effects among various devices or components early in the design flow such that the impact of such layout-dependent effects may be analyzed during the schematic design stage as well as the physical design stage.","Disclosed are a method, a system, and an article of manufacture for implementing multi-scenario physically-aware design of an electronic circuit design.

In some embodiments, the characterization of electrical parasitics associated with physical data may be performed with a two stage approach.","The two stage approach begins with the selection a particular net or a partial net encompassing the parameterized cell. In the first stage, the approach identifies where along that net or partial net that a geometric description is to be created. The geometric description may include wire widths and spacings, conductor and ILD (inter layer dielectrics) thicknesses, or thickness of barrier materials. A common description may be created and provided via an API (application programming interface.) The second stage may include one or more components that may translate, transform, convert, or map (hereinafter \u201cmap\u201d) the geometric description to an equivalent parasitic value such as an electrical resistance, capacitance or inductance. This translation, transformation, conversion, or mapping (hereinafter \u201cmapping\u201d) may be done with mathematical algorithms or models that are often referred to as parasitic extraction in some embodiments. The models may be created through the use of semi-empirical methods that combine models or knowledge of the underlying physics with data provided by various solver(s), simulator(s), or a combination thereof. In some cases, the mapping for capacitance may also be done with a solver. In some embodiments, the second stage may use parasitic extraction for some nets and a field solver for other nets.","In some embodiments, the second stage may use a combination of parasitic extraction for, for example, resistance(s) and a field solver for, for example, capacitance(s) on the same net. In some embodiments, the characterization of electrical parasitics may be performed with extraction tools that map geometric dimensions and patterns to corresponding parasitics such as R (electrical resistance), L (inductance), and C (capacitance.) In some embodiments, the characterization of electrical parasitics includes the use of field solvers that map geometric dimensions and patterns to capacitance(s).","In some embodiments, the electrical parasitics may comprise, for example, resistance, self-or coupled-inductance, or capacitance that is associated with the physical data. In the previous example of an interconnect segment in a physical design, the method or the system may characterize the electrical resistance of this particular interconnect segment by using the electrical resistivity, the length of the segment, and the cross-sectional area along the segment. In some embodiments the system monitors and tracks the relevant physical data associated with the creation or change to the design, for example the creation of an instance of the parameterized cell. Resistance and capacitance models may be applied automatically to compute the parasitic data in some embodiments. In these embodiments, parasitics may be generated interactively as physical design objects have been or are being created or modified. The set of partial design objects, including a set of one or more objects in the electronic circuit design that is interactively analyzed may form a partial layout.

For example, the linear solver and parasitic data may be used to solve for all the currents distributed throughout one or more signal nets or the instance of the parameterized cell in the first layout scenario. In this approach, the non-linear devices that are defined as part of a schematic design are generally solved using a circuit simulator. Electrical parameters, for example currents or voltages, associated with the device terminals are stored and provided to the solver. The remaining interconnect portion of the circuit created during layout may be solved as linear system using direct methods, for example Cholesky-based, or iterative, for example Conjugate Gradient, techniques. For example, a linear system could be formed from the following equation:\n\n\n","where G is the matrix of conductance values, v is the vector of node voltages and i is the vector of independent sources is solved using a linear solver employing direct or indirect methods. For example, Cholesky factorization may be used to separate the conductance matrix into a product of lower and upper triangular matrices and then forward and back substitution may be used to solve for the voltages throughout the network.","In some embodiments, the process or hardware module  may comprise the respective process or hardware module B for identifying or determining one or more constraints associated with electrical characteristics.

In some other embodiments, the method or the system may further examine whether another layout scenario with an exactly or approximately identical layout alternative of the parameterized cell may meet the constraint and perform scenario switch, which will be described in greater detail in some subsequent paragraphs, or provides feedback to the designer for the non-compliance with the constraint.

This characterization may occur incrementally as each net is created or modified and may occur while there is only a partial layout.
