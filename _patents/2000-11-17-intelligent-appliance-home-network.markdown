title: Intelligent appliance home network
abstract: The instantaneous power consumption of an appliance is used to determine the status of the appliance, from which further actions may be taken. This invention is premised on the observation that most appliances have a characteristic power consumption pattern that can be used to determine the state of operation of the appliance. An electric coffee pot, for example, consumes high power substantially continuously during the brewing state, then reduces its power level, or power duration, or both, while keeping the pot warm, then terminates its power consumption when it is turned off. In like manner, the power consumption patterns of other appliances, such as toasters, washing machines, dryers, and so on may also be used to determine the state of each appliance. The communicated state may be used by a home-automation system to effect a variety of actions, including notifying the user, terminating the available power to the appliance, initiating an action by another appliance, and so on.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the field of consumer devices, and in particular to the field of automated home control systems.","2. Description of Related Art","Home automation is becoming increasingly popular. Standards continue to be developed which will allow devices of varying types and varying vendors to be controlled by a common controller. Such standards include IEEE 1394, X-10, HAVi, HomeAPI, Jini, and the like. IEEE 1394 and X-10 are communication protocols; HAVi is a software architecture using IEEE 1394; Home API is an open industry specification that defines a standard set of software services and application programming interfaces which enable software applications to monitor and control home device. Jini is a distributed software architecture (network) wherein clients see devices and services as objects.","Some home automation systems may include a monitoring and reporting system that maintains a record of selected events. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,644,320, \u201cHOME ENERGY MONITORING AND CONTROL SYSTEM\u201d, issued Feb. 17, 1987 for Carr et al, incorporated by reference herein, presents a system that periodically records the temperature inside and outside the home, and a cumulative energy usage, measured via energy measuring devices that are attached to appliances such as furnaces, air conditioners, and the like. Statistics are also provided and presented as text or graphic displays to facilitate a user's assessment of the energy usage, and potentially effect a change of habit to reduce such usage.","Typical home automation systems are configured to provide a central control station and a number of remote controllers. For example, the central control station may be a home computer, and the remote controllers may be sub-controllers located in particular areas of the home, such as in a master bedroom, entry foyer, and the like. Typical home automation systems may also include remote sensors that are used, for example, to automatically turn lights on or off when motion is detected, or to turn a television set on or off in response to a particular sound or voice command. Some home automation systems allow the desired operations to be preprogrammed, so that, for example, lights or appliances are turned on or off at different preset times, televisions are tuned to different channels at different times, and so on.","As detailed above, most home automation systems are fundamentally \u201cunidirectional\u201d: information flows from the user to the appliance. The user provides commands to appliances, either directly or indirectly, and the appliance is controlled to effect the command. Some appliances are available that contain a degree of \u201cintelligence\u201d to effect a \u201cbidirectional\u201d information flow by communicating information to the user regarding their status, available options, and so on. Such a bidirectional information flow capability, however, is typically available only from fairly sophisticated appliances, such as home-entertainment systems, wherein the additional cost associated with providing the \u201cintelligence\u201d required is insubstantial, or deemed to be worthwhile to effect a product differentiation. Also, even if a majority of future appliances contain sufficient intelligence to communicate their status to a home automation system, the cost of replacing every legacy appliance in one's home to obtain such intelligent appliances will be cost-prohibitive to most users.","It is an object of this inventing to provide a method for communicating a status of an appliance that is easy to implement regardless of the capabilities of the appliance. It is a further object of this invention to provide a method for communicating a status of an appliance without requiring a modification to the appliance. It is a further object of this invention to provide an appliance-independent device that can provide status information that can be used to determine the status of its associated appliance. It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and device to enhance the physical security of the appliances in a home-automation system.","These objects and others are achieved by monitoring the instantaneous power consumption of an appliance to determine the status of the appliance. This invention is premised on the observation that most appliances have a characteristic power consumption pattern that can be used to determine the state of operation of the appliance. An electric coffee pot, for example, consumes high power substantially continuously during the brewing state, then reduces its power level, or power duration, or both, while keeping the pot warm, then terminates its power consumption when it is turned off. Additionally, distinctive power consumption patterns may be associated with, for example, the repeated heating of an empty or near empty coffee pot, the absence of the coffee pot, and so on. In like manner, the power consumption patterns of other appliances, such as toasters, washing machines, dryers, and so on may also be used to determine the state of each appliance. The communicated state may be used by the home-automation system to effect a variety of actions, including notifying the user, terminating the available power to the appliance, initiating an action by another appliance, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","160","115","125","135","145","150","170","110","120","130","140","160"]},"In accordance with this invention, at least one appliance  includes a power monitor device  that provides a measure  of the power  consumed by the appliance  to a processing device . Based on a sequence of these measures , the processing device  determines a state of the appliance . The processing device  also initiates actions based on the determined state of the appliance . For example, the processing device  may provide a notification signal to the annunciator  to notify a user when the coffee maker appliance  reaches a \u201cfinished brewing\u201d state. Similarly, the processing device  may provide a control signal to turn off the coffee maker appliance  when the coffee maker appliance  reaches a \u201cwarming an empty pot\u201d state. Alternatively, the processing device  may receive the state  of an appliance  directly, via a status reporter , and effect operations based on a mix of power measures  and status reports . For example, if the clock-radio appliance  reports a \u201csnooze\u201d state , the processing device  turns on the coffee maker appliance , then communicates a command to the clock-radio appliance  to terminate the \u201csnooze\u201d state  and turn the radio on when the coffee maker appliance  reports a \u201cfinished brewing\u201d state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","115","125","135","145","165","200","210","220","200","200","201","101","211","211","200","135","130","200","290","211"]},"The current monitor  utilizes conventional current detection techniques to provide a measure of the current. The current may be detected directly, via an in-line sensor or shunt device, or indirectly, via, for example, an induction coil in proximity to the wire that provides the power to the appliance. The form of the current measure will depend upon the degree of resolution desired or required for determining the state of an appliance. For example, two bits of resolution can be used to signifying one of four possible states: no current flow; minimal current flow; nominal current flow; and high current flow. By providing an indication of multiple power levels appliances may be configured to draw a small but detectable amount of current when turned off and plugged into the monitor , so that an \u201cabsent\u201d state can be distinguished from an \u201coff\u201d state. In this manner, the monitor  may also serve as a security device that alerts the user, or other party, of the removal of a monitored appliance. The particular delineation points among the current measures are fairly arbitrary; in a preferred embodiment, no current flow is less than 0.001 amps, minimal current flow is between 0.001 and 0.1 amps; nominal between 0.1 and 1 amp, and high is above 1 amp. Alternatively, an eight or sixteen bit number may be communicated representing, for example, a measure of the current in milliamps, or, at the other extreme, a single bit may be communicated indicating whether any measurable amount of current is being drawn. These and other techniques for measuring current flow, or power consumption, will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art.","The communications device  communicates the current measure to a processing device that is typically remote from the power monitor device . Any number of conventional techniques may be employed to effect this communication, such as via an RF transmission, via a wired connection such as an IEEE RS-232 or IEEE 1394 direct connection, or, in a preferred embodiment, via a communications technique that utilizes the AC supply lines  to effect the communications, such as an X-10 compatible device, common in the art of home-automation.","Optionally, the power monitor  may include a processing device  that effects a similar function as the processing device. , and an annunciator  that effects a similar function to the annunciator . That is, in accordance with this invention, the processing device that determines an appliance's state based on the power measurement may be local  to the appliance, or remote  from the appliance, and, the annunciator that notifies a user of the status, or change of status, of the appliance, may also be local  or remote . As illustrated, the optional processing device  may communicate the state of the appliance or other messages to the communicator , for communication with other devices, such as a remote annunciator , or the remote processing device .","For ease of reference, the invention will be discussed hereinafter with regard to remote devices , ; the application of the principles presented to the local devices ,  will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art.","The processing device  determines the state of the appliance based on the reported power measurements. In general, the state of the appliance is determined via a sequence of reported power measurements, by comparing the sequence with a set of predetermined sequences corresponding to each state, or each state transition. Any of a variety of techniques, common in the art, may be used to determine a state of an appliance.  illustrates a timing diagram and  illustrates a state diagram for an example coffee maker appliance .  illustrates a timing diagram and  illustrates a pattern characterization for an example washing machine appliance . Note that the timing diagram patterns are presented for illustrative purposes; specific appliances will exhibit similar or different characteristic patterns.","Line A of  illustrates an example characteristic pattern of the current drawn by the coffee maker appliance  during a typical usage. During the brewing stage, the appliance  draws continuous current  until a thermostat or other device in the appliance  signals the end of the brewing stage and terminates the current draw, at . After some period of time, a thermostat signals a decrease in temperature at the warming plate that holds the coffee pot, and current  is again drawn, to keep the coffee warm, then terminated , then drawn , and so on, in a typical thermostatically controlled cyclic warming process. If an empty, or near empty, coffee pot is on the warming plate, the duration of the thermostatic cycle will decrease, because there is less coffee to heat, and thus less energy is required to raise the temperature of the coffee pot, as illustrated by the shorter current drawing segments , ,  of , and corresponding shorter cooling segments , .","Line B of  illustrates a power measurement sampling of the current consumption pattern of Line A. In this example, the power measure is a simple on\/off measure. The \u201con\u201d or \u201cdrawing current\u201d condition is illustrated in Line B as an up-arrow, and the \u201coff\u201d or \u201cinsubstantial current\u201d condition is illustrated as the absence of the up-arrow. This representation may correspond, for example, to a system in which, to conserve energy, a power measure is communicated only when power is being drawn by the appliance. As illustrated, the power monitor provides a sequence - of power measures corresponding to the current drawing pattern - of the coffee maker appliance .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","110","410","400","110","360","374","400","360","150","110","420","110","420","110","311","3","361","0","430","4","362","0","430","1","440","390","435","0","430","410"],"sub":"off "},"In the example presented, a properly operating coffee maker appliance  will draw current  for at least a time duration T during the warming stage. A reported \u201coff\u201d state  after the time duration T effects a transition from warm state  back to the warm state . The transition from warm, to warm, and back to warm continues throughout the routine thermostatically controlled warming cycle discussed above. However, if an empty coffee pot is being heated, a short current drawing period  results. As illustrated in , if the power measure is reported to be \u201coff\u201d  before a time duration T from the \u201con\u201d measure  that effected the transition into the warm state, the state is changed from the warm state to a \u201cproblem\u201d state . That is, if an empty coffee pot is being heated, the processing device  determines a \u201cproblem\u201d state , based on the reported power measures - corresponding to the above discussed shortened current draw . In like manner, similar to the time duration T, a time duration T is defined, such that a continued current draw, indicated by a continued \u201con\u201d power measure  in the warm  state also effects a transition to the \u201cproblem\u201d state .","Thus, as shown, an information processor  of the example system of  can determine when a coffee maker appliance  is off, brewing, warming, or exhibiting a problem, based on the sequence of binary power measures  (-) received from a power monitor  associated with the coffee maker appliance . In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the information processor  effects an action in response to particular states, or state transitions. When the information processor  determines that the coffee maker appliance  has left the \u201cbrew\u201d state , it notifies the user that the coffee is ready for consumption. This notification can be effected in a variety of ways, including a spoken message or particular tone sequence via the annunciator , or local annunciator , a recorded or generated audio or video message via the television , and so on.

In a preferred embodiment, the messaging is not necessarily limited to notifications, and may include other effected actions by the information processor . For example, when the processing device  determines that the coffee maker appliance  is in the \u201cproblem\u201d state, it communicates a control signal to shut off the appliance , using, for example, an optional control device  in the power monitor  (), and resets  the state diagram  of  to the \u201coff\u201d state . In like manner, when the processing device  determines that the coffee maker appliance  has completed the \u201cbrew\u201d state, it may communicates a control signal to turn on other appliances, such as the clock radio .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["120","560","576","5","360","374","3","516","5","567","566","567","563","150","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["6","6","120","6","660","662","560","562","5","5","6","663","664","666","563","564","566","605"],"sup":["st ","nd ","st "]},"As illustrated in , pattern B is very similar to patterns C and D . The processing device uses the reported power measure amplitudes ,  to distinguish the characteristic pattern B of the 1spin state from the characteristic pattern C of the rinse state. In a preferred embodiment, the rinse cycle is characterized as having a large ratio of reported power measure  to power measure , while the ratio of reported power measure  to power measure  is relatively small, and is characteristic of the 1spin cycle.","Measures other than the amplitude of the reported power measure are also used to distinguish states. For example, the 1spin cycle pattern B is distinguished from the 2spin cycle pattern D by a substantially shorter period  of little or no current draw, compared to the period  of pattern D, corresponding to the periods  and , respectively, of FIG. . In like manner, the finished state pattern E is characterized by the absence of a subsequent current draw after an interval  from a prior current draw .","As would be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art, the techniques discussed above for determining a state based on a sequence of power measures, and other techniques common in the art, can be combined as required to provide the desired level of distinction among states. Note also that the determination of state based on power measures facilitates the development of a monitoring and notification system that can be customized for each user. That is, the definition and determination of each state resides in the embodiment of the processing device , rather than being predefined for each appliance. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, the integration of a variety of appliances into a home automation network  can be effected without requiring an agreed upon standard of definitions of states among the multitude of vendors that provide the various appliances, and without being constrained by a particular vendor's defined states for an appliance.","In accordance with another aspect of this invention, the rules and characteristics associated with determining a state of an appliance from a sequence of power measures may be provided by an external source, such as a vendor who provides this information as a means for product differentiation, or to increase the perceived value of the appliance.

Using techniques similar to those presented in these referenced applications, the processing device  can receive the information and programming required to effect the determination of states for selected appliances.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["150","710","720","730","740","730","110","120","6","6","6"]},"The processed sequence is compared to the characteristic  associated with the appliance, at . As discussed above, the form of the characteristics  can be any of a variety of forms that facilitate a determination of the state of the appliance from the reported sequence. For example, the characteristics  of the coffee maker appliance  may be in the form of a state machine that effects the state transitions illustrated in FIG. . Conversely, the characteristics  of the washing machine appliance  may be in the form of graphic patterns, and the comparison block  is configured as a pattern matching system. These and other forms of information processing techniques to facilitate comparisons will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of this disclosure.","If, at , the comparison at  indicates a change of state, the state variable is updated, at . At , the appropriate action, if any, corresponding to this change of state is determined, and effected, typically by communicating a message to another device, such as the annunciator , another appliance, such as the television appliance , or to the appliance corresponding to the reported power measures, such as the coffee pot appliance .  illustrates a typical state-transition driven process, wherein actions are effected only when the appliance undergoes a change of state. As is evident to one of ordinary skill in the art, placing the block  outside the conditional path, for example, at , will provide for effecting actions with every reported power measure. Alternatively, forming the block  as a process that is independent of the flow of  will provide for a continuous determination of actions, and would be useful, for example, to detect an absence of the power monitor device. In a preferred embodiment, the actions are determined via a collection of rules  associated with the appliance. As with the characteristics , the rules  may be any of a variety of forms. In a preferred embodiment, the rules are conventional IF-THEN-ELSE statements, common in the art of programming. For example, a rule for the coffee pot appliance  may be \u201cIF new state=warm THEN send Message to Annunciator\u201d, where Message is a recorded or generated message corresponding to the coffee being ready, and Annunciator is an identification of one or more devices or appliances that are used to render the message to notify the user. After effecting whatever actions are required, the process continues, via the loop back to block  to receive the next power measure.","The foregoing merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the invention and are thus within its spirit and scope.

Alternative arrangements are feasible as well. For example, the processing device  is illustrated as being connected directly to the home network . An alternative arrangement could include a processing device  that is remote from the home, such as a service provided by a security monitoring agency, that is connected via a telephone or cable network. In like manner, an annunciation device  may be located at a remote location, and used to provide security alert notifications when monitored appliances are reported as being absent, or when the monitor unexpectedly ceases transmission.
