{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Electronic devices may include rechargeable batteries. In some instances, maintaining the device battery at full charge during recharging may reduce the useful lifetime of the battery. To address this problem, the battery may be maintained at less than a full charge while coupled to the charger. In some examples, the device may show a full charge (i.e., display a 100% charge to the user) while the battery is in fact at, for example, 85 to 90% of full charge. Such implementations may maintain the useful life of the device battery but they may provide shorter use time of the electronic device between battery recharges.","The present disclosure describes example methods for providing battery management for a device. Example methods for a device that has a device battery and is electrically coupled to a device charger may include providing a charge to the device battery that is less than a full charge capacity of the device battery via the device charger, determining a device battery top off charge trigger associated with the device and the device battery, and providing a top off charge to the device battery in response to the device battery top off charge trigger. Example methods for a smart charger to provide battery management for a device coupled to the smart charger may include providing a charge to a battery of the device that is less than a full charge capacity of the battery, determining a battery top off charge trigger associated with the device and the battery, and providing a top off charge to the device battery in response to the device battery top off charge trigger. Example methods for a device to provide battery management to a charging device electrically coupled to the device may include providing a charge to a battery of the charging device that is less than a full charge capacity of the battery, determining a battery top off charge trigger associated with the charging device and the battery, and providing a top off charge to the device battery in response to the device battery top off charge trigger.","The present disclosure also describes example machine readable non-transitory media having stored therein instructions that, when executed, provide battery management by providing a charge to the device battery that is less than a full charge capacity of the device battery via the device charger, determining a device battery top off charge trigger associated with the device and the device battery, and providing a top off charge to the device battery in response to the device battery top off charge trigger.","The present disclosure also describes example devices. The devices may include a device battery, a device charger configured to be electrically coupled to the device, a processor and a machine readable medium having stored therein instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the device to provide battery management by providing a charge to the device battery that is less than a full charge capacity of the device battery via the device charger, determining a device battery top off charge trigger associated with the device and the device battery, and providing a top off charge to the device battery in response to the device battery top off charge trigger.","The foregoing summary may be illustrative only and may not be intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.","Subject matter is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification. The foregoing and other features of the present disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Understanding that these drawings depict only several embodiments in accordance with the disclosure and are, therefore, not to be considered limiting of its scope, the disclosure will be described with additional specificity and detail through use of the accompanying drawings.","The following description sets forth various examples along with specific details to provide a thorough understanding of claimed subject matter. It will be understood by those skilled in the art, however, that claimed subject matter may be practiced without some or more of the specific details disclosed herein. Further, in some circumstances, well-known methods, procedures, systems, components and\/or circuits have not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring claimed subject matter.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and make part of this disclosure.","This disclosure is drawn, inter alia, to methods, devices, systems and computer readable media related to providing device battery management.","In some examples, device battery management may provide for a fully or substantially fully charged battery for use between battery recharges while maintaining the useful life of the device battery. In some battery implementations, such as, for example, lithium-ion batteries, the battery may degrade and lose lifespan if the battery is maintained on a full charge during recharges, particularly when left on a charger for long durations such as during a workday or overnight. In some examples discussed herein, during recharging, the battery may be maintained at a charge that is less than a full capacity of the battery such that the lifespan of the battery may be substantially maintained. To provide a recharged battery to the user that may be substantially fully charged, a trigger may be determined that indicates the device may soon be removed from the charger. In response to the trigger, the battery may be topped off to a substantially full charge or at least a charge that is greater than the lifetime maintaining charge at which the battery is maintained during recharging. The battery top off trigger may be determined in any suitable manner such as, for example, using past charger removals to determine a likely removal time or an on-charger duration time, an indication from, for example, the user, indicating the user will soon remove the charger or that the user may be requesting a top off charge, a query for battery top off to the user and an affirmation to the query, or the like. Such techniques may provide for a substantially long battery lifespan and improved charge levels for users between recharging. The improved charge levels may increase the available use time of the device between recharges or the increased charge levels may be used to downsize the device battery to decrease the size and weight of the device. Such techniques may also provide for a tradeoff to be made between battery lifespan (limiting top off charging) and charge level between recharging (using aggressive top off charging).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","142","144","146","150","110","120","110","110","120","120","120","120","120","120"]},"Battery management system  may be implemented in any suitable manner.

In some examples, the charge to the device battery may be controlled by the device itself. In general, the charge provided to the device battery may be any suitable charge such that the charge may be less than a full charge capacity. As discussed, the less than full charge at the device battery may maintain the battery life of the device battery.","In some examples, the provided charge may be a fraction of the full charge capacity of the battery. In some examples, the provided charge may be 80 to 85% of full charge capacity. In some examples, the provided charge may be 85 to 90% of full charge capacity. In some examples, the provided charge may be 90 to 95% of full charge capacity. The provided charge may be substantially the same with each recharge of the battery or it may be different. In some examples, the provided charge may be determined by the user. In some examples, the charge may be inputted by the user directly (e.g., the user may indicate a less than fully charge capacity percentage or fraction). In other examples, the user may provide a user profile or user setting or settings to the device such as a charge aggressiveness level or a battery life maintenance preference, or the like. In some examples, the provided charge may be determined based on factors such as how long the battery has been in operation (a battery in operation parameter), how long the battery is typically charged for (a battery charge duration parameter), how frequently the battery is charged (a battery recharge frequency parameter), or the like.","In some examples, the device battery may be brought directly to the desired charge at which the device battery may be maintained. Such implementations may offer the advantage of a greater maintenance of the device battery life. In other examples, the device battery may be brought to a full or substantially full charge and the device may be run on the device battery (while being coupled to a charger) such that the device battery may fall the desired charge at which the device battery may be maintained. Such implementations may offer the advantage that, when the battery may be removed prior to an expected removal time, the battery may have a greater charge for use by the user. Method  may continue at block .","At block , \u201cDetermine a Device Battery Top Off Charge Trigger\u201d, a battery top off trigger may be determined. The top off trigger may provide any suitable indication such that a top off charge may be provided to the device battery. In some examples, the top off trigger may trigger the start of a top off charge to the device battery. The battery may begin to charge to a full or substantially full charge and maintain that charge until the device may be removed from the charger by a user. In some examples, the top off trigger may start a count down timer such that the top off charge begins after the count down may be complete. In some examples, the top off trigger may provide an early indication or warning before the device is expected to be decoupled from the device charger. In such examples, the top off charge may be started at any suitable time based on the trigger. In some examples, the top off charge may be started based on an estimated time to full charge of the battery.","In general, the top off charge trigger may be determined using any suitable techniques. In some examples, determining the device battery top off charge trigger may include predicting a removal time of the device from the device charger and providing the device battery top off charge trigger at a time before the predicted removal time of the device. Such examples may use any suitable user activity prediction techniques. The user prediction techniques may track user events and predict when a user may decouple the device from the device charger. In some examples, the removal time may be predicted based on past behavior such that the removal time may be based on a previous removal time or times of the device from the device charger. In some examples, a pattern of past behavior may be based on a common time for removal of the device from the charger. For example, a user may decouple a device from a device charger each workday morning at about the same time before departing for work and\/or at the end of each workday before departing for home. Such techniques may account for the user's workweek and weekend or off days, for example. In some examples, determining the device battery top off charge trigger may include predicting a removal time of the device from the device charger and providing the device battery top off charge trigger at a time before the predicted removal time of the device.","In some examples, determining the device battery top off charge trigger may include predicting an on-charger duration that may indicate how long a user typically keeps the device from the charger. Based on the predicted on-charger duration, a device battery top off charge trigger may be provided at a time before the on-charger duration has expired. For example, some users may not wake or leave for work at a predictable time (such that an accurate removal time may be predicted), but they may charge their device for a predictable duration of time (such that an on-charger duration may be predicted), such as the duration of a night's sleep, a work shift, a car ride, or the like.","In some examples, determining the device battery top off charge trigger may include determining a proximity to a destination. In such examples, the device may be coupled to a car charger. As the device approaches a destination, the device may provide a top off charge trigger to bring the device to a full or substantially full charge as discussed herein. In some examples, the destination may be preset by a user (e.g., by setting a final destination while getting driving directions). In other examples, the destination may be a repeat destination (i.e., home, work, or the like) that the device may recognize and save for use in the top off charge techniques discussed herein. As is discussed further herein, a global positioning system (GPS) of the device may track the device location to determine proximity to the destination location. In some examples, when the device is within a certain distance or predicted time of arrival at the destination, the top off charge trigger may be implemented to begin the top off charge or begin a count down timer to a start time of the top off charge.","In some examples, determining the device battery top off charge trigger may include receiving or determining an indicator at the device. In some examples, the indicator may be determined based on an activity at the device. For example, a user may shut down an email applications shortly before the end of a workday. In other examples, a user may close all or most applications shortly before the end of a workday. In some examples, a user may check a website for directions or weather or the like before heading to or from work. Such behaviors may be monitored to determine a top off charge trigger to provide battery management using the techniques discussed herein.","In some examples, the indicator may be determined at a device sensor. For example, for some users, the device may be removed from the device charger after the occurrence of a sensed event. In some examples, the sensor may be a light sensor. In some examples, the sensor may be a microphone. For example, the user may remove the device from the charger after an alarm sounds and the indicator may be based on the detection of an audio alarm. In another example, the user may typically remove the device from the charger after the lights in the room with the device may be turned on and the indicator may be based on the detection of the lights being turned on. In general, the indicator may be implemented using any suitable techniques. In some examples, the indicator may be an electrical signal communicated over a bridge within the device. In some examples, the indicator may include a register setting command. The register setting command may set a register within the device to indicate the device battery may be top off charged in any manner as discussed herein.","In some examples, determining the device battery top off charge trigger may include receiving an indicator from a networked device communicatively coupled with the device. In general, the device may be networked with and be in communication with a variety of devices. In some examples, the device may be in communication with a ubiquitous computing device. In some examples, ubiquitous computing devices may communicate using a standard protocol such as, for example, the Microsoft Windows SideShow standard. In some examples, the device may be in communication with a kitchen appliance such as, a refrigerator, a coffee maker, or a microwave, a bar code reader, or a radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader, or any device discussed herein. In some examples, the device may receive an indicator from any of such devices indicating an activity has occurred. The activity may be related with the user removing the device from the device charger after the occurrence of the activity. For example, a refrigerator may communicate that the refrigerator door has been opened and, based on past occurrences, the device may predict the user may soon remove the device from the device charger and begin a top off charge as discussed herein. In general, any indicator that may be related to a predictable removal of the device from the device charger may be used. In various examples, the indicator may include a coffee maker being activated (or finishing a recipe), a microwave being activated (or finishing a recipe), a bar code or RFID reader indicating a food item has been removed from its storage location, or the like.","In some examples, determining the device battery top off charge trigger may include receiving a top off charge command from a user. For example, the device may include a button implemented as a hardware button or as a software selection for the user to command the device to begin a top off charge for the device. In software implementations, such a button may be implemented as a home screen option or it may be implemented as a sub-option within a menu option (e.g., the user may select the top off charge by selecting \u201cSystem\u201d, then \u201cBattery\u201d, then \u201cTop Off Charge\u201d, or the like). Such implementations may offer the advantage of flexibility and control for the device user such that the user may choose when a top off charge may be needed, how aggressively to top off charge the device, and so on.","In some examples, determining the device battery top off charge trigger may include presenting a top off charge query to a display device and receiving an affirmation of the top of charge query from a user. In such examples, the device may present to the user an option to top off charge the device battery. If the user affirms the top off charge query, the device may provide the top off charge as discussed herein. If the user rejects the top off charge query, the device may maintain at the less than full charge. In various examples, the top off charge query may be determined in any manner as discussed herein with respect to determining the top off charge trigger. In other examples, the top off charge query may be provided to the user at the time the device and the power source are coupled. Such implementations may offer the advantages of allowing control for the user and a reminder to the user that a top off charge may be available.","In some examples, two or more device battery top off triggers may be determined during the same device recharge. Such triggers may be considered compound triggers. In such examples, a confidence parameter may be associated with each trigger and the trigger having the highest confidence level may be used to determine the implemented trigger. For example, a device sensing lights being turned on may provide a first trigger, sensing a refrigerator door opening may provide a second trigger, and sensing car keys being moved may provide a third trigger. In this example, the third trigger may have a higher confidence level and may be used to implement the top off charge. In other examples, the compound triggers may be used in conjunction to provide a top off trigger. For example, the trigger (or top off charge parameters related to the trigger) for the lights being turned on may be refined by the trigger related to the refrigerator door opening to provide a composite trigger. The trigger related to the keys moving may provide even further refinement. In such examples, multiple triggers may be combined to provide a more accurate composite top off trigger. In some examples, a trigger may have a priority such that no matter what other pending triggers may be available, the top off charge may be immediately responsive to the priority trigger. In the above example, a sensing of keys moving may provide such an impending removal from a charger that an immediate trigger to begin top off may be sent without regard to a pending composite trigger related to the lights and refrigerator. Method  may continue at block .","At block , \u201cProvide a Top Off Charge to the Device Battery in Response to the Top Off Charge Trigger\u201d, a top off charge may be provided. In general, the top off charge may be provided using any suitable techniques. In some examples, the top off charge may be implemented by a battery management system or a power management system of the device. In some examples, the battery management system or power management system may determine the actual state of charge of the device battery. In some examples, the top off charge may begin to ramp the battery to full or substantially full charge and maintain that charge until the device is removed from the charger. In such examples, the top off charge may be of any suitable duration. In examples where the battery is brought to a full or substantially full charge, the battery may take a duration in the range of about 8 to 20 minutes to go from the less than full charge state to the full or substantially full state. In some examples, the duration may be about 10 to 15 minutes. In some examples, a less than full charge may be provided. In some examples a 1 to 5 minute top off charge may be provided. In some examples, the device may increase the current to the battery to provide the top off charge. In some examples, the charge provided may \u201cbump\u201d the charge of the battery from the previously provided less than full charge and the charge provided may therefore be considered a bump charge. In some examples, at completion of the top off charge, a notification may be provided at the device via the device display or speaker, or the like.","In some examples, the device battery may not be brought to a full or substantially full state but instead the device battery may be brought to a charge that is greater than the less than full charge at which the battery had been maintained. In some examples, the battery may be brought to a charge in the range of about 90 to 95% of full charge. In some examples, the battery may be brought to a charge in the range of about 95 to 98% of full charge. In some examples, the top off charge may be provided for a predetermined duration. Such techniques may offer the advantage of ease of use. In some examples, the top off charge may be provided for a duration in the range of about 8 to 12 minutes. In some examples, the top off charge may be provided for a duration in the range of about 12 to 18 minutes.","As discussed, in some examples, providing a less than full charge to the device battery (as discussed with respect to block ) may be completed before or while the top off charge trigger may be determined (as discussed with respect to block ). In other examples, the order of those actions may be reversed such that the top off trigger may be determined before the less than full charge is provided to the device battery. In some examples, a device top off trigger may be determined each time the device is recharged. In other examples, the device trigger may have been previously determined and the top off trigger may be retrieved each time the device is recharged.","As discussed, the battery management techniques discussed herein may offer a tradeoff between having a fully or substantially fully recharged battery and maintaining a useful lifetime of the battery. In some examples, the aggressiveness of the top off charging may be managed by how full of a charge may be provided to the battery during the top off charge. For example, an 85% of full top off charge may provide minimal battery aging, a 90% of full top off charge may provide a medium or mid-level of battery aging, a 95% of full top off charge may provide a high battery aging, and a 100% full top off charge may provide a maximum battery aging. In other examples, aggressiveness of the top off charging may be managed by how frequently top off charges may be performed. In some examples, both the level of top off charging and the top off charging frequency may be altered together to manage the recharge\/battery lifetime tradeoff.","In some examples, the top off charge aggressiveness, level or frequency may be implemented as a user setting or settings. In some examples, the top off charging may be decreased as the battery gets older to maintain the lifetime of the battery. In some examples, the top off charging may be increased as an end of a device service contract nears its end. Since many devices may be replaced at contract renewal, such implementations may provide more recharge durations for the user while the battery life loss problem may not cause a problem since the device may soon be replaced. In some examples, the battery may be top off charged to a full or substantially full charge once or twice per day, while at other recharges, no top off charge may be provided.","In some examples, the aggressiveness of the top off charge may be determined based on a confidence in the prediction of the top off trigger. In some examples, over time the top off trigger may be evaluated for accuracy. In other examples, the technique used to determine the top off trigger may indicate how accurate the trigger may be. For example, a destination based trigger may be more reliable than a prediction based on a sensed change in lighting. In some examples, for more accurate or reliable triggers, a greater top off charge level may be used. In some examples, the confidence in the prediction may be expressed as a time window of expected device removal. For smaller time windows, a greater top off charge may be provided, while for larger time windows a lesser top off charge may be provided. For example, if the window is about 2 to 5 minutes a 95 to 100% top off charge may be provided while if the window is about 40 to 60 minutes, a 88 to 95% top off charge may be provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","500","500","520","500","500","501","500","500","503","504","505","501","503","504","505","500"]},"As illustrated in , device may also include a battery management system  which may provide the battery management functionality discussed herein.

These algorithmic descriptions or representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, is considered to be a self-consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context, operations or processing involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically, although not necessarily, such quantities may take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared or otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to such signals as bits, data, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, numerals or the like. It should be understood, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels. Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout this specification discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining\u201d or the like refer to actions or processes of a computing device, that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical electronic or magnetic quantities within memories, registers, or other information storage devices, transmission devices, or display devices of the computing device.","The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and\/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples contain one or more functions and\/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and\/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof. In some embodiments, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits, as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and\/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a flexible disk, a hard disk drive (HDD), a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Versatile Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and\/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communication link, a wireless communication link, etc.).","The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely examples and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components and\/or logically interacting and\/or logically interactable components.","With respect to the use of substantially any plural and\/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and\/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and\/or application. The various singular\/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d","While certain example techniques have been described and shown herein using various methods and systems, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various other modifications may be made, and equivalents may be substituted, without departing from claimed subject matter. Additionally, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation to the teachings of claimed subject matter without departing from the central concept described herein. Therefore, it is intended that claimed subject matter not be limited to the particular examples disclosed, but that such claimed subject matter also may include all implementations falling within the scope of the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Subject matter is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification.
