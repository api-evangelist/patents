It will be appreciated, however, by one skilled in the art that embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced without such specific details. In some instances, details such as control structures and full software instruction sequences have not been shown in order not to obscure the invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art, with the included descriptions, will be able to implement appropriate functionality without undue experimentation.","References in the specification to \u201cone embodiment,\u201d \u201can embodiment,\u201d \u201can illustrative embodiment,\u201d etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.","Embodiments of the invention may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof. Embodiments of the invention may also be implemented as instructions stored using one or more machine-readable media, which may be read and executed by one or more processors.

In other words, some connections, relationships or associations between elements may not be shown in the drawings so as not to obscure the invention. Also, for ease of illustration, a single connecting element may be used to represent multiple connections, relationships or associations between elements. For example, where a connecting element represents a communication of signals, data or instructions, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that such element may represent one or multiple signal paths, as may be needed, to effect the communication.","Referring now to , an illustrative content retrieval system  is embodied in a computing device . The content retrieval system  includes a content and user interaction analyzer , which processes electronic content (e.g., content , , ) and electronic interactions of a user (e.g., interactions , ) with or relating to electronic content. The content and user interaction analyzer  extracts or derives information and associations from the processed content and interactions, and maintains a similarity model  based on the extracted or derived information and associations. As described in more detail below, the similarity model  can be used (e.g., by a user at a computing device or by an automated process) to find content having a desired type and\/or degree of similarity to an input or source content . Alternatively or in addition, the similarity model  may be used to arrange found content based on a desired type and\/or degree of similarity to an input or source content .

In some embodiments, the content and user interaction analyzer  operates in an automated fashion (e.g., on a continuous, ongoing basis, such as a background process) to analyze electronic content as it is created, modified, or accessed. In other embodiments, execution of the content and user interaction analyzer  may occur in response to a triggering event (e.g., a user command, the occurrence of an event, or the elapse of a specified amount of time).","As described in more detail below with reference to , the content and user interaction analyzer  processes electronic content (e.g., content , , ) to extract or derive therefrom one or more pieces of content embodied in the content and\/or one or more attributes (e.g., name, author, file type, file size, date created, etc.) of the content. Based on the extracted or derived information, the content and user interaction analyzer  associates textual elements with the content, associates the analyzed content with one or more clusters in the similarity model , and updates the similarity model  with information relating to the textual elements and clusters associated with the processed content.","Some examples of electronic content that may be processed by the content and user interaction analyzer  include text strings (such as a search request, query, or search term), electronic mail messages; calendar, task list, or notepad entries; electronic files of any file type (e.g., word processing documents, presentation slides, spreadsheets, graphics, images, thumbnails, sound, music, and audiovisual files), portions or combinations of any of the foregoing and\/or others. Some examples of pieces of content that may be extracted from the content include words, phrases, clauses, symbols, paragraphs, equations, formulas, sequences of numbers, text blocks, sections, headers, images, graphics, charts, tables, graphs, and\/or spreadsheets, portions or combinations of any of the foregoing and\/or others. Some examples of textual elements that may be associated with the content include keywords, meta tags (e.g., HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or Extensible Markup Language (XML) tags), text tokens, semantic information, vectors, portions or combinations of any of the foregoing and\/or others.","As shown in , electronic content processed by the content and user interaction analyzer  may be associated with a search realm . The illustrative search realm  includes un-analyzed content  (e.g., content that has not been processed by the content and user interaction analyzer ), and analyzed content  (e.g., content that has been processed by the content and user interaction analyzer ).","In general, the electronic content ,  associated with the search realm  includes one or more electronically-retrievable documents, data or information elements, such as word processing documents, spreadsheets, presentation slides, text, image, audio, audiovisual, or multimedia files; web pages, electronic messages, attachments to electronic messages, calendar events, address book entries, task list entries, notes, comments, and individual pieces of content or information stored in any location that is accessible to the content retrieval system ; including, for example, private, shared, or public sources, services, applications, databases, document management systems, contact management systems and\/or customer relationship management (CRM) systems, portions or combinations of any of the foregoing, and\/or others. Some examples of private sources include electronic files, folders, and directories, which may be located on a personal computing device (e.g., a smart phone, personal digital assistant, laptop, tablet, or desktop computer). Some examples of shared sources include electronic messages that are sent to other users (e.g., through an electronic mail or social networking application), and electronic files or other information to which a limited group of other users has access (e.g., via a group folder, intranet, or enterprise system). Some examples of public sources include electronic files, blogs, web pages, comments, status updates and messages to which access is not restricted.","In some embodiments, the electronic content ,  may include user-specific content and\/or non-user specific content. Some examples of user-specific content include information created by or about the user and\/or the user's interactions with electronic content that is accessible to the user through one or more computing devices. Such information and\/or interactions may include, for example: documents, data, text, image, audio and video files, presentation slides or files, spreadsheets, electronic messages, email attachments, address book and calendar entries and the like; as well as records of information pertaining to the user's online or local computing activity, search queries, search results, web sites visited and\/or bookmarked, online or local computer applications or services subscribed to (e.g., RSS feeds, TWITTER follows, automated alert services, etc.), user-specific configuration data or preferences (e.g., travel or dining preferences, music styles, etc.), application-specific user information (e.g., employment status or history, subjects or topics of interest, privacy settings, etc.), files, messages, address book entries and\/or calendar events created, viewed, opened, modified, sent, forwarded, replied to or deleted; electronic bookmarks, notes, comments, reminders, task lists, portions or combinations of any of the foregoing and\/or others.","Some examples of non-user specific content include information that is publicly available on the Internet or through Internet-based applications or other networked or online services, such as: documents; text, graphic, image, video, sound or music files, news articles, educational information, maps, address and\/or phone directories, geographic information such as time zones, zip codes, and currency conversions; and catalogs or product or service descriptions, as well as reference data such as public dictionaries or thesauruses (e.g., DICTIONARY.COM), domain-specific dictionaries and\/or ontologies (e.g. medical, legal, or scientific dictionaries and\/or ontologies), public knowledge bases (such as WIKIPEDIA), lists of search terms that are most frequently used by a population of users, rankings of electronic content that has been most frequently or most recently accessed by a population of users, portions or combinations of any of the foregoing and\/or others.","As illustrated in  and described further below, all or portions of the search realm  may be stored on a local computing device, a remote computing device (e.g. one or more physical or logical servers or storage devices configured to provide storage for multiple users), an Internet site (e.g. a server hosting a web page or web-based application), and\/or other suitable locations depending on the type and\/or characteristics of the particular search realm .","The content and user interaction analyzer  interfaces with the search realm  to process electronic content as described herein and update the similarity model  according to the results of the content processing. The illustrative similarity model  is embodied as a database or other suitable data structure configured to store information resulting from the processing conducted by the content and user interaction analyzer . Some examples of information that may be generated by the content and user interaction analyzer  and stored in the similarity model  include textual elements that are added to or associated with processed content (e.g., keywords, topics, sub-topics, text tokens, vectors, annotations, and\/or others), associations of topics and\/or sub-topics with other topics, sub-topics, and\/or content; indexes, information about relationships or associations between or among textual elements, and information about relationships or associations among the various pieces of electronic content and user interactions with or relating to electronic content. The similarity model  also stores weights and scores that are determined or calculated and assigned by the content and user interaction analyzer  to the various textual elements, topics, sub-topics, content and\/or other information associated with the processed electronic content, as described below with references to . The illustrative similarity model  is described in more detail below with reference to .","In some embodiments, the similarity model  may include a user-specific profile . The illustrative user-specific profile  is embodied as part of the similarity model  and may be embodied as a database or other suitable data structure that stores information about a particular user or users of the content retrieval system , user-specific content, and\/or user interactions with or relating to electronic content. Some examples of information that may be stored in the user-specific profile  include textual elements, associations of topics and\/or sub-topics with other topics, sub-topics, and\/or content; indexes, information about relationships or associations between or among textual elements, and information about relationships or associations among various pieces of user-specific information, content and\/or interactions. In some embodiments, the user-specific profile  may include one or more of the features described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/149,536, filed May 31, 2011, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for User Modelization,\u201d and\/or one or more of the features described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/298,374, filed Nov. 17, 2011, entitled \u201cMethod and System Utilizing a Personalized User Model to Develop a Search Request,\u201d both of which are incorporated herein by this reference in their entirety.","Referring still to , the content retrieval system  also includes a similar content finder  and a found content analyzer . The illustrative similar content finder  is embodied as a computerized module that includes one or more computer-executable instructions configured to formulate and execute a computer-executable query to search for electronic content in the search realm  having a desired type and\/or degree of similarity with the input or source content , based on information associated with the input or source content , information obtained from the similarity model , and\/or other input from a user (e.g., interactions , ). Typically, the computer-executable query includes Boolean operators and may include semantic data and\/or other search terms corresponding to one or more attributes or textual elements associated with the input or source content . The similar content finder  returns one or more pieces of electronic content retrieved from the search realm , or no results, in response to the execution of the computer-executable query. The illustrative similar content finder  is described in more detail below with reference to .","The illustrative found content analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module that includes one or more computer-executable instructions configured to analyze the electronic content retrieved by the similar content finder  and arrange the found content according to its relative proximity to the input or source content  according to a desired type and\/or degree of similarity. The desired type and\/or degree of similarity can be determined or modified as a result of user input (e.g., interactions , ) and\/or information obtained from the similarity model . The found content (e.g., content ), if any, may be arranged and presented to the user in any suitable form, visual or otherwise, such as a list, table, or matrix of data, hyperlinks, text, image, audio output, audiovisual files, thumbnail files, and\/or other items, and\/or portions or combinations of any of the foregoing. The illustrative found content analyzer  is described in more detail below with reference to .","As indicated by the bidirectional arrows , , , , , , , , , , , each or any of the processes described herein may be iterative in nature. For example, in some embodiments, a user may enter a search request (e.g., one or more search terms, keywords, or other pieces of content) as the input or source content  and then modify the search request or create a new search request based on results found by the similar content finder . Likewise, the similar content finder  may allow the user an opportunity to specify, modify or clarify the search request by displaying a number of possible modifications or clarifications  of the desired type and\/or degree of similarity associated with the search request, and then create or modify the computer-executable query based on the user's response (e.g., interaction ). In a similar manner, the found content analyzer  may allow the user an opportunity to specify, modify, or clarify the desired arrangement of the found content by displaying a number of possible modifications or clarifications  relating to the desired type and\/or degree of similarity, and then modify the arrangement of the found content based on the user's response (e.g., interaction ). As another example, the content and user interaction analyzer  may monitor a user's electronic interactions with or relating to the found content (e.g., found content ), and then update the similarity model  based on the user's interactions and\/or interface with the found content analyzer  to re-arrange the found content in response to the user's interactions. Additionally, the content and user interaction analyzer , similar content finder  and\/or the found content analyzer  may interface with the similarity model  to update weights, scores, textual elements, associations or other information, at any time during operation of the content retrieval system . In these and other ways, the content retrieval system  can continuously learn new information that may relate to the desired type and\/or degree of similarity with respect to a given input or source content . As a result, through continuous interfacing with the similarity model , the content retrieval system  can adapt and improve its ability to find electronic content having a desired similarity to an input or source content over time (e.g., as content or user preferences change).","In the illustrative example of , an input or source content  is received by or otherwise identified to the content retrieval system  as being electronic content for which other content having a desired type and\/or degree of similarity to the input or source content  is sought. The input or source content  may include an alphanumeric string, a document, an image, a graphic, or virtually any other type of electronic content, and\/or a portion or combination of any of the foregoing. The input or source content  may or may not have already been processed by the content and user interaction analyzer . If the input or source content  has not previously been processed by the content and user interaction analyzer , then it may be processed by the content and user interaction analyzer .","Using the results of processing of the input or source content  conducted by the content and user interaction analyzer , the content retrieval system  may display a number of possible clarifications or modifications  of the desired type and\/or degree of similarity. The possible clarifications or modifications  may relate to one or more similarity metrics (i.e., one or more bases for measuring the type and\/or degree of similarity of electronic content to other electronic content). Some exemplary similarity metrics are discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","In this instance, the input or source content  may be, for example, a presentation slide that has text, graphics, and formatting (e.g., background color, font size, etc.) embedded therein. The similar content finder  may determine, based on the formatting, document type (e.g., \u201c.ppt\u201d), or the presence of graphics in the input or source content ; or based on other attributes or textual elements added to or associated with the input or source content  or other information obtained from the similarity model , that electronic content having a similar layout (but not necessarily similar textual content) is sought. Alternatively or in addition, the similar content finder  may have learned from the similarity model  that the user has created two new versions of the input or source content  within the last several days, and therefore determine that content having similar words, layout, and graphics is the degree of similarity that is sought. To illustrate further, the similar content finder  may determine, based on attributes and\/or textual elements added to or associated with the input or source content , or based on information in the similarity model , or based on interactions of a user with electronic content, that the desired type and\/or degree of similarity relates to the layout of the input or source content , or that a lesser or greater degree of similarity, or that a different type of similarity, is likely desired.","In some embodiments, the similar content finder  may automatically proceed to generate a computer-executable query to search for electronic content having a similar layout (but not necessarily similar words or graphics) to the input or source content ; or to search for electronic content having similar words, similar layout, and similar graphics, as the case may be. However, in the illustrated example, the user is prompted for a possible clarification or modification  and the user selects \u201clayout.\u201d The similar content finder  then executes a computer-executable query formulated to weight \u201clayout\u201d higher than other similarity metrics.","Next, the found content analyzer  analyzes the results of the executed query and arranges the found content based on the similarity of each found content's layout to the layout of the input or source content . Additionally, the found content analyzer  may evaluate the similarity of the found content to the input or source content  based on one or more of, or all of, the other similarity metrics associated with the input or source content . For example, based on the weights associated with the various similarity metrics, found content having similar layout, text, and graphics may be ranked higher or lower than found content having only similar layout.","In some embodiments, the found content analyzer  may automatically proceed to arrange and output the found content (e.g., as a list of search results). In the illustrative example, however, the user is prompted for a possible clarification or modification  of the desired type and\/or degree of similarity. In the illustrative example, the found content analyzer  may, after having learned from user input that layout is an important similarity metric (for at least the current search), display possible modifications or clarifications that may be related to the layout, and the user may select \u201ccolor scheme.\u201d The found content analyzer  then groups the found content; ranking found content that has both similar layout and similar color scheme to the input or source content  higher than found content that has only a similar layout, and higher than found content that has a similar layout and similar graphics but not a similar color scheme.","Referring now to , an illustrative data model diagram  for the similarity model  is shown. According to the data model diagram , the similarity model  stores and maintains content data objects ; extracted content, attribute, or textual element data objects , topic data objects , sub-topic data objects , similarity profile data objects , similarity metric data objects , content analyzer data objects , and relationships among the data objects , , , , , , , represented by bidirectional arrows.","The illustrative content data object  stores information about electronic content that has been processed by the content and user interaction analyzer ; for example, a unique content identifier, a content name (e.g., a file name), a description of the content, a content type (e.g., a document type), a location (e.g., a folder or directory on a computing device), a status (e.g., analyzed or un-analyzed), and a score (e.g., a proximity score relative to an input or source content ).","The illustrative extracted content\/attribute\/textual element data object  stores information about each piece of content extracted from a content , attributes associated with the content , and textual elements added to the content  by the content and user interaction analyzer . For example, the extracted content\/attribute\/textual element data object  stores a unique extracted content\/attribute\/textual element identifier, name, description, type (e.g., extraction, attribute, or textual element), location (e.g., link or name of a folder or directory on a computing device), and weight (indicating, e.g., the importance of the extracted content, attribute or textual element  relative to other extracted content, attributes or textual elements  associated with the content ).","The illustrative topic data object  and sub-topic data object  each include information relating to words that describe or indicate higher-level concepts and\/or associations or relationships among the extracted content, attribute, and\/or textual element data objects , as determined by the content and user interaction analyzer . For example, based on its analysis of a content , the content and user interaction analyzer  may associate an extracted image of a person sitting at computer with a topic called \u201ccomputer\u201d and also with a sub-topic of the \u201ccomputer\u201d topic called \u201cpersonnel.\u201d However, based on its analysis of another content , the content and user interaction analyzer  may associate the same image with a topic called \u201cworkplace\u201d and a sub-topic called \u201ctelecommuting.\u201d In the illustrated example, the topic data object  and the sub-topic data object  store a unique topic or sub-topic identifier (as the case may be), name, description, and weight (indicating, e.g., the importance of the topic or sub-topic relative to other topics or sub-topics associated with an extracted content, attribute or textual element  or content ).","The illustrative similarity profile data object  stores information that can be used to link one or more similarity metrics with a particular search situation, such as a specific user or process conducting the search and\/or a specific type of input or source content . In the illustrated example, the information associated with the similarity profile data object  includes a unique similarity profile identifier, name, type of profile (e.g., user and\/or content type), description, related-to identifier (e.g., a user name, process identifier, or a file name or file extension associated with a document type), and weight (indicating, e.g., the importance of the similarity profile  relative to other similarity profiles  associated with a user or content type). As an example, a particular user or process may specify that when searching for electronic mail messages that are similar to an input or source content , similarity metrics relating to textual similarity should be weighted higher than similarity metrics relating to visual similarity. The same user or process may specify that when searching for electronic books (or \u201ce-books\u201d) that are similar to an input or source content , similarity metrics relating to content style (e.g., similar style of writing) should be weighted higher than similarity metrics relating to visual similarity. Other users or processes may define similarity differently in these and\/or other contexts, and therefore may have different similarity profiles.","The similarity metric data object  stores information about similarity metrics that can be associated with extracted content, attributes or textual elements  and\/or similarity profiles . In the illustrated example, that information includes a unique similarity metric identifier, name, type (indicating, e.g., whether the similarity metric applies to textual or non-textual content), description, and weight (indicating, e.g., the importance of the similarity metric relative to other similarity metrics associated with an extracted content, attribute or textual element  or with a content ). For example, where an extracted content consists of a video or graphic file, a similarity metric relating to visual content similarity may be weighted higher than a similarity metric relating to textual similarity. Similarity metrics may be configured to apply to all or certain instances of content, attributes, and textual elements, or, through the similarity profile , may be tailored according to the preferences associated with specific users or automated processes.","As described in more detail below with reference to , the illustrative content analyzers (e.g., analyzers , , , , , , , , , , ) are embodied as computerized modules executable by the content and user interaction analyzer  to process electronic content in accordance with one or more similarity metrics. The content analyzer data object  includes data that can be used to associate one or more content analyzers with one or more similarity metrics. In the illustrated example, that data includes a unique content analyzer identifier, name, type (indicating, e.g., on what type of content the analyzer can be used, such as graphics, images, URLs, words, or phrases), description, and weight (indicating, e.g., the importance of the content analyzer  relative to other content analyzers associated with a similarity metric ). As an example, if an extracted content includes a grammatical clause or phrase, a similarity metric that is directed to measuring the similarity of the text (e.g., the words or sequences of words) may be applied. There may be multiple different content analyzers associated with the \u201csimilar text\u201d similarity metric; for example, a most important words analyzer (e.g., analyzer ), a semantic analyzer (e.g., analyzer ), and a vector analyzer (e.g., analyzer ). These content analyzers may be weighted differently for the extracted clause or phrase than they would be for an extracted keyword, attribute, or textual element, in some instances. For example, a vector analyzer may be weighted higher than a most important words analyzer for analysis of extracted clauses or phrases.","In the illustrative embodiment, the bidirectional arrows shown in  are used to indicate many-to-many relationships among the data objects. For example, a piece of content  may be related to one or more extracted content\/attribute\/textual element data objects . That is, a content  may have one or more pieces of content extracted or derived therefrom, or one or more attributes, or one or more textual elements associated therewith. Similarly, an extracted piece of content, attribute or textual element may be associated with one or more content data objects  (e.g., the same graphic or keyword may occur in multiple documents). An extracted content, attribute, or textual element  can be associated with many different topics , sub-topics , and\/or similarity metrics , and vice versa. Likewise, a similarity metric  can be associated with many different instances of extracted content, attributes, or textual elements ; many different similarity profiles , and\/or many different content analyzers , and vice versa. Also, a topic  may have multiple sub-topics  associated with it, and a sub-topic  may be associated with multiple topics . It should be understood, however, that one-to-many and\/or one-to-one relationships between the data objects , , , , , ,  may be used, alternatively or in addition to many-to-many relationships, in some embodiments.","Referring now to , an illustrative method  executable by the content and user interaction analyzer  to analyze electronic content is shown. At block , the method  determines whether electronic content identified to the content and user interaction analyzer  (e.g., content , , ) is content to be processed by one or more of the content analyzers , , , , , , , , , , , or whether it relates to a user's electronic interaction with or relating to content (e.g., selecting and\/or opening a found document at a computing device).","If the electronic content identified to the content and user interaction analyzer  relates to a user interaction, then at block , the interaction is analyzed and the similarity model  is updated as needed. For example, depending on the nature of the user's interaction with the content, one or more of the weights associated with the data objects , , , , ,  may be adjusted higher or lower. The user's interaction may be explicit (e.g., clicking on a \u201clike,\u201d \u201cthumbs up,\u201d or \u201cthumbs down\u201d icon) or implicit (e.g., the user opens a document ranked third on a list of found content but does not open a document ranked first on the list). In either case, information relating to the user's interaction is captured by the content and user interaction analyzer  and may be used to update the similarity model .","If the electronic content (e.g., content , , ) identified to the content and user interaction analyzer  is to be processed by one or more of the content analyzers , , , , , , , , , , , then at block , the method  determines which of the one or more similarity metrics are associated with the content. Some examples of similarity metrics include: a textual similarity metric (measuring the similarity of words in a piece of content to those in an input or source content); a content similarity metric (measuring the similarity of concepts or topics to which a piece of content is related compared to those related to an input or source content); an overall visual similarity metric (measuring the similarity of the layout, color, font, paragraph structure, etc. of a piece of content to those of an input or source content); a specific visual similarity metric (measuring the similarity of a specific piece of visual content (e.g., a graphic or image) to an input or source content); a content type similarity metric (measuring the similarity of the type of content (e.g., legal, medical, technical, entertainment, opinion, news, etc.) to an input or source content); a content style similarity metric (measuring the similarity of the writing style of content to an input or source content); and a content sentiment similarity metric (measuring the relative polarity (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) of a content relative to an input or source content).","The similarity metric(s) associated with an electronic content may be determined based on, for example, one or more attributes of the content. For example, if the content is a word processing document in which tables and graphs are embedded, then both a textual similarity metric and a visual similarity metric may be associated with the content. In some embodiments, all of the available similarity metrics may be associated with the content irrespective of its attributes or other factors, in which case, block  can be skipped.","At block , a determination is made as to whether all or a subset of the available content analyzers (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , ) are to be applied to the electronic content. In some embodiments, only those content analyzers associated with a particular similarity metric, or only certain of the content analyzers associated with a particular similarity metric, may be applied to the content. For example, a text document may be associated with a content similarity metric. The content similarity metric may have multiple different content analyzers associated with it; such as a most important words analyzer (e.g., analyzer ), a semantic analyzer (e.g., analyzer ), a topic analyzer (e.g., analyzer ), and a vector analyzer (e.g., analyzer ). Based on one or more attributes of the content and\/or information in the similarity model  (e.g., user preferences, weights, etc.), the method  may determine that the semantic analyzer  but not the vector analyzer  should be applied to the content. In other embodiments, all of the available content analyzers may be applied to the content irrespective of its attributes, associated similarity metrics, or other factors, in which case, block  can be skipped.","At block , the electronic content identified to the content and user interaction analyzer  is analyzed using all or selected ones of the available content analyzers , , , , , , , , , , . At block , individual pieces of content and\/or attributes are extracted or derived and analyzed, and one or more textual elements (e.g., keywords, topics, sub-topics, text tokens, vectors, annotations, etc.) are added to or associated with the content by the selected content analyzers , , , , , , , , , , .","In some embodiments, a word importance analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative word importance analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to determine which of the textual elements added to or associated with a content comprise one or more words that appear to be the most important, most popular, most frequently used, and\/or most recently used words associated with the content. In some embodiments, the word importance analyzer  uses one or more statistical or probabilistic analytical tools or techniques, such as a combination of term frequency and inverse document frequency (e.g., a modified tf-idf algorithm), to create and continuously update an index of words that appear to be most important in the content and\/or in the similarity model . In some embodiments, the word importance analyzer  extracts the most important words from the content, adds or associates one or more textual elements with the content, and updates the similarity model  with information associated with the most important words, so that other content containing one or more of the most important words may be determined to have a desired similarity with the content.","In some embodiments, a URL analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative URL analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to identify any Uniform Resource Locators in the content and to follow the link associated with each URL. Any additional content associated with each followed link is analyzed in the same manner as the original content, as described herein.","In some embodiments, a semantic analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative semantic analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to extract or derive semantic information from the electronic content and add or associate one or more textual elements with the content based on the semantic information. For purposes of this disclosure, the term \u201csemantic information\u201d is intended to include, without limitation, any information relating to the underlying meaning or meanings of a particular piece of content and\/or relationships between the content and its one or more underlying meanings. For example, in some embodiments, semantic information relating to content may include one or more categories of information (e.g., name, date, location, phone number, etc.); specific instances of information associated with the categories of information (e.g., proper nouns); and relationships between the categories and instances of information. As an example, for a given piece of content containing the word \u201cJackson\u201d (or having a textual element \u201cJackson\u201d associated therewith), a semantic relationship might be \u201clast name: Jackson,\u201d while for another piece of content, the relationship might be \u201cfirst name: Jackson\u201d or \u201ccompany name: Jackson.\u201d Alternatively or in addition, multiple relationships may be associated with content, with each relationship being assigned a weight according to its likelihood of being the correct or intended one. For example, for a given piece of content, a relationship of \u201cJackson: first name\u201d might be weighted higher than a relationship of \u201cJackson: last name,\u201d while the opposite might be true for a different piece of content.","Generally speaking, the semantic analyzer  processes electronic content to determine semantic information (e.g., semantic categories, instances, and\/or relationships) associated with the electronic content using one or more semantic analysis techniques. In some embodiments, the semantic analyzer  may process electronic content using one or more of the semantic analysis techniques described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/149,319, filed May 31, 2011, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Performing Semantic-Based Analysis,\u201d which is incorporated herein by this reference in its entirety. The semantic analyzer  may also access the similarity model  (including the user-specific profile ) to determine semantic information that may be appropriate to associate with the content and add or associate one or more textual elements with the content based on semantic information from the similarity model .","In some embodiments, a topic analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative topic analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to analyze semantic information and\/or other attributes or textual elements associated with the content, and create or associate topics and\/or sub-topics with the content. In some embodiments, the topics and\/or sub-topics may be obtained or derived from user-specific sources (such as the user-specific profile ) and\/or public sources, such as dictionaries or thesauruses (e.g., DICTIONARY.COM), domain-specific dictionaries and\/or ontologies (e.g. medical, legal, or scientific dictionaries and\/or ontologies), public knowledge bases (such as WIKIPEDIA), lists of search terms that are most frequently used by a population of users, and\/or rankings of online content that have been most frequently or most recently accessed by a population of users. The topics and\/or sub-topics are stored in the similarity model , and may include descriptions, connotations, contexts, and\/or higher-level concepts or abstractions that represent associations among extracted content, attributes, and\/or textual elements (e.g., semantic information) that appear to have some relationship with one another based on, for example, their use, proximity and\/or frequency of occurrence in the content and\/or the similarity model . The topic analyzer  may also assign weights to the various topics and sub-topics, based on, for example, frequency or recency of access or use of the content.","In some embodiments, a style analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative style analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to analyze the style of writing of content, including, for example, the language used (e.g., English, French, Chinese, etc.), the average length of sentences and\/or paragraphs, the number of different words used, the relative frequency of similar words, the number of words of a particular part of speech used (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), most common terms, the types and\/or frequency of punctuation, abbreviations, acronyms, typographical errors, uncommon terms, the types and\/or frequency of use of different sentence types (e.g., declarative, interrogative, imperative, exclamatory, simple, compound or complex), a portion or combination of any of the foregoing, and\/or other factors. The style analyzer  extracts or derives grammatically significant groups or combinations of words that appear together or in close proximity (e.g., phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, etc.) from the content and conducts a most important words analysis (using, e.g., the word importance analyzer  described above) and\/or a vector analysis (using, e.g., the vector analyzer  described below) to associate the extracted or derived content with one or more styles of writing. The style analyzer  adds or associates one or more textual elements with the content with information associated with the one or more styles of writing determined to be associated with the content. The style analyzer  may also access the similarity model  to determine writing style information that may be appropriate to associate with the content and add or associate one or more textual elements with the content based on writing style information from the similarity model .","In some embodiments, a domain analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative domain analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to determine one or more specific subject matter domains (e.g., legal, medical, technical\/electrical, technical\/mechanical, etc.) associated with the content. The domain analyzer  extracts or derives words or combinations of words that appear to have a specialized meaning (e.g., proper nouns or uncommon phrases) from the content and conducts a most important words analysis (using, e.g., the word importance analyzer  described above) and\/or a vector analysis (using, e.g., the vector analyzer  described below) to associate the extracted or derived content with one or more subject matter domains. The domain analyzer  adds or associates one or more textual elements with the content based on information associated with the one or more subject matter domains determined to be associated with the content. The domain analyzer  may also access the similarity model  to determine subject matter domain information that may be appropriate to associate with the content and add or associate one or more textual elements with the content based on subject matter domain information from the similarity model .","In some embodiments, a sentiment analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative sentiment analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to analyze the overall sentiment of content, including, for example, whether the content is an opinion piece or an analysis, and if an opinion, the type and\/or degree of polarity (e.g., strongly negative, mildly negative, neutral, mildly positive, or strongly positive, emphatic, or critical). The sentiment analyzer  extracts or derives grammatically significant groups or combinations of words that appear together or in close proximity (e.g., phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, etc.) from the content and conducts a most important words analysis (using, e.g., the word importance analyzer  described above) and\/or a vector analysis (using, e.g., the vector analyzer  described below) to associate the extracted or derived content with a type and\/or degree of sentiment. The sentiment analyzer  adds or associates one or more textual elements with the content based on information associated with the type and\/or degree of sentiment determined to be associated with the content. The sentiment analyzer  may also access the similarity model  to determine sentiment information that may be appropriate to associate with the content and add or associate one or more textual elements with the content based on sentiment information from the similarity model .","In some embodiments, a vector analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative vector analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to extract or derive words, alphanumeric strings, and\/or grammatically significant parts of speech (e.g., groups or combinations of words) that appear together or in close proximity (e.g., phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, etc.) from the content, and convert them to numerical vectors. In the illustrated embodiment, each vector is a sequence of digits of length N, where N is a positive integer. Each digit has a value that comprises a positive integer (ranging, e.g., from 0 to 9), and each digit has a position in the vector, also represented by a positive integer. Each digit (e.g., the combination of its position in the vector and its value) is associated with a specified meaning. All of the vectors generated for the content are then processed using a mathematical or arithmetic function (e.g., addition), and the resulting vector (or list or array of vectors) is added as a textual element to the content. In this way, a vector or combination of vectors associated with content can be compared with corresponding vectors associated with other content to determine whether there is a desired type and\/or degree of similarity between the pieces of content.","For example, a paragraph describing a hotel's amenities may be extracted from content that includes a structured web page from a trip planning web site. The web page may include a paragraph indicating that a hotel has rooms available that have a queen size bed with free wireless Internet service, no swimming pool, and a complimentary continental breakfast. The extracted paragraph may be converted to a vector , where the first digit position in the vector represents bed information, the second position represents wireless access information, the third position represents swimming pool information, and the fourth position represents breakfast information. For bed information, the following digit values may be available: {0=full, 1=queen, 2=king, 3=California king}. Thus, the illustrative vector, which has the value 1 in position 1, indicates that the available hotel room has a queen bed. Similarly, the available values for wireless access may be {0=no, 1=yes}; thus, the illustrative vector having a value of 1 in position 2 indicates that the available hotel room has wireless access. Likewise, the available values for swimming pool information may be {0=no, 1=yes}, such that the illustrative vector having a value of 0 in position 3 indicates that the hotel does not have a swimming pool. Further, the available values for breakfast information may be {0=coffee, 1=continental, 2=Asian}, such that the illustrative vector having a value of 1 in position 4 indicate that the hotel has a continental breakfast.","Vectors can also be configured to associate digits with specific structures that may be present in the content. For example, patent documents have a specific structure with claims presented as numbered paragraphs at the end of the document, and legal documents often have a specific structure that includes a signature block at the end of the document. A vector can be configured, for example, so that one of its digits is used to represent the presence or absence of a particular type of structure in the content. As an example, a vector digit at a certain position in the vector may have possible values of {0=not a claim, 1=claim}, where the determination of whether the analyzed part of the document is or is not a claim is made, for instance, by whether it begins with a number followed by a period followed by a sentence of a certain length and\/or format.","Signature blocks may be analyzed similarly using the vector analyzer . For example, position 1 in a vector may represent the presence of a name, position 2 may represent location or title, and position 3 may represent contact information. Thus, if an extracted piece of content has a name followed by a location or title followed by contact information (e.g., phone number, or postal or electronic mail address), its associated vector may be 111, which may be considered by the vector analyzer  as having a high degree of likelihood of representing a signature block. In this way, vectors can be used to determine that a content has a particular structure (e.g., a signature block) without regard to the actual contents of the signature block. The signature block vector can then be compared, alone or in combination with other vectors, to corresponding vectors of other content to determine whether there is a desired type and\/or degree of similarity between the pieces of content.","As shown in , the vector analyzer  can be used in connection with many of the textual content analyzers, including, e.g., the semantic analyzer , the topic analyzer , the style analyzer , the sentiment analyzer , and\/or the user profile analyzer . In general, the vector analyzer  may be used whenever sequences or groupings of words, textual tokens, tags, etc., as opposed to individual instances of textual elements (e.g., words, tokens, tags, etc.), are extracted from the content. In some embodiments, the vector analyzer  may, alternatively or in addition, be used with one or more of the non-textual content analyzers that transform non-textual information into textual tokens (e.g., the graphics or image analyzer  and\/or the layout or template analyzer , both described below). For example, the graphics or image analyzer  may execute the vector analyzer  to produce vectors where, e.g., digit 1={0=graphic\/image is in black and white, 1=graphic\/image is in color}, digit 2={0=graphic\/image contains no people, 1=graphic\/image contains people}, or may produce vectors including a digit associated with the presence or absence of each color, types of shapes (e.g., square, circle, etc.) in the graphic\/image, and\/or others. Information relating to associations of vectors with their respective content may be stored in the similarity model .","In some embodiments, a graphics or image analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative graphics or image analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to extract or derive graphics and\/or images from the content and convert them to textual representation tokens that describe one or more attributes or characteristics of the extracted graphic or image. In the illustrative embodiments, textual representation tokens comprising information relating to the type of graphic or image, its dimensions (e.g. pixels), main color(s), shape, edge positions, and position within the content, may be used. In other embodiments, additional or other types of textual representation tokens may be used. In some embodiments, special software, such as ASPOSE.SLIDES FOR .NET, may be used to extract information from graphics or images and convert the graphics or images to textual representation tokens. The graphics or image analyzer  then adds or associates one or more textual elements with the content based on or including the resulting textual representation tokens. The graphics or image analyzer  may also access the similarity model  to determine graphic or image-related information that may be appropriate to associate with the content and add or associate one or more textual elements with the content based on or including graphics or image textual representation tokens from the similarity model .","In some embodiments, a layout or template analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative layout or template analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to extract or derive layout and\/or template information (e.g., number of pages, page numbering scheme and position, sections, paragraphs, titles, fonts, styles, indents, bulleted lists, numbered lists, tables, headers, footers, etc., and\/or portions or combinations of any of the foregoing) from the content and convert them to textual representation tokens that describe one or more attributes or characteristics of the extracted layout and\/or template information. In the illustrative embodiments, textual representation tokens comprising information relating to any of the above-mentioned layout and\/or template features, and\/or others, may be used, depending on the requirements of a particular design. In other embodiments, additional or other types of textual representation tokens may be used. In some embodiments, special software, such as ASPOSE.EMAIL, ASPOSE.PDF, and\/or ASPOSE.WORD may be used to extract layout and\/or template information from content and convert the layout and\/or template information to textual representation tokens. The layout and\/or template analyzer  then adds or associates one or more textual elements with the content based on or including the resulting textual representation tokens. The layout and\/or template analyzer  may also access the similarity model  to determine layout and\/or template information that may be appropriate to associate with the content and add or associate one or more textual elements based on or including the content with layout and\/or template textual representation tokens from the similarity model .","In some embodiments, a user profile analyzer  may be applied to the content. The illustrative user profile analyzer  is embodied as a computerized module comprising one or more computer instructions configured to extract or derive words, alphanumeric strings, and\/or grammatically significant groups or combinations of words that appear together or in close proximity (e.g., phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, etc.) from the content and accesses the user-specific profile  to determine user-specific meanings, connotations, and\/or relationships with other terms that may be appropriate to associate with the content, and adds or associates one or more textual elements with the content based on user-specific information from the user-specific profile . For example, in some embodiments, the user-specific profile  may be used to determine user-specific meanings of acronyms, abbreviations, proper nouns, and\/or other words or groups or combinations of words in the content. In some embodiments, the user profile analyzer  may include one or more of the features described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/298,374, filed Nov. 17, 2011, entitled \u201cMethod and System Utilizing a Personalized User Model to Develop a Search Request,\u201d which, as noted above, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Once content has been analyzed using any or all of the content analyzers , , , , , , , , , , , information relating to the textual elements and their associated content may be stored in the similarity model . At block , the method  executes one or more clustering methods to associate the analyzed content with one or more topics or sub-topics defined in the similarity model , and\/or create one or more new topics or sub-topics, based on the textual elements added or associated with the content at block . In the illustrative embodiments, a dynamic clustering method is used to associate the analyzed content with topic\/sub-topic cluster(s) in the similarity model. For example, a dynamic clustering method and\/or one or more of the clustering tools described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/149,319, filed May 31, 2011, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Performing Semantic-Based Analysis,\u201d which, as noted above, is incorporated herein by reference. Some examples of suitable clustering tools include Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), object-oriented programming languages such as LINGO, and linear programming models such as KATZ.","In some embodiments, the content retrieval system  may include multiple different clustering tools; in which case the content and user interaction analyzer  may execute programming logic to select and use one of the available clustering tools, depending on the particular content type, context, user preferences or feedback, and\/or other factors. Following clustering, information relating to the cluster(s) associated with the processed content is stored in the similarity model .","Referring now to , an illustrative method  executable by the similar content finder  is shown. Generally speaking, execution of the method  is triggered by a request made (e.g., by a user or an automated process) to find content having a desired type and\/or degree of similarity to the input or source content . At block , the method  determines whether the input or source content  includes more than one piece of content. If the input or source content  includes more than one piece of content, the individual pieces of content are \u201cmerged\u201d into a single logical or physical content unit (using, e.g., a concatenation function and\/or other techniques including, for example, one or more techniques for removing duplicates, removing non-overlapping pieces of content, or weighting certain of the pieces of content higher than others).","At block , the desired type and\/or degree of similarity is determined. As described above, this may be an iterative process that may involve one or more interactions with a user and\/or accessing of user-specific context information, which may be stored in the user-specific profile . Some examples of user-specific context information include a history of the user's most recent searches or interactions with content, information about the user's current geographic location, the current date and time, recent changes in the user's calendar or contact information, recent email activity of the user, and\/or others.","If the input or source content  has not previously been processed by the content and user interaction analyzer , then it is processed by the content and user interaction analyzer  to obtain the textual elements, similarity metrics, and clustering information described above. The textual elements, similarity metrics, and clustering information associated with the input or source content  are used to determine the desired type and\/or degree of similarity sought. In some embodiments, this determination may also be informed by one or more attributes of the input or source content , user input (e.g., interaction ), and\/or information obtained from the similarity model  (including information from the user-specific profile ). In some embodiments, a determination is made as to which similarity metric or metrics may be associated with the input or source content  (e.g., based on the textual elements and\/or clustering information associated with the input or source content , user interaction, and\/or information in the similarity model ).","At block , the weights associated with the similarity metrics(s) determined at block  to be associated with the desired type and\/or degree of similarity are determined from the similarity model  (e.g., using weights stored in the similarity model  as described above with reference to ). In some cases, the desired type and\/or degree of similarity may be, in fact, a type or degree of dissimilarity, or diversity. In such instances, weights associated with one or more of the relevant similarity metrics may be adjusted downward.","At block , the relevant similarity metric(s) and their associated weights are used to identify relevant cluster(s) in the similarity model, and then other content in the search realm  and associated with the relevant cluster(s) is identified using a computer-executable query as described above. During searching, the similar content finder  looks for content in the search realm  that is associated with one or more clusters in the similarity model  that are also associated with the input or source content .","Referring now to , an illustrative method  executable by the found content analyzer  is shown. The method  is, generally speaking, triggered by the finding, by the similar content finder , of content having a desired type and\/or degree of similarity to the input or source content . At block , for each cluster that found content has in common with the input or source content , the piece(s) of found content in the cluster are scored based on its proximity to the input or source content . A score is calculated for each of the similarity metrics that were applied to the content. In some embodiments, proximity scoring is done using a weighted sum; that is, the proximity scores for all of the relevant similarity metrics are weighted according to the weights associated with the similarity metrics, respectively, and then the weighted scores are added together to yield a total proximity score for the piece of content as it relates to the input or source content . In some embodiments, the proximity score may be computed as a measure of perceived strength of association (e.g., the confidence level or strength of belief that the found content is similar to the input or source content ) using statistical measures including probabilities, proximity measures, and\/or other techniques.","At block , each cluster and\/or the found content in each cluster associated with the input or source content  is ranked based on the calculated proximity scores. As mentioned above, this may be an iterative process and may involve interaction with the user (e.g., interaction ). In instances where the desired similarity is actually a desired type and\/or degree of dissimilarity, found content may be grouped according to the clusters it has in common with the input or source content , and then only one or a small number of content may be selected from each cluster to provide a desired level of diversity or dissimilarity. Once a desired ranking of the clusters and\/or found content is established, the found content is output to the user at a computing device according to the arrangement determined at block .","At block , the content and user interaction analyzer  monitors the user's interactions with the output generated at block . Based on the user's interactions, the content and user interaction analyzer  may update the proximity scores associated with certain clusters and\/or found content, and\/or one or more of the weights described above, and store the updated scores and\/or weights in the similarity model . For instance, if block  assigned a high ranking to a certain found content, but the user does not access that content from the returned results, then block  may update the proximity score associated with that content.","Referring now to , an illustrative embodiment of the computing device  is shown. The computing device  includes at least one processor  and an input\/output (I\/O) subsystem . In the illustrative embodiment, the computing device  is embodied as a personal computing device such as, for example, a mobile or handheld computing device, smartphone, personal digital assistant, laptop computer, tablet computer, or desktop computer. However, the computing device  may be embodied as any type of computing device such as, for example, a server, an enterprise computer system, a network of computers, or other electronic device or system.","The processor  includes one or more processor cores (e.g. microprocessors). The I\/O subsystem  typically includes, among other things, an I\/O controller, a memory controller, and one or more I\/O ports (not shown). The processor  and the I\/O subsystem  are communicatively coupled to a memory . The memory  may be embodied as any type of suitable memory device, such as a dynamic random access memory device (DRAM), synchronous dynamic random access memory device (SDRAM), double-data rate dynamic random access memory device (DDR SDRAM), and\/or other volatile memory device.","The I\/O subsystem  is communicatively coupled to at least one input device , at least one data storage , at least one output device , and at least one network interface . The I\/O subsystem  may be communicatively coupled to one or more other peripheral devices such as a graphics, sound and\/or video adapter (not shown), depending upon, for example, the intended use of the computing device .","The input device  may include a keyboard, keypad, touch screen, microphone, or other suitable device for accepting input from a user (e.g. interactions , , ). The output device  may include a text, graphics, and\/or video display screen, speaker, or other suitable device for presenting output (e.g. possible modifications or clarifications , , found content , etc.), to the user.","The network interface  communicatively couples the computing device  to one or more networks , which may include a local area network, wide area network, personal cloud, enterprise cloud, public cloud, and\/or the Internet. Accordingly, the network interface  may include a wired or wireless Ethernet adapter, Wi-Fi adapter or other suitable device as may be needed, pursuant to the specifications and\/or design of the particular network .","The data storage  may include one or more hard drives or other suitable data storage devices (e.g., memory cards, memory sticks, and\/or others). In the illustrative embodiment, an operating system (\/S)  resides in the data storage . The operating system  is, for example, a Microsoft Windows\u00ae, Linux, or other operating system, or other similar set of instructions, which may be designed specifically for a particular type of computing device, for example, a discrete, handheld, or portable electronic device or smart phone.","Any or each of the content retrieval system , the search realm , and the similarity model  may be local to the computing device  or distributed across multiple computing devices . In the illustrated example, a content retrieval system CRS()  includes at least one instance of the content retrieval system , a similarity model SM()  includes at least one instance of the similarity model , and a search realm SR()  includes at least one instance of the search realm . At least a portion of each of the CRS() , SM() , and SR()  is stored in the data storage . Portions of the O\/S , CRS() , SM() , and\/or SR()  may be copied to the memory  during operation, for faster processing or other reasons.","In some embodiments, the CRS()  may include a client application or front-end user interface for the content retrieval system , while a back end or server application for the content retrieval system  may reside on the network  (e.g. as a content retrieval system CRS() ). Likewise, the SM()  may include aspects of the similarity model  that are local to the computing device , such as locally created documents; while other aspects of the similarity model , such as records of the user's electronic interactions with networked systems, may reside on the network  (e.g. as a similarity model SM() ). Similarly, the SR()  may include aspects of the search realm  that are local to the computing device , such as locally created documents; while other aspects of the search realm , such as publicly available content, may reside on the network  (e.g. as a search realm SR() ).","In some embodiments, the entire content retrieval system , the entire similarity model , and the entire search realm  may be stored in the data storage  (e.g. as CRS() , and SM() , and SR() ) of the computing device . In some embodiments, the CRS()  and\/or the CRS()  may have access to all or portions of one or more other similarity models (e.g. one or more similarity models SM() ). In this way, the content retrieval system  can leverage not only similarity information that is contained in the local similarity model (e.g. SM() ), but also similarity information contained in other similarity models to which it has been granted access (e.g. by family, friends or colleagues of the user, or automated processes). Similarly, an instance of the content retrieval system  (such as an instance of a content retrieval application used by a certain person or automated process) may have access to all or portions of one or more other similarity model(s) SM()  and\/or SM() , depending on the particular requirements or design of a given content retrieval system .","The computing device  may include other components, sub-components, and devices not illustrated in  for clarity of the description. Further, it should be appreciated that in embodiments where one or more of the instances of content retrieval systems , , search realms , , and\/or similarity models , ,  are distributed or implemented on a network, such systems should be capable of tracking and maintaining the identity of the user(s) using or associated with the respective content retrieval systems , , search realms , , and\/or similarity models , ,  as may be needed. This can be done, for example, by capturing a user's logon ID, password, device address (such as an IP address), and\/or other suitable identifying information and using suitable authentication and\/or validation techniques.","In general, the components of the computing device  are communicatively coupled as shown in , by one or more signal paths, which are represented schematically as bidirectional arrows , , , , , , , , , , . Such signal paths may be embodied as any type of wired or wireless signal paths capable of facilitating communication between the respective devices. For example, the signal paths may be embodied as any number of wires, printed circuit board traces, busses, point-to-point interconnects, intervening devices, and\/or others.","While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, such an illustration and description is to be considered as exemplary and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only illustrative embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the disclosure are desired to be protected.
