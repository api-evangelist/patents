No. 60\/772,779 filed Feb. 13, 2006.","This invention was made partially with Government supports under grant no NNJ05JC13C awarded by NASA. The government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Technical Field","The invention relates to optical imaging apparatus, particularly related to polarization imaging apparatus, more specifically related to a high speed polarization imaging system that can measure Stokes components from a sample at different optical wavelengths.","2. Technical Background","The light scattered by a tissue has interacted with the ultrastructure of the tissue, which imprinted some intrinsic properties of the tissue. Tissue ultrastructure extends from membranes to membrane aggregates to collagen fibers to nuclei to cells. Photons are most strongly scattered by those structures whose size matches the photon wavelength. It has been demonstrated that light scattering can provide structural and functional information about the tissue. One important biomedical application of optical imaging and spectroscopy is non-invasive or minimally invasive detection of pre-cancerous and early cancerous changes in human epithelium, such as dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.","In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the propagation of polarized light in randomly scattering media. The investigation of backscattered light is of particular interest since most medical applications aimed at the in-vivo characterization of biological tissue rely on backscattered light. By recording the spatially dependent response of a medium to a polarized point source, one may obtain information about the scattering particles that are not accessible to mere intensity measurements. A diagnostic imaging modality based on near-infrared (NIR) radiation offers several potential advantages over existing radiological techniques. First, the radiation is non-ionizing, and therefore reasonable doses can be repeatedly employed without harm to the patient. Second, optical methods offer the potential to differentiate between soft tissues, due to their different absorption or scatter at NIR wavelengths that are indistinguishable using other modalities. And third, specific absorption by natural chromophores (such as oxy-haemoglobin) allows functional information to be obtained. NIR imaging research has focused on a variety of possible clinical applications.","The fact that the polarization state of the light contains useful information has been shown in many literatures, for example. Rahmann and Canterakis in \u201cReconstruction of specular surfaces using polarization imaging,\u201d , vol. 1, pp. 149-155, 2001, describe how the polarization state of light can be used for the reconstruction of specular surfaces to determine the shape of 3-D objects. They use the fact that light reflected by dielectrics and metals becomes partially linearly polarized and that the direction of polarization depends on the orientation of the reflecting surface. Demos and Alfano in \u201cDeep subsurface imaging in tissues using spectral and polarization filtering,\u201d , vol. 7, no. 1, pp. 23-28, 2000, demonstrate a technique based on polarization imaging that allows for optical imaging of the surface as well as structures beneath the surface.","There have been several polarization imaging schemes published. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,437,856, inventor Steven Louis Jacques, which issued Aug. 20, 2002, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,394, inventors Robert R. Alfano, et al., which issued Dec. 8, 1998, a set of measurements at different polarization orientations are taken to render a new image that is independent of the light reflected from the surface of a tissue sample and that is dependent of the light scattered from deep tissue layers. Especially, a linearly parallel polarized light is used for illumination and two images are acquired, one image selecting linearly parallel (Par) polarized light (i.e., parallel to the light source-tissue-camera plane) and one image selecting linearly perpendicular (Per) polarized light (i.e., perpendicular to the light source-tissue-camera plane). A new image is obtained by (Par\u2212Per) or (Par\u2212Per)\/(Par+Per).","Many polarimetric sensing technologies have been developed to capture the Stokes polarization information. People use rotating retarder, rotating polarizer to obtain Stokes parameters from several successive frames of image. In these mechanically-rotation approaches, however, the exact spatial registration between various frames is difficult due to changes of viewing angle and the polarization properties during the period of between successive frames in most target detection applications.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,798,514, inventor James Maurice Daniels, which issued Sep. 28, 2004, the light passes through two liquid crystal waveplates and a polarizing filter before falling on a light sensitive element device to measure intensity of light in four different polarizations. However, the same difficulty also applied to the approach using liquid crystal for electro-optic polarization modulation, which usually has response time in the order of 100 ms. Another drawback for the liquid crystal approach is that polarization-rotating liquid crystals are not commercially available in many important IR bands.","It is therefore the main objects of the invention to provide a polarization imaging apparatus which can consistently provide high speed and broadband Stokes images in real-time.","The first key feature of the polarization imaging apparatus is that it provides fast adjustable optical phase control through high speed electro-optical variable phase retarders made from transparent electro-optic ceramics.","The second key feature of the invention is that the polarization imaging apparatus can be worked at a wavelength from 400 nm to 7 \u03bcm, using electro-optic ceramics.","The third key feature of the invention is that a simplified time sequential control and measurement algorithm which provides a fast measurement and converts sequential intensity images to Stokes images.","A preferred embodiment of the polarization imaging apparatus is shown in , which consists of a polarization imaging sensing unit , an electronic driver  and a computer . The imaging sensing unit  consists of an optical lens set , a linear polarizer  with its optical axis , a first variable phase retarder (VPR)  with its optical axis  aligned 22.5\u00b0 to axis , a second variable phase retarder  with its optical axis  aligned 45\u00b0 to axis , and a imaging sensor  for sensing the intensity images of the sample.

Hence, the 22.5 degree orientation of the second variable phase retarder  with respect to the first variable phase retarder  of claim  is achieved by any combination of relative physical rotation of the second variable phase retarder  with respect to the first retarder  and rotation of the polarization reference frame between the two variable phase retarders  and  by a fixed phase retarding plate (not shown but included as part of the present invention).","Any other orientation configuration of first variable phase retarder  and second variable phase retarder  will also work, as long as the two variable retarders oriented at different angles, however may involve more difficult calculations.","In addition to the simplified measurement algorithm, a key component in this polarization imaging apparatus is the variable phase retarder. The other means to change the phase retardation, rotating waveplates, Faraday rotators and Pockel's cell have been used in laboratories worldwide. These devices, however, are bulky, high power consumption, slow or expensive.","A preferred variable phase retarder is made from an electro-optic (EO) material. The general requirement for an EO variable phase retarder is that, when a voltage is applied, a predetermined phase shift is produced for the light beam. Also the material is isotropic with no voltage applied, there is no residual birefringence to cause the initial phase shift. Preferably, the material has a high electro-optic coefficient in order to reduce operating voltages to less than 500 volts. Also the mechanical characteristics allow formation of a bar or plate for use as the electrode. Of course, the material must be transparent at the wavelength of interest, e.g., between 450 nm and 7 \u03bcm for most of the polarization imaging applications.","These requirements are satisfied by a class of ferroelectric complex oxides which 1) are optically isotropic; 2) have a Curie temperature less than about 490\u00b0 C., so that electro-optic coefficients are high near room temperature; 3) have a diffusive phase transition, so that the temperature dependence of the electro-optic coefficients is lessened; and 4) which are not permanently poled by moderate electric fields since materials with a low Curie temperature that become permanently poled are less stable. Example material systems include electro-optic lanthanum modified PZT (PLZT), lead manganese niobate (PMN), a solid solution of lead zinc niobate and lead tantalate (PZN-PT), and a solid solution of lead manganese niobate and lead tantalate (PMN-PT). Besides PLZT, without being an exhaustive list the following materials and their solid solution with or without lanthanum modification, may be used: Pb(Zr,Ti)O, Pb(Mg,Nb)O, PbTiO, Pb(Zn,Nb)Oand PbTaO. These materials are available from Corning Inc. (Corning, N.Y.) and Boston Applied Technologies, Inc. (Woburn, Mass.), referenced as OptoCeramic\u00ae materials. These materials are electrical controllable, solid-state, high speed, low insertion loss, and low fabrication cost.","A preferred OptoCeramic\u00ae material, PMN-PT, for use in the present invention may be described by the general formula\n\nPbLa[(MgNb)Ti]O\n","wherein x is between about 0.6 and about 0.95, z is between about 0 and about 0.08, and t is between about 0.30 and about 0.36. In especially preferred electro-optic ceramic materials of the present invention, z is between about 0.01 and about 0.06. In preferred electro-optic materials of the present invention, t may be between about 0.32 and about 0.34, and x may be between about 0.65 and about 0.90.","According to the present invention, the preferred OptoCeramic\u00ae PMN-PT is lanthanum modified solid solution of lead manganese niobate and lead tantalate (La:PMN-PT, or PLMNT) with a nominal 3.5\/75\/25 La\/PMN\/PT composition. For reference purposes nominal values for this PLMNT are n=2.48 and R=11.5\u00d710m\/Vat 1.06 \u03bcm and n=2.458 and R=6.86\u00d710m\/Vat 1.55 \u03bcm, both at 23\u00b0 C. PLMNT has a polycrystalline structure with crystal sizes ranging from about 5 to 20 microns. In the form of hot-pressed ceramics, it is optically isotropic and exhibits little birefringence with zero applied voltage.","An electrode geometry of phase retarder which takes advantage of these materials is illustrated by the transverse field configuration illustrated in . A plate , for use as the variable phase retarder  and  of , is shown which has thin metallized electrodes  and  on the both sides, respectively, of a block section  of EO material. The electrodes  and  are shown connected to a driving voltage  provide by controller  shown in . The electric field (designated E) is 90\u00b0 to the direction of light propagation. Since the effect is based on the electric field in the material, it is desirable to arrange the electrodes as close together as possible to minimize the control voltage. The optical axis of the EO element is perpendicular to the electric field.","As an example, an EO phase retarder is made from a PLMNT plate with metallized electrodes, which has dimensions where the width (w) between the electrodes is about 5 mm, a thickness (t) of about 4 mm, and a length (l) of about 5 mm. Such a dimensioned PLMNT plate has an insertion loss of about 0.1 dB and half-wave voltage of 320V for a 700 nm wavelength laser at 23\u00b0 C.","It will be understood that the particular geometry described is an example and that other device geometries can be used. Different dimensions of w and t can be selected to provide the same \u03c0 phase shift with different control voltage. The other preferred PLMNT plate has dimensions of, but not limited to a width (w) of about 0.5-5 mm, a thickness (t) of about 1.30-5 mm, and a length (l) of about 1.0-5.0 mm.","Another preferred OptoCeramic\u00ae material is PLZT with a nominal 9.5\/65\/35 La\/Pb\/Zr composition. This composition is known to be transparent in a range from 450 nm to 7 \u03bcm; see, for example, Lionel M. Levinson, Electronic Ceramics, Chapter 7 (Marcel Dekker, New York, 1987).","Yet another preferred OptoCeramic\u00ae material, PZN-PT, for use in the present invention may be described by the general formula\n\nPbBaLa[(ZnNb)Ti]O\n","wherein x is between about 0.5 and about 0.9, y is between about 0.05 and about 0.5, z is between about 0 and about 0.05, and t is between about 0.30 and about 0.36. In especially preferred electro-optic ceramic materials of the present invention, x is between about 0.65 and about 0.85, y is between about 0.1 and about 0.2, z is between about 0.02 and 0.04, and t is between about 0.32 and about 0.34.","Referring to  is the measured variable phase retarder response. The optical response  to the applied control voltage  is less than 1 microsecond. This means that the speed of setting and resetting of the VPR is as fast as 1.0 microsecond. According to the present invention, the imaging apparatus only needs 2 and 3 settings for the first and the second variable phase retarders  and  to complete a measurement cycle, respectively. The polarization sampling time could be less than 3 microseconds. This equals the system can generate a set of 4 Stokes component images at a speed of up to 300K frames per second (fps). With a fast enough imaging sensor, a real-time Stokes polarization imaging system can be realized.","In the present invention, another preferred EO material for variable phase retarders  and  are made from liquid crystals for a polarization imaging system working between the optical wavelengths 350 nm to 2000 nm. Using the invented control algorithm illustrated in , and relationship between sequential intensity images and Stokes images listed in Table 1, a fast polarization imaging system using LC variable retarders can also be configured.","A polarization imaging apparatus shown in  is basically a passive imaging system which using ambient light source to illuminate the sample. Referring to  is a schematic view of a preferred embodiment of an active polarization imaging apparatus in accordance with the present invention. It consists of an illumination unit  and an imaging sensing unit . The said illumination unit and imaging sensing unit are aligned in a reflection configuration. Both illumination unit  and imaging sensing unit  can be set to an angle related to sample  surface normal . In addition to a light source , the illuminator may consist of parts such as a collimator , a polarizer or polarization modulator , and a fixed wavelength filter or tunable wavelength filter . Tunable optical band-pass filter was used to produce desired wavelength for the imaging, from visible to infrared (IR). The illuminator could produce a linear or arbitrary polarized light beam.","A preferred light source  is a broadband light source, such as a tungsten-halogen lamp which provides a strong intensity over a broad spectrum from UV to NIR (300 nm to 2 \u03bcm). Another preferred light source is a light emitting diode (LED) source or laser source.","The scattering light  from sample  is detected by the imaging sensing unit . The optical lens set  in  shown in  can be an optical objective lens  in  with an infinite focal length, which makes the polarization imaging system a Stokes microscope.","The first VPR  and second VPR  were controlled independently by a computer  through a controller unit  which generates a sequential of voltages to control the phase retardations of VPRs  and . A set of four intensity images, I, I, Iand Iof the sample were captured by imaging sensor  when the phase retardations of VPRs  and  were set at (0,0), (\u03c0,0), (\u03c0,\u03c0) and (\u03c0\/2,\u03c0), respectively Then four Stokes components of a Stokes image, S, S, Sand Scan be calculated by computer  according to equation (1).","Referring to  is a schematic view of a polarization imaging apparatus shown in  configured in a transmission configuration.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
