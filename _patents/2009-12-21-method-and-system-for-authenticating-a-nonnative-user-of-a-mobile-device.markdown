title: Method and system for authenticating a non-native user of a mobile device
abstract: An approach for permitting an unregistered user of a mobile device to utilize a communication service. It is detected that a user of a mobile device is not registered with a service provider to utilize the mobile device. Authentication information supplied by the user of the mobile device is collected. A request, including the authentication information, is generated for using a communication service of the service provider. In response to the request, an acknowledgement message is selectively received granting permission for the user to utilize the communication service if the authentication information is valid.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The mobile industry continues to mature and enjoy great success, in which consumers' usage of services are ever increasing. Consequently, the number and types of mobile devices (e.g., handsets), with varying levels of sophistication available to consumers, are also growing at a high rate. Undoubtedly, mobile devices have become an integral part of life. Hence, the unavailability of a device, even temporarily, can be gravely disruptive, particularly in the context of business communications. Moreover, in addition to variety in equipment, there are many choices of service providers and associated services that the various mobile devices can engage in or subscribe to. Traditionally, users are tied to particular mobile devices as part of their subscriptions to these wireless services. As a result, consumers are severely restricted in their ability to freely use other mobile devices.","Based on the foregoing, there is a need for an approach that permits usage of mobile devices irrespective of whom the devices are registered to, as to minimize unavailability of wireless communication service.","A preferred method and system for authenticating a user using authentication information (e.g., biometric data) in the absence of a user identification module within a mobile device is described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, that the preferred embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiments of the invention.","Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to a mobile station, it is contemplated that various exemplary embodiments are also applicable to stationary devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","101","103","101","105","107","105","109"]},"In system , according to certain embodiments, one or more networks, such as data network , service provider network , telephony network , and\/or wireless network , are provided to handle various communication sessions, voice communications as well as non-voice communications. Networks - may be any suitable wireline and\/or wireless network, and be managed by one or more service providers. For example, telephony network  may include a circuit-switched network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), an integrated services digital network (ISDN), a private branch exchange (PBX), or other like network. Wireless network  may employ various technologies including, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), mobile ad hoc network (MANET), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like. Meanwhile, data network  may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, such as a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network.","Although depicted as separate entities, networks - may be completely or partially contained within one another, or may embody one or more of the aforementioned infrastructures. For instance, service provider network  may embody circuit-switched and\/or packet-switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit-switched and\/or packet-based communications. It is further contemplated that networks - may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and\/or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner, networks - may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 (SS7) network, or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.","According to exemplary embodiments, end user devices  may include any customer premise equipment (CPE) capable of sending and\/or receiving information over one or more of networks -. For instance, voice terminal  may be any suitable plain old telephone service (POTS) device, facsimile machine, etc., whereas mobile device (or terminal)  may be any cellular phone, radiophone, satellite phone, smart phone, wireless phone, or any other suitable mobile device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), pocket personal computer, tablet, customized hardware, etc. Further, computing device  may be any suitable computing device, such as a VoIP phone, skinny client control protocol (SCCP) phone, session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, IP phone, personal computer, softphone, workstation, terminal, server, etc.","By way of example, the approach of system  for permitting an unregistered (or non-native) user of a mobile device to utilize a communication service is explained with the wireless network  employing GSM.","Currently users of GSM phones can remove a user identification module, e.g., a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, from the mobile phone and insert the SIM card into a new phone. The SIM card can store information to identify a subscriber\u2014i.e., a service-subscriber key (IMSI). This card can also contain security authentication and ciphering information, as well as information about the services available to the user. Upon placement of the SIM card into the new phone, the phone will operate without interruption of service. However, if the users do not have a SIM card, the phone is rendered in operable. For example, a user may lose the SIM card, such would be a common scenario in regions that support pre-paid SIM cards, for example.","Therefore, the approach of system , according to certain exemplary embodiments, stems from the recognition that mobile devices (in which user authentication module is unavailable) constitutes wasted or underutilized resources, not to mention a source of inconvenience (even aggravation) for users. Also, it is recognized that current systems that tie users to particular mobile devices lack flexibility with respect to the users' experience and accessibility to communication resources.","By way of example, the mobile device authentication platform  allows users employ any wireless device as their own (e.g., for a temporary period) by uniquely identifying and authenticating themselves. In certain embodiments, these users, who are not registered with a wireless service provider to use the subject wireless devices, are considered \u201cnon-native\u201d users, and thus, the devices are referred to as \u201cnon-native devices.\u201d Conversely, registered users and associated devices are denoted, respectively, as \u201cnative users or native devices.\u201d In this example, mobile device is assumed to be a non-native device with respect to a particular user. The mobile device requests authentication from the network (e.g., wireless network  and\/or service provider network ) to permit use of the non-native device over the network. Once the authentication is completed in the non-native device , the device may obtain the details necessary from the network , which will be used to present service options in the non-native device as if it were a native device. As mentioned, this capability can be designated as temporary; and thus, once this temporary mode expires, the device returns back to its original state. According to certain embodiments, the users will be able to effect the above approach just by biometrically identifying themselves, which can be used to both uniquely identify and authenticate the users using non-native devices to emulate their original devices. It is noted that the biometric authentication mechanism may be replaced with (or\/and operated with) other authentication mechanism as well; e.g., multiple passphrase challenges as well as other identification details, etc.","By way of example, the mobile device can include or can gain access to a biometric identification mechanism to conduct, for instance, a retina scan, facial scan, voice print, finger print, palm vein reader, etc. The non-native user using the mobile device can invoke an application to biometrically authenticate himself\/herself. According to certain embodiments, once such initial authentication is complete, additional authentication mechanism can invoked, such as passphrase challenge. That is, the authentication mechanism may verify user provided credential information, which can be stored within a user profile of, for instance, subscriber database . In one example, the credential information may include \u201clog on\u201d information corresponding to a user name, password, coded key, or other unique identification parameter, such a personal identification number (PIN). In other instances, the credential information may include any one or combination of a birth date, an account number (e.g., bank, credit card, billing code, etc.), a social security number (SSN), an address (e.g., work, home, internet protocol (IP), media access control (MAC), port, etc.), or telephone listing (e.g., work, home, cellular, etc.), as well as any other form of uniquely identifiable datum, e.g., bearer tag identifier, etc.","Thereafter, the appropriate components (e.g., switches) of wireless network  is updated, incoming calls can be routed to this device for the non-native user. In one embodiment, information that the user has pre-configured can be downloaded to this \u201cnew\u201d device , such that the information can configured for presentation by the device . For example, the information may include the user's own contact list, images, call log, calling plan, call usage information, balance, and etc. Any communication session (e.g., call) that is made can be counted towards the new users' cell phone account (as tracked in subscriber platform  and database , for instance). Under this arrangement, the mobile device becomes the user's \u201cown\u201d device for the period of time the user chooses to use the device ","The system  can implement, in one embodiment, a wireless application (e.g., resident within mobile device ) that can exchange data through the user's data plan, without compromising the ability of the native user's ability to make or receive calls. The native user can receive and initiate calls through a \u201cregular\u201d channel of network , whereas the non-native users' call will be routed through the data network \u2014using, for instance, voice over internet protocol (VoIP) on demand application. This application can be launched on the device . According to one embodiment, the \u201cborrowed\u201d (or non-native) mobile device essentially becomes the user's own device with respect to functionalities, with the exception that communication sessions (e.g., voice calls) are established via data channels rather than voice channels.","Using the borrowed mobile device , the user can authenticate through the user's own wireless provider, e.g., wireless network , which has an account for this user as maintained within subscriber database . In one embodiment, this authentication process can be executed via an authentication application via the data network , wherein the user dials the user's directory number (i.e., phone number) and is authenticate through a voicemail platform , specifying the borrowed device as a target device (e.g., mobile device ) for a VoIP application. Once the user is authenticated with the service provider, the service provider can identify the type of device the user has borrowed, as well as the network the device is on and the devices data network capabilities. This process can be either automatically performed by the network (e.g., service provider network ) or the user can manually specify the type of device, as well as data and voice network capabilities.","By way of example, the service provider can either push a VoIP application to the device , or send an SMS\/MMS message to the device enabling the user of the device to pull the VoIP application. As mentioned, the VoIP application can supply calling functionality on the borrowed device via the data network , as the user of data services will minimize cost for supporting the communication sessions initiated by the non-native device ","According to one embodiment, the application can provide a customized graphical user interface (GUI) to resemble the user's regular native device (such information can be maintained within subscriber database )\u2014for example, the application can duplicate the display and key mapping of that device . Additionally, the user's personal information (contacts, appointments, data storage such as images and video) can also be network resident and available to the application via the network . This device configuration information can be downloaded to the target device, i.e., device . Therefore, the described arrangement can enable users to readily utilize the mobile devices of other users, while preserving the look-and-feel of the user's native device.","Accordingly, the service provider can maintain a database  of target device profile and capability data so that the application that is launched on the target device (i.e., the borrowed device) is validated on that device to work. It is noted that if the wireless network  is governed by the same service provider of network , then the device profile database  can also be implemented at the mobile subscriber platform .","Furthermore, the database  can store configuration information of devices that can be utilized to emulate the capabilities of one device on another device. In other words, the service provider can determine the capabilities, applications, features, and communication services (as part of the configuration information) associated with the user's native device, and implement to the extent possible these features and services on the non-native (or borrowed) device. With this configuration information, the platform  can attempt to emulate by activating the features and services that the user is accustomed to, but provided by the borrowed device . Moreover, if the user maintains data (e.g., contact lists, calendar information, etc.) within the service provider network , such that the data can be made available to the user via the non-native device. In this manner, the user can essentially use any device to access the user's data without loss of functionality.","Among many advantages of the described authentication mechanism is that the user is not tied to a particular phone to utilize the communication service. That is, the user (i.e., non-native user) has the ability to use multiple devices (if the user has phones of differing capabilities and form factors) as well as other users' phones without expending those users' minutes (i.e., incur cost to the other users). Under this approach, for example, if the user loses his\/her mobile device, the user can simply purchase another phone, biometrically authenticate himself\/herself and immediately continue using the user's wireless service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A","FIG. 7"],"b":["101","100","101","201","203","205","207","209","211","101","103","101","109"]},"Furthermore, the device database  can be maintained by the mobile device authentication platform  as part of the service provider network ; alternatively, the device database  can be deployed within the wireless network  as a database local to the mobile subscriber platform . The device database , as explained, store configuration information and applications to permit the non-native user to possess similar functionality and look of the user's native device. According to one embodiment, device database  stores contact lists, calendar information, as well as media (e.g., images and video). When the borrowed device is authenticated, the device can be configured with these configuration information and applications. Depending on the make and model of the mobile devices (as well as services), equivalent features and functionalities need to be correlated for the emulation function to operate. As such, a native device emulator  can perform this correlation, and determine how to implement equivalent functionalities on the borrowed device. In this regard, the emulator  may query the device profile database  to compare the features of the subject devices (e.g., the non-native device and the native device) and invoke the necessary actions to \u201cinstall\u201d on a temporary basis the features and programs to effectively emulate the native device on the nonnative device. By way of example, if the non-native device does not have data service, but the non-native user wishes to use email, the platform  would activate the data service on the borrowed device, on a temporary basis. This process is further detailed with respect to . According to one embodiment, this emulation capability can be provided as a subscription service by the service provider.","In this example, the platform  may communicate directly with one or more switches (not shown) within the telephony , or may be integrated with the telephony signaling network as an intelligent peripheral or processor, for instance. While specific reference will be made to this particular implementation, it is also contemplated that platform  may embody many forms and include multiple and\/or alternative components. For example, it is contemplated that the components of platform  may be combined, located in separate structures, or separate locations.","According to one embodiment, platform  embodies one or more application servers over one or more networks -.","According to some embodiments, authentication module  for provides for authentication of non-native users of mobile devices using unique authentication information (or credential information) that is unique to the users and respective mobile devices , . An authentication schema may require interaction with biometric analysis module , which is configured to analyze biometric data received from a user. It is noted that the unique authentication information may further include a user name and password, a key access number, a unique machine identifier (e.g., media access control (MAC) address), etc., as well as a combination thereof. However, in one embodiment, only the biometric data generated from the mobile device (e.g., device ) is utilized.","The authentication module , in conjunction with the biometric analysis module , can process the biometric data generated by mobile device , in which the biometric analysis module  can ensure that the biometric data complies with predetermined format and data structural requirements (e.g., protocol). This check is especially important if there lacks uniformity in the manner the mobile devices generate the biometric data. In any event, this capability permits more flexibility, and thus, facilitates more rapid adoption of this non-native user authentication approach. If the form of the biometric data is acceptable (as determined by the biometric analysis module ), the authentication module  proceeds with known authentication schemes using the biometric data.","It is contemplated that the authentication module  may operate in concert with communication interface . That is, the authentication module may verify the biometric data acquired via communication interface  against corresponding biometric data stored within a user profile of subscriber database . Alternatively, a subset of the subscriber database can be stored locally in a user profile repository (not shown).","User interface  may be a web portal or other networked application, to permit user to access the features and functionality of platform  via devices . According to certain embodiments, user interface  may be configured via a web browser or other network-based application or system, such as a voice browser or interactive voice recognition system. This capability permits users, for instance, to directly register their devices to receive notifications.","As mentioned, the target device (e.g., mobile device ) may be supplied with a VoIP application. Thus, mobile device authentication platform  can include a VoIP application module  that can initiate a download of a VoIP application to mobile device automatically or upon manual request by the non-native user.","According to certain embodiments, platform  may include a messaging module (not shown) that may be configured to generate control signals for transmission to device utilizing any suitable bearer, such one or more call control setup messages, short messaging service (SMS) messages, enhanced messaging service (EMS) messages, multimedia messaging service (MMS) messages, electronic mail, files, or any other suitable bearer, as well as any suitable combination thereof. In particular implementations, these bearer mediums may include control signals in various forms, including attention (AT) commands, menu traversal paths, function codes, voice data, dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals, scripts, strings, parameters, object variables, and the like. It is noted that these control signals can be used in lieu of \u201csoftware code,\u201d and therefore, may be directly integrated into the control logic of mobile device , thereby requiring less processing and hence, less power. It is contemplated, however, that coded instructions may also be utilized.","Additionally, platform  may include one or more controllers (or processors)  for effectuating the aforementioned features and functionality of the authentication processes of system , as well as one or more memories  for permanent and\/or temporary storage of one or more of the aforementioned variables, parameters, information, signals, etc. In this manner, the features and functionalities of non-native user authentication may be executed by controller(s)  and\/or memories , such as in conjunction with one or more of the various components of platform .","On the user side, as shown in , a mobile device , which may be a mobile device of , includes a non-native user authentication module  that is configured to acquire authentication information from a non-native user. According to one embodiment, the mobile device  interfaces with a biometric identification device , which can acquire biometric data from the user based on, for instance, a retina scan, facial scan, voice print, finger print, palm vein reader, etc. Thus, the biometric identification device  can include one or more sensors to capture the described biometric data. In an alternative embodiment, the biometric identification device  be integrated (reside within) the mobile device , as illustrated in .","As shown, the mobile device  employs a user identification module , such as a subscriber identification module (SIM), to permit a native user to communicate over wireless network . However, as mentioned, if the SIM  is removed, the mobile device  can still retain the capability to communicate using functionality of the non-native user authentication module . This authentication module  can determine when the user identification module  is absent, and thus, initiate an alternative mode operation. This alternative mode of operation can be temporary; in this manner, an operational mode monitor  can track when and\/or how the mobile device  reverts to normal operations. By way of example, the monitor  can transition the mobile device  according to an expiration period or time-based schedule. Alternatively, the monitor  can detect a triggering event to transition operational states. The settings or parameters associated with the monitor  is user (i.e., native user) configurable, in one embodiment.","Also, the device  includes, according to one embodiment, a packetized voice module  that is configured to establish a voice communication session over a data channel\u2014e.g., using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. This method of communication can be set as a default during the alternative operational mode. Consequently, the cost of communication can be minimal or avoided (assuming voice communications over a data channel, such as VoIP, is significantly less costly vis-\u00e0-vis cellular voice channels). Additionally, or alternatively, once the network  \u201crecognizes\u201d the non-native user based on the biometric data, the network  can redirect any charges (e.g., minutes) to the account of the non-native user. In other words, the non-native user may be non-native with respect to mobile device , but is nonetheless a valid wireless subscriber with a separate account from the native user of the device .","Thus, communication interface  can be appropriately configured depending on the transport systems and networks, and whether packetized voice communications is invoked during the alternative operational mode. Although only a single interface  is shown, it is noted that multiple communication interfaces may be utilized, depending on the technologies involved.","Moreover, the user device  employs a user interface module  to enable control by the user of the device of these various communication sessions; in one embodiment, the user interface module  provides a graphical user interface (GUI). Additionally, a controller  is configured to coordinate the concurrent communication sessions provided by the user interface module  and voice module ; for example, the controller  generates the appropriate signaling to control the communication interface  for transmissions over a voice channel and a data channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["250","100","301","250","251","250","255","250","253","303","253"]},"In step , a request is generated by the device  to utilize a communication service of the wireless network . The communication service, in this example, is establishment of a voice communication session; alternatively, this communication service can, instead, be a messaging service (e.g., short message service\/multimedia message service (SMS\/MMS)), or email. The request is then transmitted, as in step , to the mobile device authentication platform  via the wireless network , which can detect the authentication request using appropriate signaling to forward the request to the platform .","At this point, the mobile device authentication platform  proceeds to verify the biometric data and generate an acknowledgement message, which specifies the granting of permission for the non-native user to utilize the wireless communication service of network . This process is more fully described below with respect to . Accordingly, in step , the mobile device  receives the acknowledgement message. Thereafter, the mobile device  can establish a communication session (step ), e.g., voice call, over the network ; in one embodiment, this voice call is carried over a data channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["250","117","101","113","401","250","113","117","101","117","403"]},"Next, the process obtains the identifier of the mobile device , as in step . It is noted that this step  can be optional, assuming the mobile device authentication platform  is capable of acquiring the identity of the mobile device  in another manner. In step , the process checks whether the received biometric data correlates to any biometric data that has been previously stored (within biometric data database ) by comparing the received biometric data with the stored biometric data (step ). Next, the process determines whether the extracted biometric data is valid based on the comparison, as in step .","In step , the mobile identifier (as obtained in step ) is associated with a user identifier (corresponding to the received biometric data), after the biometric data is declared valid. An acknowledgement (ACK) message is then generated; such message can indicate that a grant is provided for permission to establish a communication session over the wireless network , per step .","However, if the received biometric data is determined to be invalid, in step , a negative acknowledge message (or equivalent) can be created to indicate a denial of the request (step ). This denial can occur, for example, if the mobile device  has been reported stolen, lost, etc.","Thereafter, depending on whether the biometric data is valid or not, the response (i.e., ACK or NACK message) is transmitted, as in step , to the mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["101","501","503","505"]},"According to one embodiment, the time duration for operating a state that supports non-native users can be enforced on the network end (as opposed to the user device side as shown in , whereby the operational mode monitor  is executed on the mobile device ). In the example of , it is assumed that mobile device authentication platform  performs the timing function to limit the duration of the operations for the non-native user. That is, after the expiration, the non-native user will not be permitted to utilize the wireless network service of network  any longer. Upon the expiration of this time, the non-native user may be prompted to re-authenticate, for example. In other words, the non-native user associated with mobile device  can be prompted to re-authenticate. In one embodiment, the user may be asked to undergoing the same authentication procedure with respect to the biometric, as to avoid the mobile device  being totally \u201copen\u201d to any and all users.","In step , according to one embodiment, the process determines that the user is non-native, and thus, initiates a timer to permit the non-native user restricted use of the communication service. At this point, the process can optionally determine whether the mobile device  has a packetized voice application (e.g., VoIP application) resident within the device  to permit establishment of a voice call over a data channel. If no application exists, the process can download the VoIP application to the mobile device . Hence, the non-native can talk using VoIP over a data channel, as in step . Furthermore, the process permits the mobile device to download device configuration information to enable this \u201cborrowed\u201d device to be configured with applications and settings to provide a look-and-feel that resembles this user's native device. Under this scenario, the user is assumed to be a subscriber of a wireless communication service (but associated with a different mobile device); it is this native device's configuration information that can be stored within the service provider network  for this purpose.","If, within step , the process determines that the user is a native user. Thus, the user can establish a communication session over the wireless network  according to the normal process. For example, a voice call can be established using a voice-channel, as compared to a data channel, as in step .","As mentioned, in certain embodiments, non-native users may utilize borrowed devices that can be reconfigured, on a temporary basis, according to device profiles of the non-native users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2A"],"b":["215","601","215","603","121","121","215"]},"Next, the emulator  can correlate the profiles; specifically, each of the features and\/or services is correlated based on a comparison of the profiles, as in step . For example, if the non-native user has a device profile that indicates a particular VoIP application\/provider, the emulator  would attempt to find the specific VoIP application\/provider or a comparable substitute. As another example, the device profile of the non-native user indicates certain call features, e.g., 3-way calling, video conferencing, etc.; such features would be invoked by the service provider network . The correlation can be performed for each feature and\/or service indicated in the device profile of the non-native user. In step , the correlated features and\/or services are temporarily activated on the non-native device. Furthermore, the non-native user may have data (e.g., music, applications, etc.) maintained within the network  of the service provider; this can be indicated in the device profile information so that this data is made available to the non-native user via the borrowed device.","It is contemplated that the above emulation activities can be performed after authentication of the non-native user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","100","700","701","703","705","707","700"]},"According to exemplary embodiments, user interface  may include one or more displays , keypads , microphones , and\/or speakers . Display  provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that permits a user of mobile device  to view dialed digits, call status, menu options, and other service information. The GUI may include icons and menus, as well as other text and symbols. Keypad  includes an alphanumeric keypad and may represent other input controls, such as one or more button controls, dials, joysticks, touch panels, etc. The user thus can construct user profiles, enter commands, initialize applications, input remote addresses, select options from menu systems, and the like. Microphone  coverts spoken utterances of a user (or other auditory sounds, e.g., environmental sounds) into electronic audio signals, whereas speaker  converts audio signals into audible sounds.","Communications circuitry  may include audio processing circuitry , controller , location module  (such as a GPS receiver) coupled to antenna , memory , messaging module , transceiver  coupled to antenna , and wireless controller  coupled to antenna . Memory  may represent a hierarchy of memory, which may include both random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM). Computer program instructions and corresponding data for operation can be stored in non-volatile memory, such as erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and\/or flash memory. Memory  may be implemented as one or more discrete devices, stacked devices, or integrated with controller . Memory  may store information, such as one or more user profiles, one or more user defined policies, one or more contact lists, personal information, sensitive information, work related information, etc.","Additionally, it is contemplated that mobile device  may also include one or more applications and, thereby, may store (via memory ) data associated with these applications for providing users with browsing functions, business functions, calendar functions, communication functions, contact managing functions, data editing (e.g., database, word processing, spreadsheets, etc.) functions, financial functions, gaming functions, imaging functions, messaging (e.g., electronic mail, IM, MMS, SMS, etc.) functions, multimedia functions, service functions, storage functions, synchronization functions, task managing functions, querying functions, and the like. As such, control signals received by mobile device  from, for example, platform  may be utilized by API(s)  and\/or controller  to facilitate remotely configuring, modifying, and\/or utilizing one or more features, options, settings, etc., of these applications.

In other instances, controller  may be controlled by API(s)  to cause location module  to determine spatial positioning information corresponding to a location of mobile device . Still further, controller  may be controlled by API(s)  to image (e.g., backup) and\/or erase memory , to configure (or reconfigure) functions of mobile device , to track and generate device usage logs, or to terminate services available to mobile device . It is noted that captured signals, device usage logs, memory images, spatial positioning information, and the like, may be transmitted to platforms  and\/or  via transceiver  and\/or wireless controller . In this manner, the captured signals and\/or other forms of information may be presented to users and stored to one or more networked storage locations, or any other suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) the components and facilities of system .","It is noted that real time spatial positioning information may be obtained or determined via location module  using, for instance, satellite positioning system technology, such as GPS technology. In this way, location module  can behave as (or substantially similar to) a GPS receiver. Thus, mobile device  employs location module  to communicate with constellation of satellites. These satellites transmit very low power interference and jamming resistant signals received by GPS receivers  via, for example, antennas . At any point on Earth, GPS receiver  can receive signals from multiple satellites, such as six to eleven. Specifically, GPS receiver  may determine three-dimensional geolocation (or spatial positioning information) from signals obtained from at least four satellites. Measurements from strategically positioned satellite tracking and monitoring stations are incorporated into orbital models for each satellite to compute precise orbital or clock data. Accordingly, GPS signals may be transmitted over two spread spectrum microwave carrier signals that can be shared by GPS satellites. Thus, if mobile device  is able to identify signals from at least four satellites, receivers  may decode the ephemeris and clock data, determine the pseudo range for each satellite and, thereby, compute the spatial positioning of a receiving antenna . With GPS technology, mobile device  can determine its spatial position with great accuracy and convenience. It is contemplated, however, that location module  may utilize one or more other location determination technologies, such as advanced forward link triangulation (AFLT), angle of arrival (AOA), assisted GPS (A-GPS), cell identification (cell ID), observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA), enhanced observed time of difference (E-OTD), enhanced forward link trilateration (EFLT), network multipath analysis, and the like.","Mobile device  also includes messaging module  that is configured to receive, transmit, and\/or process messages (e.g., EMS messages, SMS messages, MMS messages, IM messages, electronic mail messages, and\/or any other suitable message) received from (or transmitted to) platform  or any other suitable component or facility of system . As previously mentioned, platform  may transmit control singles to mobile device  in the form of one or more API  directed messages, e.g., one or more BREW directed SMS messages. As such, messaging module  may be configured to identify such messages, as well as activate API(s) , in response thereto. Furthermore, messaging module  may be further configured to parse control signals from these messages and, thereby, port parsed control signals to corresponding components of mobile device , such as API(s) , controller , location module , memory , transceiver , wireless controller , etc., for implementation.","According to exemplary embodiments, API(s)  (once activated) is configured to effectuate the implementation of the control signals received from platforms , . It is noted that the control signals are utilized by API(s)  to, for instance, remotely control, configure, monitor, track, and\/or capture signals from (or related to) biometric scanner , communications circuitry , and\/or user interface . In this manner, visual and\/or acoustic indicia pertaining to an environment surrounding mobile device  may captured by API(s)  controlling biometric scanner  and microphone . Other control signals to cause mobile device  to determine spatial positioning information, to image and\/or erase memory , to configure (or reconfigure) functions, to track and generate device usage logs, or to terminate services, may also be carried out via API(s) . As such, one or more signals captured from biometric scanner  or microphone , or device usage logs, memory images, spatial positioning information, etc., may be transmitted to platform  via transceiver  and\/or wireless controller , in response to corresponding control signals provided to transceiver  and\/or wireless controller  by API(s) . Thus, captured signals and\/or one or more other forms of information provided to platform  may be presented to users and\/or stored to repository , or any other suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) the components and facilities of system .","It is also noted that mobile device  can be equipped with wireless controller  to communicate with a wireless headset (not shown) or other wireless network. The headset can employ any number of standard radio technologies to communicate with wireless controller ; for example, the headset can be BLUETOOTH enabled. It is contemplated that other equivalent short range radio technology and protocols can be utilized. While mobile device  has been described in accordance with the depicted embodiment of , it is contemplated that mobile device  may embody many forms and include multiple and\/or alternative components.","The described processes and arrangements, according to certain embodiments, advantageously permit users to conveniently employ wireless devices that are not \u201ctied\u201d or registered to them, thereby enabling greater flexibility for users to utilized wireless communication services. Moreover, these service providers can continue to service users, even though users are not able to authenticate themselves using conventional techniques, such as a SIM card.","The processes for authenticating non-native users are described herein may be implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","801","803","801","800","805","801","803","805","803","800","807","801","803","809","801"]},"The computer system  may be coupled via the bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display, active matrix display, or plasma display, for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for adjusting cursor movement on the display .","According to an embodiment of the invention, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted in , multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to computer-readable storage medium ((or non-transitory)\u2014i.e., non-volatile media and volatile media), and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.","While certain exemplary embodiments and implementations have been described herein, other embodiments and modifications will be apparent from this description.
