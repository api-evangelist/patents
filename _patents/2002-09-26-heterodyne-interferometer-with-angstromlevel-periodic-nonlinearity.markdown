No. 60\/350,925, which was filed on Jan. 24, 2002. This patent application claims the Jan. 25, 2002 filing date of this provisional patent application.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the United States Government for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties.","The present invention is related to interferometry methods and devices thereof. The present invention is also related to distance measuring interferometers. The present invention is also related to acousto-optic modulators, optical fibers, and reflective mechanisms, such as retroreflectors and mirrors.","Periodic error in heterodyne displacement-measuring interferometry is well known in the art. Researchers have identified and modeled sources of non-linearity in traditional Michelson-type heterodyne interferometers. Additionally, experimental configurations are known which tend to minimize or eliminate the periodic error inherent in these systems. Although such techniques have been successfully implemented, they typically require complex mechanical and\/or electrical manipulations and are generally absent from commercial applications.","A fundamental source of systematic error in Michelson-type heterodyne interferometers is undesired leakage of each of the two polarization-coded light frequencies into both measurement and reference paths. In a perfect system, a single wavelength would travel to a fixed reference target, while a second, single wavelength should travel to a moving target. Interference of the combined signals would yield a perfectly sinusoidal trace with a phase that varied relative to a reference phase signal, in response to the motion of the moving target. The inherent frequency leakage of the two signals in actual implementations, however, tends to produce interference, or beat, signals, which are not exactly sinusoidal (i.e. contains spurious spectral content) and can lead to a periodic, or non-cumulative, error in measured displacements.","Experimental and analytical analyses of measurement signal frequency content have identified both first and second-harmonic periodic errors, or errors of one and two cycles per wavelength of optical path change, respectively. Physically, these errors arise from frequency leakage in the laser light source (non-orthogonality between the two frequencies exiting the laser head and ellipticity of the ideally linear output polarizations), non-ideal optical components (imperfect extinction between the two polarizations in the polarizing beamsplitter and retroreflector polarization rotation), mechanical misalignment of the interferometer (e.g. roll of the laser coordinate system with respect to the interferometer), parasitic reflections, and two-tone intermodulation distortions in the amplifying electronics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00008","num":"00008"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","1","100","106","108","102","110","1","110","106","110","110","102","110","102","104","110","108","112","106","1"],"sub":["1","2","2","2","1","d "]},"Because of the effect of leakage, each optical frequency may be present in both the reference and measurement paths of the interferometer. Detection of the interference signal during constant-velocity motion of the measurement retroreflector  exhibits multiple spectral peaks if this leakage exists. , for example, illustrates a graph  depicting a representation of the heterodyne interferometer frequency spectrum for low velocity target motion. The desired AC interference measurement signal  is seen at a frequency equal to the beat frequency (i.e. the difference between the two optical source frequencies, f) up or down-shifted, depending on target direction, by a scalar amount proportional to the velocity of the moving retroreflector (i.e. the Doppler shift, f).","With a proper alignment of the measurement beam and axis motion, the measurement signal amplitude can effectively remain constant during motion of the moving retroreflector. Also present, however, is spectral content that essentially remains at the beat frequency, known as spatial first-harmonic or AC reference terms , and a peak up or down-shifted from the beat frequency by an amount equal to, but opposite the measurement signal frequency shift, referred to as the second-harmonic or leakage-induced AC interference term .","Optical power terms  may also be observed at zero frequency and DC interference terms  at +fin fully leaking configurations, when each source frequency exists in both the measurement and reference paths. For low target velocities and the typical phase locked loop (PLL) modulation bandwidths associated with phase measuring electronics in commercially available systems, however, it is the AC reference and leakage-induced AC interference terms that generally dominate the periodic error magnitude. The attenuation of these error signals with respect to the measurement signal determines the peak-to-peak value of the resulting periodic error. Reported values have ranged from approximately 0.4 nm to 12 nm.","Based on the foregoing, the present inventors have concluded that a need exists for an improved interferometer, which is not plagued by the problems associated with prior art interferometer systems. In particular, the present inventors believe that a need exists for an improved displacement measuring interferometer (DMI), which does not rely on polarization coding and polarization-dependent optics to separate and recombine the reference and measurement frequencies of the heterodyne system. Therefore, a new concept for a heterodyne interferometer that minimizes periodic error, while maintaining a simple architecture, is described and illustrated herein.","The following summary of the invention is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the present invention, and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the invention can be gained by taking the entire specification, claims, drawings, and abstract as a whole.","It is therefore one aspect of the present invention to provide improved interferometry systems and methods.","It is another aspect of the present invention to provide an improved displacement measuring interferometer (DMI).","It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide an improved displacement measuring interferometer, which can be configured utilizing one or more acousto-optic modulators (AOM), optical fibers, and retroreflector devices.","It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide an improved displacement measuring interferometer, which does not rely on polarization coding and polarization-dependent optics to separate and recombine the reference and measurement frequencies of the heterodyne system.","The above and other aspects can be achieved as will now be summarized. In general, one or more acousto-optic modulators for receiving a laser light beam from a laser light source can be utilized to split the laser light beam into two or more laser light beams, each with a slightly different frequency, while spatially separating frequencies thereof. One or more retroreflectors can be utilized to reflect one or more of the laser light beams back to the acousto-optic modulator. Interference of two or more of the laser light beams at the acousto-optic modulator provides an interfered laser light beam thereof that carries the displacement information. A detector for receiving the interfered laser light beam can be utilized to provide interferometer displacement measurement data.","The present invention can include a laser light source for providing a first laser beam at an optical frequency f, and a mechanism for providing an acoustic signal having an acoustic frequency f. A first acousto-optic modulator can be utilized to receive the first laser beam at a Bragg angle \u03b8, and also to receive the acoustic signal. The acousto-optic modulator can provide two laser beams, the first of the two laser beams being a portion of the first laser beam transmitted directly through the acousto-optic modulator at the optical frequency f, and the second of the two laser beams having an optical frequency of the first laser beam shifted by the acoustic frequency (f+for f\u2212f), and exiting the acousto-optic modulator at twice the Bragg angle \u03b8with respect to direction of the first of the two laser beams.","Additionally, a reference retroreflector can be utilized to reflect the first of the two laser beams back to the acousto-optic modulator. Likewise, a measurement retroreflector can be utilized to reflect the second of the two laser beams back to the acousto-optic modulator. The first and second of the two reflected laser beams can interfere with each other in the acousto-optic modulator to provide an interfered laser beam. A detector can receive and detect the interfered laser beam for interferometer displacement measurement thereof. A second acousto-optic modulator can also be disposed in the path of the first laser beam to frequency shift any back-reflected light to isolate the back-reflected light from the laser source. A non-polarizing beam splitter can additionally be located between the first and second acousto-optic modulators to direct the light to the optical receiver.","The particular values and configurations discussed in these non-limiting examples can be varied and are cited merely to illustrate an embodiment of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","The present invention provides an improved displacement measuring interferometer (DMI), which does not rely on polarization coding and polarization-dependent optics to separate and recombine the reference and measurement frequencies of the heterodyne system. Instead, frequencies originate from an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and remain spatially separated in the interferometer. The original and frequency-shifted beams travel to reference and measurement retroreflectors, respectively, return parallel and collinear to the original path, then recombine in the AOM. No other optical components are required. Because the measurement and reference beams are separated and recombined in the AOM, it serves the function of the polarization beamsplitter in typical heterodyne interferometers without introducing the leakage-induced periodic errors described previously.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00034","num":"00034"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","304","308","306","302","310","314","310","304","310","318","310","308","318","306","304"],"sub":["0","1","0","acoustic","0 ","1 "]},"The phase information regarding measurement retroreflector displacement (i.e., in the measurement beam direction) is now carried on the interfered signal and travels to a suitable detector, such as, for example, detector . Beamsplitter  is generally configured as a non-polarizing beamsplitter, which directs the measurement signal (i.e., light beam ) to detector . It can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, however, that the use of such a beamsplitter is not a critical component to the operation of the device disclosed herein. Note that although retroreflectors, such as retroreflectors  and , are discussed herein with respect to preferred and\/or alternative embodiments of the present invention, those skilled in the art can appreciate that other types of reflective mechanisms, such as mirrors, can be utilized to in association with the present invention. For example, any reflective surface, such as a mirror, can be utilized to direct a light beam back to AOM .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00036","num":"00036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","404","404","406","400","406","4","408"],"sub":["0","0","1 ","2 "],"sup":"12 "},"At AOM , the frequency-shifted beam from the isolating AOM  can be diffracted into two components, which are depicted in  as light beams  and . Light beam  generally comprises a 0order component, while light beam  generally comprises a 1order component. The 0order component (i.e., frequency f+f) travels to a reference retroreflector  and the 1order component (i.e., frequency f+f+f) travels to a moving retroreflector . Because the angle between the two beams exiting the AOM  is generally small (e.g., <2 mrad), it may be necessary to allow the light to travel approximately 1.5 m before adequate spatial resolution is available to pick off the measurement beam and direct it toward measurement retroreflectors  and , which can be mounted on an air bearing slide.","Once the two beams travel individually to the reference retroreflector  and the measurement retroreflectors ,  and , they interfere during a return path through AOM . Because the beams are still oriented at a Bragg angle, they can each be frequency shifted. In system , the reference beam can be diffracted into two components: 0order unchanged and 1order down-shifted. Similarly, the measurement beam can be split into two components: 0order unchanged and 1order up-shifted. Therefore signals are generally available, each with a beat frequency of approximately two times the AOM interferometer driving frequency, or 2f=2.45.5 =91 MHz","One of the two available 91 MHz interference signals can be launched into a fiber-optic pick-up  and carried to a DC-1 GHz wide bandwidth receiver by a multi-mode fiber . Note that the interference of the f+f+fmeasurement and f+f\u2212fdown shifted reference signals can be arbitrarily selected for proof of concept. The receiver signal can then be input to, for example, a Model 8566B Hewlett-Packard spectrum analyzer with a bandwidth range of 100 Hz-22 GHz. The local spectral response can then be recorded as indicated respectively with respect to  herein, for two cases: 1) no motion of the measurement retroreflector, and 2) 0.128 msmeasurement retroreflector velocity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00040","num":"00040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["500","600","500","500","600"],"sup":"\u22121 "},"Content is also recognized at the original beat frequency suggesting a first-order periodic error. This signal, however, can be attenuated by 48.8 dB with respect to the original measurement signal and represents a non-cumulative error, \u03b4x, of only 0.18 nm (i.e., see equation (1) below, where FF is the interferometer fold factor). This error is attributed to multiple diffractions, or intermodulations due to reflected acoustic waves, within the AOM . Analyzing the spectrum of the beams exiting the AOM  can support this conclusion. Content shown in  was recorded at both 91 MHz and 131 MHz (2f=2.65.5=131 MHz), as well as multiples of these frequencies (i.e., 4f, 4f, etc). No appreciable second-order periodic error frequency content is seen. \n\n","The combined standard uncertainty, u, in this periodic error value may be determined according to the law of propagation of uncertainty, which is well known in the optical arts. As demonstrated in equation (2) below, the variance in a measured value, u, can be obtained by first calculating the partial derivatives of the functional relationship between the measured (\u03b4x) and input parameters (\u03bband dB) with respect to each input; then multiplying the partial derivatives by the standard uncertainty in the associated input (zero covariance between input quantities has been assumed); and, finally, summing the squares of each product. For standard uncertainties of 6\u00d710nm in wavelength (0.01 ppm) and 0.5 dB in amplitude, the combined standard uncertainty in the periodic error measurement result is 0.01 nm (0.1 \u212b). It can be appreciated by those skilled in the art that this value can reflect the uncertainty in the periodic error computed from the spectrum analyzer signal alone. Further signal corruption, which can be imposed by the phase-measuring electronics, for example, is generally highly system dependent. \n\n","A proof-of-concept carried out by the present inventors verified the possibility of using an AOM as a polarization-independent interferometer. An interference signal demonstrated 48.8 dB attenuation between the measurement signal and first-order periodic error on a bench-top setup with no external technique for reducing the system nonlinearity and a mechanical slide for motion generation (i.e., typical experimental setups use a vacuum cell, for example). The AOM DMI, however, did exhibit a first-order phase error, attributed to bi-directional acoustic interactions within the AOM, with a resulting periodic error of 0.18 nm (1.8 \u212b). Although this may not be a desired result, the AOM interferometer can present a 2 to 24 times decrease in the periodic error associated with commercial interferometers while maintaining a simple architecture.","There are several benefits associated with the application of the present invention, aside from the decreased periodic error. First, with respect to the required equipment, a single frequency laser light source is used rather than a more complex and expensive two-frequency laser head, fewer optical components are required, and only one photoreceiver per multiple axis system is necessary. The latter can be accomplished utilizing different AOM driving frequencies in each axis. Second, single mode fiber feed to each axis allows easy setup and alignment of a miniaturized package. Third, fiber launching of the light is generally simplified because polarization-maintaining fiber is not necessary for the polarization-independent interferometer. These benefits are depicted graphically in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00045","num":"00045"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","700","702","704","704","706","708","710","718","716","702","720","714","712","728","716","724","722","728","716"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00046","num":"00046"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","800","804","806","808","810","812","808","812","812","814","810","816","816","818","816"]},"The primary difficulty in implementing the AOM interferometer is adequate spatial separation of the measurement and reference beams given the small diffraction angle encountered in typical commercially available AOMs. Two techniques, which seek to overcome this difficulty, are depicted in .  depicts a block diagram illustrating an AOM DMI system , which can be implemented in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention.

A proof-of-concept for the acousto-optic modulator based displacement measuring interferometer (AOM DMI) was developed and successful experimental results presented, as indicated herein. Such results included the demonstration of a 0.18 nm periodic error in a bench-top setup.

Other linear displacement transducers with this level of accuracy typically have demonstrated substantially smaller measurement ranges. In the measurement of surface acoustic perturbations, or very small displacements at the surface of solids, caused by, for example, bulk sound waves or electronic excitation of the base material, optical methods have been applied but total displacements of only fractions of an angstrom were recorded.
