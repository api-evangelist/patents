The respective owners of such intellectual property have no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the disclosure by anyone as it appears in published Patent Office file\/records, but otherwise reserve all rights.","The present innovations generally address apparatuses, methods, and systems for electronic commerce, and more particularly, include DYNAMIC PAYMENT OPTIMIZATION APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS (\u201cDPO\u201d).","Consumers engaging in transactions typically select a product from a store shelf or website, and then check them out at a checkout counter or webpage. Product information is typically selected from a webpage catalog or entered into a point-of-sale terminal device. The consumer utilizes a payment option, such as cash, check, credit card, or debit card, to pay for the transaction. Once payment is made, the point-of-sale terminal device memorializes the transaction in the merchant's computer system, and a receipt is generated indicating satisfactory consummation of the transaction.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed. As such, a detailed discussion of reference number  would be found and\/or introduced in . Reference number  is introduced in , etc.","The DYNAMIC PAYMENT OPTIMIZATION APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS (hereinafter \u201cDPO\u201d) transform requests for on-demand and flexible monetization and related services, via DPO components, into currency transfers, purchase receipt notifications, social networking communications and transaction analytics reports.","Business-to-consumer (B2C) companies may build their customer billing operations through a mix of in-house software development, third-party payment processor integrations and various third-party software products for subscription, fraud management and commerce systems depending on the business models they adopt. As the cost for customer acquisition and retention increases, more and more sophisticated monetization models may be required to drive higher conversion rates and Average Revenue Per User (ARPUs) from paying users.","In some embodiments, the DPO implements a flexible monetization platform based on a completely new way of thinking about how to monetize different types of users at various price points and at different life cycle stages of customers' engagement with the content offered. It calls for a 360-degree view of a customer who is looking to access and consume content across devices, platforms and networks. For example, when a lot of AAA content is available for free, merely setting a $14.99 monthly subscription price point and up-sell buckets may limit revenue generation capabilities. Consumers may want to pay at their own pace and at the price point they can afford. Thus, in some embodiments, the DPO enables a disruptive business model of microtransactions, which unlocks a massive consumer base that could become paying customers. Moreover the operational costs, and overheads with operating customer billing operations inhouse, or through a mix of in-house and third party solutions may become unnecessarily expensive for the B2C companies since their payment volumes do not justify the investment needed. Furthermore, billing teams may not be able to keep up with the need for updates, improvements, or inclusion of new technologies or new payment methods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","102","102","112","113","114"],"i":"b"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","202","203","204","205"]},"In some embodiments, a service provided by the DPO may include, e.g., , the ability to select from a plurality of payment service providers (PSP) for routing the transaction, but from the same user interface, see e.g., . In some embodiments, the DPO may offer a large variety of payment methods to users, and determine what methods to offer to what segment of the user base in specific countries to maximize conversion. In some embodiments, the DPO may manage a vast amount of technical integrations with PSPs, but obfuscate the differences by presenting the merchant with a single integration. Each PSP may have its own interfaces and APIs and so the complexity in providing a unified customer experience may be large. In some embodiments, the DPO may handle this complexity to present a unified consistent experience to consumers making purchasing transactions. This unified integration may take the form of either API integration in some embodiments, or the use of widgets or front end pages that manage the payments on behalf of the merchant in other embodiments. In order to create the single integration touch point for the merchant, in some embodiments, the DPO may have a translation module that repurposes all the various integration, settlement, and use of third party PSPs into a common infrastructure. Because of this unified User Interface and unified integration APIs, the the DPO may allow the continued addition or updating of payment customers without requiring that the merchants make updates or changes to their integration or billing systems.","In some embodiments, a service provided by the DPO may include, e.g., , risk management services for the user and\/or merchant, including fraud detection and prevention, identity theft, and\/or the like. For example, the DPO may manage risk by using a comprehensive fraud engine to monitor and prevent and minimize the number of fraudulent transactions that occur. The Fraud Engine may gather information from multiple sources such as third party fraud services such as negative file databases, AVS matching services, device fingerprinting services and\/or the like. The Fraud Engine may combine these various data points as well as analyzes historical data to create heuristics and rules to prevent fraudulent transactions from occurring. The DPO, in some embodiments, may also provide a number of on-demand reports that help merchants gain insight into the incidence of fraud on their site and tune and configure their detection rules to better prevent fraud while maintaining a positive customer experience.","In some embodiments, a service provided by the DPO may include, e.g., , micro-payment and subscription services. In some embodiments, the DPO may include an electronic wallet that maintains stored value balances for user accounts either in the form of real world balances or virtual currency balances. These balances may be broken down and tracked according to the method of payment made to create the balance such that the merchants can gain visibility into the actual cost basis for any user's balance. The DPO may further include subscription, and recurring billing engines and related features such as automatic entitlement delivery, overdue bill collection and event notifications. As another example, the DPO may include tracking of account balances, spend tracking, billing and\/or product subscriptions, product offers and\/or recommendations, event notifications, and\/or the like.","In some embodiments, a service provided by the DPO may include in-app optimization, e.g., . In order to collect payments, the front end user experience around the presentation of purchasing options may be optimized by the DPO for the individual user in order to maximize the likelihood of a user completing a transaction. One such method that may be used by the DPO in some embodiments is lightbox (pop-up) front end UI that is embedded on the merchants site through the use of for example, javascript. Users who click the Buy button may experience a pop-up window that is seamlessly integrated into the merchant site, with a look and feel that is customized to the merchant site. This lightbox experience may allow the user to stay within the payment window experience and the transaction may be completed within this same experience and not require that the user be redirected to an alternate website to transact a payment. In some embodiments, the Lightbox may have a dynamic user interface that reorders the payment methods in the order that is most likely to have a user complete a transaction based on the users demographic information as well as historic data around users purchasing activity and payment method preferences. For example, users in country A may see payment option X and Y listed first, because those methods convert highly in country A, whereas a user in Country B may see payment options Z listed first because that method converts highly in country B. In general, the DPO may provide features to modify the front-end user experience of a user purchasing a product to maximize the likelihood of the user completing the purchase and\/or returning to the merchant's site for additional purchases. For example, the DPO may allow for configuration of the user interface according to the user's demographics, behavior, location, language, payment preferences (either specific to the user, or generally for the user's demographic), and\/or the like.","In some embodiments, the DPO may provide storefronts and\/or marketplaces for users to browse products for purchase. Before a user can make a payment, they need to see which items they desire to purchase. The DPO may include a presentation layer and front end user interface in the form of a storefronts (app stores\/marketplace) where items are presented to users. The DPO may further provide the necessary backend infrastructure to enable storefronts to function such as inventory management modules, catalog and offer management modules, merchandizing modules, coupon code and discount promotion modules, inclusion of virtual currency wallet across games, one-click purchases, recommendation engine, search engine. In general, DPO may provide back-end services for the merchants, including inventory management, product search, advertisement placement, offer managements, consumer purchase incentives such as rewards or discounts, and\/or the like.","In some embodiments, the DPO may provide analytics for the merchant based on card transaction data obtained from users purchasing products from the merchant, e.g., . In some embodiments, the DPO may also allow developers to develop third-party apps that may be provided by the DPO to merchants via an application service store for the merchants. For example, the DPO may provide a Developer Console that gives clients the information they need in a unified fashion for all aspects of the MaaS stack. Reports and data include products, pricing or revenue by payment method and\/or country, spending patterns, free-to-paid conversion and ARPU metrics.","In some embodiments, the DPO may provide customer support services, such as on-demand live video\/text chat, and\/or the like services, for the users, e.g., . For example, in some embodiments, the DPO may facilitate a Developer Console that provides role based permissions to allow users of different levels to access different parts of the platform. One such level may be a customer support representative who can gain access to user transaction data to assist them with any issues, but would not gain access to other information such as revenue reports. The customer support tools may include ability for CS reps to issue refunds, look up pending transactions as well as whitelist or black list users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-E","FIG. 3A"],"b":["311","300","316","312","314"]},"In some embodiments, the app may be configured to automatically detect, e.g., , the presence of a product identifier within an image or video frame grabbed by the device (e.g., via a webcam, in-built camera, etc.). For example, the app may provide a \u201chands-free\u201d mode of operation wherein the user may move the device to bring product identifiers within the field of view of the image\/video capture mechanism of the device, and the app may perform image\/video processing operations to automatically detect the product identifier within the field of view. In some embodiments, the app may overlay cross-hairs, target box, and\/or like alignment reference markers, e.g., , so that a user may align the product identifier using the reference markers to facilitate product identifier recognition and interpretation.","In some embodiments, the detection of a product identifier may trigger various operations to provide products, services, information, etc. for the user. For example, the app may be configured to detect and capture a QR code having embedded merchant and\/or product information, and utilize the information extracted from the QR code to process a transaction for purchasing a product from a merchant. As other examples, the app may be configured to provide information on related products, quotes, pricing information, related offers, (other) merchants related to the product identifier, rewards\/loyalty points associated with purchasing the product related to the product identifier, analytics on purchasing behavior, alerts on spend tracking, and\/or the like.","In some embodiments, the app may include user interface elements to allow the user to manually search, e.g., , for products (e.g., by name, brand, identifier, etc.). In some embodiments, the app may provide the user with the ability to view prior product identifier captures (see, e.g., ) so that the user may be able to better decide which product identifier the user desires to capture. In some embodiments, the app may include interface elements to allow the user to switch back and forth between the product identification mode and product offer interface display screens (see, e.g., ), so that a user may accurately study deals available to the user before capturing a product identifier. In some embodiments, the user may be provided with information about products, user settings, merchants, offers, etc. in list form (see, e.g., ) so that the user may better understand the user's purchasing options. Various other features may be provided for in the app (see, e.g., ). In some embodiments, the user may desire to cancel product purchasing; the app may provide the user with a user interface element (e.g., ) to cancel the product identifier recognition procedure and return to the prior interface screen the user was utilizing.","With reference to , in some embodiments, the app may include an indication of the location (e.g., name of the merchant store, geographical location, information about the aisle within the merchant store, etc.) of the user, e.g., . The app may provide an indication of a pay amount due for the purchase of the product, e.g., . In some embodiments, the app may provide various options for the user to pay the amount for purchasing the product(s). For example, the app may utilize GPS coordinates associated with the device to determine the merchant store within which the user is present, and direct the user to a website of the merchant. In some embodiments, the app may be configured to make an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) call to participating merchants to directly facilitate transaction processing for purchases. In some embodiments, a merchant-branded app may be developed with an in-app purchasing mode, which may directly connect the user into the merchant's transaction processing system. For example, the user may choose from a number of cards (e.g., credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, etc.) from various card providers, e.g., . In some embodiments, the app may provide the user the option to pay the purchase amount using funds included in a bank account of the user, e.g., a checking, savings, money market, current account, etc., e.g., . In some embodiments, the user may have set default options for which card, bank account, etc. to use for the purchase transactions via the app. In some embodiments, such setting of default options may allow the user to initiate the purchase transaction via a single click, tap, swipe, and\/or other remedial user input action, e.g., . In some embodiments, when the user utilizes such an option, the app may utilize the default settings of the user to initiate the purchase transaction. In some embodiments, the app may allow the user to utilize other accounts (e.g., Google\u2122 Checkout, Paypal\u2122 account, etc.) to pay for the purchase transaction, e.g., . In some embodiments, the app may allow the user to utilize rewards points, airline miles, hotel points, electronic coupons, printed coupons (e.g., by capturing the printed coupons similar to the product identifier) etc., to pay for the purchase transaction, e.g., . In some embodiments, the app may provide an option to provide express authorization before initiating the purchase transaction, e.g., . In some embodiments, the app may provide a progress indicator provide indication on the progress of the transaction after the user has selected an option to initiate the purchase transaction, e.g., . In some embodiments, the app may provide the user with historical information on the user's prior purchases via the app, e.g., . In some embodiments, the app may provide the user with an option to share information about the purchase (e.g., via email, SMS, wall posting on Facebook\u00ae, tweet on Twitter', etc.) with other users and\/or control information shared with the merchant, acquirer, payment network etc., to process the purchase transaction, e.g., . In some embodiments, the app may provide the user an option to display the product identification information captured by the client device (e.g., in order to show a customer service representative at the exit of a store the product information), e.g., . In some embodiments, the user, app, device and or purchase processing system may encounter an error in the processing. In such scenarios, the user may be able to chat with a customer service representative (e.g., VerifyChat ) to resolve the difficulties in the purchase transaction procedure.","In some embodiments, the user may select to conduct the transaction using a one-time anonymized credit card number, see e.g., . For example, the app may utilize a pre-designated anonymized set of card details (see, e.g., \u201cAnonCard1,\u201d \u201cAnonCard2\u201d). As another example, the app may generate, e.g., in real-time, a one-time anonymous set of card details to securely complete the purchase transaction (e.g., \u201cAnon It 1X\u201d). In such embodiments, the app may automatically set the user profile settings such that the any personal identifying information of the user will not be provided to the merchant and\/or other entities. In some embodiments, the user may be required to enter a user name and password to enable the anonymization features.","With reference to , in some embodiments, the user interface elements of the app may be advantageously arranged to provide the user the ability to process a purchase with customized payment parameters with a minimum number of user inputs applied to the user's device. For example, if the user has a QR pay code, e.g., , within the viewing angle of a camera included in the user's mobile device, the user may activate a user interface element to snap the QR code. In some embodiments, the user may control the field of view of the camera using a user interface zoom element, e.g., . In some embodiments, the user interface may be designed such that the user may touch an image of a QR code displayed on the screen to capture the QR code (see e.g., ). For example, the position of the user's touch may be utilized as an input by an image processing module executing on the user's device to process the displayed video frame (and\/or adjacent video frames), and extract the QR code from the frame(s) based on the user's input. For example, the user's touch may provide an approximate center point of the QR code. Using this information, the image processing module may be able to better perform an automated QR code image recognition, and accordingly capture the correct QR code (e.g., if portions of many QR codes are displayed within the video frame(s)) selected by the user for capture and processing.","In some embodiments, the app may utilize predetermined default settings for a particular merchant, e.g., , to process the purchase based on the QR code (e.g., in response to the user touching an image of a QR code displayed on the screen of the user device). However, if the user wishes to customize the payment parameters, the user may activate a user interface element  (or e.g., press and continue to hold the image of the QR code ). Upon doing so, the app may provide a pop-up menu, e.g., , providing a variety of payment customization choices, such as those described with reference to . The user may, e.g., drag the user's finger to the appropriate settings the user prefers, and release the user's finger from the touchscreen of the user's mobile device to select the setting for payment processing. In alternate embodiments, the payment settings options, e.g., , and QR capture activation button, e.g.,  may be included in the user interface along with a window for capturing the QR code via the mobile device's camera. In alternate embodiments, the user's mobile device may generate a hybrid QR code-payment settings graphic, and the POS terminal (or user's trusted computing device) may capture the entire graphic for payment processing. In some embodiments, the app may provide a user interface element  for the user to minimize the payment options settings user interface elements. In some embodiments, the app may provide additional user interface elements, e.g., , to display previous purchases, data shared about those purchases, purchase receipts (e.g., via barcodes) and customer support options (e.g., VerifyChat).","With reference to , in some embodiments, the user may be able to view and\/or modify the user profile and\/or settings of the user, e.g., by activating user interface element  (of ). For example, the user may be able to view\/modify a user name (e.g., -), account number (e.g., -), user security access code (e.g., -), user pin (e.g., -), user address (e.g., -), social security number associated with the user (e.g., -), current device GPS location (e.g., -), user account of the merchant in whose store the user currently is (e.g., -), the user's rewards accounts (e.g., -), and\/or the like. In some embodiments, the user may be able to select which of the data fields and their associated values should be transmitted to facilitate the purchase transaction, thus providing enhanced data security for the user. For example, in the example illustration in , the user has selected the name , account number , security code , merchant account ID and rewards account ID as the fields to be sent as part of the notification to process the purchase transaction. In some embodiments, the user may toggle the fields and\/or data values that are sent as part of the notification to process the purchase transactions. In some embodiments, the app may provide multiple screens of data fields and\/or associated values stored for the user to select as part of the purchase order transmission. In some embodiments, the app may obtain the GPS location of the user. Based on the GPS location of the user, the app may determine the context of the user (e.g., whether the user is in a store, doctor's office, hospital, postal service office, etc.). Based on the context, the app may present the appropriate fields to the user, from which the user may select fields and\/or field values to send as part of the purchase order transmission.","For example, a user may go to doctor's office and desire to pay the co-pay for a doctor's appointment. In addition to basic transactional information such as account number and name, the app may provide the user the ability to select to transfer medical records, health information, which may be provided to the medical provider, insurance company, as well as the transaction processor to reconcile payments between the parties. In some embodiments, the records may be sent in a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant data format and encrypted, and only the recipients who are authorized to view such records may have appropriate decryption keys to decrypt and view the private user information.","With reference to , in some embodiments, the app executing on the user's device may provide a \u201cVerifyChat\u201d feature for fraud prevention (e.g., by activating UI element in ). For example, the DPO may detect an unusual and\/or suspicious transaction. The DPO may utilize the VerifyChat feature to communicate with the user, and verify the authenticity of the originator of the purchase transaction. In various embodiments, the DPO may send electronic mail message, text (SMS) messages, Facebook\u00ae messages, Twitter\u2122 tweets, text chat, voice chat, video chat (e.g., Apple FaceTime), and\/or the like to communicate with the user. For example, the DPO may initiate a video challenge for the user, e.g., . For example, the user may need to present him\/her-self via a video chat, e.g., . In some embodiments, a customer service representative, e.g., agent , may manually determine the authenticity of the user using the video of the user. In some embodiments, the DPO may utilize face, biometric and\/or like recognition (e.g., using pattern classification techniques) to determine the identity of the user, e.g., . In some embodiments, the app may provide reference marker (e.g., cross-hairs, target box, etc.), e.g., , so that the user may the video to facilitate the DPO's automated recognition of the user. In some embodiments, the user may not have initiated the transaction, e.g., the transaction is fraudulent. In such embodiments, the user may cancel, e.g., , the challenge. The DPO may then cancel the transaction, and\/or initiate fraud investigation procedures on behalf of the user. In some embodiments, the app may provide additional user interface elements, e.g., to display previous session , and provide additional customer support options (e.g., VerifyChat ).","In some embodiments, the DPO may utilize a text challenge procedure to verify the authenticity of the user, e.g., . For example, the DPO may communicate with the user via text chat, SMS messages, electronic mail, Facebook\u00ae messages, Twitter' tweets, and\/or the like. The DPO may pose a challenge question, e.g., , for the user. The app may provide a user input interface element(s) (e.g., virtual keyboard ) to answer the challenge question posed by the DPO. In some embodiments, the challenge question may randomly selected by the DPO automatically; in some embodiments, a customer service representative may manually communicate with the user. In some embodiments, the user may not have initiated the transaction, e.g., the transaction is fraudulent. In such embodiments, the user may cancel, e.g., , the text challenge. The DPO may then cancel the transaction, and\/or initiate fraud investigation procedures on behalf of the user. In some embodiments, the app may provide additional user interface elements, e.g., to display previous session , and provide additional customer support options (e.g., VerifyChat ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-E","FIG. 4A"],"b":["410","412","411","413","413","414"]},"With reference to , in some embodiments, after the user has confirmed payment, the light box  may display a confirmation page. In some embodiments, the confirmation page may provide a summary  of the transaction. For example, the payment option selected, the item purchased and the amount that was charged may be displayed to provide confirmation to the user that the purchase is complete. Other information such as more information on the UltimatePay  may also be provided on the same confirmation page view. In the confirmation page view, a continue button  may also be provided to allow the user to return back to the page where he or she was previously on. In this way, the light box  may provide an integrated way to conduct a transaction using a variety of payment options from anywhere on a website and allow the user to return back to his or activity seamlessly.","With reference to , in some embodiments, the PAYPAL option may be selected by the user from the variety of payment options  available to conduct a transaction. When the PAYPAL option is selected, a user interface  customized for PAYPAL may be displayed to the user. The amount due may be pre-populated and a \u201ccheck out with PALPAL\u201d button  may be provided. Once the user clicks on the button , a customized interface , as shown in , may be provided within the light box showing payment information for user confirmation. The interface  may display purchase information  including description of the item(s) to be purchased, payment amount, payment method (e.g., PALPAL balance), payment currency, applicable discounts, and\/or the like. The interface  may also include shipping and contact information . Once the user reviews the displayed information and makes any necessary changes, the user may confirm payment with the \u201cpay now\u201d button . This may conclude the transaction and a message  may be displayed informing the user that the user will be returned to the web page he or she was previously on before initiating the transaction (e.g., the PlaySpan marketplace). The user may also have the option to manually close the window and return to the previous web page.","With reference to , in some embodiments, facilities may be provided by customizing the payment light box with different skins, payment options, logos, advertisement, and\/or the like as shown by light boxes  and . Such customizations may provide the appearance of a payment system that is seamlessly integrated with the merchant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-C"},"The presentation of the payment options can be displayed to the user on a merchant in a number of ways. In some embodiments, when a merchant wishes to present a user with a payment option, the merchant may send a query or API call to the payment provider that contains certain user demographic information such as age, location, item to be purchased, social networking ID or many others. The payment processing system may then compute, based on its algorithms and historic data, which payment methods are most likely to be the ones that will have the user complete a transaction. In one embodiment, the DPO may generate an API list that the merchant receives for the recommended order list of payment method to display to users. This API can further include graphics such as payment logos, or know payment methods of a user such as for example a Visa Credit card ending with the last 4 digits of ABCD. In another embodiment, the merchant may integrate a payment widget, lightbox, web-redirect or iframe to allow the payment processor to directly optimize the VI and front end user experience of the display of the methods. This could be through a simple list, or through a tabbed based approach. In the tab based approach the tabs selected and the methods that are shown by default may dynamically change based on the users demographic information. In some embodiments, the DPO can further optimize the purchasing experience by adjusting language, price points, currencies, merchandizing (such as promotions or display ads) or the user interface and look and feel of the payment experience for the user. In general, the DPO may tailor the purchasing experience dynamically for each individual user and can optimize and adjust a variety of parameters such as those listed above in order to create an experience that is most likely to have a user complete a transaction.","The DPO can also favor particular payment methods if the merchant desires them to be given prominent placement if there are economic reasons or strategic preferences for favoring particular methods. One method that might be favored is an existing account balance of stored currency that the user already has. By presenting the stored currency as a payment option ahead of other payment options, users can complete the transaction with a simple one click and the merchant can then recognize the revenues from the utilization of the stored balance.","In some embodiments, as shown in , facilities may be provided for customizing payment options according to geography (e.g., continent, country, region, etc.) , language and\/or the like. For example, the country Germany may be pre-selected or chosen by a user. Based on the selected country, payment options, language and currency information may be automatically updated to cater to the users of the selected country. For example, in the case of Germany, language may be German or any of the world's most spoken languages . Similarly, payment options may be updated to show most popular payment methods in Germany or the highest converting payment methods  in Germany. In a further implementation, the interface may also be updated to display localized currencies and price points .","With reference to , an exemplary payment interface customized for the selected country Japan  is provided. While credit and\/or debit card options such as VISA and AMERICAN EXPRESS and PAYPAL may be acceptable forms of payment in Japan or accepted by merchants, other country-specific payment choices  may also be provided under \u201cmore choices\u201d tab  in the payment interface. The user may then select any of the provided choices for completing the transaction.","With reference to , in some embodiments, payment options and ordering in mobile application interfaces may also be customized based on geography. When the United States is selected as the country , the amount due may be displayed in the currency of the United States. Various payment options in the mobile application may displayed in an arrangement customized for (or in some instances by the user) in the region on the mobile application interface. When the country selection is changed to Germany from the United States, the amount due may displayed in local or popular currency. Similarly, various payment options and orderings may be modified as shown in the region of the mobile application interface. In some embodiments, the highest converting payment methods may be provided. In another implementation, the user may configure the settings for a country and may save it for future use.","With reference to , in some embodiments, various currency configurations may also be available in mobile interfaces of the payment system. For example, a user may use Visa to pay for an amount due in United States currency. In a further implementation, the user may also have the option to pay for the amount (or a portion thereof) using rewards points . The corresponding amount due may be displayed in currency points at ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A-D"},"In some embodiments, the DPO may enable users to view their payments from users on a country-by-country basis, understanding market share for countries, e.g. US is 10% and Canada is 3%, total users, total payments and average payment size. These analytics and insights may give merchants clues that they need to increase revenue streams in their commerce activities. Additionally this data may be provided graphically showing a global heat map with countries having more payments with a darker color and payments with few payments with a lighter color (or no color for no payments). The levels, color contrast and granularity of the map can be configured and may provide merchants with simple and quick ways to visualize the effectiveness of their commerce activities across geographic regions.","In some embodiments, the geographies shown are country maps and the levels of payments are segmented into five spectrums based on an exponential scale such that each darker color level represents twice the payment volume than the next level. In some embodiments, the map may be divided into states, cities or districs and the color gradient can be a linear spectrum from light to dark and normalized to from the lowest paying location to the highest paying location, The graphical display may be populated, in one example, as follows: Each order and payment transaction may be tagged with an IP address and country stamp. Geopayments reports then created by the payment network by filtering all transactions for a given merchant, then aggregated by country, and counting the sum of users and transactions and calculating the country market share and average payment size. Graphic charts may be created by taking a map of the globe, aggregating payment volume and coloring different countries based on the market share of payments in that specific country.","Various analytics facilities may be available for merchants having the payment application integrated with their websites. An example merchant analytics dashboard , as shown in , may include various options for generating graphical and other representations  of analytics such as geographic transaction volume. Example options available for configuration include, without limitation, type of data  (e.g., users and transactions), service codes  (e.g., UT01-PBC Test Merchant), date range  (e.g., Sep. 20, 2010 to Oct. 20, 2010), frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), and\/or the like to observe trends for users and transactions over time. The graphical display area  may further display the trends for transactions  and users  in graphical charts such as trend line and bar chart among others. The merchant may also change any of the parameters on the dashboard  on the fly, and click on update button  to generate a graphics for the updated parameters. In a further implementation, email , download or export facilities may also be available for the merchant to download raw or processed data in EXCEL, text, WORD, .CSV and other formats, as well as graphics in various graphic formats such as .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg\/, .png, .gif, .PDF, and\/or the like.","With reference to , in some embodiments, the merchant may reconfigure his or her dashboard to select other data types such as revenue by payment method . The merchant may also select another service code , data range  and frequency . When the merchant clicks on the update button , updated graphical charts may be displayed on the graphical display area . For example, for the revenue for payment method data , a pie chart  may be displayed showing a percentage breakdown of revenue for each payment method. Further a line chart  may also be displayed showing the daily revenue amount (y-axis) for each payment method over a period of time (x-axis) defined by the date range . As in , raw and\/or processed data and graphics may be available for email , export or download.","With reference to , in some embodiments, a merchant may select revenue by country  data analysis. The merchant may also specify service codes , date range  and frequency . Once the update button  is clicked, the graphical display area may display various graphical charts and maps showing revenue breakdown by country. For example, the heat map  may identify, using color or other indicators, each country which produced a revenue in the range of 0-5%, 5-10%, 10-25%, 25-50% and higher than 50% during the defined time period. Other percentage ranges for revenue breakdown are contemplated and are within the scope of the payment system analytics. As another example, the graphical chart  may show the revenue amount (y-axis) over a period of time (x-axis) for each revenue producing country.","With reference to , in some embodiments, various dashboard , analytics , customer service , manage systems  and mobile apps  facilities may be integrated together in a single console. The merchant (or service user in general) may log in and select any one of the tabs - to obtain analytics and information and manage various services, systems and mobile applications. For example, when the dashboard tab is selected, an overview of various analyses, data and charts may be provided. For example, sub-windows such as geopayments , revenue , conversion  and summary  may be displayed. The summary table , as shown, may include various columns of data such as date , revenue , users , transactions , average spending per user , average amount per transaction , conversion rate , and\/or the like. In one implementation, the summary table may include data for a predefined time period (e.g., current month, current week). The data from the summary table may then be displayed using graphical charts in sub-windows such as the geopayments sub-window , revenue  sub-window and conversion sub-window . The geopayments sub-window  may display geographical heat maps of revenue described in . The revenue window  may display a column chart of revenue amount (y-axis) plotted against date (x-axis). Similarly, the conversion sub-window  may display a column chart that shows revenue on the left y-axis and conversion rate on the right y-axis plotted again date on the x-axis. In addition to the heat maps and column charts described above, other types of graphical display techniques may be used. In a further implementation, the \u201cview reports\u201d option on any of the sub-windows may be selected for further data analysis and\/or reconfiguration of one or more parameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 7A-C"},"With reference to , in some embodiments, a user, e.g., , may desire to browse through a product catalog of a merchant managed by the DPO.

For example, let's say that a game wants to see virtual currency for a ratio of $1 to 100. The DPO may automatically calculate virtual currency amounts, so that if you enter a payment for $5, then 500 points is automatically created.","In some embodiments, the DPO may manage Discreet Pricing. For example, let's say that a game wants to give away more coins for money invested. Discreet pricing allows game developers to enter discreet point packages for different prices points. For example, the user might get 500 coins for $5, but 1,100 coins for $10 (a 100 coin bonus).","In some embodiments, the DPO may utilize Smart Pricing. For example, let's say that a game sets a ratio of $1=1,000 coins. However, the user is in Germany and prefers to pay in Euros. Instead of just doing a simple conversion and showing 1 EUR=793 Coins, Game Developers can round either up or down, from 1-3 significant digits. This means that the user might see 800 coins (rounded up to two significant digits) which is a much better number than 793 (from a consumer marketing perspective). In some embodiments, a setting for each country, merchant, and\/or product may specify the number of threshold digits that may be rounded. For example, in the US, aggregate analysis of consumer behavior may show that two-digit rounding to enhance and increase transaction throughput for 4-digit point levels. For example, if a strict conversion ratio for $10 would 1237 virtual coins, having a two-digit rounding for the 4-digit value may result in an amount of 1250 coins, with \u201c50\u201d being the last two digits allowed for threshold rounding.","In some embodiments, the DPO may adapt virtual currencies according to the costs of the payment method employed by the user. As one example, the DPO may manage a high cost payment method such as Mobile Pricing. For example, let's say that a game sets a ratio of $1=1,000 coins for standard payments, e.g. credit card or PayPal. What if the user wants to pay in mobile? Mobile payments tend to charge 50% or more. The game developer can specify different ratios for different payment methods or different payment cost types. In this example, the game developer might want to give the user $1=750 coins (25% less coins) to help cover the economic costs of the mobile payment. As another example, the game developer may utilize different discrete mobile price points across multiple carriers, and set ratios (or discrete points) so that the DPO can automatically calculate a discrete number of price points per carrier for each country and show the appropriate pricing to the user. In general, it is contemplated that a DPO may facilitate dividing up the available price points to maximize the range of payment options provided to the user, and then provide a set number of payment choices, and calculating the applicable virtual currency to display.","In some embodiments, the DPO may accommodate the above mentioned virtual currency use cases as follows: Virtual Currencies may be created by the game developer on a Developer Console. Virtual currencies may be configured with names, like \u201cCoins\u201d and virtual currency codes, which reference the virtual currency during API calls. Once a virtual currency has been created, the game developer may create pricing rules for the virtual currency.","In some embodiments, once a base set of rules is created\u2014the virtual currency is ready for use. The game developer may sell the virtual currency on their service, and when the user clicks on \u201cbuy\u201d; then the game developer may also pass a virtual currency code, to let the DPO know that the purchase is for a virtual currency configured in the DPO. The payment interface on the game developer's site may then allow the user to make the payment. The interface may show price packages in drop downs and buttons according to the rules set up in the developer console. When the payment is complete, the DPO may send a postback communication to the game developer that the payment is complete. As part of the payment complete notification, the DPO may also pass the virtual currency code (so the game developer knows to credit the user with virtual currency), as well as the amount of virtual currency to credit. For security both the virtual currency code and the virtual currency amount may be MD5 hashed, so that users can't tamper with or grant themselves extra virtual currency.","With reference to , in some embodiments, an entity and\/or component of the DPO may obtain a trigger for virtual currency configuration (e.g., MaaS server in ), e.g., . As an example, the DPO may obtain the trigger when a user requires on-demand modification of payment options in a UI (see e.g., ). The DPO may obtain data on the product being purchased for which virtual currency configuration is sought, e.g., . The DPO may identify a set of currencies using which the user desires to pay for the product purchase, e.g., . For example, if the user desires to pay 40% of the purchase price using rewards points, and 60% using Japanese yen, then the DPO may identify the specific type of rewards points and Japanese yen as the set of currencies to convert the purchase price into, from the present currency(ies) in which the pricing information is available. Based on identifying the set of currencies, the DPO may decompose the purchase price according to the share of identified currencies, e.g., . For example, if the purchase price is $10, for the example set of currencies above, the DPO may decompose the purchase prices into $4 for payment through rewards points, and $6 for payment through Japanese yen.","In some embodiments, the DPO may determine currency exchange rates for the virtual currency configuration based on one or more factors, which may include, but not be limited to: user device platform (e.g., mobile device, online game, eCommerce site, shopping in physical store, etc.), user payment method (e.g., debit, credit, etc.), and\/or the like. For example, the DPO may determine the user's platform using communications forwarded to it from the PoS client where the user is engaged in the purchase transaction, e.g., . The DPO may also determine the user payment method being utilized for payment, e.g., using user payment selections made by the user at the PoS client being utilized for the purchase transactions, e.g., . The DPO may determine a currency conversion exchange rate for each of the set of currencies identified as being implicated in the virtual currency configuration. For example, the DPO may select a currency from the identified set of currencies for conversion, e.g., . The DPO may query a database for a conversion algorithm to utilize for the conversion, based on the user platform, payment method, selected currency, and\/or the like. For example the DPO may query a database using PHP\/SQL commands similar to the example described previously to obtain the conversion algorithm to utilize. Several examples of conversion algorithms are described below. The DPO may utilize any single algorithm, or combinations of the algorithms in any sequence and to any portion of the conversion of the set of currencies, to convert the price from one currency to another","For example, one algorithm, a constant ratio algorithm, may assign a constant exchange rate, regardless of the total value of the purchase price. A discreet pricing algorithm may assign a variable exchange rate depending on the total value of the purchase price. For example, the exchange rate may be lowered (e.g., more beneficial to the user) when the total purchase price is higher than a threshold value, than when it the total purchase price is lower than the threshold value. The discreet pricing algorithm may, in some embodiments, utilize a plurality of thresholds to generate virtual currency conversions. As another example, one algorithm, a smart pricing algorithm, may round the value of any input passed to it to at least one significant digit. The inputs passed to the smart pricing algorithm may, in various embodiments, be the exchange rate calculated by another algorithm, a price calculated by another algorithm, a (portion of a) purchase price of a product, and\/or the like. In some embodiments, the DPO may utilize a pre-specified table for performing some of the currency conversions. In such embodiments, the DPO may query a database for a conversion table for the identified currency conversions, using the user platform, payment method and conversion algorithms as keys for the query, e.g., . Using the conversion algorithms and conversion tables, the DPO may compute a conversion currency equivalent of the share of the total purchase price.

In some embodiments, if the number of failed authorization attempts exceeds a threshold, the pay network server may abort the authorization process, and provide an \u201cauthorization fail\u201d message to the merchant server, user device and\/or client.","In some embodiments, the pay network server may obtain the funds authorization response including a notification of successful authorization, and parse the message to extract authorization details. Upon determining that the user possesses sufficient funds for the transaction, e.g., , the pay network server may invoke a component to provide value-add services for the user, e.g., . For example, the pay network server may invoke a P2P social network marketing component to post a notification of the user's successful purchase of the product to a social profile of the user hosted by a social networking service. As another example, the pay network server may invoke the P2P social network marketing component to reward a different user whose social post via a social networking service caused the user to engage in the purchase transaction. For example, the pay network server may invoke the example P2P social network marketing component discussed below with reference to .","In some embodiments, the pay network server may forward a transaction authorization response to the user wallet device, PoS client, and\/or merchant server. The merchant may parse, e.g., , the transaction authorization response, and determine from it that the user possesses sufficient funds in the card account to conduct the transaction, e.g., , option\u201cYes.\u201d The merchant server may add a record of the transaction for the user to a batch of transaction data relating to authorized transactions. For example, the merchant may append the XML data pertaining to the user transaction to an XML data file comprising XML data for transactions that have been authorized for various users, e.g., , and store the XML data file, e.g., , in a database. In some embodiments, the server may also generate a purchase receipt, e.g., , and provide the purchase receipt to the client. The client may render and display, e.g., , the purchase receipt for the user. In some embodiments, the user's wallet device may also provide a notification of successful authorization to the user. For example, the PoS client\/user device may render a webpage, electronic message, text\/SMS message, buffer a voicemail, emit a ring tone, and\/or play an audio message, etc., and provide output including, but not limited to: sounds, music, audio, video, images, tactile feedback, vibration alerts (e.g., on vibration-capable client devices such as a smartphone etc.), and\/or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0154"},"figref":"FIGS. 17A-D"},"Thus, in some embodiments, there may be no need for the recommending user profile information to get communicated to the vendor by the Affiliate Server, thus ensuring the privacy of both the recommending user and the referred user. The \u201cAffiliate Server\u201d Rewards module may reward the recommending user on the successful click or action (sale) to the second user (referred user) resulting from the recommending user propagating the vendor offering to the second user, through his\/her Social Network communication. The reward may include one or more items selected from a group including a cash value, one or more virtual currency based rewards, or products, offers or coupons. A description of a user interacting with the invention in an example scenario follows: A Facebook user joins the P2P Affiliate program and in so doing grants the Affiliate Server access to the users profile or social graph data. This access could be granted in the form of adding a Facebook Affilate Application, or through the use of Facebook Connect on a website. The user is now incented to post to his\/her social network about any products he\/she finds appealing, or can endorse because such posts can not only infoml hislher friends about his\/her preferences, but can also lead to affiliate rewards if his\/her friends decide to click on the posts. The user posts a link that he\/she recently purchased a pair of Levy Jeans. This post gets communicated to hundreds of the user's friends through Facebook's friend feed. Ten users click on the link to browse the Levy Jean's Website. Two of the then users make a jeans purchase of $50 each. Levy has agreed to reward an affiliate with $0.50 for every user who browses their site and 5% of the sales price for any purchase. The Affiliate Server tracks the activity of the referred users on Levy's site and knows to reward the recommending user appropriately with $6.00 in this example. The Affiliate Server may take a percentage of all rewards as a service fee, or may receive a service fee from the merchants independently.","With reference to , in some embodiments, a MaaS server or other entity or component within the DPO may obtain a trigger, e.g., , to provide P2P social network marketing service (see, e.g., , ). In some embodiments, the MaaS server may parse the obtained trigger for provide P2P social network marketing service, and extract transaction details from the trigger, e.g., . For example, the pay network may extract fields such as, but not limited to: session ID, timestamp, alters URL, user ID, PoS client type and address, purchased products, product pricing, offers redeemed in the purchase, coupons utilized in the purchase, rewards provided due to the purchase, merchant name, URL to the product on the merchant website, and\/or the like. In some embodiments, the MaaS server may generate a user social post request for a social networking service using the details of the purchase transactions extracted from the trigger and\/or other communications (e.g., card authorization requests) associated with the trigger. For example, the MaaS server may query, e.g., -, its own database (e.g., via PHP\/SQL commands) to obtain a user ID of the user associated with the social networking service. Using the obtained user profile data  from the MaaS database , the MaaS server may generate a user social post request, e.g., an API call, to the social networking server . For example, the MaaS server may utilize a HTTP(S) POST request message similar to the examples provided previously.

The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative instructions may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. It should be understood that in alternative embodiments, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests. Often, the processors themselves will incorporate various specialized processing units, such as, but not limited to: integrated system (bus) controllers, memory management control units, floating point units, and even specialized processing sub-units like graphics processing units, digital signal processing units, and\/or the like.

The CPU may be a microprocessor such as: AMD's Athlon, Duron and\/or Opteron; ARM's application, embedded and secure processors; IBM and\/or Motorola's DragonBall and PowerPC; IBM's and Sony's Cell processor; Intel's Celeron, Core (2) Duo, Itanium, Pentium, Xeon, and\/or XScale; and\/or the like processor(s). The CPU interacts with memory through instruction passing through conductive and\/or transportive conduits (e.g., (printed) electronic and\/or optic circuits) to execute stored instructions (i.e., program code) according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates communication within the DPO controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and\/or capacity, distributed processors (e.g., Distributed DPO), mainframe, multi-core, parallel, and\/or super-computer architectures may similarly be employed.

Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the DPO features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the DPO system designer\/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or simple mathematical operations. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be circuit flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the DPO may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate DPO controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs.

The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the DPO controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like.

In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such.

Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP3, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash operation), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the DPO may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the DPO component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the DPO and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The DPO database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the DPO database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the DPO database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the DPO database  may be integrated into another component such as the DPO component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A Users table may include fields such as, but not limited to: user_id, ssn, dob, first_name, last_name, age, state, address_firstline, address_secondline, zipcode, devices_list, contact_info, contact_type, alt contact_info, alt contact_type, and\/or the like.

A Geographical Customizations table may include fields such as, but not limited to: geo_id, geo_name, geo_UI_customizations_list, geo_currency_customizations_list, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the DPO database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search DPO component may treat the combination of the DPO database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the DPO. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the DPO may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The DPO may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The DPO database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the DPO database communicates with the DPO component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The DPO component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the DPO component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the DPO discussed in the previous figures. As such, the DPO affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The DPO component may transform requests for on-demand and flexible monetization and related services via DPO components into currency transfers, purchase receipt notifications, social networking communications and transaction analytics reports, and\/or the like and use of the DPO. In one embodiment, the DPO component  takes inputs (e.g., catalog browsing input , product cart data , product catalog , social search results , product selection input , checkout request input , product data , service authorization response , service data , wallet access input , transaction authorization input , payment gateway address , payment network address , issuer server address(es) , user account(s) data , user profile data , batch data , payment network address , issuer server address(es) , payment ledger, merchant account data , merchant transactions data , and\/or the like) etc., and transforms the inputs via various components (e.g., UPC , PTA , PTC , PCB , FMS , VCC , DPO , P2P-SNM , Gila , and\/or the like), into outputs (e.g., product search response , display , updated product cart data , checkout data , display , service authorization confirmation\/retry message , flexible monetization service request , checkout widget , card authorization request , , , batch append data , purchase receipt , social post confirmation , user account credit command , social marketing credit notification , display credit notification , batch payment request , , transaction data , payment command , individual payment confirmation , , updated payment ledger, merchant account data , analytics results , , and\/or the like).","The DPO component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D)HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and\/or the like), WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the DPO server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The DPO component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the DPO component communicates with the DPO database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The DPO may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The structure and\/or operation of any of the DPO node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the DPO controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Jini local and remote application program interfaces, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.","For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., JSON, SOAP, and\/or like parsers) that may be employed to parse (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like. Again, the desired configuration will depend upon the context, environment, and requirements of system deployment.","For example, in some implementations, the DPO controller may be executing a PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) socket server via the information server, which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send data, e.g., data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication, the PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device, parse the received JSON-encoded text data to extract information from the JSON-encoded text data into PHP script variables, and store the data (e.g., client identifying information, etc.) and\/or extracted information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language (\u201cSQL\u201d).
