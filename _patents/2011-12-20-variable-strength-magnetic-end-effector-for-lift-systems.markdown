Moreover, conventional lifting and transporting systems using one or more end effectors are typically configured to perform a specific function with little variability regarding the capabilities of the end effector.","It is not uncommon for operator controlled lift and\/or transport assistance systems, such as forklifts, cranes, hoists, jacks, platform lifts, etc. to utilize a magnetically powered end effector to lift and transport objects. However, many of these end effectors, when active, are deficient in terms of their functionality where a payload of a specific weight or a specific amount of payload is required or desired to be transported from one location to another. Indeed, the magnetic end effectors present in most lift and\/or transport systems typically involve high power industrial grade magnets that indiscriminately lift and transport their payloads.","The present invention is related to copending nonprovisional U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/332,165, filed Dec. 20, 2011, and entitled, \u201cTeleoperated Robotic System\u201d; Ser.

For example, an object that is \u201csubstantially\u201d enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However, generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of \u201csubstantially\u201d is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. In other words, something that is \u201csubstantially free of\u201d an item may still actually contain such item as long as there is no measurable effect thereof.","As used herein, the term \u201cabout\u201d is used to provide flexibility to a numerical range endpoint by providing that a given value may be \u201ca little above\u201d or \u201ca little below\u201d the endpoint.","As used herein, a plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, and\/or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus, no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary.","Numerical data may be expressed or presented herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such a range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and thus should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. As an illustration, a numerical range of \u201cabout 1 to about 5\u201d should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited values of about 1 to about 5, but also include individual values and sub-ranges within the indicated range. Thus, included in this numerical range are individual values such as 2, 3, and 4 and sub-ranges such as from 1-3, from 2-4, and from 3-5, etc., as well as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, individually.","This same principle applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value as a minimum or a maximum. Furthermore, such an interpretation should apply regardless of the breadth of the range or the characteristics being described.","Reference will now be made to certain examples, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. Examples discussed herein set forth an adjustable or variable strength magnetic end effector for lift systems. In particular examples, the magnetic end effector is operational with a teleoperated robotic lift system, wherein the magnetic end effector is capable of lifting discriminate payloads by selectively actuating an actuator, such as a linear hydraulic actuator or a motor, to vary the strength of the magnetic end effector. The actuator can be operatively coupled to the variable strength magnet end effector, wherein the actuator is selectively actuatable to control the adjustment of the variable strength magnet. The actuator also functions to maintain the variable strength magnet at a desired magnetic force output strength once achieved for any given amount of time.","In accordance with one example, the present disclosure is directed to a lift system for lifting one or more objects comprising a lifting element that can be supported about a platform. A master control unit can be provided for controlling the lifting element, as well as a variable strength magnetic end effector that is supported about the lifting element of the lifting system for facilitating the lifting of one or more objects. The variable strength magnetic end effector is in communication with the master control unit. The end effector can comprise a variable strength magnet that is continuously adjustable to an infinite number of output magnetic strengths or magnetic strength output levels. The lifting system may also comprise an actuator that is selectively actuatable to control the adjustment of the variable strength magnet, and to maintain the variable strength magnet at a desired magnetic force output strength to secure the object to the end effector. The strength or intensity of the magnetic force is selectively and continuously adjustable throughout a range between full strength and no strength. More particularly, the strength of the magnet may be infinitely adjustable within the given range.","In another example, the present disclosure is directed to a method for lifting and transporting a specific number of objects from a larger collection of objects using an end effector supported about a lift system and employing an adjustable magnetic force. In this example, the method comprises obtaining a collection of objects arranged adjacent one another and determining a specific number of objects to lift from the collection of objects. Once determined, a continuously variable strength magnetic end effector may be positioned about the collection of objects, wherein the variable strength magnetic end effector having an infinite number of available magnetic strength outputs. The variable strength magnetic end effector may be actuated to achieve a magnetic strength output above a threshold level suitable for discriminately lifting the specific number of objects from the collection of objects. Moreover, the magnetic strength output may be maintained at least at the threshold level for a given period of time.","In still another example, the present disclosure is directed to a magnetic end effector comprising a housing; a magnetic element disposed within the housing, the magnetic element being continuously adjustable to an infinite number of magnetic strength output levels; and at least one communication element that associates the magnetic element with an actuator that facilitates control of the adjustment of the magnetic element. The actuator may be configured to maintain the magnetic element at a desired magnetic force strength output level to secure a lifted object to the end effector.","With these general examples set forth above, it is noted in the present disclosure that when describing the magnetic end effector or related devices and methods, each of these descriptions are considered applicable to the other, whether or not they are explicitly discussed in the context of that example. For example, in discussing the magnetic end effector, per se, the device and\/or method examples are also included in such discussions, and vice versa.","Furthermore, various modifications and combinations can be derived from the present disclosure and illustrations, and as such, the following figures should not be considered limiting in any way.","Illustrated in  is a magnetic end effector  configured as part of a user controllable teleoperated robotic lift system , the lift system comprising one or more structural elements for facilitating the lifting of objects. As shown, there is a master control unit  and a magnetic end effector . The master control unit  is in communication with the magnetic end effector  which enables a user at the master control unit  to control and adjust the magnetic end effector  to achieve an infinite number of magnetic force strengths or outputs between full power or intensity and no power or no intensity. As described in more detail herein, the magnetic strength of the magnetic end effector  can be continuously adjusted or varied within a pre-defined range according to the desires of a user.","In many aspects, enabling a user to vary and\/or adjust the magnetic force of the magnetic end effector  to achieve an infinite number of strength outputs between full power and no power has many advantages over conventional lifting and transport systems. Indeed, many conventional magnetic lift systems employ the use of two magnetic strengths: \u201con\u201d (full power) and \u201coff\u201d (no power). Accordingly, these conventional systems may be unable to selectively discriminate between objects when performing lifting and transporting functions.","In many instances, a user may need to lift a certain quantity of objects or a certain weight amount from a collection of objects. Shown in  is an operational example of the adjustable magnetic end effector . In the illustrated example, a lifting system  is lifting (illustrated by the upward arrow ) a specific quantity of objects, in this case a single metal plate member , from a larger collection of plate members . Using the adjustable magnetic end effector , a user can lift and transport a specific quantity of objects by adjusting the strength of the magnetic force of the magnetic end effector  to correspond with a desired load. For example, a user that desires to lift more than a single metal plate member from the collection of plate members  can continuously vary the strength of the magnetic force to increase the magnetic force until the desired strength output (magnetic force) is achieved that is suitable to accomplish the task. In one aspect, this can be accomplished by monitoring how many plate members are lifted from the collection of plate members at a given magnetic force. If too many plate members are lifted, the magnetic force can be continuously varied to reduce the magnetic force. Upon reaching the magnetic force that separates the desired quantity of metal plate members from the collection of plate members , the user can then increase the strength of the magnetic force even further, such as to full strength, in order to better secure the metal plate member  to the magnetic end effector .","Also shown in , the user controllable teleoperated robotic lift system  can include a platform , and one or more lifting elements, such as the robotic arm  shown. It is contemplated that the platform  can be mobile, as shown in , or fixed at a permanent location. In one aspect, the platform  can provide support for a user controllable teleoperated robotic lift system . In another aspect, the platform  can provide combined support for the master control unit  and for a teleoperator, or user, of the system . Thus, a mobile platform  can allow the system  and the magnetic end effector  to be moved from place to place as desired. Additionally, the user can be positioned on the platform , such that the user can see, hear, and direct one or more of the magnetic end effectors  in the workspace in which the magnetic end effectors  operate.","It is contemplated that the master control unit  can include one or more visual and\/or audio monitoring units that can enable the user to monitor the magnetic end effector  and the environment and objects around the magnetic end effector . The visual and\/or audio monitoring units may be in communication with one or more monitoring devices, such as a camera or microphone.","It is additionally contemplated that the master control unit  can be remotely located relative to magnetic end effector . In this example, the magnetic end effector  can include a camera, microphone, or other instrument to convey visual and\/or audio information to the remote user. With images and\/or sounds reproduced from the magnetic end effector workspace, the user can adjust the magnetic end effector  as desired. It is further contemplated that whether in close proximity or remotely located relative to one another, the master control unit  and the magnetic end effector  can be linked by signals communicated via wired or wireless data transfer systems. Wireless transmissions can be via radio, satellite, cell phone network, or any other type of wireless communication.","In one example, shown in , the teleoperated robotic lift system  includes one or more robotic slave arms  in communication with the master control unit . As described in more detail herein, the position and orientation of the robotic slave arms  can be adjusted and controlled from the master control unit. Also shown, the magnetic end effector  can be coupled to the robotic slave arm . Accordingly, in one aspect, a user may manipulate and change the position of the magnetic end effector  by adjusting the position and orientation of the robotic slave arms .","It is contemplated that the magnetic end effector  may be coupled to a variety of types of user controlled lift devices or elements, such as, but not limited to, robotic slave arms , tines of a forklift, a crane, hoists, jacks, platform lifts, and so forth. In accordance therewith, the adjustable magnetic end effector  can be adapted to suit the needs of a workplace.","Shown in  is a partial perspective view of a robotic slave arm  having a magnetic end effector  coupled to a support member  of the robotic slave arm . The magnetic end effector  can include a variable strength magnet . It is contemplated that the variable magnet  may be any suitable type, shape, size, grade, and\/or strength. In some non-limiting examples, the magnet  may be a permanent magnet, such as that comprising, Neodymium Iron Boron, Samarium Cobalt (SmCo), Alnico, Ceramic, and\/or Ferrite. However, these should not be limiting in any way. In one exemplary embodiment, the permanent magnet  may comprise a type of magnet made available from Industrial Magnetics, Inc. of Boyne City, Mo.","In an alternative example, the magnet  can comprise an electromagnet, having an electronic actuator that delivers current to the electromagnet. In one aspect, the electromagnet can comprise a metal core, such as an iron alloy. A wire coil can be wrapped around the metal core and a current from a power source can be directed to the wire coil. The power source may be any type, such as, but not limited to, a battery source or a power source contained in the master control unit  or platform  shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","100","210","210","308","308","310","310","315","308","230","310","315","210","210","210","210","315","210"]},"Conversely, orienting the magnet  so that the north and south polar regions are horizontal and in line and in contact with the ferrous material  causes the magnet  to produce a maximum magnetic force or strength output. Orienting the magnet  in this \u201cfull on\u201d position can be accomplished, for example, by rotating the magnet  to be into contact with first and second blocks  and  of the ferrous material .","As indicated above, in one aspect, selectively controlling the rotation of the permanent magnet  can be used to selectively increase and decrease the strength or intensity of the magnetic force of the magnet . Specifically, causing the permanent magnet  to be positioned in one of an infinite number of positions between the \u201cfull on\u201d and \u201cfull off\u201d positions can enable a magnetic force of a lesser degree as compared to the permanent magnet's \u201cfull on\u201d or full powered position. In these in between positions, the magnetic flux extends partially through the ferrous material  and the non-ferrous material  to produce a reduced magnetic force. Continuously varying the magnet  position between these positions effectively functions to vary the strength of the magnetic force.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["210","210","420","210","418","210","420","210","418","420","210","410","210","210","410","210","420","115","210","420"]},"In one aspect, shown in , the actuator  functions to enable the user to control the rotation of the permanent magnet . As previously discussed, the rotation of the permanent magnet  can function to adjust the strength of the magnetic force. Accordingly, through a user's control of the rotation imparted to the magnet  by the actuator , the magnetic force of the magnet  can be adjusted and controlled. Moreover, the actuator functions to be able to maintain the achieved magnetic force for any given period of time.

The user interface can be coupled to the actuator to cause movement of the actuator in response to user input. For example, the user can pull on a spring-loaded trigger to achieve a desired amount of magnetic force. By varying the position of the trigger, the user can determine the appropriate amount of magnetic force by sight or feel. Thus, when picking up sheet metal pieces from a stack of sheet metal pieces, for example, the user can pull the trigger and move the magnetic end effector slightly to determine how many sheet metal pieces have been secured to the end effector. This process can be repeated with different trigger positions until the desired number of sheet metal pieces have been secured to the end effector. Once the user has removed the desired number of sheet metal pieces from the stack, the user can pull the trigger to a maximum position to achieve maximum magnetic force while moving the sheet metal pieces. The user can release the trigger to an appropriate extent to reduce the magnetic force in order to disengage the end effector from any number of the sheet metal pieces.","Illustrated in  is a perspective view of an en effector  configured in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the end effector  comprises a variable strength magnet (not shown) operatively controlled by an actuator in the form of an electric motor  configured to enable a user to adjust the strength of the magnet to provide an infinite number of output strengths in terms of its magnetic force, as described herein. The electric motor  is operatively linked or otherwise secured to the shaft member , which is operatively coupled or otherwise secured to the magnet (not shown) supported within the housing . The electric motor  is in communication with the master control unit  and a power source. In operation, the electric motor  may be configured to provide bi-directional rotation of the shaft  and the magnet in response to a user's command, thereby adjusting the output strength of the magnet in a similar manner as discussed elsewhere herein. As shown, the motor  is mounted to the housing  and located about the shaft . In another aspect, the motor may be mounted to a different mounting structure and operatively linked to the shaft  to provide similar rotation of the shaft  and the magnet.","Illustrated in  is another exemplary embodiment, wherein a magnetic end effector  comprises more than one magnet or a plurality of magnets, such as magnets , . The magnets can be configured with interface regions ,  for interfacing with a payload to be secured by the magnets. Mounting bracket  can support the magnets , . In one aspect, the magnets ,  can be pivotally coupled to the mounting bracket, as illustrated by pivot connection . The pivot connections can be configured to allow small rotations up to about +\/\u221220 degrees in order to provide some \u201cgive\u201d in the end effector to move with a payload. This can allow the payload to maintain a secure coupling with the magnets even when undergoing a rotational displacement that would tend to twist or rock the payload loose from the magnets. The pivot connection can also include some form of resistance component to resist a freely pivoting and unrestrained movement at the connection. Such resistance can be linear or progressive in nature and can be applied by a spring, elastomer, or other suitable resistance component. The mounting bracket  can also be configured to couple with a slave arm at mounting region .","Magnetic strength can be adjusted by adjustment mechanism . The adjustment mechanism  can couple to and adjust the strength of each of the magnets , . For example, the magnets can be rotatable and coupled to a common drive mechanism. In one embodiment, the drive mechanism can comprise a gear or sprocket ,  and a drive element, such as a chain  or belt. The gear ,  can be driven by the chain . Opposite ends ,  of the chain  can be coupled to a carriage , thus associating the carriage with the drive mechanism to facilitate operation of the drive mechanism and the adjustment mechanism. A tensioner  can be used to put preload in the chain  in order to prevent the chain  from disengaging with the gears , . The carriage  is configured to move linearly along a shaft  in direction . The shaft  is coupled to support member  at one end by bracket  and at an opposite end by bracket . Thus, movement of the carriage  along the shaft  causes the chain  to move, which drives the gears ,  and rotates the magnets ,  to adjust magnetic strength. It should be recognized that any number of adjustable strength magnets can be coupled in this manner in order to simultaneously adjust the magnetic strength of all the magnets. In certain aspects, multiple groups of adjustable strength magnets can be employed, with each group of magnets being adjustable independent of the other group or groups. In another embodiment, the drive mechanism can include a rack and pinion gear system employed in place of the chain  illustrated, with the rack replacing the chain and drive gears ,  configured as pinions.","The carriage  is caused to move by an actuator . The actuator  is coupled at one end to the support member  by bracket  and at an opposite end to the carriage . Thus, the actuator  displaces the carriage  relative to the support member . As shown, the actuator  is a linear hydraulic actuator having hydraulic couplings ,  that can be coupled to a control valve, such as a servo valve, to control movement of the actuator .","A position sensor  can be used to monitor the position of the carriage, which can be related to the magnetic strength due to the rotation of the magnets , . The position sensor  can be coupled to the support member  and can track the position of the carriage  by a shaft  coupled to the carriage .","Illustrated in  are adjustable magnetic end effectors and incorporated as part of teleoperated robotic lift system having master control arms and , which are operatively linked to and are used to control and manipulate the robotic slave arms and , respectively.

The load weight recall functions can include instructions for storing, processing data from a user's previous loads and enabling a user to recall and have the system  automatically adjust the magnetic strength of the end effector  to be the same or substantially similar to previous load weights.","In an example, if a user needs to lift objects such as a stack of plates, the user can determine the weight of the first plate using the system . The load weight value of the first plate can be stored in the database  along with the actuator function value corresponding to the load weight value. Prior to lifting subsequent plates, a user can input a load weight recall function which instructs the control unit  to recall the data from the first lifted plate, data such as load weight and the corresponding actuator function. The control unit  then instructs the actuator to adjust the end effector adjustable magnet to the magnetic strength associated with the first plate. In at least one aspect, the load weight recall function is advantageous as in many situations a user does not know the load weight of one or more objects the user desires to lift.","In another example, the system  can enable a user to increase the magnetic strength of the end effector  to a desired degree above a desired or target load weight. By way of example only, if a desired load weight is one hundred pounds, the system  can be directed to automatically increase the magnetic strength to correspond to a load weight of one hundred ten pounds. Thus, the system  can enable a user to ensure the magnetic strength of the end effector  is sufficient to lift the desired load weight.","Some of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. The various modules, engines, tools, or modules discussed herein may be, for example, software, firmware, commands, data files, programs, code, instructions, or the like, and may also include suitable mechanisms. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more blocks of computer instructions, which may be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module when joined logically together.","Indeed, a module of executable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices. The modules may be passive or active, including agents operable to perform desired functions.","The modules can also be a combination of hardware and software. In an example configuration, the hardware can be a processor and memory while the software can be instructions stored in the memory.","The methods and systems of certain examples described herein may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or combinations thereof. In one example, the method can be executed by software or firmware that is stored in a memory and that is executed by a suitable instruction execution system. If implemented in hardware, as in an alternative example, the method can be implemented with any suitable technology that is well known in the art.","Also within the scope of an example is the implementation of a program or code that can be stored in a non-transitory machine-readable medium to permit a computer to perform any of the methods described above. For example, implementation can be embodied in any computer-readable media for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system such as a computer\/processor based system or an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) or other system that can fetch or obtain the logic from computer-readable media and execute the instructions contained therein. \u201cComputer-readable media\u201d can be any media that can contain, store, or maintain program instruction and data for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system such as a processor. Computer readable media can comprise any one of many physical media such as, for example, electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, or semiconductor media. More specific examples of suitable computer-readable media include, but are not limited to, a magnetic computer diskette such as floppy diskettes or hard drives, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory, or a portable device such as a compact disc (CD), thumb drive, or a digital video disc (DVD).","Various techniques, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, DVDs, hard drives, flash drives or any other machine-readable storage medium wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device may include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various techniques described herein may use an application programming interface (API), reusable controls, and the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) may be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with hardware implementations.","While the foregoing examples are illustrative of the principles and concepts discussed herein, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications in form, usage and details of implementation can be made without the exercise of inventive faculty, and without departing from those principles and concepts. Accordingly, it is not intended that the principles and concepts be limited, except as by the claims set forth below."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
