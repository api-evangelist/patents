The United States Government may have certain rights in this invention.","1. Technical Field","The present invention generally relates to carbon materials comprising an optimized pore structure, methods for making the same and devices containing the same.","2. Description of the Related Art","Activated carbon is commonly employed in electrical storage and distribution devices. The high surface area, conductivity and porosity of activated carbon allows for the design of electrical devices having higher energy density than devices employing other materials. Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs or \u201cultracapacitors\u201d) are an example of such devices. EDLCs often have electrodes prepared from an activated carbon material and a suitable electrolyte, and have an extremely high energy density compared to more common capacitors. Typical uses for EDLCs include energy storage and distribution in devices requiring short bursts of power for data transmissions, or peak-power functions such as wireless modems, mobile phones, digital cameras and other hand-held electronic devices. EDLCs are also commonly use in electric vehicles such as electric cars, trains, buses and the like.","Batteries are another common energy storage and distribution device which often contain an activated carbon material (e.g., as anode material, current collector, or conductivity enhancer). For example, lithium\/carbon batteries having a carbonaceous anode intercalated with lithium represent a promising energy storage device. Other types of carbon-containing batteries include lithium air batteries, which use porous carbon as the current collector for the air electrode, and lead acid batteries which often include carbon additives in either the anode or cathode. Batteries are employed in any number of electronic devices requiring low current density electrical power (as compared to an EDLC's high current density).","One known limitation of EDLCs and carbon-based batteries is decreased performance at high-temperature, high voltage operation, repeated charge\/discharge cycles and\/or upon aging. This decreased performance has been attributed, at least in part, to electrolyte impurity or impurities in the carbon electrode itself, causing breakdown of the electrode at the electrolyte\/electrode interface. Thus, it has been suggested that EDLCs and\/or batteries comprising electrodes prepared from higher purity carbon materials could be operated at higher voltages and for longer periods of time at higher temperatures than existing devices.","In addition to purity, another known limitation of carbon-containing electrical devices is the pore structure of the activated carbon itself. While activated carbon materials typically comprise high porosity, the pore size distribution is not optimized for use in electrical energy storage and distribution devices. Such optimization includes an idealized blend of both micropores and mesopores. An idealized pore size distribution is expected to maximize ion mobility (i.e., lower resistance), increase power density and improve volumetric capacitance of electrodes prepared from the optimized carbon materials.","Although the need for improved high purity carbon materials comprising a pore structure optimized for high pulse power electrochemical applications has been recognized, such carbon materials are not commercially available and no reported preparation method is capable of yielding the same. One common method for producing high surface area activated carbon materials is to pyrolyze an existing carbon-containing material (e.g., coconut fibers or tire rubber). This results in a char with relatively low surface area which can subsequently be over-activated to produce a material with the surface area and porosity necessary for the desired application. Such an approach is inherently limited by the existing structure of the precursor material, and typically results in a carbon material having an unoptimized pore structure and an ash content (e.g., metal impurities) of 1% or higher.","Activated carbon materials can also be prepared by chemical activation. For example, treatment of a carbon-containing material with an acid, base or salt (e.g., phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, zinc chloride, etc.) followed by heating results in an activated carbon material. However, such chemical activation also produces an activated carbon material not suitable for use in high performance electrical devices.","Another approach for producing high surface area activated carbon materials is to prepare a synthetic polymer from carbon-containing organic building blocks (e.g., a polymer gel). As with the existing organic materials, the synthetically prepared polymers are pyrolyzed and activated to produce an activated carbon material. In contrast to the traditional approach described above, the intrinsic porosity of the synthetically prepared polymer results in higher process yields because less material is lost during the activation step. However, known methods for preparing carbon materials from synthetic polymers produce carbon materials having unoptimized pore structures and unsuitable levels of impurities. Accordingly, electrodes prepared from these materials demonstrate unsuitable electrochemical properties.","While significant advances have been made in the field, there continues to be a need in the art for improved high purity carbon materials comprising an optimized pore structure for use in electrical energy storage devices, as well as for methods of making the same and devices containing the same. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages.","In general terms, the current invention is directed to novel carbon materials comprising an optimized pore structure. The optimized pore structure comprises a ratio of micropores to mesopores which increases the power density and provides for high ion mobility in electrodes prepared from the disclosed carbon materials. In addition, electrodes prepared from the disclosed carbon materials comprise low ionic resistance and high frequency response. The electrodes thus comprise a higher power density and increased volumetric capacitance compared to electrodes prepared from other carbon materials. The high purity of the carbon materials also contributes to improving the operation, life span and performance of any number of electrical storage and\/or distribution devices","Accordingly, the novel carbon materials find utility in any number of electrical energy storage devices, for example as electrode material in ultracapacitors. Such devices containing the disclosed carbon materials are useful in any number of applications, including applications requiring high pulse power. Because of the unique properties of the disclosed carbon materials, the devices are also expected to have higher durability, and thus an increased life span, compared to other known carbon-containing electrochemical devices.","Accordingly, one embodiment of the present disclosure is directed to a carbon material comprising a pore structure, the pore structure comprising micropores, mesopores and a total pore volume, wherein from 40% to 90% of the total pore volume resides in micropores, from 10% to 60% of the total pore volume resides in mesopores and less than 10% of the total pore volume resides in pores greater than 20 nm.","In other embodiments, from 40% to 50% of the total pore volume resides in micropores and from 50% to 60% of the total pore volume resides in mesopores.

In some embodiments, such catalysts can be used in the range of molar ratios of 20:1 to 200:1 phenolic compound:catalyst. For example in other embodiments, such catalysts can be used in the range of molar ratios of 5:1 to 100:1 phenolic compound: catalyst.","The reaction solvent is another process parameter that may be varied to obtain the desired properties (e.g., surface area, porosity, purity, etc.) of the polymer gels and carbon materials. In some embodiments, the solvent for preparation of the polymer gel is a mixed solvent system of water and a miscible co-solvent. For example, in certain embodiments the solvent comprises a water miscible acid. Examples of water miscible acids include, but are not limited to, propionic acid, acetic acid, and formic acid.

Another envisioned method comprises using a blast freezer with a metal plate at \u221260\u00b0 C. to rapidly remove heat from the polymer gel particles scattered over its surface. Another method of rapidly cooling water in a polymer gel particle is to snap freeze the particle by pulling a high vacuum very rapidly (the degree of vacuum is such that the temperature corresponding to the equilibrium vapor pressure allows for freezing). Yet another method for rapid freezing comprises admixing a polymer gel with a suitably cold gas. In some embodiments the cold gas may have a temperature below about \u221210\u00b0 C.

In further embodiments, the molar ratio of phenolic precursor to catalyst is from about 100:1 to about 5:1.","In the specific embodiment wherein one of the polymer precursors is resorcinol and another polymer precursor is formaldehyde, the resorcinol to catalyst ratio can be varied to obtain the desired properties of the resultant polymer gel and carbon materials. In some embodiments of the methods described herein, the molar ratio of resorcinol to catalyst is from about 10:1 to about 2000:1 or the molar ratio of resorcinol to catalyst is from about 20:1 to about 200:1. In further embodiments, the molar ratio of resorcinol to catalyst is from about 25:1 to about 100:1. In further embodiments, the molar ratio of resorcinol to catalyst is from about 25:1 to about 50:1. In further embodiments, the molar ratio of resorcinol to catalyst is from about 100:1 to about 5:1.","Polymerization to form a polymer gel can be accomplished by various means described in the art and may include addition of an electrochemical modifier. For instance, polymerization can be accomplished by incubating suitable polymer precursor materials, and optionally an electrochemical modifier, in the presence of a suitable catalyst for a sufficient period of time. The time for polymerization can be a period ranging from minutes or hours to days, depending on the temperature (the higher the temperature the faster, the reaction rate, and correspondingly, the shorter the time required). The polymerization temperature can range from room temperature to a temperature approaching (but lower than) the boiling point of the starting solution. For example, the temperature can range from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 90\u00b0 C. In the specific embodiment wherein one polymer precursor is resorcinol and one polymer precursor is formaldehyde, the temperature can range from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 100\u00b0 C., typically from about 25\u00b0 C. to about 90\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, polymerization can be accomplished by incubation of suitable synthetic polymer precursor materials in the presence of a catalyst for at least 24 hours at about 90\u00b0 C. Generally polymerization can be accomplished in between about 6 and about 24 hours at about 90\u00b0 C., for example between about 18 and about 24 hours at about 90\u00b0 C.","The polymer precursor materials as disclosed herein include (a) alcohols, phenolic compounds, and other mono- or polyhydroxy compounds and (b) aldehydes, ketones, and combinations thereof. Representative alcohols in this context include straight chain and branched, saturated and unsaturated alcohols. Suitable phenolic compounds include polyhydroxy benzene, such as a dihydroxy or trihydroxy benzene. Representative polyhydroxy benzenes include resorcinol (i.e., 1,3-dihydroxy benzene), catechol, hydroquinone, and phloroglucinol. Mixtures of two or more polyhydroxy benzenes can also be used. Phenol (monohydroxy benzene) can also be used. Representative polyhydroxy compounds include sugars, such as glucose, and other polyols, such as mannitol. Aldehydes in this context include: straight chain saturated aldehydes such as methanal (formaldehyde), ethanal (acetaldehyde), propanal (propionaldehyde), butanal (butyraldehyde), and the like; straight chain unsaturated aldehydes such as ethenone and other ketenes, 2-propenal (acrylaldehyde), 2-butenal (crotonaldehyde), 3 butenal, and the like; branched saturated and unsaturated aldehydes; and aromatic-type aldehydes such as benzaldehyde, salicylaldehyde, hydrocinnamaldehyde, and the like.

The polymer precursor materials can also be combinations of the precursors described above.","In some embodiments, one polymer precursor is an alcohol-containing species and another polymer precursor is a carbonyl-containing species. The relative amounts of alcohol-containing species (e.g., alcohols, phenolic compounds and mono- or poly-hydroxy compounds or combinations thereof) reacted with the carbonyl containing species (e.g. aldehydes, ketones or combinations thereof) can vary substantially. In some embodiments, the ratio of alcohol-containing species to aldehyde species is selected so that the total moles of reactive alcohol groups in the alcohol-containing species is approximately the same as the total moles of reactive carbonyl groups in the aldehyde species. Similarly, the ratio of alcohol-containing species to ketone species may be selected so that the total moles of reactive alcohol groups in the alcohol containing species is approximately the same as the total moles of reactive carbonyl groups in the ketone species. The same general 1:1 molar ratio holds true when the carbonyl-containing species comprises a combination of an aldehyde species and a ketone species.","The total solids content in the solution or suspension prior to polymer gel formation can be varied. The weight ratio of resorcinol to water is from about 0.05 to 1 to about 0.70 to 1. Alternatively, the ratio of resorcinol to water is from about 0.15 to 1 to about 0.6 to 1. Alternatively, the ratio of resorcinol to water is from about 0.15 to 1 to about 0.35 to 1. Alternatively, the ratio of resorcinol to water is from about 0.25 to 1 to about 0.5 to 1. Alternatively, the ratio of resorcinol to water is from about 0.3 to 1 to about 0.4 to 1.","Examples of solvents useful in the preparation of the polymer gels disclosed herein include but are not limited to water or alcohols such as, for example, ethanol, t butanol, methanol or combinations thereof as well as aqueous mixtures of the same. Such solvents are useful for dissolution of the polymer precursor materials, for example dissolution of the phenolic compound. In addition, in some processes such solvents are employed for solvent exchange in the polymer gel (prior to freezing and drying), wherein the solvent from the polymerization of the precursors, for example, resorcinol and formaldehyde, is exchanged for a pure alcohol. In one embodiment of the present application, a polymer gel is prepared by a process that does not include solvent exchange.","Suitable catalysts in the preparation of the polymer gels include volatile basic catalysts that facilitate polymerization of the precursor materials into a monolithic polymer. The catalyst can also comprise various combinations of the catalysts described above. In embodiments comprising phenolic compounds, such catalysts can be used in the range of molar ratios of 5:1 to 200:1 phenolic compound:catalyst. For example, in some specific embodiments such catalysts can be used in the range of molar ratios of 25:1 to 100:1 phenolic compound:catalyst.","2. Creation of Polymer Gel Particles","A monolithic polymer gel can be physically disrupted to create smaller particles according to various techniques known in the art. The resultant polymer gel particles generally have an average diameter of less than about 30 mm, for example, in the size range of about 1 mm to about 25 mm, or between about 1 mm to about 5 mm or between about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm. Alternatively, the size of the polymer gel particles can be in the range below about 1 mm, for example, in the size range of about 10 to 1000 microns. Techniques for creating polymer gel particles from monolithic material include manual or machine disruption methods, such as sieving, grinding, milling, or combinations thereof. Such methods are well-known to those of skill in the art. Various types of mills can be employed in this context such as roller, bead, and ball mills and rotary crushers and similar particle creation equipment known in the art.","In a specific embodiment, a roller mill is employed. A roller mill has three stages to gradually reduce the size of the gel particles. The polymer gels are generally very brittle and are not damp to the touch. Consequently they are easily milled using this approach; however, the width of each stage must be set appropriately to achieve the targeted final mesh. This adjustment is made and validated for each combination of gel recipe and mesh size. Each gel is milled via passage through a sieve of known mesh size. Sieved particles can be temporarily stored in sealed containers.","In one embodiment, a rotary crusher is employed. The rotary crusher has a screen mesh size of about \u215binch. In another embodiment, the rotary crusher has a screen mesh size of about \u215cinch. In another embodiment, the rotary crusher has a screen mesh size of about \u215dinch. In another embodiment, the rotary crusher has a screen mesh size of about \u215cinch.","Milling can be accomplished at room temperature according to methods well known to those of skill in the art. Alternatively, milling can be accomplished cryogenically, for example by co-milling the polymer gel with solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) particles. In this embodiment, the two steps of (a) creating particles from the monolithic polymer gel and (b) rapid, multidirectional freezing of the polymer gel are accomplished in a single process.","3. Rapid Freezing of Polymer Gels","After the polymer gel particles are formed from the monolithic polymer gel, freezing of the polymer gel particles may be accomplished rapidly and in a multi-directional fashion as described in more detail above. Freezing slowly and in a unidirectional fashion, for example by shelf freezing in a lyophilizer, results in dried material having a very low surface area. Similarly, snap freezing (i.e., freezing that is accomplished by rapidly cooling the polymer gel particles by pulling a deep vacuum) also results in a dried material having a low surface area. As disclosed herein rapid freezing in a multidirectional fashion can be accomplished by rapidly lowering the material temperature to at least about \u221210\u00b0 C. or lower, for example, \u221220\u00b0 C. or lower, or for example, to at least about \u221230\u00b0 C. or lower. Rapid freezing of the polymer gel particles creates a fine ice crystal structure within the particles due to widespread nucleation of ice crystals, but leaves little time for ice crystal growth. This provides a high specific surface area between the ice crystals and the hydrocarbon matrix, which is necessarily excluded from the ice matrix.","The concept of extremely rapid freezing to promote nucleation over crystal growth can also be applied to mixed solvent systems. In one embodiment, as the mixed solvent system is rapidly cooled, the solvent component that predominates will undergo crystallization at its equilibrium melting temperature, with increased concentration of the co-solvent(s) and concomitant further freezing point depression. As the temperature is further lowered, there is increased crystallization of the predominant solvent and concentration of co-solvent(s) until the eutectic composition is reached, at which point the eutectic composition undergoes the transition from liquid to solid without further component concentration or product cooling until complete freezing is achieved. In the specific case of water and acetic acid (which as pure substances exhibit freezing points of 0\u00b0 C. and 17\u00b0 C., respectively), the eutectic composition is comprised of approximately 59% acetic acid and 41% water and freezes at about \u221227\u00b0 C. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the mixed solvent system is the eutectic composition, for example, in one embodiment the mixed solvent system comprises 59% acetic acid and 41% water.","4. Drying of Polymer Gels","In one embodiment, the frozen polymer gel particles containing a fine ice matrix are lyophilized under conditions designed to avoid collapse of the material and to maintain fine surface structure and porosity in the dried product. Generally drying is accomplished under conditions where the temperature of the product is kept below a temperature that would otherwise result in collapse of the product pores, thereby enabling the dried material to retain an extremely high surface area.","The structure of the final carbon material is reflected in the structure of the dried polymer gel which in turn is established by the polymer gel properties. These features can be created in the polymer gel using a sol-gel processing approach as described herein, but if care is not taken in removal of the solvent, then the structure is not preserved. It is of interest to both retain the original structure of the polymer gel and modify its structure with ice crystal formation based on control of the freezing process. In some embodiments prior to drying, the aqueous content of the polymer gel is in the range of about 50% to about 99%. In certain embodiments upon drying, the aqueous content of the polymer cryogel is about 10%, alternately less than about 5% or less than about 2.5%.","A lyophilizer chamber pressure of about 2250 microns results in a primary drying temperature in the drying product of about \u221210\u00b0 C. Drying at about 2250 micron chamber pressure or lower case provides a product temperature during primary drying that is no greater than about \u221210\u00b0 C. As a further illustration, a chamber pressure of about 1500 microns results in a primary drying temperature in the drying product of about \u221215\u00b0 C. Drying at about 1500 micron chamber pressure or lower provides a product temperature during primary drying that is no greater than about \u221215\u00b0 C. As yet a further illustration, a chamber pressure of about 750 microns results in a primary drying temperature in the drying product of about \u221220\u00b0 C. Drying at 750 micron chamber pressure or lower provides a product temperature during primary drying that is no greater than about \u221220\u00b0 C. As yet a further illustration, a chamber pressure of about 300 microns results in a primary drying temperature in the drying product of about \u221230\u00b0 C. Drying at 300 micron chamber pressure or lower provides a product temperature during primary drying that is no greater than about \u221230\u00b0 C.","5. Pyrolysis and Activation of Polymer Gels","The polymer gels described above, can be further processed to obtain carbon materials. Such processing includes, for example, pyrolysis and\/or activation. Generally, in the pyrolysis process, dried polymer gels are weighed and placed in a rotary kiln. The temperature ramp is set at 5\u00b0 C. per minute, the dwell time and dwell temperature are set; cool down is determined by the natural cooling rate of the furnace. The entire process is usually run under an inert atmosphere, such as a nitrogen environment. Pyrolyzed samples are then removed and weighed. Other pyrolysis processes are well known to those of skill in the art.","In some embodiments, pyrolysis dwell time (the period of time during which the sample is at the desired temperature) is from about 0 minutes to about 120 minutes, from about 0 minutes to about 60 minutes, from about 0 minutes to about 30 minutes, from about 0 minutes to about 10 minutes, from about 0 to 5 minutes or from about 0 to 1 minute.","Pyrolysis may also be carried out more slowly than described above. For example, in one embodiment the pyrolysis is carried out in about 120 to 480 minutes. In other embodiments, the pyrolysis is carried out in about 120 to 240 minutes.","In some embodiments, pyrolysis dwell temperature ranges from about 500\u00b0 C. to 2400\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, pyrolysis dwell temperature ranges from about 650\u00b0 C. to 1800\u00b0 C. In other embodiments pyrolysis dwell temperature ranges from about 700\u00b0 C. to about 1200\u00b0 C. In other embodiments pyrolysis dwell temperature ranges from about 850\u00b0 C. to about 1050\u00b0 C. In other embodiments pyrolysis dwell temperature ranges from about 800\u00b0 C. to about 900\u00b0 C.","In some embodiments, the pyrolysis dwell temperature is varied during the course of pyrolysis. In one embodiment, the pyrolysis is carried out in a rotary kiln with separate, distinct heating zones. The temperature for each zone is sequentially decreased from the entrance to the exit end of the rotary kiln tube. In one embodiment, the pyrolysis is carried out in a rotary kiln with separate distinct heating zones, and the temperature for each zone is sequentially increased from entrance to exit end of the rotary kiln tube.","Activation time and activation temperature both have a large impact on the performance of the resulting activated carbon material, as well as the manufacturing cost thereof. Increasing the activation temperature and the activation dwell time results in higher activation percentages, which generally correspond to the removal of more material compared to lower temperatures and shorter dwell times. Activation temperature can also alter the pore structure of the carbon where lower temperatures result in more microporous carbon and higher temperatures result in mesoporosity. This is a result of the activation gas diffusion limited reaction that occurs at higher temperatures and reaction kinetic driven reactions that occur at lower temperature. Higher activation percentage often increases performance of the final activated carbon, but it also increases cost by reducing overall yield. Improving the level of activation corresponds to achieving a higher performance product at a lower cost.","Pyrolyzed polymer gels may be activated by contacting the pyrolyzed polymer gel with an activating agent. Many gases are suitable for activating, for example gases which contain oxygen. Non-limiting examples of activating gases include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, steam, oxygen and combinations thereof. Activating agents may also include corrosive chemicals such as acids, bases or salts (e.g., phosphoric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, oxalic acid, uric acid, lactic acid, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, zinc chloride, etc.). Other activating agents are known to those skilled in the art.","In some embodiments, the activation time is between 1 minute and 48 hours. In other embodiments, the activation time is between 1 minute and 24 hours. In other embodiments, the activation time is between 5 minutes and 24 hours. In other embodiments, the activation time is between 1 hour and 24 hours. In further embodiments, the activation time is between 12 hours and 24 hours. In certain other embodiments, the activation time is between 30 min and 4 hours. In some further embodiments, the activation time is between 1 hour and 2 hours.","Pyrolyzed polymer gels may be activated using any number of suitable apparatuses known to those skilled in the art, for example, fluidized beds, rotary kilns, elevator kilns, roller hearth kilns, pusher kilns, etc. In one embodiment of the activation process, samples are weighed and placed in a rotary kiln, for which the automated gas control manifold is set to ramp at a 20\u00b0 C. per minute rate. Carbon dioxide is introduced to the kiln environment for a period of time once the proper activation temperature has been reached. After activation has occurred, the carbon dioxide is replaced by nitrogen and the kiln is cooled down. Samples are weighed at the end of the process to assess the level of activation. Other activation processes are well known to those of skill in the art. In some of the embodiments disclosed herein, activation temperatures may range from 800\u00b0 C. to 1300\u00b0 C. In another embodiment, activation temperatures may range from 800\u00b0 C. to 1050\u00b0 C. In another embodiment, activation temperatures may range from about 850\u00b0 C. to about 950\u00b0 C. One skilled in the art will recognize that other activation temperatures, either lower or higher, may be employed.","The degree of activation is measured in terms of the mass percent of the pyrolyzed dried polymer gel that is lost during the activation step. In one embodiment of the methods described herein, activating comprises a degree of activation from 5% to 90%; or a degree of activation from 10% to 80%; in some cases activating comprises a degree of activation from 40% to 70%, or a degree of activation from 45% to 65%.","C. Characterization of Polymer Gels and Carbon Materials","The structural properties of the final carbon material and intermediate polymer gels may be measured using Nitrogen sorption at 77K, a method known to those of skill in the art. The final performance and characteristics of the finished carbon material is important, but the intermediate products (both dried polymer gel and pyrolyzed, but not activated, polymer gel), can also be evaluated, particularly from a quality control standpoint, as known to those of skill in the art. The Micromeretics ASAP 2020 is used to perform detailed micropore and mesopore analysis, which reveals a pore size distribution from 0.35 nm to 50 nm in some embodiments. The system produces a nitrogen isotherm starting at a pressure of 10atm, which enables high resolution pore size distributions in the sub 1 nm range. The software generated reports utilize a Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to calculate properties such as pore size distributions, surface area distributions, total surface area, total pore volume, and pore volume within certain pore size ranges.","The impurity content of the carbon materials can be determined by any number of analytical techniques known to those of skill in the art. One particular analytical method useful within the context of the present disclosure is proton induced x-ray emission (PIXE). This technique is capable of measuring the concentration of elements having atomic numbers ranging from 11 to 92 at low ppm levels. Accordingly, in one embodiment the concentration of impurities present in the carbon materials is determined by PIXE analysis.","D. Devices Comprising the Carbon Materials","1. EDLCs","The disclosed carbon materials can be used as electrode material in any number of electrical energy storage and distribution devices. One such device is an ultracapacitor. Ultracapacitors comprising carbon materials are described in detail in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,835,136 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety.","EDLCs use electrodes immersed in an electrolyte solution as their energy storage element. Typically, a porous separator immersed in and impregnated with the electrolyte ensures that the electrodes do not come in contact with each other, preventing electronic current flow directly between the electrodes. At the same time, the porous separator allows ionic currents to flow through the electrolyte between the electrodes in both directions thus forming double layers of charges at the interfaces between the electrodes and the electrolyte.","When electric potential is applied between a pair of electrodes of an EDLC, ions that exist within the electrolyte are attracted to the surfaces of the oppositely-charged electrodes, and migrate towards the electrodes. A layer of oppositely-charged ions is thus created and maintained near each electrode surface. Electrical energy is stored in the charge separation layers between these ionic layers and the charge layers of the corresponding electrode surfaces. In fact, the charge separation layers behave essentially as electrostatic capacitors. Electrostatic energy can also be stored in the EDLCS through orientation and alignment of molecules of the electrolytic solution under influence of the electric field induced by the potential. This mode of energy storage, however, is secondary.","EDLCS comprising the disclosed carbon material can be employed in various electronic devices where high power is desired. Accordingly, in one embodiment an electrode comprising the carbon materials is provided. In another embodiment, the electrode comprises activated carbon material. In a further embodiment, an ultracapacitor comprising an electrode comprising the carbon materials is provided.

In some embodiments, the carbon material is milled to an average particle size of about 10 microns using a jetmill according to the art. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this fine particle size enhances particle-to-particle conductivity, as well as enabling the production of very thin sheet electrodes. The jetmill essentially grinds the carbon against itself by spinning it inside a disc shaped chamber propelled by high-pressure nitrogen. As the larger particles are fed in, the centrifugal force pushes them to the outside of the chamber; as they grind against each other, the particles migrate towards the center where they eventually exit the grinding chamber once they have reached the appropriate dimensions.","In further embodiments, after jet milling the carbon is blended with a fibrous Teflon binder (3% by weight) to hold the particles together in a sheet.

Lithium air batteries generally comprise an electrolyte interposed between positive electrode and negative electrodes. The positive electrode generally comprises a lithium compound such as lithium oxide or lithium peroxide and serves to oxidize or reduce oxygen. The negative electrode generally comprises a carbonaceous substance which absorbs and releases lithium ions. As with supercapacitors, batteries such as lithium air batteries which comprise the disclosed carbon materials are expected to be superior to batteries comprising known carbon materials. Accordingly, in one embodiment the present invention provides a metal air battery, for example a lithium air battery, comprising a carbon material as disclosed herein.","Any number of other batteries, for example, zinc-carbon batteries, lithium\/carbon batteries, lead acid batteries and the like are also expected to perform better with the carbon materials.

The active material can be any active material known in the art and useful in lead acid batteries, for example the active material may comprise lead, lead (II) oxide, lead (IV) oxide, or combinations thereof and may be in the form of a paste.","Another embodiment of any of the above devices, the carbon material comprises the same micropore to mesopore distribution but at a lower surface area range. This embodiment is prepared by synthesizing the same base high purity polymer structure that yields the same optimized micropore to mesopore volume distribution with low surface functionality upon pyrolysis (but no activation). The result of lower surface area optimized pore structure in a battery application like lead acid batteries is a maximization of an electrode formulation with a highly conductive network.

Chemicals were obtained from commercial sources at reagent grade purity or better and were used as received from the supplier without further purification.","Unless indicated otherwise, the following conditions were generally employed for preparation of the carbon materials and precursors. Phenolic compound and aldehyde were reacted in the presence of a catalyst in a binary solvent system (e.g., water and acetic acid). The molar ratio of phenolic compound to aldehyde was typically 0.5 to 1. The reaction was allowed to incubate in a sealed container at temperatures of up to 85 C. for up to 24 h. The resulting polymer hydrogel contained water, but no organic solvent; and was not subjected to solvent exchange of water for an organic solvent, such as t-butanol. The polymer hydrogel monolith was then physically disrupted, for example by grinding, to form polymer hydrogel particles having an average diameter of less than about 5 mm. Unless stated otherwise, the particles were then rapidly frozen, generally by immersion in a cold fluid (e.g., liquid nitrogen or ethanol\/dry ice) and lyophilized. Generally, the lyophilizer shelf was pre-cooled to \u221230\u00b0 C. before loading a tray containing the frozen polymer hydrogel particles on the lyophilizer shelf. The chamber pressure for lyophilization was typically in the range of 50 to 1000 mTorr and the shelf temperature was in the range of +10 to +25\u00b0 C. Alternatively, the shelf temperature can be set lower, for example in the range of 0 to +10\u00b0 C. Alternatively, the shelf temperature can be set higher, for example in the range of 25 to +100\u00b0 C. Chamber pressure can be held in the range of 50 to 3000 mTorr.

Without being bound by theory, Applicants believe this mesoporosity contributes, at least in part, to the enhanced electrochemical properties of the carbon materials.","A carbon material prepared according to the general procedures described above was evaluated for its properties and performance as an electrode in a symmetric electrochemical capacitor with a carbonate-based organic electrolyte. A comprehensive set of property and performance measurements was performed on test capacitors fabricated with this material.","The sample was very granular and included relatively large particles. As a result, the capacitor's electrodes formed for the evaluation were porous and had very low density (0.29 g\/cm). The electrode fabricated using the carbon material exhibited a high value of specific capacitance (105 F\/g) but because of the very low electrode density the volumetric capacitance was only 30 F\/cc. Using the mass or volume of the dry electrodes only, the test devices had Figure of Merit (FOM) values (see Miller, \u201cPulse Power Performance of Electrochemical Capacitors: Technical Status of Present Commercial Devices,\u201d Proc. 8th International Seminar on Double Layer Capacitors and Similar Energy Storage Devices, Deerfield Beach, Fla.

In comparison, the maximum reported FOM value for commercial capacitor products using organic electrolyte (1998) was 3.6 W\/g and 4.1 W\/ml. The disclosed carbon material compares very favorably to the commercial devices on a weight basis, primarily because of the relatively high \u201cturn-on\u201d frequency (0.17 Hz). It is anticipated that the volumetric performance of the carbon materials can be improved by reducing the particle size by grinding or other processing.","The carbon sample was labeled 9AC16. The sample was dried at 60\u00b0 C. then mixed with a Teflon binder at 3.0% by weight. This mixture was thoroughly blended and formed into 0.003\u2033-thick-electrodes. The sample appeared to have a significant fraction of larger particles which led to a porous and low density electrode. In some instances, 0.002\u2033 thick electrodes are used for evaluation but the sample could not be formed into this thin a sheet with the integrity required for subsequent handling, and thus, the thicker electrodes were prepared.

The double separator was \u02dc0.004\u2033 thick before it is compressed in the test cell.
