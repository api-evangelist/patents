{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/367,319, filed on Jul. 23, 2010, entitled \u201cElectronic Badge Clearinghouse,\u201d the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","This document relates to systems and techniques for sharing and presenting badges and similar items that represent achievements by users of an electronic computing system.","Users of social networks typically enjoy sharing information about themselves with friends and others, and with seeing information about their friends. For example, many users provide short posts that describe recent happenings in their lives, link to content that they recently located and found to be interesting, or post digital photos of things they have done recently.","Social network systems also provide services that track what users do and that require less active involvement of the users. For example, a user may allow his or her location to be tracked (e.g., with GPS functionality provided in their smartphone) and reported to friends. A user may also \u201ccheck-in\u201d at particular venues such as restaurants, bars, and museums, and the occurrence of the visit may be reported to the user's friends or to others. The user may then make comments about the venue, and other users can later see those comments (e.g., as restaurant reviews and the like).","Users may also accumulate status points for visiting certain venues, and their status may be represented by an icon that can be displayed with their user profile in a system. For example, if a user visits museums frequently, a system can give the user an award that is represented by a badge on their home page or profile that indicates that the user is thoughtful and sophisticated (e.g., a badge that has a representation of Galileo in it). Such a badge can be seen by other users, who may then make judgments about the first user based on the types of badges the user has\u2014much like people may make judgments about a member of the military based on the ribbons they see on the person's dress uniform.","This document describes systems and techniques that may be used to manage awards for user achievement across multiple different systems. For example, various different social networks may assign awards to their users and represent those awards with badges that can be viewed in relation to the user, and a separate service may receive and accumulate information about the various awards so that a composite picture of the user's achievement across multiple systems may be generated.","The communication links between the various social networking organizations and the aggregating organization may be authenticated or verified connections, such as via OAuth or rel-me microformat, so that the aggregating organization and its users can trust that information provided by the aggregating organization is legitimate, and that user achievements are not fabricated, particularly in more important areas. (The number of times a person has visited a particular fast food restaurant might not be important from an authentication standpoint, whereas the user's professional achievements probably would be.)","The aggregation of user achievement information may be employed in a variety of manners. For example, a user's profile page at a particular site may reflect all of the achievements that the user has achieved with various different organizations. As one example, the user may belong to one social network for athletic-related activities, and another for visiting (and commenting on) restaurants and similar venues. The user's athletic and eating\/drinking activities can both be displayed to other users in a single location using the techniques discussed here. Similarly, the user may belong to a \u201cprofessional\u201d social networking system that is able to authenticate claims for employment, e.g., by calling listed employers to confirm that a person had the jobs he claims to have had. Such professional achievements may then be combined with more recreational achievements that the user may have recorded on a more general social networking site.","Also, particular achievements may be combined across multiple different organizations\u2014as one example, a user may have a badge that shows how many times they have gone to Mexican restaurants, and the number shown on an aggregated badge may reflect the sum of the times the user has checked into Mexican restaurants using any of the various social networks to which the user is subscribed.","Other achievements by the user may be related to factors other than attendance of the user at a venue or other similar real-time user tracking. For example, a user may be licensed or otherwise qualified in an activity by a licensing agency, and the user may wish to have that qualification displayed to people who visit the user's profile page, and to have it done in a way so that the visitors are confident that the qualification is legitimate. Thus, for example, a licensing organization, like a state bar association for attorneys, could provide a stub at its website for each of the lawyers licensed by the organization. The organization may mediate access to the stub using traditional credentialing, such as by assigning each licensed attorney an ID and password they must enter before accessing their page or other content. Each attorney may then use their credentials to point to their page or other objects to their profile page, such as a page with a badge aggregating service and can point the profile page back at their bar page, so as to set up an authenticated or verified connection. The organization that generates the profile page may have preexisting relationships to each state bar association so that the organization knows that it can trust each of the bars organizations, and the profile page organization may thus display a badge on the user's profile page that shows the user is licensed (and perhaps also show if he is in good standing, if the bar organization has left the user's content up) in the particular state. Such information may be relevant to users who want to hire the person as a lawyer, and want to confirm that the person is licensed in their state.","In addition, a user may provide for automatic filtering of badges or other content that is brought to a central profile page from multiple social systems. For example, a user may define that badges of a certain type (e.g., that suggest the user's activity in less-than-professional endeavors) not be shown. Such badges can be identified by meta data that is provided with the badge (e.g., a badge name or category) or in other ways as may be agreed upon among the various organizations (e.g., via a public application programming interface (API)).","In certain implementations, such systems and techniques may provide one or more advantages. For example, users of social networking systems may be able to aggregate their disparate information, and have their achievements seen more conveniently and clearly by their friends, followers, and other users. Social networking systems may benefit because more users will generally associate themselves with a system that can show complete information, so that such users can learn of new social networking services when they view aggregated information, and may thus choose to be involved with new services. Also, users are more likely to make the investment to get involved with a particular service if they know that they can use other services for other social networking purposes. In addition, the systems and techniques described here can permit for the relatively simple and secure integration of information from services other than social networking services, such as from professional credentialing organizations.","In one implementation, a computer-implemented method for handling electronic achievement information is provided. The method comprises receiving, from a first user of an achievement aggregation system, a selection a plurality of achievement tracking services that are operated by organizations that are separate from the operator of the achievement aggregation system; establishing an electronic communication connection between the achievement aggregator system and each of the one or more achievement tracking services; obtaining from each of the achievement tracking services, information sufficient to characterize one or more achievements obtained by the user; aggregating the information obtained from each of the achievement tracking services into a user achievement profile; and providing the user achievement profile for presentation to one or more users who request profile information about the first user. The method can also comprise aggregating the information obtained from each of the achievement tracking services with information sufficient to characterize one or more achievements obtained by the user with an organization that operates the achievement aggregation system. Moreover, the method can include providing a list of social networking services to the user and receiving the selection from the user in response to providing the list to the user.","In certain aspects, the electronic communication connections are established using a public, open connect-style application programming interface. Also, the information sufficient to characterize one or more achievements obtained by the user can comprise information that identifies one or more badges that each visually represents one of the achievements. In addition, aggregating the information obtained from each of the achievement tracking services can comprise arranging badges awarded by each of the plurality of achievement tracking services into a single integrated display of badges that includes badges from different independent services.","In yet other aspect, aggregating the information obtained from each of the achievement tracking services comprises creating new badges that represent on or more badges from the plurality of achievement tracking services. A first badge of the one or more new badges can represent a sum total of achievements combined from two or more of the achievement tracking services. The first badge in such a situation can display the sum total and contributed totals for each of the achievements from each of the achievement tracking services. The first badge can alternatively be of a badge type that differs from any badge types received from the achievement tracking services.","In other aspects, aggregating the information for the first badge comprises identifying badges types for at least two badges from the achievement tracking services, and identifying a badge type supported by the achievement aggregation system that corresponds to the identified badge types. Also, providing the user achievement profile can comprise serving code for displaying badges that represent the user's achievements on a profile page for the user. Moreover, providing the achievement profile can comprise providing information to a qualified third party requester that represents the aggregated information.","In another implementation, a computer-implemented user achievement data management system is disclosed. The system comprises an organization interface, an aggregator, and a user interface. The organization interface is programmed to communicate via electronic communication connections with one or more third-party achievement tracking services that provide information that characterizes one or more achievements made by particular users of the achievement tracking services. The aggregator is programmed to join achievement information for particular users obtained from different achievement tracking services, so as to generate an aggregates achievement profile that represents a combination of achievements for users across multiple third-party achievement tracking services. And the user interface is arranged for generating content that, when displayed, shows the joined achievement information in a single integrated display of achievement information for particular users.","In some aspects, the aggregator is further programmed to aggregate the information obtained from each of the achievement tracking services with information sufficient to characterize one or more achievements obtained by the user with an organization that operates the data management system. The user interface can also be arranged to provide a list of social networking services to the user and receive a selection from the user in response to providing the list to the user, the selection identifying services to which the organization interface is to establish connections. The electronic communication connections can also be established using a public, open connect-style application programming interface.","In another implementation, a computer-implemented user achievement data management system is disclosed that includes an organization interface programmed to communicate via electronic communication connections with one or more third-party achievement tracking services that provide information that characterizes one or more achievements made by particular users of the achievement tracking services; means for creating aggregated data out of individual user data from different third-party achievement tracking services to reflect total achievements be users across the multiple services; and a user interface for generating content that, when displayed, shows the joined achievement information in a single integrated display of achievement information for particular users.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","This specification discusses aggregation, sharing, and presentation of user achievement data. Such data represents activities and accomplishments achieved by individual users or groups of users of on-line networked systems. The achievements may be as minor as attending particular fast food restaurants many times, and as major as obtaining a difficult certification in a profession (e.g., a certification of a certain surgical specialty for a medical doctor).","The information is shared in the examples discussed here by forming authenticated or verified electronic communication connections between services that track and verify user achievements, and a central achievement aggregation system. The central system may receive the information from a variety of different sources, such as by using known social communication application programming interfaces (APIs), may combine and reformat the information, and perhaps generate new information that describes users' achievements, and then may provide it, either directly for review by the user or other users, or to another system that can use the combined achievement information. As one example, the aggregation system may provide information for display on a user's on-line profile page so that, when other users go to the page, they will see badges or other representations of all the first user's achievements in a single, integrated format, even though those achievements may have been obtained from a variety of independent services that track such information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","108"]},"The aggregator system  is represented in the figure in the form of a profile page for a particular user of the systems  and . For example, the user may have an account with the organization that operates the achievement aggregator , and the profile page may be one of the services that the organization provides to the user. It may provide the user with a profile page where the user may display personalized content that other users may review. For example, the user may include a photo of themselves, and other photos, contact information, information about their current employer and past employers, information about their education, personal likes and dislikes, and other similar information that is traditionally displayed on a personal profile.","The achievement aggregator  is shown in the figure, by means of two-headed arrows, as communicating with several other subsystems. The achievement aggregator  is at the center of the communication network and thus can communicate with each of the other subsystems. A first subsystem is an athletic social networking service  that provides a variety of services relating to athletic activities for its users. For example, the athletic social service  may provide profile pages for each user and may show information about the users, such as a user's current weight as reported by an electronic scale that may be in the user's home, and distances that the user has run, such as by using data that is automatically uploaded by portable devices that users may carry with them when they run, and that may be synchronized to a network-attached computer.","The athletic social service  is displayed along with a number of badges , which represent achievements that led to awards for the user of the service . In this example, four badges  are shown, and are represented by square icons positioned below the service . One badge shows a person high hurdling, and may represent an achievement in a particular track and field area for the user. Another badge shows a user shooting a bow and arrow, and may indicate a proficiency in archery for the user, such as the fact that the user may have scored a certain level in a controlled competition in archery. Another badge shows an aerial view of a running track, and may represent that the user has competed in particular track events. A fourth badge displays the number 50, and may indicate that the user has run for 50, 500, or 5000 miles during a certain period such as the previous week, month, or year. Each icon for the badges  may be displayed when a user visits the athletic social service  and identifies the particular user who corresponds to the profile page.","As shown by the two-headed arrow between the athletic social service  and the achievement aggregator , an authenticated or verified communication connection may be established between the two systems. Such a connection may be formed by the particular user pointing from the athletic social service  to their profile page at the achievement aggregator , and by the user pointing from the achievement aggregator  to the athletic social service . With such an authenticated or verified communications connection established, the achievement aggregator  may request the achievement information about the user and other users for which the connections were formed. The athletic social service  can then provide sufficient information to reflect the athletic achievements represented by the icons for the badges , and may pass the information to the achievement aggregator  in various manners, including by standard communication protocols such as extensible markup language (XML).","The information needed to characterize the achievements may take a variety of forms. First, the information may include an identifier for the user that can be recognized by both the athletic social service  and the achievement aggregator  so that the information is properly assigned to the right user when it is obtained by the achievement aggregator . The information may also include a title for the achievement (e.g., \u201cNerd Badge\u201d), and a longer description of the achievement (e.g., \u201cYou have checked in at science museums more than 5 times.\u201d). In addition, the information may include a parameter for the achievement such as \u201cmiles run since X date\u201d, and a value or values to the parameter, such as the total of miles that the particular user has run in the relevant time period defined by the parameter. The information may additionally include information needed to construct an icon that represents the achievement, including a fixed digital image or a URL that points to a stored and network-accessible image.","In the example system , the achievement aggregator  is also shown communicating with a social social service . This social social service  is referred to as being \u201csocial\u201d because it focuses on social activities that a user may undertake, such as meeting friends for food and drinks, as represented by the plate and wine glass shown with the social social service . Like the athletic social service , the social social service  is shown here along with several badges . The form of the social social service  badges is triangles rather than squares, and the particular form of badges may be selected by the particular social service that initiates the badges. The shapes in this example were chosen to help visually distinguish badges that originate at athletic social service  from badges that originate at social social service , though the form of badges may be selected in an appropriate manner by the respective services.","In this example, a first badge with a smiley face indicates a user achievement of going to a certain number of comedy clubs with friends. Badges with the numbers 1 and 50 in them are also shown. The badge with the number 1 may indicate that a user is the top user for a certain activity, while the badge with the number 50 may indicate a number of miles that the user has run during a time period\u2014similar to the last of the badges in group .","A two-headed arrow that is also shown between athletic social service  and social social service  indicates that the two social services may form a communication channel directly between themselves to provide for sharing of information in addition to, or alternatively to, providing information via achievement aggregator .","As shown in the figure, an aggregated group of icons for the user's achievements is shown inside the profile page for the achievement aggregator . These icons represent a combination of the badges  and  from the athletic social service  and the social social service , respectively. Some of the badges are simply repeated in the form that they would appear on a profile page for the same user with the social service from which the badge came. For example, the first two triangle badges are shown in the same form, as are the first three square badges from the athletic social service .","However, the badges showing the number of miles run by the user with respect to each of the social services have been replaced by a single badge in the aggregated user profile at the achievement aggregator . In this example, the achievement aggregator has analyzed the data for each of the incoming achievements, determined that they relate to a common achievement, extracted the parameter values for the achievement from each of these social services, and added the values to each other to identify that the user has one value of 100 instead of two values of 50. Also, an icon has been created by the achievement aggregator , which shows the number 100, but also shows the two 50-value icons, so that a viewer of the aggregated profile may readily see that the value of a particular achievement was created by the contribution of two different achievements at two different systems. The particular way of showing that achievement as a combination from two different services may be achieved in various manners, and the particular example shown here has been selected for clarity of explanation.","An additional icon on the profile page for the user shows the scales of justice. This icon is generated, not from an icon previously created at a social network, but by using data that indicates achievement by the user in the professional world. In particular, a professional system  may form a communication link with the achievement aggregator  in ways like those discussed here for the social services. The professional system may be, for example, a system run by the state government or other licensing authority that has power to certify professionals and others in particular technologies, fields, or specialties. In this example, the professional system  is shown as a courthouse, to represent that it is a website operated by an entity that licenses attorneys.","A plurality of documents  are shown with the professional system , and represent network accessible information, such as webpage stubs, that may be generated by an administrator of the professional system . Each licensed member of the organization may be provided with a stub, and access to that particular stub may be limited to a member who provides the proper credentials for logging into the system as that member. As a result, the member (or their agent) may cause the stub to be pointed at the achievement aggregator  profile page for that user, and may cause the achievement aggregator  profile page to point back at the stub. As a result, the professional system  may indicate to the achievement aggregator  that a particular user corresponding to a particular profile is a licensed attorney in the state, and the achievement aggregator  may create a particular icon that represents as much (e.g., the scales of justice icon). In this manner, the system  may also represent various achievements that are not related to a social network but that may be very important for a particular member of the system  to display.","Also in this way, a user can join multiple different social networks that each provide something of value to the user, and even though no social network meets all the user's needs. But the user can have their achievements reported in a single location, including with achievements from pages that are not part of public social networking sites.","In certain implementations, individual users may be given the opportunity to apply manual or automatic filters to limit the number or type of badges that will be displayed on their profiles. For example, once has user has imported and aggregated all their badges from other services, they may be shown a list of all the badges and may be given an opportunity to select particular badges or classes of badges that they want included or excluded, respectively, from the badges that are displayed on their profile page. For example, a user who is graduating from college may wish to block the display of badges that reflect the user's prior social activities in a manner that may negatively reflect on the user's employuability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","202","200","200","100"]},"The components communicate through a network , which may include various local and wide area networks, including the internet. The communications may take place via various well-known mechanisms, such as HTTP requests, HTML, XML, and others. In this particular example, all communications are between the server system  and one of the other components. The server system  is shown schematically as a rack server to indicate that the services discussed here may typically be provided by an operator of a large data center that provides a wide range of computing services such as mapping services, search engine services, email services, and the like.","The server system  may communicate with a portable client device  and two other server systems ,  that are operated by organizations that differ from each other and from the organization that operates the server system . In addition, the web addresses for each of the various server systems may be associated with different domains. A professional organization server system  represents an organization that qualifies, licenses, or otherwise certifies particular users as having competence in a particular area. The server system  may be a secure system that allows members who it has certified to access it with an ID and password, so as to prevent imposters from accessing the system . As discussed above and below, the particular members can edit content on the system  so as to point their content at the server system , and can make similar actions pointing from system  to system . Such actions may allow the systems to establish a communication channel with each other with respect to the particular user (though different users can perform similar steps so that various communication channels can be open for multiple users).","In a similar manner, a social network system  may be in communication with the system . In this example, however, a user may not need to take affirmative actions to have their achievement information shared between the systems. Instead, the two systems  and  may agree to share certain public information about users under a standard API. Using such mechanisms, the system  may provide data sharing functionality like that discussed above. The user may also be prompted to permit a certain level of information sharing via the API, again using methods that are known.","Particular components within the aggregation server system  may drive the operation of such functionality. For example, an organization interface  manages interactions between the system  and other server systems that might provide user information to the system , such as systems  and . The organization interface  may implement, for example, standard mechanisms like OAuth for establishing a communication connection so that information may be received by one of the systems with trust that it is accurate and properly corresponds to the identified user.","An authenticator  is provided to assist in determining whether a particular other service is legitimate and something that the system  should accept data from. The authenticator  may include components for checking the bona-fides of another service, or to determine whether the other service is likely to be legitimate and to provide good clean data, and to perform other operations needed to assist the organization interface  in setting up authenticated or verified communication connections.","A user front end  permits various users to request and view their own profiles or profiles of other users. The main information for a profile may be gathered in a familiar manner, such as by accessing the user data store , which may store personal information about each user in the system, such as name, birth date, gender, group to which the user has made an association, and the like. The profile may also gather information for displaying badges or similar user achievement indicators for a user whose profile is to be displayed. The information may be stored as user achievement data  and made available to the user front end  for generation of appropriate reports such as profile pages.","Finally, an aggregator  is provided to turn data about user achievement received from individual service into a single, integrated larger data set so that all of a user's achievements across multiple services can be conveniently displayed on a profile page. The aggregator may obtain information from the organization interface  or the user achievement data  and may look for commonalities between achievements tracked by different services. The aggregator may then perform actions like those discussed above and below to aggregate the various information, including by modifying badges or creating new badges, and by arranging the various aggregated badges for display to a user or users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The process begins at box , where a user selection is received that identifies services from which the user would like to have their achievement information imported. For example, the process may provide a list of social networking services with which a system that runs the process has informationsharing relationships. The system may then allow a user to select certain listed services. Alternatively, or in addition, the system may search for a name or a handle (a unique or essentially name for the individual in the system or systems, which may be an email address or a screen name) for the user at the first service that is run by the system, and then to see if that handle is present at the other services. The system may then present the services with a match for the handle or identifier that was found.","At box , the first service (i.e., at the system that is executing the process described here) may establish an authenticated or verified connection with the services (e.g., as provided by various social networking sites or services) that the user selected, and may provide an identifier for the particular user to those services. The first service may, in this example, be an aggregation service that is arranged to obtain information from the other services and to provide it back to various users (e.g., at a profile page for the aggregation service or at profile pages for each one of the other services) once it has been aggregated","If the user information that is provided by the aggregation service is appropriate, the service may obtain user achievement data sufficient to describe achievements made by the user at the other service, as shown in box . As discussed above, that user achievement data may include an identifier for the achievement such as an identified achievement number, an identifier for the user, a name of the achievement, a description of the achievement, information needed to connect an icon or other form of badge for display for the achievement, and other relevant information. The transfer of information may take various forms including an XML transmission. Such forms of communication connections with other services, and obtaining achievement information from those services, may continue until each of the services identified by the user has been checked for relevant information (as indicated by the \u201crepeat for all services\u201d arrow). For example, an aggregation service may first check the user's main social networking site, may then check a specialized site that tracks the user's physical fitness achievements, and may then check even more specialized sites such as professional licensing organizations.","At box , the aggregation service aggregates the achievement information that may have been obtained from the various separate and individual services that are run by different third parties. The aggregation may take a variety of forms, and certain example processes are shown here. For example, the process may group badges, so that badges of a particular type will be displayed near each other when a profile for the user is displayed. For example, badges relating to certain geographic locations may be grouped together, as may badges that represent a particular activity by a user (e.g., eating, sports, etc.).","Badges may also be combined. For example, if a user has the same badge from two different services, one of the badges may be removed, a badge that approximates the look of the two initial badges may be created, or a badge may be created that visually indicates that it is the result of two original badges, similar to the badge with the number 100 in .","As an additional aggregation step, certain of the badges may be re-sized and re-formatted. Such re-formatting may take the form of changing the sizes of badges, the shapes the badges (especially the peripheral shape), and otherwise affecting the way the badges will be displayed, so that badges that may have originated at different services may visually match each other so as to form a more pleasing visual representation of the badges in a display adjacent to each other. Finally, the badges may be sorted, so that, for example, badges that may be determined to be most important, may be displayed at the beginning of a list of badges. For example, badges that relate to professional achievements and other badges believed to be important to other users may be placed higher in a listing of badges that is to be shown to users.","At box , the aggregated group of badges is displayed on a user's profile page, either to the user, or to other users that may visit the profile page. The display may take a familiar form, such as by providing the badges as icons that are stacked above and next to each other in a rectangle, similar to the manner in which ribbons are positioned on the breast of the jacket of a member of the military. The display may occur on a profile page at the aggregator's domain, or at a domain of one of the organizations that provided badge information. For example, the user's main social networking site may show badges that the user earned there in addition to badges that the user earned from a wholly separate physical fitness site.","In this manner, the process may provide a convenient mechanism by which to combine information from various different social network sites and other sites so that a single user's achievements can be combined so that all of the individual achievements and accomplishments by the user can be readily appreciated. The combination of the achievements may be made relatively seamless visually by adjusting icons and other visual representations for each of the achievements, and displaying those adjusted icons in a consistent manner with each other. The display may be on a particular aggregated site or on each of the user's various sites, so that when a visitor brings up a personal page for the user, the visitor is shown a combination of achievement icons from various different services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","450","400","450"]},"Computing device  includes a processor , memory , a storage device , a high-speed interface  connecting to memory  and high-speed expansion ports , and a low speed interface  connecting to low speed bus  and storage device . Each of the components , , , , , and , are interconnected using various busses, and may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate. The processor  can process instructions for execution within the computing device , including instructions stored in the memory  or on the storage device  to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input\/output device, such as display  coupled to high speed interface . In other implementations, multiple processors and\/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices  may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system).","The memory  stores information within the computing device . In one implementation, the memory  is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, the memory  is a non-volatile memory unit or units. The memory  may also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk.","The storage device  is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device . In one implementation, the storage device  may be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product can be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product may also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above.
