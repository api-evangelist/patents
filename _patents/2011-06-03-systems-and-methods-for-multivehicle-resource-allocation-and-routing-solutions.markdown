title: Systems and methods for multi-vehicle resource allocation and routing solutions
abstract: A computer system for allocating and routing a plurality of servicing objects within a map of a region such that work load is balanced across the plurality of servicing objects is provided. The system formulates a model for allocating and routing the plurality of servicing objects in the region. The model comprises a distance matrix based upon a first plurality of segments or a second plurality of intersections in the map. The memory stores instructions for partitioning the map into a plurality of disjoint contiguous sub-regions in view of the distance matrix using an equitable convex region partition algorithm. The memory further stores instructions for calculating a corresponding tour graph for each sub-region in the plurality of sub-regions, where, for each respective sub-region in the plurality of sub-regions, a servicing object in the plurality of servicing objects is assigned to the tour graph that corresponds to the respective sub-region.

These systems and methods are specifically directed to the allocation and routing of vehicles within a region and are designed for balancing work load optimally across multiple vehicles and generating an optimal route for each vehicle. In addition, there is built-in flexibility that allows for multiple vehicles to be dispatched from multiple depots with different operational or performance metrics such as distributing tasks evenly across resources or minimizing total cost.","Two main applications are targeted by the present systems and methods: (i) all-street scanning and (ii) multi-location servicing.

There are many applications using a multi-location servicing model such as package delivery (UPS, FEDEX); other types of delivery services e.g. newspaper and service personnel dispatching. The multi-location servicing problem is what many fleet management companies face when trying to assign a task to individual delivery vehicle and providing each vehicle with an optimal route.

If the agent spends at least five minutes to figure out tours for client at least three times a days, then application of the systems and methods of the present disclosure translate to at least $200 equivalent of cost savings assuming a $40 per hour labor rate not to mention savings in fuel costs. In the case of a mail package distribution center, at least twenty minutes a day are spent figuring out tours mail delivery and ad hoc pick ups, then application of the systems and methods of the present disclosure provide the opportunity for real-time allocation of mail trucks and optimized zoning as well as substantial savings in fuel costs. In the case of a delivery truck, the systems and methods of the present disclosure allow for delivery efficiency depending on drivers' experience, optimized loading and unloading, shorter operation times and reduced fuel cost.","Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings.","The present disclosure details novel advances over known systems and methods for optimally allocating and routing servicing objects within a region such that work load is balanced optimally across multiple vehicles optimal routes are generated for each vehicle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","180","180"]},"The server  will typically have one or more processing units (CPU's) , a network or other communications interface , a memory , one or more magnetic disk storage and\/or persistent devices  optionally accessed by one or more controllers , one or more communication busses  for interconnecting the aforementioned components, and a power supply  for powering the aforementioned components.

The method details the steps taken by server  to address the all-street scanning problem in accordance with the present disclosure. In this method, using a map region  with defined street segments  and intersections , and available fleet resources (servicing objects) , an optimal vehicle allocation and route is found such that every street segment within the given map region  is visited at least once.","Step .","In step  a map  is obtained. In some embodiments, the map  contains defined street segments . In some embodiments the map contains defined intersections . In some embodiments, the map  contains both defined street segments  and defined intersections . An example of such a map is map  of . In some embodiments map  is a map of a city, county, town, village, state, country, the world, a continent, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, map  is a dataset. An example where map  is a dataset is given in the left hand side of  by a section of a segment list  and a section of an intersection list . The corresponding road segment for this segment list  and intersection list  is shown in the right hand side of .","Step .","In step , fleet resources  that may be devoted to the optimization problem are identified. Examples of fleet resource are application specific. Examples of fleet resources include a fleet of delivery vans, number of vehicles, number of salesmen, number of trains, and\/or number of airplanes. For instance, in the street scanning problem, the fleet resources  may comprise a number of vehicles equipped to take high resolution pictures. The present systems and methods impose no limitation on the number of vans, vehicles, salesmen, trains, airplanes, etc. (generically referred to as units) that may be considered. In some embodiments, there are more than two units, more than ten units, more than 100 units, more than 1000 units, between 2 and 20,000 units, less than 100 units available, to name a few exemplary ranges.","Step .","In step , the target function  to be minimized is identified. For example, in one embodiment, given the maximum number of vehicles (e.g., given fleet resources ) and hours available to work each day, the target function is to minimize the resources needed to finish the task of scanning each road in map . In another exemplary embodiment, given the number of days to finish the task for the given region, the objective function is to minimize the number of vehicles needed. Thus, depending on the target function , it is not necessarily the case that all fleet resources are utilized. Thus, for example, in some embodiments, there may be any number of vehicles available for the task (e.g., the number of vehicles is not posed as the rate limiting factor) but the amount of time that is available is limited. In such embodiments, the target function  can be posited as, given the maximum number of vehicles and hours available to work each day, minimize the resources needed to finish the task for the given map .","Step .","In step , the appropriate data model for solving the target function is formulated. As detailed in further steps below, the methodology for vehicle allocation and routing optimization consists of two main components: the region partition planner (RPP) module  and the route optimization planner (ROP) module . In some embodiments, RPP module  utilizes a novel equitable convex region partition (ECRP) algorithm to subdivide a given map  into disjoint contiguous sub-regions  (based on given metrics such as total amount of roadway or any other given density function), and assign vehicles from fleet resources  to corresponding sub-regions . ROP module  is an innovative optimization tool that optionally utilizes a turning cost minimization (TCM) constraint  to generate an optimal tour graph (route)  for each vehicle within its assigned sub-region . An immediate benefit is a reduction in vehicle overhead (driving same segment of road multiple times).","The street scanning problem can be formulated as a Chinese postman problem (CPP), where a vehicle traverses each road in a network at least once, minimizing total distance traveled. It can also be modeled as a travelling salesman's problem (TSP), where each road is modeled as a node in a network graph and a vehicle traverses each node in a network at least once. The all street scanning problem is complicated by the presence of multiple vehicles with given starting points. In some embodiments, additional costs, such as intersection metrics, are considered.","Intersection Only Model (CPP).","The road segment in the right hand side of  can be modeled as an intersection only CPP model. In such embodiments, nodes in the model include only intersection nodes . Intersection node's coordinates are taken from the last waypoint of its incoming segment. A distance matrix is calculated from the waypoints of the segment to directly connecting two intersection nodes. In such an approach, a distance matrix is utilized by the routing algorithm to represent the portion of the region given by the example in . This distance matrix is illustrated in . After the given area is properly modeled by the CPP model, the RPP module  and the ROP module  solve the multi-vehicle routing problem in two stages: partitioning and route generation.","Segment Plus Intersection Model (TSP or CPP).","Referring to , in some embodiments, the data model is a segment plus intersection model. Nodes in the model include both segment nodes  and intersection nodes . The intersection node's coordinates are taken from the last waypoint of its incoming segment. Segment node's coordinates are taken from the mid waypoint among all its waypoints. A distance matrix is calculated from the waypoints of the segment from an intersection node to a segment node, or from a segment node to an intersection node if there are directly connected.","Segment Only Model (TSP).","Referring to , in some embodiments, the data model is a segment only model. In such embodiments, nodes in the model include only segment nodes . Segment node's coordinates are taken from the first waypoint among all its waypoints. A distance matrix is calculated from the waypoints of the segment to directly connected segment nodes.","Step .","In step  the map  is partitioned. As a pre-processing stage, the RPP module  first divides the map  into a collection of smaller sub-regions . In some exemplary embodiments, the map  is divided by RPP module  into two or more sub-regions , three or more sub-regions , five or more sub-regions , between two and one hundred sub-regions , or less than 20 sub-regions. In order to balance the loads of all vehicles, all sub-regions  preferably contain equal amounts of total road length; that is, the total lengths of all roads in each sub-region are preferably equal. When vehicles originate from various depots distributed in the network, the RPP module  forces each sub-region  to contain a depot. When no vehicle depot is given, the RPP module  instead minimizes the maximum diameter of each sub-region , e.g. the maximum distance between two points in that sub-region.","The partitioning stage involves finding a \u201cregular\u201d partition of a service region that optimizes some heuristic objective, or satisfies some other constraints, e.g.","equal area, equal distance traversed (same road length)","equal area, must contain a depot","equal distance traversed, must contain a depot","minimize total distance traversed","minimize maximum distance traversed","minimize number of vehicle days","The given region can be any given area that can be confined by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":["any administrative region specified by the user, such as Santa Clara region map","any region specified by an given polygon."]}}}},"Suppose for example that there are n vehicles servicing customers in the area define by map  and that this area is a convex region C. Suppose further that the vehicles start at a set of depots P. In one application of the systems and methods of the present application, what is desired is to route the vehicles such that all customers are visited while minimizing the time until the last vehicle returns to its depot. In this example, resources are allocated to clients in a load-balanced manner. Each vehicle is allocated to the customers it will service. The routing of each vehicle from its depot, to its allocated customers, and then back to the depot in the shortest time is a traveling salesman problem. Since what is sought is to minimize the maximum travel time, it is expected that the travel times of the vehicles will be roughly equal in an optimal solution. One heuristic is to find an equitable partition of C and P (one which partitions C into n sub-regions  of equal area each containing one point of P). Then all customers in one part of C are assigned to the vehicle starting at the depot in that part. This heuristic is asymptotically optimal when the assumption is made that there are many customers and that their locations are independent and identically uniformly distributed in C. This is because the following theorem shows that the length of each vehicle's route is asymptotically proportional to the square root of the area of the region it services and because the equitable partition splits C into regions of equal area. Theorem: suppose that p is a point in convex set R and that X's are random points independent and identically uniformly distributed in R. Then the length TSP(p,X, . . . , X) of the optimal traveling salesman tour traversing points p and X, . . . , Xsatisfies\n\nTSP()\u2192\u03b1\u221a{square root over (\u03bb())},\n\nAs k\u2192\u221e, where \u03b1 is some constant and \u03bb(R) denotes the area of region R. See, Beardwood et al., 1959. Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 55, 299-327, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in it entirety.\n","Using a convex equitable-partition might have some further benefits. For instance, it is expected that odd-shaped regions may take longer to service than more compact regions with the same area. Convex regions also ensure that a vehicle's traveling-salesman tour remains in its service region and may be a robust way to handle some small uncertainty in the customers' exact locations.","Suppose that, instead of using traveling salesman tours to service the clients, it is desired to connect each of the clients using spanning (or Steiner) trees to some point in P so as to minimize the size of the largest tree. The theorem above holds not only for traveling salesman tours but also for minimum spanning trees and Steiner trees (but with different values of \u03b1). See, Beardwood et al., 1959. Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 55, 299-327 and Steele, 1988, Annals of Probability 16, 1767-1787, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in it entirety. Hence asymptotically in the case of many clients, the optimal solution partitions C into pieces of equal area each containing one point in P (as in the above case for vehicle routing).","The reason for imposing the criterion that partitions be equal is derived the combinatorial result that specifies that the lengths of many combinatorial structures (such as TSP, Voronoi Graph, Nearest Neighbor graph) in a service region with uniformly distributed points depends only on the area of the region and the number of points in the region, asymptotically speaking:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0078"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mrow":[{"mi":["lim","L"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mi":["n","\u221e"],"mo":"\u2192"}]},"mo":"\/","msqrt":{"mi":"n"}},{"mi":["A","\u03b1"],"mo":"\u00b7"}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"b":"44"},"Step .","Given the sub-regions  of step , in step  the ROP module  plans an optimum tour graph (route)  for each sub-region . This is a combinatorial optimization problem known as the Chinese postman problem (CPP). One embodiment of the present disclosure provides a customized algorithm that solves the CPP, while minimizing the number of left and U-turns that vehicles take. In considering turning costs, the input that is considered is a directed network in which the assumption is made that incoming degree equals outgoing degree for all intersections and that sibling edges have an associated \u201cturning cost\u201d. Given this input, the goal is to obtain a tour of the graph that visits every edge and minimizes turning cost. This is an NP-hard problem. Here, turning cost is the time it takes to move from the end of one segment to the start of another segment.","In some embodiments, the metrics at intersections that are considered are the choices of turning right, going straight, turning left and U-turn.

A metric table can be generated to list the metrics for each scenario.

For instance, in some embodiments directional scanning can be done. A given road network may consist of both one-way and two-way streets. In addition, narrow two-way streets may be traversed only once, while large two-way streets may require traversal in both directions. In such embodiments, this is addressed by using an implementation of the mixed postman algorithm to find vehicle routes in such road networks.","In some embodiments, priority scanning is done. Rather than requiring that all streets in a city be traversed, a client may only require that a subset of streets be visited. In such embodiments, an implementation of the rural postman algorithm is used to find vehicle routes in such a setting.","In some embodiments, scanning of one or more specified lanes on a given segment when there are multiple lanes in that segment is done.","In some embodiments, speed limits are considered. In such embodiments, a list of speed limits is taken as input on each road in a network. This is necessary information when the goal is to minimize the time to completion of all vehicle tours, since roads of the same length may require different amounts of time to traverse. Vehicles may also have a maximum speed limit when performing a scan.","In some embodiments, special parsers have been developed to extract given map raw data into SEGMENT LIST and INTERSECTION LIST DATA, for example the TIGER raw map data and NAVSTREET raw map data. In the case of NAVSTREET map data, a parser has been developed to extract into SEGMENT LIST, INTERSECTION LIST, and associated attributes DATA as input to our optimization route planner.","The RPP module  can integrate into mapping products to effectively partition (assign) tasks to resources (vehicles) in order to balance work load and provide resource planning and management. In addition, the ROP module  can reduce operational cost by reducing driving overhead and by minimizing turning costs. In certain applications, as illustrated in , the partition and route planning for each individual sub-region can be processed at a central server  utilizing distributed computing, and the routes can be pushed to each end device . This increases the speed of optimal route generation and reduces the computational need for a local device, therefore improving significantly the overall system computational performance. In certain applications, the partition and route planning offer can be implemented and hosted on a cloud server, such as Amazon cloud. The route and planning offer is also offered as a webservice that applies to any companies that would like to integrated route optimization solution into their applications. The web services can be consumed in via standard Soap 1.2 protocol web service requests, or RESTFUL services. For example, for the multi-location servicing application, the web-service method takes either a list of strings that specify lat\/long pairs or specific street addresses and return an ordered list of destinations for optimized routing.","Turning to , a street scanning example using real data is presented.  shows a map of Santa Clara, Calif. after partitioning in accordance with the systems and methods of the present disclosure. A fleet of six vehicles is allocated to cover all street segments, and thus six equal partitions are identified.  then illustrates how a route is then drawn in accordance with the systems and methods of the present application.  shows that the maximum path length among all six vehicles is minimized to achieve a balanced workload. In addition, the total number of roads that are covered more than once is only around four percent in this example.

In other words, for a map  with defined street segments  and intersections , and available fleet resources , the optimal vehicle allocation and route is found such that every given location that needs to be serviced is visited at least once in such embodiments. Objectives can be given multiple ways, for example:\n\n","In some embodiments, enhanced services incorporate other distance measures between destinations. For example, in some embodiments, a variable distance matrix\u2014that is, the distance between two destinations can be measured in an arbitrary way, is used. For example, in one embodiment, the actual traveling distance (as induced by a road network) between two destinations, is used rather than the \u201cas the crow flies\u201d approximation from a basic service. In some embodiments the travel time required to visit all destinations is minimized. In a heavily congested network, this may be different from the route minimizing the total distance. In yet another embodiment, the total fuel expenditure on a route is minimized by measuring the distance between two destinations as the average amount of fuel required to travel between those destinations. Information needed to derive such quantities for United States based routes can be obtained from the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) fuel economy profiles.","In some embodiments, a custom modification of the Lin-Kernighan algorithm is used to solve problems in which destinations are also constrained by time in some way. In particular, clients may require some amount of service time to be performed at their destination. Constraints that vehicles are only allowed to visit destinations during a specified time window may also be imposed. These constraints can be enforced by taking advantage of the iterative property of the Lin-Kernighan algorithm: that is, the Lin-Kernighan algorithm builds a route by sequentially performing small modifications to a given route. Thus, provided the constraints are enforced at each iteration, it can be guaranteed that the final route must also obey these constraints. Such constraints are additionally enforced in some embodiments by imposing a penalty parameter on routes in which large amounts of time are wasted. This occurs when a vehicle arrives at a destination before the beginning of that destination's time window, and thus the vehicle must sit idly until the time window begins.","In some embodiments, a custom modification of the Chinese Postman Problem, the so called Rural Postman Problem, is addressed. The Rural Postman Problem is an extension of the Chinese Postman Problem. For a rural postman problem, only a subset of the edges from a given graph is required to be traversed at least once. So, the objective is to cover all the edges inside this subset at least once while utilizing the whole given graph minimizing cost of a given metric. This problem is particularly useful in practical applications of solving the Street Scanning problem because it can be used for route planning when the following situations occur:\n\n","The rural postman problem consists of finding a minimum-cost path for a vehicle that traverses the links in a given subset of all the road links in a network. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, this problem is addressed using a four-stage process:","1) Condense the road network by replacing all non-required links with the shortest path between two required nodes. Thus, each link is either a required link, or adjacent to a required link.","2) Form a minimum spanning tree that connects all of the required nodes together, using non-required links.","3) Perform a local search heuristic on the minimum spanning tree from step (2) to give all nodes the same incoming and outgoing degree, by solving a sequence of minimum-cost flow problems. After completing this stage, all nodes have the same incoming and outgoing degree; some nodes may additionally have undirected edges incident to them as well.","4) Make a non-bipartite matching between all edges having an odd number of undirected edges incident to them, where the weight between two nodes is equal to the cost of the shortest path between the two.","Step 4 outputs an eulerian graph that contains all of the required links, and we can now proceed with the problem as if it were a conventional multi-vehicle Chinese Postman Problem.","Optimization Parameters.","In some embodiments, optimization parameters are considered in developing routes. Such parameters include, but are not limited to, any combination of (i) road data (e.g., static data such proximity\/real driving distances, or real time traffic updates), (ii) location (e.g., servicing time windows, servicing time duration, service types, task priority), (iii) resource constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity, types, availability, driver skills, availability, (iv) road limitations (e.g., for truck operations) such as speed, weight, and\/or height, (v) road segment functional class range, or any attributes that are associated to segments and or intersection data.","Truck Routing.","Some embodiments of the present disclosure support the use of GIS shapefile data to devise routes that are feasible for large vehicles. For example, a loaded truck may exceed the weight limit on a bridge or the height threshold at an overpass. A truck carrying pressurized contents may have a limit on the maximum altitude at which it can travel. In such embodiments, the systems and methods of the present disclosure are able to take such factors into account by performing modifications to the road network, such as removing forbidden road links.","Variable Resolution Scanning.","In some embodiments, there is a need for portions of a map  to be scanned at high resolution and for portions of the map  to scanned at low resolution using fleet resources  that comprises both high resolution and low resolution vehicles. The systems and methods of the present disclosure contemplate at least two embodiments for addressing such a situation.","In option one the areas for high and low resolution scanning are covered by using high resolution vehicles in the fleet resources  to cover as much as they can and then use to up the rest of the vehicles. In this option, the problem is posed as a two stage problems. The first stage is to have the high end vehicles cover all the high resolution segments as much as they can and, if they are still available, they can cover then low resolution segments. The second stage involves using the rest of the vehicles in the fleet resources (e.g., the low resolution vehicles) for the remaining segments.","In option two, only the high resolution vehicles are used to cover high resolution segments of the map . In this option, the problem is also separated into two problems: one for the high resolution vehicles and the other for the rest of the vehicles (e.g., the low resolution vehicles in the fleet resources  to cover the low resolution segments. In this second option, the planning can be done in parallel using the methods disclosed herein.","Replanning.","The systems and methods of the present disclosure support high level daily planning. For example, daily replanning of the assignment of the vehicles and their routes according to sentimental factors (weather change, activity blockage, road constructions, etc.) can be done. Furthermore, real-time re-route planning is support. This arises for instance when a driver has made a wrong turn. This real-time replanning tool is also able to correct for false route information (e.g., if the route was determined with the assumption that a certain segment is available, but in real situation that segment is blocked). The replanning tool can be equipped with a simple interface for the driver to inform the replanner to incorporate this updated information for the replanning.","Incomplete Scans.","In some embodiments, the systems and methods of the present disclosure will compute solutions for scanning 100% of the roads in the map . More typically, the systems and methods of the present disclosure will compute solutions that scan less than 100% of the roads in the map . In such embodiments a cost versus benefit analysis is done which declares completion when the cost of scanning the rest of the segments is \u2018higher\u2019 than the benefit.","All references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","The present invention can be implemented as a computer program product that comprises a computer program mechanism embedded in a computer readable storage medium.
