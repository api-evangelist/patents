{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments generally relate to data translation applications, and in particular to an apparatus, system and method of translating structured or semi-structured data.","Automatic machine translation engines may be designed for general purpose translation of whole sentences, making use of linguistic context to perform translations. Examples of such applications include Systran\u00ae, Language Weaver\u00ae, Apptek\u00ae, LogoMedia\/LEC\u00ae, and Google Translate\u00ae. However, with respect to structured data found in databases and spreadsheets, or semi-structured data that is extracted from full text via an information extraction engine, frequent translation errors occur due to a lack of knowledge of a category for noun phrases (\u201cNPs\u201d) for the structured or semi-structured information. For example, the Russian names \u201cSergey Lozhechko\u201d and \u201cShedrov Aleksandr\u201d should be left alone, or transliterated. Transliteration involves changing characters of one language into corresponding characters of another language. For instance, the Greek \u201cX\u201d may be transliterated into English as \u201cch\u201d. However, these names could instead be literally translated as \u201cSergey spoon\u201d and \u201cgenerous Alexander\u201d, respectively, without an understanding by the system that it is dealing with names of people. Similarly, the Russian word \u201c\u201d means \u201cstreet\u201d in the context of an address, but means \u201cbrochure\u201d or \u201cprospectus\u201d in the context of a document type. Such errors due to a lack of linguistic or natural language context that is present in higher level units of linguistic analysis, such as sentences, paragraphs and full text documents, may render conventional automatic machine translation engines inaccurate for translating noun phrases in structured or semi-structured data.","In an embodiment, an apparatus includes a processor and a memory. The processor is configured to determine a category for a group of isolated noun phrases in a structured or semi-structured data source stored in the memory. The group of isolated noun phrases includes one or more isolated noun phrases. The processor is also configured to translate the group of isolated noun phrases from a source language to a target language using a category-driven isolated noun phrase translation. The determination of the category and the category-driven isolated noun phrase translation are performed based on context derived from the group of isolated noun phrases.","In another embodiment, a method for performing automatic machine translation of isolated short and proper noun phrases includes determining a category for a group of isolated noun phrases in a data source. The group of isolated noun phrases includes one or more isolated noun phrases. The method also includes translating the group of isolated noun phrases from a source language to a target language using a category-driven isolated noun phrase translation. The determination of the category and the category-driven isolated noun phrase translation are performed based on context derived from the group of isolated noun phrases.","Some embodiments include an apparatus, a system, and an automatic machine translation (\u201cMT\u201d) method for performing automatic MT of isolated short and proper noun phrases. Some embodiments also include a system for translating structured and semi-structured data using the automatic MT method. Under one definition, a noun phrase is a single noun, pronoun or adjective, or a group of words containing at least one noun, pronoun or adjective (and no verb) that function together as a noun, pronoun or adjective. The group of words that function together as a noun, pronoun or adjective may include parts-of-speech such as nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners and conjunctions, but no verbs. For example, all of the following are noun phrases for the purposes of ASSETS: \u201cboy\u201d, \u201cthe boy\u201d, \u201cthe small boy\u201d, \u201cthe small boy in the garden\u201d, \u201cthe small boy in the garden with the ice cream\u201d, \u201csmall\u201d, \u201cvery small\u201d and \u201cXL\u201d. The precise labels for the parts-of-speech depend on the syntactic model used to describe a language. For example, the part-of-speech called \u201cdeterminer\u201d can be further sub-classified as articles, demonstratives, possessive pronouns, quantifiers, etc. Nonetheless, a person of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate the intent of this definition of noun phrase based on the discussion and labels provided herein. The automatic machine translation system, and the functionality employed by the system, may be called the Automatic Semi-Structured Entity Translation System (\u201cASSETS\u201d). Isolated noun phrases may be found naturally in structured data sources, such as spreadsheets and databases, or the isolated noun phrases may be contained in semi-structured data produced through preprocesses, such as information extraction from full text or noun phrase chunking. While \u201ccolumns\u201d are discussed herein, the term extends to any set of grouped data including data obtained from semi-structured lists. Dividing sentences into non-overlapping phrases is called text chunking and noun phrase chunking deals with a part of this task that involves recognizing the chunks that consist of noun phrases.","The translation strategies employed by ASSETS may use category labels in one or more ways. Some include a lexicon-based lexical transfer mechanism that selects target language translations based on a preference for translations that are pre-associated with a semantic category in the system's lexicon. A lexicon of a language is its vocabulary, including words and expressions. An advanced translation strategy used by the ASSETS functionality in some embodiments employs category-specific shallow transfer rules to produce a graph of possible translations combined with statistical language models specific to each category to enhance translation sense selection and word ordering.","Some embodiments of ASSETS provide translation capabilities for data that is naturally structured by virtue of occurring in lists or in rows and columns, such as data that is found in spreadsheets or in tables of a database. ASSETS can also be used to process data that is semi-structured in the sense that the data originally occurred in full text, but was extracted and possibly categorized by information extraction technology. An example of category-specific knowledge enabling the selection of an appropriate translation strategy is for names of people, which normally should not be translated but instead either left alone, transliterated or translated using name-only translation senses. For example, the Russian name   should be transliterated as \u201cSergey Lozhechko\u201d and not translated as \u201cSergey spoon\u201d, as mentioned above. Likewise,   should be transliterated as \u201cShedrov Aleksandr\u201d or translated as \u201cShedrov Alexander\u201d rather than translated as \u201cGenerous Alexander\u201d. Also included are category-appropriate translations of abbreviations such as \u201cnp.\u201d, which expands to  (street) in addresses or to  in medical terminology as in (thymol test) or to  (other) in \u201c np.\u201d (etc.). Further, translation sense selection is affected by the semantic category of a noun phrase. For example, per the above, the Russian word  means \u201cstreet\u201d in the context of a list of addresses, but it means \u201cbrochure or prospectus\u201d in the context of a list of document types.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","110","105","110","100","115","110","115","100","120","100"]},"Computer readable media may be any available media that can be accessed by processor  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media, and communication media. Communication media may include computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media.","Processor  is further coupled via bus  to a display , such as a Liquid Crystal Display (\u201cLCD\u201d), for displaying information to a user, such as server status information. A keyboard  and a cursor control device , such as a computer mouse, are further coupled to bus  to enable a user to interface with ASSETS server .","In one embodiment, memory  stores software modules that provide functionality when executed by processor . The modules include an operating system  that provides operating system functionality for ASSETS server . The modules further include ASSETS functionality  that is configured to perform structured data translation. ASSETS server  can be part of a larger system such as a cluster computing system, a distributed computing system, a cloud computing system, a \u201cserver farm\u201d or any other system having multiple servers and\/or computing devices. ASSETS server  will typically include one or more additional functional modules  to include additional functionality. In some embodiments, ASSETS functionality  may be part of operating system  or part of one or more other functional modules included in other functional modules .","It should be noted that many of the functional features described in this specification have been presented as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom very large scale integration (\u201cVLSI\u201d) circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.","Modules may also be at least partially implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified unit of executable code in a software module may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations that, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module. Modules may be stored on a computer-readable medium, which may be, for instance, a hard disk drive, a flash device, random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d), a tape drive, an optical drive, a compact disk having read-only memory (\u201cCD-ROM\u201d) or a digital video disk having read-only memory (\u201cDVD-ROM\u201d), or any other such medium used to store data. The medium may be read-only or read\/write. The modules may also be stored on multiple media either residing on the same hardware device or distributed across multiple hardware devices.","Indeed, a unit of executable code could be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices, and may exist, at least partially, merely as electronic signals on a system or network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","100","145"]},"The functional modules of ASSETS server  include a tokenizer module , a morphological analyzer module  (which may include or be replaced by a part of a speech tagging module), a Comma Separated Value (\u201cCSV\u201d) translator module , a transliterator module , a dictionary module , a TM module , a categorizer module  and a translator module . Tokenizer module  divides a source language string into tokens when tokens are not provided to the system. Tokens represent word-like units that may be looked up in dictionary module  or translation memory module  and, thus, be associated with a set of grammatical and semantic features. Tokenizer module  generates information about the tokens it produces, including properties such as the data type and the capitalization.","Morphological analyzer module  may perform operations including lemmatization to find the citation form of each token along with dictionary and TM lookup by dictionary module  and TM module , respectively, to retrieve all information associated with the citation form, and to perform affix analysis for the purpose of determining grammatical characteristics marked by inflectional affixes. Lemmatization is the process of determining the \u201clemma\u201d of a word. A lemma is the form of the word used as the headword or citation form in a dictionary, glossary, or index. For example, \u201chide\u201d is the lemmatized form for \u201chides\u201d, \u201chiding\u201d and \u201chidden\u201d. Lemmatization functionally allows the different inflected forms of a word to be grouped so they can be analyzed as a single item.","CSV translator module  parses comma separated data to retrieve the structured data stored therein. While shown here as a CSV translator, in some embodiments, one or more other characters may be used to separate data by CSV translator . In some embodiments, CSV translator  may be denoted as a \u201cdelimited data translator\u201d since what the delimiter characters are and whether the file is actually a \u201cphysical\u201d file are matters of design choice. For example, the data structure provided to ASSETS could be a \u201cvirtual\u201d table resulting from a select statement from a database or from some other component that has read in data from an unknown spreadsheet format. Transliterator module  uses a specified transliteration standard to convert the writing system of a source language into that of a target language, and is used by various features to replace some or all of the source language string with target language characters. For example, in some embodiments, transliterator module  may be used to replace indicated portions of a TM entry with appropriate transliterations. Transliterator module  may also be used to replace unknown source language words with similar sounding representations in the target language, and\/or to convert an entire source cell into a target language spelling. Dictionary module  contains associations of tokens with a set of grammatical and semantic features. TM module  contains lists of pre-identified translation pairs whose associations may be restricted by category. Categorizer module  may be configured to automatically identify the most likely category of a list of data. Translator module  uses the ASSETS category-driven isolated noun phrase translation feature to translate data cells from the source language to the target language.","Information for the functional modules of ASSETS server  may be retrieved from the various databases (\u201cDB\u201ds) depicted in . These databases may either be located in the same physical storage device or distributed across two or more storage devices. The entirety of a single database is not necessarily stored on a single storage device. In , tokenizer module  uses tokenization rules DB , morphological analyzer module  uses morphological rules DB , transliterator module  uses transliteration rules DB , dictionary module  uses dictionaries DB , TM module  uses TM tables DB , categorizer module  uses categorization models DB  and translator module  uses translation rules and models DB , respectively. Configuration parameters DB  contains shared parameters that may be used by all modules. Statistical language translation and models DB  may be used in performing noun phrase translation by a statistical engine or by a word sense selection feature that uses statistical knowledge, such as statistical engine  or category driven word sense selector , respectively, both illustrated in .","Various client applications may access the functionality of ASSETS server . A client computer  accesses ASSETS server  directly using a local client application . Another client computer  accesses ASSETS server  via a Java Remote Method Invocation (\u201cRMI\u201d) client application  by way of RMI server . Yet another client computer  accesses ASSETS server  via a web client application  by way of Simple Object Access Protocol (\u201cSOAP\u201d) server . While RMI and SOAP are discussed herein, other distributed and remote technologies may be used at the implementer's discretion.","The ASSETS system may be configured with various parameters allowing user control over the interpretation of the document, the behavior of categorizer module , transliterator module  and the translation features. The parameters available for controlling the system in some embodiments are listed in Table 1 below and explained in more detail in the sections pertaining to the affected component.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ASSETS SYSTEM PARAMETERS"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Component(s)"]},{"entry":["Parameter","Data Type","Default","Explanation","Affected"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Categorize by","Boolean","False","Determine whether to","Categorizer Module"]},{"entry":["Sample?",{},{},"select a subset of each"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"column (list) to use in"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"determining the category"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"of a column"]},{"entry":["Sampling","Constant","FULL","{FULL, EVERY_Nth)","Categorizer Module"]},{"entry":"Strategy"},{"entry":["Use Column","Boolean","True","Indicate whether an","Categorizer Module"]},{"entry":["Headers for",{},{},"ontological classification"]},{"entry":["Categorization?",{},{},"of the column header"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"should be included in the"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"determination of a"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"column's category"]},{"entry":["Verify Cell","Boolean","False","Indicate whether an","Translator Module"]},{"entry":["Categories?",{},{},"individual cell's category"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"should be rechecked and"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"used for determining"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"translation behavior"]},{"entry":["Apply TM to Sub-","Boolean","True","Indicate whether entries","Translator Module"]},{"entry":["Cell Data",{},{},"in the translation memory"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"should be applied to sub-"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"cell tokens"]},{"entry":["Use Inexact TM","Boolean","True","Indicate whether inexact","TM Module"]},{"entry":["Matching",{},{},"matching should be used"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"to retrieve items from the"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"TM"]},{"entry":["Inexact TM","One from a list","System","Select the inexact match","TM Module"]},{"entry":["Matching","of schemes","default per","strategy from a library of"]},{"entry":["Strategy","supported by","language","inexact matching"]},{"entry":[{},"the engine",{},"algorithms"]},{"entry":["Transliteration","One from a list","System","Select the standard to be","Transliterator Module"]},{"entry":["Scheme","of schemes","default per","applied for transliteration"]},{"entry":[{},"supported by","language"]},{"entry":[{},"the engine"]},{"entry":["Encoding of Input","String","UTF-8","Specify the character","Data Loader"]},{"entry":["Data",{},{},"encoding of the"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"document to be"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"processed.

If the system is configured to categorize by sample rather than using the entire contents of a column, a sample selector  gathers a set of column samples for use by ASSETS column categorization . The option to categorize by sample rather than using the entire contents of a column is an efficiency measure that is designed to increase the speed with which a document can be loaded. Categorization by sampling may be performed, for instance, for large documents. The final task of data loader  is to determine whether column headers are to be used for categorization at . If yes, a header selector  isolates column headers to be factored into the column categorization. The process then proceeds to ASSETS column categorization .","After data loader  has loaded the data, ASSETS column categorization  identifies the category of each column to be translated. Users may specify some or all of the column categories, or may allow ASSETS column categorization  to automatically determine the most likely category of each column. Once the category of each column to be translated is identified, the individual cells along with the column category and any relevant parameter values are passed along by ASSETS. If cells require translation at , the data is passed to ASSETS category-driven isolated noun phrase translation  to translate data cells from the source language to the target language. Once cells no longer require translation, the process ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":"340"},"The process starts at  with a column or list of noun phrases  being provided. Per the above, one method of obtaining a column categorization is for a user who understands the source language to select a category for each column from among the column types available in the ASSETS category ontology. The precise contents of knowledge bases such as the category ontology, lexicons, transliteration, and translation rules may be subject to change and may differ by language. If a user has specified a category at , the category is known to the system and the process ends at .","However, if a user, such as a human using a GUI or a program that uses an Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) to configure the system (either setting the category through the API parameters or configuring it to automatically detect the category), does not specify a category for a column of data, the system attempts to categorize the column automatically. While cells remain to be categorized at , ASSETS column categorizer  (illustrated in ) creates a composite score for each category by combining results obtained for individual cells from Noun Phrase Categorization at . The score is created for a subset of the column's data if the system is configured to use column sampling, or from every cell in the column otherwise. ASSETS column categorizer  itself may use every cell provided to it to perform the categorization. Once there are no cells remaining to categorize at , cell category score combiner  combines the scores. If the system is not set to use a threshold at , where the top ranking score for a column should exceed the second highest score by a margin defined either through system default values or specified by the user, the system proceeds to select the top hypothesis at . If the system is set to use a threshold at  and the top ranking score passes this threshold at , the associated category is selected as the column category based on the top hypothesis at  and the process ends at .","If the threshold is not passed at , additional features of the column are considered in the reclassification. Column-level distributional feature extractors are employed to extract distributional features pertaining to the whole column at  and are incorporated into the classification results. In another embodiment, the column level features and the header features are incorporated in the same Bayesian model as the cell level features, which may be toggled on or off by configuration parameters. Distributional features may include observable statistics such as the number of unique cell values in the column, the number of unique tokens in the column, the frequency curve of the tokens in the column, and the like. After passing through column-level distributional feature extractors at , the data passes through a Bayesian classifier  that is trained to associate feature values with categories defined in the ASSETS category ontology. Bayesian classifier  uses distributional models stored in distributional models DB .","If no column headers are available, the process proceeds to category combination analyzer . If the system or a user has made column headers available at , the column headers are passed to column header classifier  and considered. The column headers are passed to a cross language header ontology component  that is configured to classify column headers according to the ASSETS cross-language header ontology. The header ontology in some embodiments is a two level classification system associating header strings with category labels. Strings of any language may be listed under any given category. If a header is not found within the header ontology, an attempt may be made to use a general English semantic ontology to locate the header classification. This is accomplished via the translation senses of each source token.","If a header is found at  using the header ontology at , the process proceeds to category combination analyzer . If not, the process proceeds to a general semantic ontology reasoner  that is configured with a parameter that determines the direction in which the tokens should be examined, i.e. left-to-right or right-to-left. This setting should generally be derived from the headedness of noun phrases in the source language. In other words, if the source language reads from left-to-right and is a head-first language, the tokens should be scanned from left-to-right. If the source language reads from left-to-right and the source language is a head-last language, the tokens are likely to be scanned from right-to-left. Languages that are read from right-to-left are also accommodated by this approach. This parameter allows languages with different characteristics to be effectively handled by the header classification component.","For each token, translation senses are looked up one-by-one in the general semantic ontology for the target language. The ontology is queried for synonyms of the translation sense under consideration. Each synonym obtained in this way is then looked up in the ASSETS cross-language header ontology. If a synonym is found, its associated category is returned and the process proceeds to category combination analyzer . If no synonym is found, the next token is examined. The first token found using this cross-language reverse-lookup technique may be used to determine the category of the header. If no synonyms are found, the ontology is queried to obtain hypernyms of the source token's translation senses, which are then looked up in the header ontology. A hypernym is a word that is more generic than the source word. This process continues until a header category is selected or until the maximum node traversal limit is reached or all tokens in the cell have been examined. The maximum node traversal limit may be another parameter of general semantic ontology reasoner . Once the process has proceeded to category combination analyzer , this component uses the data available from the previous components, including one or more of cell category score combiner , Bayesian classifier  and column header classifier . Category combination analyzer  then makes a determination as to the category that should be used.","In some embodiments, category combination analyzer  uses various techniques for producing the final decision about the category rankings. A decision tree is used to determine which technique is employed. If headers are not used, then the results produced by noun phrase categorization  and Bayesian classifier  are combined mathematically to re-rank the categories. If headers are available, the decision tree determines whether header classifications are configured to override statistical classifications for direct matches in the header ontology. If so, the header category is used directly. If not, the header category produced by column header classifier  is used to decide among the top choices when the category matches one of the top N categories, where N is an integer and inclusion in the top N categories is determined by being within the threshold relative to the top hypothesis.","Some embodiments of the ASSETS noun phrase categorization, like other ASSETS operations, are language-independent but configurable for specific languages using parameter settings and externally defined knowledge sources. The noun phrase categorization may use feature extraction and machine learning based on Bayesian statistics to automatically determine the category of a single cell or isolated noun phrase. A Bayesian classifier (such as Bayesian classifier  of ) may be trained to associate feature values with categories defined in the ASSETS category ontology. The types of features used for categorization may include data type characteristics, morpho-syntactic information, semantic categories and features, local distributional statistics and pattern-based features. The specific set of features used may vary according to the parameter settings for the language being processed. Each language may be configured to use a different subset of the ASSETS category ontology and possibly a different subset of the ASSETS feature extractors.","Feature extractors are specialized components that look for specific characteristics of the entire noun phrase string or of individual tokens of the string. Each feature extractor is designed to identify a specific type of characteristic. For example, one feature extractor may be specialized to examine the parts-of-speech of the NP's tokens, another to calculate the ratio of numbers to characters, another to examine the semantic category labels associated with each token, and another to look for externally defined pattern matches. The ASSETS noun phrase categorization (such as noun phrase categorization  of  and the process for noun phrase categorization illustrated in ) introduces the notion of feature extraction strategies. Each feature extractor uses one strategy selected from a library of feature extraction strategies along with a set of language-specific knowledge base resources, such as lexica and pattern descriptions. Some feature extraction strategies that may be used for NP categorization are described in Table 2 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"FEATURE EXTRACTION STRATEGIES"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Feature extraction",{},{}]},{"entry":["strategy","Description","Example"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Distributional, tokens","Calculate the","The number of numeric tokens"]},{"entry":[{},"proportion of tokens","compared to the total number of"]},{"entry":[{},"containing a specific","tokens"]},{"entry":[{},"attribute or attribute"]},{"entry":[{},"value relative to the"]},{"entry":[{},"total number of tokens"]},{"entry":["Distributional, string","Calculate the","The number of \u201cdigits\u201d or \u201cnumeric"]},{"entry":[{},"proportion of","characters\u201d compared to the total"]},{"entry":[{},"characters in a string","number of characters"]},{"entry":[{},"that meet a specific"]},{"entry":[{},"criterion"]},{"entry":["Property-based,","Check for the","Do any of the tokens have the OrgTerm"]},{"entry":["tokens","existence of one or","property?"]},{"entry":[{},"more tokens that have"]},{"entry":[{},"a certain property."]},{"entry":[{},"Properties can be"]},{"entry":[{},"part-of-speech labels,"]},{"entry":[{},"semantic features or"]},{"entry":[{},"category labels, token"]},{"entry":[{},"type labels, etc."]},{"entry":["Pattern-based, string","Determine whether",".*?\\@.*(COM|EDU|ORG)"]},{"entry":[{},"the source string"]},{"entry":[{},"matches a regular"]},{"entry":[{},"expression"]},{"entry":["Pattern-based, tokens","Determine whether",".*?BERG\\s"]},{"entry":[{},"one of the tokens from"]},{"entry":[{},"the source string"]},{"entry":[{},"matches a regular"]},{"entry":[{},"expression"]},{"entry":["Mixed Pattern and","Find a regular","[0-9] +"]},{"entry":["Property","expression for which","\\s{StreetTerm|StreetAbbreviation}"]},{"entry":[{},"one of the match"]},{"entry":[{},"groups passes a"]},{"entry":[{},"property-based test"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The ASSETS noun phrase categorization may consist of a training phase and a run-time classification phase. During the training phase, the system is taught to associate each category in the ASSETS category ontology with values produced by a group of feature extractors. Training is accomplished by running feature extractors on labeled training data (i.e., data for which the category is known). The feature extractors produce discrete\/continuous and real\/enumerated values representing different types of extraction results, and a Bayesian statistical model is produced that records the strengths of association of each feature value with each category. At run-time, in order to classify unknown data, the same set of features is extracted. The association strengths for each feature value are retrieved from the model and computed to produce, for each category, a probability score representing the likelihood that the data belongs to the category. This process flow is illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["420","500","505","510","525","515","515"]},"The process then proceeds to token content analyzer . This component associates each token with all known attributes contained in lexicon DB  or TM DB . While the DBs are shown as connected to one another and data from TM DB  would be \u201cpassed through\u201d lexicon DB  in , one of ordinary skill in the art would readily understand that the databases may be connected in any fashion and data from one DB need not pass through another to reach a certain module. This is also the case with the other DBs illustrated in the figures. In order to retrieve information from lexicon DB  or TM DB , token content analyzer  inspects each token to determine whether it needs to be submitted to a morphological analysis routine and performs the analysis if it does. The behavior of this component may be controlled through configuration options specified by system developers during the creation of a knowledge base for a new source language. The configuration options allow certain token types to be excluded from morphological analysis and\/or from translation in general. For example, tokens with the types \u201cNUMERIC\u201d, \u201cURL\u201d or \u201cEMAIL\u201d do not need to be looked up in a dictionary or further analyzed. This behavior is configured for each language pair's knowledge base because the tokenization rules, and therefore token types, are subject to change from language to language.","Tokens whose types are not explicitly excluded are subject to morphological analysis. Morpholgical analysis in the ASSETS system includes lemmatization to find the citation form of each token along with dictionary and TM lookup to retrieve all information associated with the citation form, and affix analysis for the purpose of determining grammatical characteristics marked by inflectional affixes. Any required disambiguation of translation senses is performed in subsequent stages of the ASSETS system.","The complication involved in looking up words in electronic dictionaries may be the same that a human being encounters when looking up words in a paper dictionary: namely, finding the appropriate headword or citation form for the word being looked up. For example, one does not search for the word \u201cboys\u201d in an English dictionary, but rather \u201cboy\u201d because the latter is the uninflected, singular form of the noun which, by English lexicographic standards, is the citation form for nouns. Finding the citation form of words for the purpose of looking them up in the dictionary involves determining whether the word is already a citation form or whether it has affixes attached to it. For the word \u201cboys\u201d, for example, the citation form is found by removing the plural suffix \u201cs\u201d. Morphological analysis is challenging for numerous reasons. Often, rules that guide the formation and decomposition of word forms have exceptions. For example, in English, a simple rule for finding the citation form based on a plural surface form might be to remove the letter \u201cs\u201d, so that \u201cboys\u201d becomes \u201cboy\u201d and \u201ccats\u201d becomes \u201ccat\u201d. This rule would over-apply to words ending in \u201cs\u201d such as \u201chis\u201d which would erroneously become \u201chi\u201d, and would under-apply on surface forms ending in \u201ces\u201d such as \u201ccrutches\u201d. Further, the rule would not apply at all to irregular plurals such as \u201cchildren\u201d. These examples are provided to illustrate the concept of morphological analysis, which is challenging even for languages with relatively limited morphological paradigms such as English.","In some embodiments of ASSETS, each language configuration may use one of three possible strategies for relating surface forms of words to their citation form. The first is a morphological dictionary, which is simply a file that lists all known surface forms, their citation forms, and the features indicated by any attached affixes, including prefixes, suffixes, infixes, circumfixes and any other category of bound morpheme. The second is run-time morphological analysis, which attempts to decompose words into citation forms plus affixes using rules, statistics, or other mechanisms. The third is stemming, which is an imperfect but fast technique that may be used in information retrieval systems for removing endings, leaving a stem that may or may not correspond to a real word, but that can be used to quickly flatten distinctions among words and to find the associated entry in an index. The first two strategies may be the techniques used for locating terminology in some embodiments of the ASSETS TM and lexicons since they allow for the identification and use of grammatical information carried on affixes for the purposes of more accurate translation. Token content analyzer  uses lexicon DB  for looking up terms in the lexicons.","The process then proceeds to cell-level feature extractors . Per the above, each feature extractor is designed to identify a specific type of characteristic and in some embodiments, may include one or more of those listed in Table 2. Next, Bayesian classifier  is trained to associate feature values with categories defined in the ASSETS category ontology using features such as data type characteristics, morpho-syntactic information, semantic categories, local distributional statistics and pattern-based features. Bayesian classifier  uses statistical category models from statistical category models DB  and a semantic category ontology from semantic category ontology DB . Following application of the Bayesian classifier, the process ends at .","A purpose of the ASSETS category-driven noun phrase translation feature may be to define a set of processes where isolated noun phrases, such as of the type encountered in structured data, can be converted from one human language (the source language) into another human language (the target language). The feature may rely heavily upon the identification of a category and the association of that category with a translation strategy. The overall approach of the translation in some embodiments is to delay deep linguistic analysis until all other options have been exhausted, meaning that the feature may rely heavily upon the existence of a densely populated translation memory and system dictionary that may be supplemented by user-created translation memories and dictionaries. If items are not found in one of these resources, then the ASSETS hybrid category-driven isolated noun phrase transfer feature may be used. The noun phrase transfer feature may offer a set of translation strategies, along with default associations between those strategies and the categories of the ASSETS category ontology. Users may override those defaults either by explicitly specifying which strategy to use for a list or column of data or by changing the strategy assigned to a particular category. All of the major components of the system employ category labels to perform their role. The high-level flow of the translation feature according to some embodiments is depicted in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["360","600","605"]},"In translation of a data cell, the category of the cell or isolated noun phrase is ascertained. In this application, the terms \u201ccell\u201d and \u201cisolated noun phrase\u201d are used interchangeably. If the process is provided with a valid category at , no categorization is performed unless the categorization provided to the system is overridden at . In the case that the categorization is overridden, the cell would be re-categorized using the ASSETS noun phrase categorization feature at . Once a valid category is established at , if the category does not require translation at , no further processing is required and the process terminates at . If the category does require translation at , if tokens are not already available at , the cell data is tokenized by tokenizer . As discussed above, the role of an ASSETS tokenizer, such as tokenizer , may be to divide the source language string into tokens if tokens are not provided to the system. Tokens represent word-like units that may be looked up in the system's dictionary or TM and thus be associated with a set of grammatical and semantic features. Tokenizer  generates information about the tokens it produces, including such properties as the data type and the capitalization. Tokens are then passed through token content analyzer  to retrieve associated TM and lexicon-based syntactic and semantic properties, as discussed above. These properties may be used by components throughout the remainder of the translation. If the system is configured to use translation memory at the cell data level at , ASSETS translation memory  is applied to cell data. If ASSETS translation memory  returns a translation, no further processing is required and the process ends at . If the cell data is not handled by the translation memory component, then it is passed to ASSETS category-driven isolated noun phrase transfer feature , which is discussed in further detail with respect to  below.","Translation memory may be a standard component of some machine translation systems. However, some embodiments of ASSETS translation memory are \u201ctransliteration-enabled\u201d. This means that although the translation memory contains a list of fixed translation pairs, sub-portions of the entries may be marked as \u201ctransliteratable\u201d. Any portions of the source string marked as transliteratable will change form in the translated output based on the rules of the selected transliteration scheme, unless the use of transliteration by the TM is globally disabled. For example, the Russian TM entry for noun phrase \u201c3AO  []\u201d may be listed in the TM as [IntelCom] Telecommunications Company, JSC. If the TM is configured to use transliteration, the bracketed portions in this example would be replaced with a different string if the transliteration standard used different letter-to-letter mappings. For example, in many standards \u201cIntelCom\u201d would be spelled \u201cIntelKom\u201d and the string returned would be \u201cIntelKom Telecommunications Company, JSC\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","705","710","715","720","755","725","760","765","770","795","770","775"]},"First, user lexicon lookup  is performed to determine whether the whole cell, i.e. the entire NP string, is found in the lexicon. If a match is found at , and only one translation sense is available at , the process ends at . If more than one translation sense is available at , the process proceeds to category driven word sense selector . If the whole cell is not found in the lexicon at , ASSETS TM lookup is performed at . If the whole cell is not found, the process ends at . If the whole cell is found, the process proceeds to the more than one translation sense decision point  and continues as discussed above. If a whole cell match is found, and a category-specific translation sense is available, that sense is returned. If not, the default general sense is returned. Returning to the \u201ccategory match required\u201d decision point at  that is reached when an entry is found in either the user TM lookup , proceeding to the \u201cyes\u201d branch of decision point , or the ASSETS TM lookup , proceeding to the \u201cyes\u201d branch of decision point , if the process requires a category match at  then the category parameter is checked against the types listed for the entry in the TM. If the types do not match at , the process finishes by returning no results. If they do match at , or if no match is required at , the next step is to determine whether transliteration is to be applied. If the translation memory feature is configured to not use transliteration at , then the target language string is returned literally, as-is, from the TM and the process ends at . Conversely, if the TM feature is configured to use transliteration at , the TM entry is checked for annotations indicating which portions of the entry need to be transliterated at  and each portion, if any, is passed to transliterator  in turn. Transliterator  uses the specified transliteration standard to replace the indicated portions of the TM entry with the appropriate transliterations, and the process finishes by returning the translation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"TRANSLATION MEMORY MATCH STRATEGIES"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["TM match",{},"Return",{}]},{"entry":["strategy","Description","Type","Example"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Strict match,","All words must be","Boolean","\u201cSport and Game"]},{"entry":["surface strings","present and in the",{},"Association\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"same order,",{},"will only"]},{"entry":[{},"with the",{},"match itself, it will"]},{"entry":[{},"exact form (inflection,",{},"not match variations"]},{"entry":[{},"declension) and",{},"such as \u201cSports and"]},{"entry":[{},"spelling of each string",{},"Game Association\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"nor \u201cAssociation of"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Sports and Games\u201d."]},{"entry":["Strict match,","All words must be","Boolean","\u201cSport and Game"]},{"entry":["stems","present and in the",{},"Association\u201d will"]},{"entry":[{},"same order, but the",{},"match \u201cSports and"]},{"entry":[{},"match is made against",{},"Game Association\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"stemmed forms of"]},{"entry":[{},"each token"]},{"entry":["Ignore function","Match without","Ranked","\u201cThe Chamber of"]},{"entry":["words, use","consideration for the","list","Commerce of the"]},{"entry":["surface forms,","existence of function",{},"Upstate New York"]},{"entry":["ordering optional","words, such as",{},"Region\u201d and \u201cThe"]},{"entry":[{},"prepositions, articles,",{},"Upstate New York"]},{"entry":[{},"demonstratives, etc.",{},"Region Chamber of"]},{"entry":[{},"Which function words",{},"Commerce\u201d will"]},{"entry":[{},"to ignore is defined on",{},"match with this"]},{"entry":[{},"a per-language basis",{},"strategy"]},{"entry":[{},"in external"]},{"entry":[{},"configuration files."]},{"entry":[{},"The remaining tokens"]},{"entry":[{},"must match but"]},{"entry":[{},"regardless of order."]},{"entry":[{},"The ranking is"]},{"entry":[{},"produced as a"]},{"entry":[{},"function of the longest"]},{"entry":[{},"substring matches on"]},{"entry":[{},"surface forms of"]},{"entry":[{},"tokens"]},{"entry":["Ignore function","Match without","Ranked","All of the following"]},{"entry":["words, use","consideration for the","list","will match:"]},{"entry":["stemmed forms,","existence of function",{},"\u201cThe Chamber of"]},{"entry":["ordering optional","words, such as",{},"Commerce of the"]},{"entry":[{},"prepositions, articles,",{},"Upstate New York"]},{"entry":[{},"demonstratives, etc.",{},"Region\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"Which function words",{},"\u201cThe Upstate New"]},{"entry":[{},"to ignore is defined on",{},"York Region"]},{"entry":[{},"a per-language basis",{},"Chamber of"]},{"entry":[{},"in external",{},"Commerce\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"configuration files.",{},"\u201cThe Upstate New"]},{"entry":[{},"See FIG. 2, reference",{},"York Regional"]},{"entry":[{},"numerals 228-244.",{},"Chamber of"]},{"entry":[{},"The remaining tokens",{},"Commerce\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"must match but",{},"\u201cThe Regional"]},{"entry":[{},"regardless of order.",{},"Upstate New York"]},{"entry":[{},"The ranking is",{},"Chambers of"]},{"entry":[{},"produced as a",{},"Commerce\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"function of the longest"]},{"entry":[{},"substring matches on"]},{"entry":[{},"stemmed forms of"]},{"entry":[{},"tokens"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The ASSETS hybrid category-driven isolated noun phrase transfer feature is a highly configurable translation component that provides flexibility by giving users the option of specifying a translation strategy to be used in some embodiments.

The process starts at  with an isolated noun phrase  being provided. Two of the translation strategies are essentially \u201cshort circuit paths\u201d. If the translation strategy involves transliteration only at , the data is passed to transliterator  whose results are returned as the isolated noun phrase translation and the process then ends at . If the translation strategy is to use a third party component at , the cell data will be passed off to that component and its results returned as the translation, ending the process at .","If neither of the \u201cshort circuit paths\u201d is chosen, if a token list is not provided at , the cell data is tokenized at . Token content is then analyzed by token content analyzer , which makes use of lexicon DB  and TM DB . Translation memory is applied at the sub-cell level by subcell TM applicator  if this parameter is toggled on at . Subcell TM applicator  also has access to TM DB . Any remaining tokens are translated according to one of four remaining translation strategies: key word replacement plus transliteration, category-driven lexical transfer, shallow syntactic transfer and statistical model translation. If the translation strategy is key word replacement plus transliteration at , then any key words in the un-translated portion of the string are translated using the category-appropriate translation sense or the default sense if a category-specific sense is not available in the lexicon by key word replacer . The semantic features that mark a token as a key word may be specified on a per-category basis. Once this is accomplished, the remaining tokens are passed to transliterator  and the combined results are returned as the isolated noun phrase translation, ending the process at .","If the strategy is not key word replacement plus transliteration at , three strategies remain. The first is the category-driven lexical transfer strategy at . This is performed by category-driven word sense selector , which makes use of Target Language-only Category-specific Language (\u201cTLCL\u201d) Models DB . Under this strategy, source words are translated in situ by replacing each source token with a category-specific translation sense. If more than one category-specific sense is available, a target language only category-specific language model is consulted to select the translation sense. If no category-specific sense is available, the default sense is used.","If category-driven lexical transfer is not selected at , the system determines whether statistical model translation is to be used at . If yes, then statistical engine  is employed. Statistical engine  uses category-specific statistical models for purely statistical translations, making use of category-specific translation models DB  and TLCL models DB . After statistical engine , the process ends at .","Finally, if none of the previously described translation strategies is used, the default behavior is to perform shallow syntactic transfer first using shallow syntactic semantic transfer rule engine , which makes use of category-specific phase reordering rules (\u201cCSPR\u201d) DB . In this approach, category-specific rules are applied to the input. These rules describe word-order transformations necessary to achieve optimal target-language word ordering. The application of these rules, which may apply to overlapping spans of text, produces a translation graph. A translation graph is a compact way to represent alternative translations that would be produced by the application of different rules and the selection of different word senses. Then, the best path through the translation graph is chosen. This is accomplished using a similar translation-sense selection as described for the category-driven lexical transfer strategy, but with the addition of statistical n-gram models used to prefer paths through the graph that optimize the presence of high frequency n-grams in the target language. Namely, category-specific translation senses are preferred. If more than one category-specific translation sense exists, a target language only category-specific language model is consulted to select the translation sense. If no category-specific sense is available, the default sense is used. The result of this translation strategy should be a well-formed phrase representing the meaning of the source phrase via the syntax and vocabulary of the target language.","In some cases, input provided to ASSETS will contain words or tokens that are not recognized by the system as part of the source language's vocabulary.

A language information library giving users visual clues to help select encodings\/scripts for unknown languages may also be included in the GUI.","Some embodiments of ASSETS translate isolated noun phrases in the absence of the linguistic or natural language context that is available to, and relied upon by, conventional full sentence translation approaches. Rather, the context in some embodiments of ASSETS may be derived from the group of isolated noun phrases. ASSETS may be language-independent, but configurable for specific languages using parameter settings and externally defined knowledge sources, such as databases - of , for example. Some embodiments of ASSETS may compensate for the lack of linguistic or natural language context by using machine learning and advanced reasoning techniques to classify the semantic category of each noun phrase according to a predefined semantic category ontology for noun phrases, principally covering proper noun phrases known as named entities. The term \u201cnamed entity\u201d refers to proper noun phrases of specific categories such as person name, place name or organization name. Category labels may be used throughout the ASSETS functionality for selecting both category-appropriate translation senses and category-specific translation strategies. The ASSETS functionality may employ a large-scale TM containing lists of pre-identified translation pairs followed by a suite of specialized translators for each noun phrase category. The category-specialized translators may employ various translation strategies. The TM may require category labels for retrieving category-appropriate translations from the TM's list of pre-determined translation pairs. A hybrid automatic translation approach may select translation components based on an association between a category and a translation strategy.","The ASSETS system may employ the ASSETS functionality on a larger scale, further exploiting noun-phrase categorization using context provided via structured data formats. The columnar organization of spreadsheets and database tables provides natural groupings of nearly homogenous category data. Some embodiments of ASSETS may either calculate the most probable semantic noun-phrase category for an entire column of related noun-phrases or allow users to specify the column category label. Column-based categorization may reduce classification errors, and, therefore, translation errors, by providing either a human judgment or a probability distribution for the categorization of an entire column of data rather than for an individual cell. Column categorization uses additional features not available to an individual cell categorizer, incorporating information obtained from column headers, distributional features derived from the entire column of data and advanced reasoning pertaining to the relationships among the columns. By default, the category label associated with a column may supersede the individual categorization of a single cell and may be provided by the ASSETS system based on system defaults or user specifications. The ASSETS functionality may use the provided category label or the automatically determined category label for selecting terminology from the TM as well as for selecting the appropriate translation strategy. The selected translation strategy may determine the combination of lexical senses, transfer rules and statistical models used during the final algorithmic phase of the translation. One translation strategy available in the system is essentially to \u201cdo nothing\u201d, meaning that some categories, once categorized, might not be translated but instead passed through the system intact (e.g. numbers, email addresses and dates).","Some embodiments of ASSETS exploit knowledge about semantic categories that is available in structured and semi-structured contexts. A column of data in a spreadsheet is normally a list of items that are grouped together by virtue of having the same category. Lists may contain one or more items. Individual items in a list may be referred to, alternatively, as a cell or as an isolated noun phrase. Lists provided to some embodiments of ASSETS are not forcibly derived from columns of a spreadsheet or a database table. The lists may also be manually assembled or grouped into like categories through the use of technologies such as information extraction.","Some embodiments of ASSETS provide a mechanism for allowing users to specify the category of a list or column of data. A column's category may be obtained by the user via automated means such as an information extraction engine, or the category may be manually selected based on observation of the data. If the user cannot or does not wish to specify the category of a column, ASSETS may provide an automatic column categorizer that uses ASSETS column categorization functionality to identify the most likely category of a list of data. Once the column's category has been established, each of the cells in the column is passed to the ASSETS category-driven isolated noun phrase translator for processing.","While the term \u201cserver\u201d has been used in the description of some embodiments of the present invention, the invention may be applied to many types of network computing devices. For purposes of this invention, the term \u201cserver\u201d includes rack computing systems, cloud computing systems, distributed computing systems, personal computers, laptops, cell phones, personal digital assistants, tablet computing devices, mainframes, any networked devices that perform computing operations, and any of these physical servers.","One having ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that the invention as discussed above may be practiced in a different order, and\/or with hardware elements in configurations that are different than those that are disclosed. Therefore, although the invention has been described based upon these preferred embodiments, it would be apparent to, and readily appreciated by, those of ordinary skill in the art that certain modifications, variations, and alternative constructions would be apparent, while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention. Further, some components may be left out for certain languages. For example, the morphological analyzer component may be left out for some source language, or the morphological analyzer may be substituted for, or complimented by, a part-of-speech tagger. Some languages may also include additional components. For instance, Arabic and Hebrew may require a vocalization in order to insert vowels into names for proper transliteration.
