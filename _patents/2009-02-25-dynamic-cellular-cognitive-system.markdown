title: Dynamic cellular cognitive system
abstract: High quality communications among a diverse set of cognitive radio (CR) nodes is permitted while minimizing interference to primary and other secondary users by employing Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) in a Dynamic Cellular Cognitive System (DCCS). Diverse device types interoperate, cooperate, and communicate with high spectrum efficiency and do not require infrastructure to form the network. The dynamic cellular cognitive system can expand to a wider geographical distribution via linking to existing infrastructure.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO THE RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority for U.S. provisional application No. 61\/031,064 and filed on Feb. 25, 2008 which is herein incorporated by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. CNS-0519959 awarded by the National Science Foundation and Contract No. 2005-I J-CX-K017 awarded by the National Institute of Justice. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to broadband wireless communications employing cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access capabilities to solve interoperability, spectrum scarcity, and infrastructure substitution.","Compared to other intelligent communication technologies like the smart antenna, cognitive radio (CR) mitigates the interference by sensing the spectrum and using idle channels. In 2004, when Qualcomm analyzed the feasibility of using CR in cellular wireless communications, it was found that in order to accurately avoid interference the cognitive transmitter is required to measure the effect of its transmission on all possible receivers. However, it is not an easy task for the transmitter to sense the environment of the entire set of possible receivers when the receiver distribution is geographically large. Diversely, even if the transmitter is able to do so, it might be difficult to find the optimal solution for both the transmitter and the receiver without any interference to primary users in such a large area and under such complicated conditions. CR is a self observing, self learning and self decision making radio. When it is performing as the sole secondary user, it is efficient and can reach optimal utilization of the resources. However, when multiple secondary users exist, the competition among the secondary users is a waste of resources.","Traditional communication systems like the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) function based on pre-defined channel allocation and sets of protocols. Whereas, CR adapts to channel conditions using the process of sensing an existing wireless channel, evolving a radio's operation to accommodate the perceived wireless channel, and evaluating what happens when a change is made.","The invention provides a method and system for providing high quality cognitive communications among CR nodes within the coverage area while reducing or eliminating interference to primary and other secondary users having reasonable computation complexity.","In the present invention, each CR node senses the immediate surrounding environment instead of measuring the effect of its transmission on all possible receivers. Subsequently, multiple secondary users cooperate based on a fair and efficient scheme without losing the flexibility and self adaptation features of CR. The invention defines the network and a set of protocols that each CR node inside the network must adopt to be considered a user within the group. The invention allows users within the group to transmit without interfering with the primary user or secondary users outside the group. Lastly, it makes computational complexity more reasonable for the individual nodes within the group.","Cognitive Radio (CR) technology is well understood in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 7,289,972 to Reiser, which is herein incorporated by reference, describes CR technology and algorithm's used to adapt a wireless radio to a changing environment. Self organizing networks are also known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 7,171,476 to Maeda, which is herein incorporated by reference, describes an example of self-organization of a number of nodes. The use of CR based wireless communications in dynamic access networks is also understood in the art. U.S. Patent Publication 2008\/0089306 to Hu, which is herein incorporated by reference describes an exemplary method of addressing inter-systems (cells) communications for coexistence and spectrum sharing. The invention builds on these and other technologies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["99","100","103","104"]},"All the cognitive mobile terminals (CMT) - in the cell can be secondary users. However, by coordinating with a PCN, CMTs can all access the spectrum without causing interference with primary users in an efficient way. PCNs serve as a digital gateway providing interoperability among different types of radios including, but not limited to FRS radio, public safety radio, cell phone, broadband devices, all of which normally cannot cooperate with each other.","PCNs use a power control optimization algorithm to control the power of each node within its cell to realize frequency reuse among different cells. The connections between PCNs, defined herein as inter-cell communication,  utilize wideband signal transmission schemes, such as WiFi or WiMAX, and function as a wireless backbone. The situation aware dynamic routing protocol is used for backbone connections to forward data to the desired destination. Frequency distribution and power control are the two primary enabling technologies. Because of the cellular structure based network, the increased capacity comes from the fact that the same radio frequency can be reused in a different cell for a completely different transmission. This technology is the same as what is used in a traditional cellular network. PCNs use power control to adjust the distance of its transmitted signal propagation distance and therefore guarantee the quality of cells frequency reuse. Frequency reuse only applies to data transmission, not the command message transmission. A command message is for exchanging information between a PCN and a CMT or among PCNs to coordinate on spectrum utilization, routing topology and cell management. Thus, when a CMT or a PCN first joins the network, it can send out request message to set up the connection with a PCN without knowing the prior cell frequency allocation information. DCCS's topology adapts based on an algorithm that allows adjacent cells to join into one. This functionality depends on the area of the cells, the number of users in the cells, and the geographic conditions of the cells.","In addition to inter-cell communication, DCCS manages communication between PCNs and CMTs within a given cell, defined herein as intra-cell communication link. Protocols about intra-cell communication defined how three way handshaking among a PCN and CMTs can allow CMTs to access spectrum as secondary users without causing interference with primary user and other users outside of DCCS system. A PCN allocate channels to either communication between two CMTs within the cell or communication between a CMT in the cell and a CMT outside of the cell via PCN itself as a forwarding point. It also serves as gateway for two radios that do not have compatibility directly. For example, there exists a secondary user access link on the spectrum allocated by a PCN between CMTs  and . The more detailed descriptions are in  to . Finally, there is the connection to the existing infrastructure ; it is the bridge for DCCS to connect to the IP network that is not damaged or destroyed (see  for example).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["115","116","117","118","119","120"]},"DCCS system is a system that mixes the cognitive radios and non-cognitive radios, primary user and secondary users. It is necessary to have some regulations about the modulation of transmission and spectrum accessing.  is a chart describing the allocation strategy and modulation types for inter-cell communications and intra-cell communications. Each radio presenting in the DCCS coverage area can be assigned a channel when it requested. By interchanging the message and scanning of each sub channel, a PCN will obtain the statistic channel records including the accumulated duration of channel being occupied by primary or other secondary user outside of DCCS system, accumulated duration of channel being vacant, latest moment a channel being vacant, latest moment a channel being occupied by primary or other secondary user outside of DCCS system. We assume that the event of primary users or other secondary users outside of DCCS system present in the channel is an exponential distribution. Using these channel records, a PCN can predict the next moment channel conditions so that it can make the optimal decision when allocating a channel. The channel that has the least probability of being interrupted by the primary channel during the communication will be assigned.","Intra-cell communications between CMTs work cognitively, which means that the CMTs calculate the optimal resource utilization and modulation scheme, while satisfying the restriction of the distributed spectrum in the cell. Intra-cell communication includes the communication between two CMTs within the cell, and between a CMT and the PCN in the cell. The communication could be multiple narrow band modulations including MPSK, FM, AM, FSK, or it could be OFDM based wideband communication. Each CMT chooses the mode that best fits the current environment and individual transmission requirements. The inter-cell communications between CMTs in different cells are coordinated through PCNs. PCN's execute inter-cell communication using wideband transmission schemes such as WiFi or WiMAX. WiFi and WiMAX or other broadband communications are preferred because the sums of inter-cell communication payloads are relatively large. Among them, WiMAX is preferred because it covers longer distance with a scheduled MAC layer principle. Also, a PCN as a powerful CR node has the ability to classify signals and perform synchronization, thus, it can accommodate multiple modulation types.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["121","122","123","124","125","126","127"]},"For PCN intra-cell management , it is PCN's responsibility to coordinate the transmission within its cell, allocate channel, and servers as gateway for radios that are not compatible. Spectrum information is gathering via energy detection from multiple nodes. Both the PCN and CMTs sense the spectrum and share available spectrum information using specifically designed scheme. A CMT randomly chooses a channel, and uses energy detection to determine the existence of signal in the channel. Based on CSMA, if no signal is present in the channel, it can send out command message. PCN listens to all channels sequentially. It processes and responds to the message it receives and collects the channel information meanwhile. Based on the channel information it collects, it calculates for the optimal decision to allocate channel. To avoid adjacent-cell interference, spectrum allocation is also negotiated among adjacent cells by the PCNs through inter-cell protocols. The CMTs are then informed of the results by the PCNs so that the CMTs do not experience intra-cell interference and adjacent-cell interference. Additional functionality for intra-cell management includes a MAC protocol  and gateway and data forwarding to CMTs within the cell .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["131","132","133","134","135","136","137","138"]},"With reference to , DCCS can accommodate both CMT and legacy radios, and based on the radio type and location, the PCN can take one of several actions such as allocate the optimal channel  and , allocate the optimal channel and forward the transmission to another cell , request that the CMT recon, serve as a gateway , or serve as a gateway with forwarding .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["145","146","147","148","149","150","152","152","153","154","155","156","157","158"],"sub":"b"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["159","160","161","8","161","162"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["163","164","165","166","167","168"]},"While the invention has been described in terms of one or more preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing and other objects, aspects, and advantages will be better understood from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention with reference to the drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 8"],"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
