{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject disclosure relates to illumination systems that include light-emitting-diode (LED) technology and, more specifically, to efficient monitoring technique(s) to assess performance of one or more LED strings.","Backlights are used to illuminate liquid crystal displays (\u201cLCDs\u201d). LCDs with backlights are used in small displays for cell phones and personal digital assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d) as well as in large displays for computer monitors and televisions. Often, the light source for the backlight includes one or more cold cathode fluorescent lamps (\u201cCCFLs\u201d). The light source for the backlight can also be an incandescent light bulb, an electroluminescent panel (\u201cELP\u201d), or one or more hot cathode fluorescent lamps (\u201cHCFLs\u201d).","The display industry is enthusiastically pursuing the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) as the light source in backlight display technology because CCFLs have many shortcomings: For instance, CCFLs do not easily ignite in cold temperatures, they require adequate idle time to ignite, and they require delicate handling. Moreover, LEDs generally have a higher ratio of light generated to power consumed than other backlight sources. Accordingly, displays with LED backlights can consume less power than other displays, which renders LED-based displays more sustainable. LED backlighting has traditionally been used in small, inexpensive LCD panels. However, LED backlighting is becoming more common in large displays such as those installed in computers and television sets. In large displays, multiple LEDs are required to provide adequate backlight for the LCD display.","As larger displays include LEDs, complexity of associated circuitry and LED configurations can substantially increase, rendering conventional monitoring techniques and architectures largely inadequate. Such inadequacy not only arises from increased signaling and processing required to monitor performance of larger installed LED configurations and related circuitry, but also from increased manufacturing difficulty and cost, as density of wiring required to operate and monitor operation of LEDs in a display increases. Accordingly, conventional approaches to monitoring performance of LEDs in complex display or illumination applications can be improved.","The following presents a simplified summary of the subject disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects thereof. This summary is not an extensive overview of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate any scope. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","One or more embodiments provide system(s) and method(s) to efficiently assess performance of a set of light emitting diode (LED) strings in an illumination system. A multiplexer component collects input signal(s) from the one or more LED strings via a first set of one or more monitoring pins, processes the collected input signal(s), and extracts at least one output signal. The at least one output signal is conveyed to a demultiplexer component through a second set of one or more monitoring pins, wherein the number of elements in the second set of monitoring pins is equal to or smaller than the number of monitoring pins in the first set. The collected input signal(s) is(are) processed in accordance with at least one mode of operation of the multiplexer component, the mode of operation is autonomously configured by the demultiplexer component.","In an aspect, autonomous configuration of the mode of operation of the multiplexer component can adjust monitoring of input signals based on timing restrictions or requirements of an illumination apparatus that utilizes the set of LED strings. The chosen mode of operation is just one of several modes of operation and can include a channel multiplexing mode that extracts a single value of the collected input signal, or a function processing mode that produces one or more values dictated by a predetermined function of the collected input signal(s). The multiplexer component can be embodied in at least one of discrete devices or an integrated circuit chipset, which can include one or more processors, whereas the demultiplexer component can be embodied in hardware or software or firmware application retained in memory and executed by one or more processors.","The multiplexer component can autonomously generate intelligence on operating status of the set of LED strings. Generation of operating status intelligence can be performed in response to configuration of an intelligence collection mode, and can be based at least in part on historical data of collected input signals. Generated operating status intelligence can be supplied to the demultiplexer component or other functional elements operatively coupled to the multiplexer component. In addition, the generated operating status intelligence can allow at the very least adjustment of performance criteria that determine normal or abnormal operation of the set of LED strings.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.","The subject disclosure is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It may be evident, however, that the various embodiments of the subject disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the present disclosure.","As employed in this specification and annexed drawings, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d \u201cinterface,\u201d and the like are intended to include a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities, wherein the entity can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. One or more of such entities are also referred to as \u201cfunctional elements.\u201d As an example, a component may be, but is not limited to being a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. Also, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate via local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems via the signal). As another example, a component can be an apparatus with specific functionality provided by mechanical parts operated by electric or electronic circuitry which is operated by a software or a firmware application executed by a processor, wherein the processor can be internal or external to the apparatus and executes at least a part of the software or firmware application. As yet another example, a component can be an apparatus that provides specific functionality through electronic components without mechanical parts, the electronic components can include a processor therein to execute software or firmware that provides at least in part the functionality of the electronic components. As further yet another example, interface(s) can include input\/output (I\/O) components as well as associated processor, application, or Application Programming Interface (API) components. While the foregoing examples are directed to aspects of a component, the exemplified aspects or features also apply to a system, interface and the like.","In addition, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.","Furthermore, the term \u201cset\u201d as employed herein excludes the empty set; e.g., the set with no elements therein. Thus, a \u201cset\u201d in the subject disclosure includes one or more elements or entities. As an illustration, a set of LED strings includes one or more LED strings; a set of devices includes one or more devices; etc.","Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches also can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","110","110","114","110","114","110","110","110","120","120"],"sub":["1","N ","\u03bb","\u03bb","\u03bb","1-N ","\u03bb","\u03bb","\u03bb"]},"LED strings -are functionally connected to an intelligent multiplexer  via respective monitoring pins -. Intelligent multiplexer component , also referred to herein and in annexed drawings as intelligent multiplexer , collects an input signal from one or more pins -and generates output signal that is multiplexed and conveyed to an intelligent demultiplexer component , also referred to herein and in annexed drawings as intelligent demultiplexer , through a set of monitoring pins -, with index M being an integer greater than or equal to unity and smaller than or equal to N. In an aspect, intelligent multiplexer  can be a dedicated component embodied in a set of discrete devices, such as resistors, diodes, transistors, and combinations thereof, or as part of a dedicated integrated circuit with one or more processors, whereas intelligent demultiplexer  can be part of a core integrated circuit (IC) that operates the lightning system that includes LED strings -and respective drivers -. Digital processing and related logic can implement, at least in part, functionality of intelligent multiplexer . Artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies also can implement, at least in part, functionality of intelligent multiplexer . Intelligent demultiplexer  can be implemented in hardware or as a software or firmware application retained in memory as a set of code instructions and executed by one or more processors. At least one of analog processing or digital processing can implement, at least in part, functionality of intelligent demultiplexer . Artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies also can implement, at least in part, functionality of intelligent demultiplexer .","In contrast to conventional lightning systems that exploit LEDs arranged in strings or other type of groupings, the combination of intelligent multiplexer  and intelligent demultiplexer  described in the subject disclosure can allow monitoring of operating status of LED strings -with a reduced number of monitoring pins, e.g., M<N; in particular, scenario(s) in which M=1 can be implemented.","At least an advantage of the subject example system  is that through reduction of monitoring pins as compared with conventional systems, example system  can reduce physical size of the core IC that operates the lightning system that utilizes LED strings -and respective drivers -and thus reduce packaging complexity and costs. In particular, reduced number of monitoring pins, e.g., M<N, can reduce wire routing significantly in the core IC.","At least another advantage of reduce monitoring pins, e.g., M<N, is that as LED-based lightning systems increase in complexity, signaling to the core IC associated with monitoring operating status of LED strings -can be maintained at a reduced level and thereby mitigating possible performance deterioration of the LED-based lightning system.","In addition, in example system  monitoring is decentralized and thus monitoring load and related signaling can be offloaded from a core IC that operates lightning system that exploits LED strings -and related drivers -. Thus, even in scenario(s) in which M=N or M\u2245N, example system  can provide efficiencies with respect to conventional systems. In particular, in complex LED-based lightning systems, the decentralized architecture described herein can mitigate costly increases in complexity of the core IC that can arise from increased processing and signaling power necessary to centrally monitor performance of large, complex lightning systems that employ LED strings -and associated drivers -. Moreover, when combined, decentralization and monitoring pin reduction can further enhance the foregoing advantages or efficiencies achieved through example system .","Various features or aspects of example system  and components therein are described in greater detail hereinafter.","As illustrated in , intelligent multiplexer  can receive input signal(s) , illustrated in diagram , as an example, with N=11 input channels, and generate, e.g., extract and convey, one or more output(s)  in accordance with one or more modes of operation, which can be established by received configuration . Output(s)  can be conveyed through one or more monitoring pins (e.g., -). As an example, three modes are presented in diagram : Mode I , Mode II , and Mode III , which is a combination of the first and second mode. In an aspect, as illustrated in diagram , Mode I is a Channel Multiplexing mode (CMM) in which the intelligent multiplexer  extracts the value  of a specific single input channel, e.g., Channel  (CH); such value can be conveyed through a single monitoring pin. Extraction of such single value can be performed by multiplexing the input signal(s)  in at least one of selective manner or sequential or series processing manner.","In another aspect, as illustrated in diagram , Mode II  is a Function Processing mode (FPM) that enables intelligent multiplexer  to extract a value  that is a function F=F(CH, CH . . . CHN) of the signal values of channels CH\u03bb, with \u03bb=1, 2 . . . N, collected in input signal(s) ; signal values for illustrative scenario with N=11 is depicted in panel . Thus, Mode II can be utilized to extract and supply a processing value of a set of two or more input channels simultaneously or substantially simultaneously in a parallel processing mode. In an example, a first function Fcan be applied to a first set of input channels, e.g., CH-CH, and a second function Fcan be applied to a second set of input channels, e.g., CH-CH. In Function Processing mode of operation, intelligent multiplexer  can supply continuous or nearly continuous monitoring of input signal, or activity, of a plurality of input channels relative to a predetermined or desired operating range or bounds: As an example, minimum value of all input signal can be determined and contrasted with a lower bound for short circuit voltage. As another example, maximum value of all input signal can be extracted, processed if necessary, and compared to a maximum reference value for electric dissipation or heating. Such continuous or nearly continuous monitoring afforded by FPM can enable time-dependent screening of performance of the set of LED strings -, and determination of abnormal operating status as gauged through predetermined reference or boundary values. Determination, or detection, of abnormal performance can lead to assessment of individual input channel condition to identify a faulty LED string as revealed by value of input signal.","The function F(\u2022) can be any or most any function of input signal(s) : min(CH, CH . . . CHN); max(CH, CH . . . CHN); E(CH, CH . . . CHN), wherein min(\u2022) adopts the minimum value amongst a set of arguments, wherein max(\u2022) adopts the maximum value amongst a set of two or more arguments, and E(\u2022) produces a mean function such as arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and weighted versions thereof; etc. F(\u2022) can be determined as part of configuration .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["130","300","350","130","300","320","320","310","310","1","2","330","320","320","300","330","1","1","2","330","1","2","330","300"],"sub":["1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","F ","1 ","2 ","F","CH\u03ba","CH\u03ba","CH1 ","CH1","CH2 ","CH2 ","CH2","CH1"]},"With regard to embodiment , diodes and enable at least one of OR Boolean logic or OR fuzzy logic; in an aspect, forward bias voltage Vof diodes and satisfy V<<V.

Determination of which output is read in CMM, or how output data is conveyed, can be based on at least one of design (e.g., efficiency) or policy associated with extraction of output signal: If pull high of unselected channel(s) is more efficient than grounding such channel(s), then output signal  can be utilized as read-out of multiplexed value and output signal  can be discarded or disabled for reading to avoid error in output reading at an intelligent demultiplexer operational coupled to embodiment .","The circuits of example embodiments , , and  can be realized in an integrated circuit (IC) and are non-limiting in that such embodiments represent only but a few of several logical gate circuits that can embody intelligent multiplexer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","130","500","140","504","504","124","124","522","540","540","522","110","110","504","110","110","128"],"sub":["1","N","1","N","1","N "]},"In addition, intelligent driver  can generate intelligence on operation of a set of LED strings, e.g., -. Generation of intelligence can be based at least in part on historical input data, which can be retained in data store ; generated intelligence can be retained in data store . In an aspect, generation of operation intelligence can include various operations on collected data such as generation of patterns (temporal or spatial) of operation of one or more LED strings, e.g., patterns of fault(s) in the set of LED strings can be identified and correlated with device information, e.g., device identity (ID), such as serial number, or external operation conditions (temperature, duty cycle, emitted photon wavelength, etc.) as part of root cause analysis for the fault pattern. Generated temporal patterns can provide operation trends which can unveil prospective fault(s).","In addition, generation of operation intelligence can allow autonomous configuration of ranges of normal operation (e.g., minimum voltage drop in a string, highest temperature in one or more strings . . . ) which can account for intrinsic performance deterioration of LED(s) in one or more strings and can ensure satisfactory operation without excessive, time-consuming monitoring such as performance of phased diagnosis (see, e.g.,  and related description). Moreover, generation of operation intelligence can enable autonomous or automatic reconfiguration of function mode of the intelligent multiplexer to switch to diagnostic mode (e.g., phased sequence and multiplexed channel signal extraction) from Normal\/Abnormal screening; in an aspect, such autonomous reconfiguration can based on cost-utility analysis that trades off cost of implementing diagnosis and thus not operating the set of strings in full (e.g., 100%) duty cycle, and benefit of identifying defective devices or functional elements and signaling maintenance. In another aspect, as part of intelligence generation, intelligent driver  can produce operating reports associated with the set of LED strings, e.g., -, based at least in part on predetermined monitoring logic, which can be retained in memory element .","In an aspect, intelligent driver  can exploit artificial intelligence (AI) methods to generate the operation intelligence described supra. Such intelligence can be generated through inference, e.g., reasoning and conclusion synthesis based upon a set of metrics, arguments, or known outcomes in controlled scenarios, or training sets of data. Artificial intelligence methods or techniques referred to herein typically apply advanced mathematical algorithms\u2014e.g., decision trees, neural networks, regression analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) for feature and pattern extraction, cluster analysis, genetic algorithm, or reinforced learning\u2014to a data set. In particular, intelligent driver  can employ one of numerous methodologies for learning from data and then drawing inferences from the models so constructed.","Such methodologies can be retained in algorithm store . As an example, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and related prototypical dependency models can be employed. General probabilistic graphical models, such as Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks like those created by structure search using a Bayesian model score or approximation can also be utilized. In addition, linear classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVMs), non-linear classifiers like methods referred to as \u201cneural network\u201d methodologies, fuzzy logic methodologies can also be employed. Moreover, game theoretic models (e.g., game trees, game matrices, pure and mixed strategies, utility algorithms, Nash equilibria, evolutionary game theory, etc.) and other approaches that perform data fusion, etc., can be exploited.","Configuration  can disclose a specific mode of generation and reporting of operational intelligence. As an example, configuration  can identify one or more groups of one or more inputs -to be monitored and a specific function to be applied to at least one of the identified groups.

Diodes -are connected to a pull-high resistor R, and enable protection of drivers -from over-voltage. In the illustrated embodiment, diodes -extract the lowest voltage amongst LED strings -and output such voltage through a single output signal pin ; it should be appreciated that in the subject embodiment of intelligent multiplexer, the set of four diodes -effectively operate as a Boolean OR gate or fuzzy logic OR gate. Accordingly, to monitor and extract voltage of a single LED string  (with \u03b3=1, 2, 3, 4), or associated driver , single-driver operation (e.g., one driver on and remainder drivers off) at measurement time or substantially at measurement time is to be ensured. Powered off LED strings in such operation pull high. To produce single-driver operation, phased power-on of drivers -can be implemented such that phasing results in staggered time-dependent power for each driver. Diagram  in  exemplifies such phasing: At each pulse-width-modulation (PWM) frame, power-on signal is relatively phase-shifted for each of strings -(indicated with bold indices  through  in ) and string voltage is collected, via output pin , for the LED string that is first powered on, indicated in each PWM frame  with a thick line and a sequence order label, e.g.,  through . Such staggered phasing can be most efficiently implemented in system(s) wherein power sources for drivers -with the same PWM settings, which ensures a predetermined phase shift magnitude is preserved throughout a plurality of frames.","Phase-shifted power sequence(s) similar to or modified from that illustrated in diagram  can be exploited for high-duty or full-duty cycle systems that include more than four LED strings. Since in such systems monitoring timing can introduce performance issues, an intelligent multiplexer can be configured for operation in FPM mode to detect performance of various or all LED strings simultaneously and determine if performance of the system is normal or abnormal; such screening can be performed continuously or nearly continuously. If such screening reveals normal operation, screening can continue. But if screening reveals abnormal operation, such as operation in LED short or open range, a diagnosis sequence can be effected to identify a LED string that operates abnormally. The diagnosis sequence can include a phase-shifted power on sequence in which a single LED string in the system is powered on at a time and voltage for such single LED string is extracted. In such monitoring mode, intelligence multiplexer described herein allows the system  to maintain full-duty or high-duty cycle operation uninterrupted until faulty operation is detected.","In an aspect, in full-duty or high-duty cycle systems, the phase-shifted sequence(s) that can be employed for the foregoing diagnosis or root cause analysis can include pulse-off of -LED strings in a set of N LED strings for a time interval (e.g., 10 \u03bcs) that allows measurement of operation voltage of the single, powered on LED string. To at least that end, a counter that measures input PWM period in power source for the set of N LED strings can be employed to pulse-off the -LED strings. Thus, diagnosis of an abnormal condition, e.g., overheating, in an LED string can be detected within the time scale in which the counter overflows, for example, about 30 ms, if the N LED strings are cycled with a period equal or nearly equal to the overflow period for the counter. Diagnosis of overheating in a full-duty or high-duty cycle system of N LED strings, e.g., -, can be performed in about N\u00d730 ms, or in less than 1 s for typical systems. In the alternative or in addition, pulse off and diagnosis can be performed at the beginning of the counter rather than at overflow.","In view of the example system(s) described above, example method(s) that can be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter can be better appreciated with reference to flowcharts in .
