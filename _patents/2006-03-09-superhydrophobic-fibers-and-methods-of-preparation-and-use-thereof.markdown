No. 60\/659,907, filed Mar. 10, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support awarded by the Army Research Office under ARO Grant No. DAAD19-02-D-0002. The government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to fibers exhibiting a water contact angle of above 150\u00b0 and water contact angle hysteresis of below 15\u00b0, methods of producing the same, and applications thereof. The present invention further relates to superhydrophobic fiber mats, methods of producing the same, and applications thereof.","Electrospinning is a versatile method to produce polymer fibers with diameters in the micron, sub-micron and nano (<100 nm) range. Numerous polymeric materials have been electrospun into continuous, uniform fibers, and various applications of the fibers have been widely recognized. The method employs electrostatic forces to stretch a polymer jet and make superfine fibers. Electrohydrodynamic instabilities that occur in electrospinning, charge density of the electrified jet (and indirectly, solution conductivity), surface tension, and viscoelasticity of the solution have been shown to play important roles both in making the production of fibers possible and in controlling the size and uniformity of the fibers. The development of internal structure in such fibers has generally been limited to crystallization of homopolymer or macrophase separation of a polymer blend during the drying and solidification of the fiber, inclusion of immiscible additives such as clays, nanotubes and metallic or oxide particles. Surface structures attributed to \u201cbreath figures\u201d have also been shown.","Block copolymers offer an alternative method by which internal structure can be induced in electrospun fibers via microphase separation. In bulk, block copolymers are known to form microphase separated structures such as spheres, cylinders, gyroids and lamellae, depending on molecular weight, volume fractions of components and the degree of immiscibility of the different polymer blocks. In thin films, it has been shown that surface forces and confinement effects are strong enough to alter the phase separation behavior. However, no such information is currently available on microphase separation in a confined cylindrical, sub-micrometer sized and fiber-like geometry. Electrospinning of block copolymers is therefore not only promising for applications involving surface chemistry, drug delivery and multi-functional textiles, but is also of intrinsic scientific interest.","The wetting behavior of a solid surface is important for various commercial applications and depends strongly on both the surface energy or chemistry and the surface roughness. Currently, surfaces with a water contact angle above 150\u00b0 are considered to be \u201csuperhydrophobic\u201d and are the subject of great interest for their water proof and self-cleaning usages. There is a need to develope fiber-forming processes and products that would demonstrate the desired surface characteristics, such as superhydrophobicity, as well as other properties, such as mechanical strength and integrity.","In one embodiment, this invention provides a fiber comprising a copolymer wherein said fiber exhibits a water contact angle of above 150\u00b0 and water contact angle hysteresis of below 15\u00b0.","In one embodiment, this invention provides a superhydrophobic fiber mat, wherein said mat comprises fibers comprising a copolymer and wherein said mat exhibits a water contact angle of above 150\u00b0 and water contact angle hysteresis of below 15\u00b0.","In one embodiment, this invention provides a method for preparing a superhydrophobic fiber or fibers, the method comprising the step of electrospinning a solution comprising a copolymer, wherein said copolymer comprises a component, comprising a silicon structure and having a surface energy of less than 1 mJ\/m, said solution exhibits conductivity, surface tension and viscoelasticity fluidic properties, and whereby said electrospinning produces a superhydrophobic fiber or fibers exhibiting a water contact angle of above 150\u00b0 and water contact angle hysteresis of below 15\u00b0.","In one embodiment, the method further comprises the step of producing a superhydrophobic mat comprising said fibers.","In one embodiment, this invention provides a composition comprising a fiber of this invention.","In one embodiment, the invention provides an article of manufacture comprising a fiber or mat of this invention.","In one embodiment, this invention provides a fiber comprising a copolymer wherein said fiber exhibits a water contact angle of above 150\u00b0 and water contact angle hysteresis of below 15\u00b0.","In one embodiment, this invention provides a superhydrophobic fiber mat, wherein said fiber comprises a copolymer and wherein said mat exhibits a water contact angle of above 150\u00b0 and water contact angle hysteresis of below 15\u00b0.","In one embodiment of this invention, the water contact angle may be above 160\u00b0.

They should, in no way be construed, however, as limiting the scope of the invention.","A Poly(styrene-co-dimethylsiloxane) diblock copolymer was synthesized at Dow Corning Corp. laboratories by sequential controlled anionic polymerization of styrene and then hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D) as shown in  [Rosati, D.; Perrin, M.; Navard, P.; Harabagiu, V.; Pinteala, M.; Simionescu, B. C. 1998, 31, 4301; Pantazis, D.; Chalari, I.; Hadjichristidis, N. 2003, 36, 3783].

Peak 1 was identified as the copolymer with Mn=238000, polydispersity (pdi)=1.16, and accounts for 76.6% of the sample. Peak 2 was identified as residual PS homopolymer, Mn=114000, and accounts for the remaining 23.4%. Assuming that the Mn of the PS block in the copolymer is also 114 k, the composition of the copolymer is 114 k\/124 k. The volume fraction of PS in the copolymer is 0.45. The volume fraction of PS in the mixture is 0.57 which exhibits a cylindrical morphology upon microphase separation in the bulk, as confirmed by the TEM image of the solution-cast film in  [Hasegawa, H.; Hashimoto, T. (1996). Self-assembly and morphology of block copolymer system. In 2, (ed. S. L. Aggarwal and S. Russo), p. 497. Pergamon, London]. Addition of a homopolymer to a near symmetric block copolymer causes swelling of the corresponding block chain, resulting in a curved interface instead of a flat interface to attain a favorable conformational entropy and a uniform packing density).","Electrospinning:","A 21 wt % solution of the above material was prepared by dissolution in a 3:1 mixture by weight of tetrahydrofuran (THF): dimethylformamide (DMF) (Aldrich). It formed a milky gel-like solution that was stable (no further solidification or precipitation takes place during storage) at room temperature. This solution was electrospun using a parallel plate setup as described previously [Shin, Y. M.; Hohman, M. M.; Brenner, M. P.; Rutledge, G. C. 2001, 42, 9955].","The electrical potential, solution flow rate, the protrusion of the spinnerette from the upper plate and the distance between the capillary tip and the collector were adjusted so that spinning was stable and dry nanofibers were obtained (Table 1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0092"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Operating parameters for the electrospinning process,"},{"entry":"according to embodiments of this invention."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Flow rate","Spinnerette protrusion","Tip-to-collector distance","Voltage"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0.05 ml\/min","2 cm","50 cm","30 KV"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)","A JEOL-6060SEM (JEOL Ltd, Japan) scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the general features of the fibers. The fibers were sputter-coated with a 2-3 nm layer of gold for imaging using a Desk II cold sputter\/etch unit (Denton Vacuum LLC, NJ). The fiber diameters were determined using AnalySIS image processing software (Soft Imaging System Corp., Lakewood, USA).","Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM):","A JEOL JEM200 CX (JEOL Ltd, Japan) transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe internal features of the fibers. For lateral viewing the fibers were deposited directly onto a copper TEM grid. For axial viewing, the fibers were fixed in a glycol methacrylate based embedding system. (JB-4 Plus Embedding Kit, TED PELLA. INC.), and then sectioned into 100 nm slices using an ultramicrotome (RMC Scientific Corp. Tucson, Ariz.) with a diamond knife. No staining was necessary, as the intrinsic difference in electron density of PS block and PDMS block provided adequate contrast.","Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC):","The thermal transitions in the as-electrospun fibers of the block copolymer were characterized using a Q1000 modulated differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (TA Instrument Inc., DE). The measurements were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere and the sample was scanned for two cycles from \u2212100 to 200\u00b0 C. with a rate of 10\u00b0 C. per minute.","X-Ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS):","Surface chemistry of the fibers was characterized using a Kratos Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Kratos Analytical, Manchester) with a monochromatized A1 K\u03b1 X-ray source. The XPS signals from the silicon and oxygen of the PDMS block were used to distinguish the two polymer blocks and to obtain the composition of the fiber surface.","Contact Angle and Contact Angle Hysteresis Measurements:","The contact angle of water on the electrospun mat was measured using a Contact Angle Meter G10 (Kruss, Germany). The final result was obtained by averaging at least 4 separate runs. Contact angle hysteresis was obtained by the sessile drop method [Lau, K. K. S.; Bico, J.; Teo, K. B. K.; Chhowalla, M.; Amaratunga, G. A. J.; Milne, W. I.; McKinley, G. H.; Gleason, K. K. 2003, 3, 1701].

A rough estimate for the Flory interaction parameter \u03c7 is obtained by group contribution methods, \u03c7=(100 cm\/mol)\/RT)(\u03b4\u2212\u03b4), [Bristow, G. M.; Watson, W. F. 1958, 54, 1731] where \u03b4=18.6 (J\/cm)and \u03b4=15.4 (J\/cm)are the Hildebrandt solubility parameters for PS and PDMS, respectively [\u2018\u2019 (Eds J. Brandrup and E. H. Immergut). 3rd Edn, Wiley, New York, 1989, P. VII\/557]. For a degree of polymerization N=2771, \u03c7N=1130, well in excess of \u03c7N=10.5 required for microphase separation in a symmetric diblock copolymer according to mean field theory [Leibler, L. Macromolecules, 1980, 13, 1602].","Strong segregation of the PS and PDMS blocks is further evidenced by the glass transition temperature Tg of 105\u00b0 C. exhibited in the DSC curve of . This transition temperature is characteristic of unblended PS. The glass transition of PDMS is \u2212125\u00b0 C. The rule of mixtures [Gordon, M.; Taylor, J. S. J. Appl Chem. 1952, 2, 493] would predict a glass transition of about \u22125\u00b0 C. if the PS and PDMS were well mixed; no such peak is observed in . The endotherm around \u221240\u00b0 C. during heating is attributed to the crystal melting point of PDMS, while the exotherm around \u221275\u00b0 C. during cooling could be due to crystallization [Chu, J. H.; Rangarajan, P.; LaMonte Adams, J.; Register, R. A. 1995, 36, 1569].","From the material composition, the average atomic ratio of carbon to silicon is about 8.8. According to the XPS data shown in , the material layer within several nanometers of the fiber surface exhibits a carbon:silicon ratio of only 5.5, indicative of surface enrichment in the PDMS component. The surface tensions of PDMS and PS are 19.9 mN\/m and 40.7 mN\/m, respectively [Chan, C.-M. \u2018Polymer surface Modification and Characterization\u2019, 1st ed., (1994) Hanser Publishers, Munich]. Since the PDMS block has lower surface tension, it is more likely to segregate to the fiber surface. A similar enrichment of PDMS was reported for the films of PS\/PS-b-PDMS blends [Lee, H.; Archer, L. A. Macromolecules 2001, 34, 4572]. Such a surface segregation of fluorine in electrospun fibers of poly(methyl methacylate-co-tetrahydroperfluorooctyl acrylate) was also observed [Deitzel, J. M.; Kosik, W.; McKnight, S. H.; Beck Tan, N. C.; Desimone, J. M.; Crette, S. 2002, 43, 1025]. The reason that the fiber surface contained not just pure PDMS but also PS may be, in accordance with embodiments of this invention, the fact that solidification during the electrospinning takes place so fast (usually on the order of milliseconds) that PDMS blocks do not have enough time to segregate completely to the surface. The reason that the surface enrichment of PDMS is not apparent in the TEM axial images may be, in accordance with embodiments of this invention, that TEM only yields pictures of individual cross sections, while XPS averages results over the surfaces of all the fibers. The confinement and diameter of the fiber also has an effect on the microphase separation. For example, large fibers tend to contain more PDMS cylinders inside than the small ones. If the diameter is not an integer multiple of the preferred domain spacing, the domains must reorganize to accommodate the incommensuration.","The contact angle measurement and the sliding behavior of the water on the PS-PDMS electrospun mat are shown  () A and B. The contact angle was as high as 163\u00b0 which is much larger than the contact angle of 112\u00b0 for pure PDMS films [Gillmor S. D. et al., 2th Annual International IEEE-EMBS Special Topic Conference on Microtechnologies in medicine & Biology, 2002, Poster 225, 51].","The advancing and receding contact angles measured by the sessile drop method were 164\u00b0 and 149\u00b0, respectively, giving a hysteresis of 15\u00b0. The wetting behavior of the PS-PDMS fiber mat were compared with that of a pure PS fiber mat with comparable fiber sizes (average diameter=300 nm) and pore size distribution (pore sizes ranging from 0.200 to 1.5 mm, as determined by Hg porosimetry, Quantachrome Instruments Poremaster 33). It was found that the PS fiber mat not only had a smaller contact angle (138\u00b0) but also showed a sliding behavior characterized by a much bigger contact area between the mat and the droplet than in the case of PS-PDMS block copolymer fiber, as shown on  () C and D. From these comparisons it can be concluded, in accordance with embodiments of this invention, that the superhydrophobicity observed for the PS-PDMS fiber mat is the combined result of both the roughness of the surface and the excess concentration of PDMS on the surface.","Table 2 presents the composition and conditions for the preparation of additional electrospun superhydrophobic fibers.
