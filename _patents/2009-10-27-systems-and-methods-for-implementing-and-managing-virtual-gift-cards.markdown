Instead of having to develop its own in-house system for administering the sale and redemption of gift cards, a retailer can engage a third party virtual gift card provider to provide administration and development according to the methods and systems described herein, and obtain a set of tools for customizing virtual gift cards according to the retailer's branding and design requirements. Embodiments of the systems and methods described herein also allow purchasers to customize aspects of the virtual gift card, which may increase customer engagement resulting in more sales to the retailer. Moreover, in embodiments in which the virtual gift card interface includes branding and\/or other design elements specific to the retailer, the experience of purchasing or redeeming a virtual gift card can be essentially transparent to the user. For example, instead of being redirected to an obvious third-party website, the user may be redirected to a gift card provider's website using the design elements of the familiar, trusted retailer, which can increase customer trust and willingness to purchase virtual gift cards.","According to embodiments of the systems and methods described herein, a virtual gift card purchaser may buy a virtual gift card for a recipient. In some embodiments, the virtual gift card may be accepted for purchases by a particular retailer or group of retailers. An account (i.e., a database entry) may be created corresponding to the recipient's virtual gift card and credited with the virtual gift card amount selected and paid for by the purchaser. The recipient receives, for example in email or in a web browser, a notification of the virtual gift card. The notification may include a virtual gift card code uniquely correlated to the recipient's virtual gift card. The recipient may then make purchases on-line using the code, and the amount of such purchases will be debited from the recipient's virtual gift card. Alternatively, the recipient may print out an email or a web-page including the virtual gift card code or an encoded representation of the code (such as a bar code) and bring the printout to a physical storefront of a retailer accepting the virtual gift card. At the physical storefront the code may be keyed or scanned into a computer which requests a debit from the recipient's virtual gift card of the amount of purchase. Other aspects and features will be described below.","In embodiments of the systems and methods described herein, a system for providing or administering virtual gift cards may be a hosted service offering which allows a retailer (or other merchant or business) to offer its customers the opportunity to purchase virtual gift cards via its own website or via a third party website. In one embodiment, a system for providing or administering virtual gift cards can be constructed according to a processor model or according to a distributor model.","According to one embodiment, in the processor model the provider of the virtual gift card platform may generate codes that are used to identify virtual gift cards. Additionally, in the processor model the provider of the virtual gift card platform may maintain a database of virtual gift cards. Where the provider maintains such a database, purchases made with the virtual gift card may be directed to the database so that information, such as the remaining balance on the virtual gift card, may be kept up-to-date as purchases are made.","According to another embodiment, in the distributor model the provider of the virtual gift card platform may, instead of generating virtual gift card codes, receive virtual gift card codes from a retailer (or from a third-party generating codes on behalf of a retailer), either in blocks or individually when needed. Additionally, in the distributor model the retailer may maintain its own database of virtual gift cards. In the distributor model, the provider of the virtual gift card platform may not need to be kept apprised of purchases by the virtual gift card recipient.","Processor Model","As noted above, in the processor model the provider of a virtual gift card platform may provide the virtual gift card codes and maintain the database of recipient accounts.","According to one embodiment of the processor model, a purchaser wishing to order a virtual gift card may be redirected to a website of the provider of a virtual gift card platform from a website of the retailer at whose websites and\/or stores the virtual gift card is redeemable. For example, a purchaser may click on an area of the retailer's website marked \u201cget a virtual gift card\u201d or similar and be redirected to a website of the provider.","As seen in , the website of the provider may include an interface  having fields  into which the purchaser can enter information pertaining to the virtual gift card and to the recipient. In one embodiment, the interface  is customized with design elements  particular to the retailer such as the retailer's logo or other design elements. Advantages of this feature include branding for the retailer and transparency for the purchaser. The retailer can rely on the gift card provider to handle providing the virtual gift cards while maintaining its brand presence to the purchaser throughout the process. The purchaser may also retain the experience of shopping with a trusted retailer instead of being obviously redirected to a third-party website.","The fields  in the user interface  may collect information from the purchaser such as a dollar amount of the virtual gift card and the name and\/or email address of the recipient. The interface  may provide the opportunity to select a background image  for the virtual gift card. The background image may, in one embodiment, be selected from a predetermined set of images  presented to the purchaser, for example, images provided by the retailer when configuring the virtual gift card interface . The interface  may, in one embodiment, provide the purchaser the opportunity to upload his or her own image for use as the background, in addition to or instead of providing predetermined image choices. The interface  may provide the purchaser the opportunity to select from a number of predetermined messages (not shown), such as \u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d or \u201cCongratulations!\u201d The interface  may also provide the purchaser with a text field  for optionally entering a personalized message for the recipient. For example, the interface  may provide a text box  into which the purchaser may type any desired text. The purchaser's text will be displayed on the virtual gift card sent to the recipient. In one embodiment, there may be an upper limit on the number of characters (e.g., 90 characters) and\/or the number of lines of text in the customized personal message. The upper limit may be desirable for practicality of implementation as well as to preserve design aspects of the virtual gift card.","According to one embodiment, the interface  may show a preview  of the completed virtual gift card with purchaser-selected or purchaser-created elements in place. As discussed, in one embodiment the interface  may give the purchaser the opportunity to select other design elements of the virtual gift card, such as a picture background (either selected from a predetermined set or uploaded by the purchaser), text color, or other design elements. These design elements may also be displayed in the preview  of the completed virtual gift card. The preview may be displayed in real-time, or upon input from the purchaser. In one embodiment, the interface includes a two-pane presentation in which one pane  includes fields for the purchaser to enter information and\/or select design elements, and the other pane  includes a display area for displaying a preview of the virtual gift card. This gives the purchaser the opportunity to readily visualize the virtual gift card prior to purchase.","For example, as discussed above, according to one embodiment, the interface  provides for the purchaser to enter a personalized message of up to some predetermined number of characters. In one embodiment, the personal message can be previewed on the virtual gift card as it is being written. In another embodiment, the virtual gift card template may be specifically designed so that the personal message text can be displayed in a manner that does not conflict with the other design elements. The preview feature may permit the purchaser to verify that the personal message text does not overlap or otherwise conflict with other design elements in the virtual gift card.","The interface  is further described with reference to . According to one embodiment, the interface  may provide the purchaser an option  for delivery of the virtual gift card immediately upon purchase or at a later date selected or otherwise entered by the purchaser into a delivery date field of the interface. The interface  may also include fields  for entering information about the purchaser and\/or recipient, such as the purchaser's name and\/or email address and the recipient's email.","The interface  is further described with reference to . According to one embodiment, once all of the elements of the virtual gift card have been selected and\/or entered, the interface  provides to the purchaser fields  for entering payment information, such as credit card information, and fields  for entering shipment information. The system may charge the purchaser for the amount of the virtual gift card and, in one embodiment, may also include a fee or service charge. When payment has been approved, the system may send a confirmation message to the purchaser, for example as a webpage, an email message, or both. One example of a confirmation message  can be seen in the interface  of . According to one embodiment, the confirmation message  may include such information as the recipients name, the recipients email address, the date of delivery, the amount of the gift card and\/or the means by which the gift card can be redeemed.","According to one embodiment, the system also generates a virtual gift card code that can be uniquely associated with the virtual gift card being created. The virtual gift code may be generated at any point in the process of creating the virtual gift card and associated with the recipient at any point in the process of creating the virtual gift card. In one embodiment, virtual gift card codes are generated and stored for retrieval and assignment to a particular recipient virtual gift card during the process of creating a virtual gift card. In other embodiments, a virtual gift card code may be generated upon entry of the recipient's name, upon approval of the purchaser's payment for the virtual gift card, or at any other time during the process of generating a virtual gift card.","According to one embodiment, virtual gift card codes may be generated as follows. Code generation may begin with a sequence number beginning, for example, at 1, and incremented each time a code is generated, up to a maximum sequence number (i.e., 1 billion). The sequence number is multiplied by a large prime number. A unique and difficult-to-predict integer is obtained by taking the remainder of this product modulo the maximum sequence number. This approach provides unique numbering (up to the maximum sequence number), without any externally obvious pattern. In some embodiments, the unique number may have prepended to it the provider's BIN (bank identifier number) or IIN (issuer identifier number). The resulting code may also have an additional digit appended to make the full number valid according to a checksum such as the Luhn algorithm. This final Luhn-compliant number is one embodiment of a code that may be used as a unique virtual gift card code, and assigned by the system to a recipient's virtual gift card. It should be understood that many other approaches to generating and\/or validating a unique code for use as a virtual gift card code may be taken. Any other procedure for generating such a code may be used with the systems and methods described in this application.","In one embodiment, once the payment has been approved, a message may be provided to the recipient notifying the recipient that a gift card has been purchased for him or her. Where the purchaser has selected the option of delivering the gift card at a later date, notice to the recipient may be deferred until that date. The notice to the recipient may be, for example as shown in , an email message  identifying the retailer, the purchaser, information on how to redeem the gift card and\/or the amount of the gift card. Similar to the interface  provided to the purchaser, the email message  may include design elements  consistent with the retailer's branding, such as a logo or other images, particular colors and\/or typefaces associated with the retailer's trade dress, or any other design element desired by the retailer.","According to one embodiment, the recipient is provided with the virtual gift card code which, as noted above, was generated and\/or assigned to the recipient's virtual gift card at some prior point. The virtual gift card code (not shown) may be provided in the email message  to the recipient, either directly or encrypted. In some embodiments the code may be provided alphanumerically, or in others encoded form such as a 1D or 2D bar code, or in both forms.","In a further embodiment, the email message  to the recipient may include a link  that the recipient may click on to view a webpage provided by the virtual gift card provider. One embodiment of the webpage  can be seen in . The webpage  likewise may include a display of the recipient's virtual gift card code, either alphanumerically  or in an encoded form such as a 1D- or 2D-bar code , or in both forms. The webpage  provided to the recipient may include design elements consistent with the retailer's branding, such as a logo or other images, particular colors and\/or typefaces associated with the retailer's trade dress, or any other design element desired by the retailer.","After receiving the email message  containing the virtual gift card and\/or viewing the webpage  containing the virtual gift card, the recipient may choose to redeem the virtual gift card either in the retailer's on-line store  or at the retailer's physical store locations . According to one embodiment, the email  and\/or the webpage  provided to the recipient may include a link  to the retailer's on-line store, where the recipient can enter the virtual gift card code to use the virtual gift card toward a purchase. According to another embodiment, the email  and\/or the webpage  provided to the recipient may include a link  to print out the email  and\/or the webpage . To use the virtual gift card in a physical store location, the recipient may print out the email  and\/or the webpage  and bring the printout to the physical store, where the recipient's virtual gift card code may be keyed (or, in embodiments in which the email or webpage includes a barcode, scanned) or otherwise entered into a computer which requests a debit from the recipient's virtual gift card of the amount of purchase.","As discussed above, according to one embodiment, in the processor model the database of virtual gift cards (and associated codes and values) is maintained by the virtual gift card provider. Thus, whether the virtual gift card is redeemed via on-line purchase or via in-store purchase, the retailer's computer communicates the purchase amount to the virtual gift card provider to update the database. It also is to be appreciated that any aspect of the transaction may be handled by the provider's servers.","According to some embodiments, the recipient of the gift card need not redeem the full value of the virtual gift card in a single purchase. Unused value is stored in the database at the provider's server, and the recipient can view the status of his or her virtual gift card by logging into a management system operated by the virtual gift card provider. In one embodiment, the recipient's virtual gift card is updated dynamically as purchases are made, and the recipient can access the database and dynamically view the current balance by accessing a web page provided by the virtual gift card provider. For example, in one embodiments the recipient can visit the webpage  linked in the email  received by the recipient. The link in that email may reference a dynamically-generated page containing information about the recipient's virtual gift card. For example, the link may include a field that is based upon the recipient's virtual gift card code, and pass that field to an application on the provider's server that dynamically generates a web page based upon the current status of the recipient's virtual gift card. If desired, the recipient can make additional purchases at a later date either using the virtual gift card code for an on line purchase, using the original printout with the code or bar code, or by creating a new virtual gift card printout reflecting the new balance at a future date.","According to one embodiment, the system may also provide an application, such as a browser application, that the retailer may use to authorize use of the gift card at any time after payment has been approved. As seen in , the browser application may include an interface  by which the retailer can authorize the use of a gift card. The interface  may include fields  which display authorization information related to the gift card. The authorization information fields  may include such information as the amount requested, the amount approved, the remaining amount on the card, and\/or the determination of whether the card has been approved. In one embodiment, the application is secured using Secure Sockets Layers (SSL), a username\/password requirement and\/or the Internet Protocol (IP) address. Some examples and embodiments of the systems and methods that may be implemented according to the systems and methods described herein may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/946,748, entitled PRE-PAID PAYMENT INSTRUMENT PROCESSING, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","According to some embodiments, the provider of the virtual gift card service can provide reporting, based upon the virtual gift card database, to the recipient, to the retailer, or both. For example, the provider can provide reporting of redemption statistics in real-time or over selected periods of time. The provider may also provide lift data indicating any increase in spending for the retailer's goods and\/or services that can be attributed to the virtual gift card program over any time period. The provider may provide recency data showing a history of the most recent transactions (including purchase and\/or redemption of virtual gift cards) over any time period. The provider can provide any other desired reporting that can be obtained from its database in which the times, amounts, and other data about virtual gift card purchase and redemption transactions are stored. According to one embodiment, reporting may be delivered by the provider through a webpage or browser application.","The development and administration of a virtual gift card by the processor model in accordance with one embodiment of the current invention will now be described in relation to the flow diagram  of . At block , the retailer designs (or has designed on its behalf) a virtual gift card template to be used by the gift card provider. As discussed above, the virtual gift card template may include design elements consistent with the retailer's branding, such as a logo or other images, particular colors and\/or typefaces associated with the retailer's trade dress, or any other design element desired by the retailer. According to one embodiment, the virtual gift card template is stored on a server of the gift card provider. The development of the virtual gift card template will be described in greater detail below.","At block , a purchaser of a virtual gift card uses the virtual gift card template to develop a virtual gift card. The purchaser may be linked to the virtual gift card template on the gift card provider's server by clicking on a link on the retailer's website. However, in another embodiment, the purchaser may access the virtual gift card template on the gift card provider's server directly through a self service kiosk. In one embodiment, the self service kiosk is located in the retailer's store. While developing the virtual gift card, the purchaser may associate the virtual gift card with such information as a recipient's name, recipient's email and\/or the value of the virtual gift card. In one embodiment, the purchaser may also associate the virtual gift card with an encrypted Personal Identification Number (PIN) which is required to redeem the virtual gift card.","At block , the virtual gift card system on the gift card provider's server, generates a unique virtual gift card code for the virtual gift card as discussed above. In one embodiment, the virtual gift card code is a 16-digit identification number. In another embodiment, the virtual gift card code may be displayed on the virtual gift card as a 16-bit alphanumeric number or a 1D or 2D barcode. As discussed above, the virtual gift card code may be generated at any time during the development of the virtual gift card.","At block , the virtual gift card code and monetary value associated with the virtual gift card are stored in a database on the gift card provider's server. At block , the virtual gift card is delivered to the intended recipient. In one embodiment, the virtual gift card is delivered via email as discussed above. According to another embodiment, the date on which the virtual gift card is delivered to the recipient may be pre-determined by the purchaser.","At block , the recipient of the virtual gift card may attempt to redeem the gift card. As discussed above, in one embodiment, the virtual gift card may be redeemed online or in the retailer's store. Depending on whether the recipient redeems the gift card online or in the store, the virtual gift card code may either be entered manually or scanned via the bar code.","After the virtual gift card code is processed, at block  the retailer may use a browser application, as discussed above, to authorize or deny the use of the gift card. According to one embodiment, the use of the gift card will be authorized if the remaining balance on the card is adequate to cover the purchase price and denied otherwise. After the use of the virtual gift card is authorized, at block , information such as the virtual gift card code and the purchase amount is communicated to the gift card provider. At block , based on the information received from the retailer, the gift card provider adjusts information related to the virtual gift card code, such as the remaining balance. Also at block , the gift card provider may store information in its database which may later be used by the retailer to generate statistics.","The system architecture of a system capable of developing and administering virtual gift cards by the processor model in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention will now be described in relation to . The retailer  provides information to the gift card provider  to produce a virtual gift card template. A purchaser  sends information to the virtual gift card provider server  to order a virtual gift card. According to one embodiment, information may be sent to the gift card server  over the internet. The virtual gift card server  generates a virtual gift card and saves information related to the virtual gift card (i.e. the purchased value and the virtual gift card code) in the database  on the server . The server  sends a confirmation to the purchaser . The server  also sends the virtual gift card, or at least an email linking to the virtual gift card, to the recipient . The recipient  is able to redeem the virtual gift card with the retailer . According to one embodiment, the recipient  may either redeem the gift card online at the retailer's website or in the retailer's store. After entering or scanning in the virtual gift card code from the virtual gift card, the retailer  receives information about the virtual gift card (i.e. the available balance on the gift card) from the database  in the server . The retailer  may then either authorize or deny usage of the virtual gift card. According to one embodiment, the retailer  may authorize the use of a virtual gift card through the use of a browser application as discussed above. In response to the virtual gift card being authorized, updated information such as the updated gift card balance is sent back to the server  from the retailer  to update the database .","Distributor Model","One difference between embodiments structured according to the processor model and those structured according to the distributor model is that in the distributor model, the virtual gift card codes are provided by the retailer (or by a third-party providing virtual gift card codes on behalf of the retailer) instead of being generated by the virtual gift card provider.","The virtual gift card codes may be provided to the virtual gift card provider in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, a block of virtual gift card codes may be stored in a database of the provider for issue (i.e., assignment to a particular virtual gift card) upon sale of a virtual gift card. In such embodiments, the retailer may generate a block of such virtual gift card codes itself and provide them to the virtual gift card provider, or obtain them from a third party. In the latter case the retailer may receive a block of codes from the third party and pass them to the virtual gift card provider or instruct the third party to provide the codes directly to the virtual gift card provider.","In other embodiments, the virtual gift card codes may be provided to the provider one at a time, when needed. For example, the provider can obtain one or more virtual gift card codes as-needed during the process of generating a virtual gift card via a system call that requests a virtual gift card code (or any needed number of virtual gift card codes) from the retailer or from the third-party providing codes on behalf of the retailer.","Additionally, in embodiments of the distributor model, rather than the provider maintaining a database of virtual gift cards, the retailer maintains its own database of recipient accounts (or, a third party maintains such a database on behalf of the retailer). In such embodiments, there may be no need to update the provider when a virtual gift card is redeemed or partially redeemed. Accordingly the provider may not be involved in any aspects of transactions involving the virtual gift card after the virtual gift card is purchased and delivered.","Apart from such back-end implementation details, however, a virtual gift card system according to the distributor model may appear substantially the same to purchasers and recipients of virtual gift cards. Thus, according to one embodiment, the distributor model system can operate almost exactly as described above in connection with the processor model. The interfaces and features made available to the purchaser as described above in relation to the processor model may be implemented in embodiments of the distributor model as well. However, according to one embodiment in which the retailer operates its own recipient account database, the provider may not provide virtual gift card use data or statistics, and the recipient will not be able to view its redemption history, monitor balance information, or print out new virtual gift cards by viewing a webpage generated by the provider.","The development and administration of a virtual gift card by the distributor model in accordance with one embodiment of the current invention will now be described in relation to the flow diagram  of . At block , the retailer, or third party on behalf of the retailer, generates virtual gift card codes (as described above). At block , the generated virtual gift card codes are transmitted to the gift card provider and stored in a database. As discussed below, blocks  and  are optional and may be replaced by additionally optional blocks  and .","At block , the retailer designs (or has designed on its behalf) a virtual gift card template. As discussed above, the virtual gift card template may include design elements consistent with the retailer's branding, such as a logo or other images, particular colors and\/or typefaces associated with the retailer's trade dress, or any other design element desired by the retailer. According to one embodiment, the virtual gift card template is stored on a server of the gift card provider. The development of the virtual gift card template will be described in greater detail below.","At block , a purchaser of a virtual gift card uses the virtual gift card template to develop a virtual gift card. The purchaser may be linked to the virtual gift card template on the gift card provider's server by clicking on a link on the retailer's website. However, in another embodiment, the purchaser may access the virtual gift card template on the gift card provider's server directly through a self service kiosk. In one embodiment, the self service kiosk is located in the retailer's store. While developing the virtual gift card, the purchaser may associate the virtual gift card with such information as a recipient's name, recipient's email and\/or the value of the virtual gift card. In one embodiment, the purchaser may also associate the virtual gift card with an encrypted Personal Identification Number (PIN) which is required to redeem the virtual gift card.","At block , in response to the virtual gift card codes being previously generated and stored in the provider's database in blocks  and , the virtual gift card provider associates one of the gift card codes with the virtual gift card. Alternatively, as discussed above, blocks  and  may be optional. If the gift card codes were not previously generated, at block  the gift card provider requests and subsequently receives a virtual gift card code from the retailer. At block , the virtual gift card provider associates the received gift card code with the virtual gift card.","At block , the virtual gift card information (i.e. the virtual gift card codes, recipient information and purchase amount) are updated in the recipient database maintained by the retailer. This is different than in the processor model in which such information is stored in a database in a virtual gift card provider database.","At block , the virtual gift card is delivered to the intended recipient. In one embodiment, the virtual gift card is delivered via email as discussed above. According to another embodiment, the date on which the virtual gift card is delivered to the recipient may be pre-determined by the purchaser.","At block , the recipient of the virtual gift card may attempt to redeem the gift card. As discussed above, in one embodiment, the virtual gift card may be redeemed online or in the retailer's store. Depending on whether the recipient redeems the gift card online or in the store, the virtual gift card code may either be entered manually or scanned via the bar code.","After the virtual gift card code is processed, at block  the retailer may use a browser application, as discussed above, to authorize or deny the use of the gift card. According to one embodiment, the use of the gift card will be authorized if the remaining balance on the card is adequate to cover the purchase price and denied otherwise. In response to the virtual gift card being authorized, at block  the information saved in the retailer's recipient database (i.e. remaining balance) is updated.","The system architecture of a system capable of developing and administering virtual gift cards by the distributor model in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention will now be described in relation to . The retailer  provides information to the gift card provider  to produce a virtual gift card template. The retailer  may also send virtual gift card codes to the virtual gift card provider . The virtual gift card codes may be stored in a database . As discussed above, the virtual gift card codes may also either be directly provided to the gift card provider  by a third party  or provided to the gift card provider  by a third party  via the retailer .","A purchaser  sends information to the virtual gift card provider  to develop a virtual gift card. According to one embodiment, information may be sent to the gift card server  over the internet. The virtual gift card provider  generates a virtual gift card and associates the virtual gift card with one of the virtual gift card codes. The virtual gift card information (i.e. the purchased value and the virtual gift card code) may be saved in the retailer's database .","The provider  sends a confirmation to the purchaser . The provider  also sends the virtual gift card, or at least an email linking to the virtual gift card, to the recipient . The recipient  is able to redeem the virtual gift card with the retailer . According to one embodiment, the recipient  may either redeem the gift card online at the retailer's website or in the retailer's store. After entering or scanning in the virtual gift card code from the virtual gift card, the retailer  checks the database  for information about the virtual gift card (i.e. the available balance on the gift card). As such, unlike in the processor model, it is unnecessary to communicate with the gift card provider when redeeming the virtual gift card. The retailer  may then either authorize or deny usage of the virtual gift card. According to one embodiment, the retailer  may authorize the use of a virtual gift card through the use of a browser application as discussed above. In response to the virtual gift card being authorized, the database  is updated with current virtual gift card information (i.e. remaining balance).","Bulk Purchase System","At times it may be desirable to purchase multiple virtual gift cards simultaneously. For example, an employer wishing to purchase a gift card for every one of his employees may find it convenient to configure and pay for multiple gift cards in a single interface, rather than stepping through the entire configuration and payment process repeatedly. For this reason, a system for providing a virtual gift card may include an interface for configuring multiple gift cards at once. The purchaser may access such a bulk purchase interface by selecting an option within the virtual gift card purchase interface.","According to one embodiment of a bulk purchase interface, as seen in , the interface  may include fields  in which the purchaser can enter denominations, recipient information, and\/or customized messages for virtual gift cards any number of recipients. For example, the purchaser may select (or upload) a background image  that will be used for all the bulk-purchased virtual gift cards and then enter denominations, recipient information, and\/or customized messages for a plurality of recipients. In one embodiment, the purchaser may be given the option to specify the same denomination and\/or the same customized message for a plurality of recipients. In further embodiments, the interface  may allow the purchaser to upload a text file, spreadsheet file, or similar file containing denominations, recipient information, and\/or customized messages for any number of recipients, instead of entering such information by hand into the interface . In such embodiments the system may specify one or more acceptable file formats (i.e. comma-delimited text).","Once the purchaser has submitted information specifying the virtual gift card parameters for all of the bulk virtual gift card recipients, the purchaser can proceed to the payment interface as described above. The virtual gift card provider's system may generate and assign a unique virtual gift card code to each of the specified recipients (in a system according to the processor model) or assign from a database a unique virtual gift card code to each of the specified recipients (in a system according to the distributor model).","Once the bulk purchase is complete, the virtual gift cards generated for the multiple recipients may be handled individually as described above. For example, the virtual gift card provider's system may send an email to each virtual gift card recipient, the email including the corresponding virtual gift card code as assigned above. Each recipient may redeem his or her own virtual gift card in any of the ways described above, including by shopping on-line with his or her virtual gift card code, and\/or bringing to a physical store location a printout of the email or of a webpage containing the virtual gift card in alphanumeric and\/or bar code form. In one embodiment, each individual recipient of a virtual gift card created as part of a bulk purchase can have access to dynamically updated information, as described above. Any other tracking or reporting that is possible for any virtual gift card system can also be implemented for virtual gift cards purchased in bulk.","Additionally, according to one embodiment, the purchaser of the bulk purchase of virtual gift cards may be provided, for example though a purchaser account at the provider's website, statistics relating to the bulk purchase. For example, the provider may provide access to data as to which or how many recipients have received, viewed, and\/or used their virtual gift cards. Such data may be updated in real-time and dynamically accessed when the purchaser requests a report.","Virtual Gift Card Template System","Also provided in embodiments of the systems and methods described herein is a readily customizable system of on-line tools that the retailer can use to set up, configure, re-configure, and monitor a virtual gift card program. Instead of engaging an in-house or third party developer to develop tools for administering a virtual gift card program, a retailer can visit a provider's website and use the tools provided to quickly and easily set up a virtual gift card template with as much branding, as much specificity, and as many options for the purchaser as the retailer wishes. As described further below, the retailer can, in embodiments, have access to monitoring and analysis tools for studying sales and redemption data in real-time.","According to one embodiment, the virtual gift card provider may provide the retailer with an application that the retailer may use to design a template for virtual gift cards associated with the retailer. The application permits the retailer to specify one or more configurations of design elements of the virtual gift card. The application may be, for example, a browser application or a stand-alone application that runs on a computer of the retailer and sends the retailer-customized templates to the provider for use in providing virtual gift cards. An advantage of this feature is that the retailer can control aspects of the appearance of the virtual gift card, allowing the retailer to preserve its branding features (such as logo, typeface, design palate, &c.) even in virtual gift cards generated by the provider.","In one embodiment, the application presents an interface to a designer acting on behalf of the retailer that the designer may use to specify design elements of the retailer's virtual gift cards. For example, the interface may permit the designer to specify one or more background images for the virtual gift cards, the size, color, and placement of any text elements on the virtual gift card, or any other design feature. The interface may offer the designer a preview of the virtual gift card template either in real time or in response to a request from the designer.","Once the virtual gift card template is completed, it can be implemented by the virtual gift card provider. The virtual gift card template may be presented to a virtual gift card purchaser through an interface such as those described above, where the purchaser can provide any remaining information needed or desired to complete the virtual gift card. The design template application may include fields allowing the designer to specify which elements of the design are fixed within the template and which are subject to further customization by a virtual gift card purchaser.","In at least one embodiment, at least some design elements of the template may be specified by the designer such that a purchaser using an interface to purchase a virtual gift card may not be given the option to customize the design elements further. For example, the designer may specify that a logo of the retailer appear in a particular position on the virtual gift card, such that the purchaser does not have the option to remove the logo or move it to a different position on the gift card. As another example, the designer may specify that text on the virtual gift card appear in a particular size or particular color, such as a color associated with the retailer's trade dress.","In one embodiment, at least some design elements of the template may be specified with the designer such that additional specification is left to a purchaser of a virtual gift card. For example, a designer may provide any number of background images that are stored in the template. These background images may be presented to the purchaser in the purchase interface so that the purchaser may select one for the virtual gift card. As another example, the designer may specify in the template that text on the virtual gift card appear in a particular color, but leave to the purchaser the exact content of the text, such as the recipient's name and\/or a personalized message provided to the recipient. As another example, the designer may specify the location of text, such as the recipient's name, on the virtual gift card, but permit the purchaser to select the color and the content of the text.","In one embodiment, after a virtual gift card template has been established and stored, a designer can edit the template at any time via the design template application. In another embodiment the design template is stored in a database of the virtual gift card provider and can be updated at any time via the design template application. Updates to the design template may take effect immediately, and be reflected the next time the design template is accessed by a purchaser.","Computer System","Various aspects and functions described herein in accord with the present invention may be implemented as hardware or software on one or more computer systems.

As depicted, the computer system  includes a processor , a memory , a bus  or other internal communication system, an interface , a storage system  and a communication device . Processor , which may include one or more microprocessors or other types of controllers, can perform a series of instructions that result in manipulated data. Processor  may be a commercially available processor such as an Intel Pentium, Motorola PowerPC, SGI MIPS, Sun UltraSPARC, or Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC processor, but may be any type of processor or controller as many other processors and controllers are available. As shown, processor  may be connected to other system elements, including a memory , by bus .","Memory  may be used for storing programs and data during operation of the computer system . Thus, memory  may be a relatively high performance, volatile, random access memory such as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or static memory (SRAM). However, memory  may include any device for storing data, such as a disk drive or other non-volatile storage device. Various embodiments in accord with the present invention can organize memory  into particularized and, in some cases, unique structures to perform the aspects and functions disclosed herein.","Components of computer system  may be coupled by an interconnection element such as bus . Bus  may include one or more physical busses (for example, busses between components that are integrated within a same machine), but may include any communication coupling between system elements including specialized or standard computing bus technologies such as IDE, SCSI, PCI and InfiniBand. Thus, bus  may enable communications (for example, data and instructions) to be exchanged between system components of the computer system .","The computer system  also includes one or more interface devices  such as input devices, output devices and combination input\/output devices. Interface devices  may receive input or provide output. More particularly, output devices may render information for external presentation. Input devices may accept information from external sources. Examples of interface devices include, among others, keyboards, bar code scanners, mouse devices, trackballs, magnetic strip readers, microphones, touch screens, printing devices, display screens, speakers, network interface cards, etc. The interface devices  allow the computer system  to exchange information and communicate with external entities, such as users and other systems.","Storage system  may include a computer readable and writeable nonvolatile storage medium in which instructions are stored that define a program to be executed by the processor. Storage system  also may include information that is recorded, on or in, the medium, and this information may be processed by the program. More specifically, the information may be stored in one or more data structures specifically configured to conserve storage space or increase data exchange performance. The instructions may be persistently stored as encoded signals, and the instructions may cause a processor to perform any of the functions described herein. The medium may, for example, be optical disk, magnetic disk or flash memory, among others. In operation, processor  or some other controller may cause data to be read from the nonvolatile recording medium into another memory, such as the memory , that allows for faster access to the information by the processor than does the storage medium included in the storage system . The memory may be located in storage system  or in memory . Processor  may manipulate the data within memory , and then copy the data to the medium associated with the storage system  after processing is completed. A variety of components may manage data movement between the medium and integrated circuit memory element and the invention is not limited thereto. Further, the invention is not limited to a particular memory system or storage system.","Although computer system  is shown by way of example as one type of computer system upon which various aspects and functions in accord with the present invention may be practiced, aspects of the invention are not limited to being implemented on the computer system as shown in . Various aspects and functions in accord with the present invention may be practiced on one or more computers having a different architectures or components than that shown in . For instance, computer system  may include specially-programmed, special-purpose hardware, such as for example, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) tailored to perform a particular operation disclosed herein. While another embodiment may perform the same function using several general-purpose computing devices running MAC OS System X with Motorola PowerPC processors and several specialized computing devices running proprietary hardware and operating systems.","Computer system  may include an operating system that manages at least a portion of the hardware elements included in computer system . A processor or controller, such as processor , may execute an operating system which may be, among others, a Windows-based operating system (for example, Windows NT, Windows 2000 (Windows ME), Windows XP, or Windows Vista) available from the Microsoft Corporation, a MAC OS System X operating system available from Apple Computer, one of many Linux-based operating system distributions (for example, the Enterprise Linux operating system available from Red Hat Inc.), a Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems, or a UNIX operating systems available from various sources. Many other operating systems may be used, and embodiments are not limited to any particular operating system.","The processor and operating system together define a computing platform for which application programs in high-level programming languages may be written. These component applications may be executable, intermediate (for example, C# or JAVA bytecode) or interpreted code which communicate over a communication network (for example, the Internet) using a communication protocol (for example, TCP\/IP). Similarly, aspects in accord with the present invention may be implemented using an object-oriented programming language, such as SmallTalk, JAVA, C++, Ada, or C# (C-Sharp). Other object-oriented programming languages may also be used. Alternatively, procedural, scripting, or logical programming languages may be used.","Additionally, various aspects and functions in accord with the present invention may be implemented in a non-programmed environment (for example, documents created in HTML, XML or other format that, when viewed in a window of a browser program, render aspects of a graphical-user interface or perform other functions). Further, various embodiments in accord with the present invention may be implemented as programmed or non-programmed elements, or any combination thereof. For example, a web page may be implemented using HTML while a data object called from within the web page may be written in C++. Thus, the invention is not limited to a specific programming language and any suitable programming language could also be used.","A computer system included within an embodiment may perform functions outside the scope of the invention. For instance, aspects of the system may be implemented using an existing commercial product, such as, for example, Database Management Systems such as SQL Server available from Microsoft of Seattle Wash., Oracle Database from Oracle of Redwood Shores, Calif., and MySQL from Sun Microsystems of Santa Clara, Calif. or integration software such as WebSphere middleware from IBM of Armonk, N.Y.","Other elements of the virtual gift card management system may include other types of well-known systems such as credit card processing systems such as those available commercially from Hypercom, Verifone, Nurit, and other providers. Various systems of the virtual gift card management system may integrate with other types of payment systems, such as debit card processing systems, check card readers, PC-based payment terminal systems, among others. For instance, various embodiments may be capable of working with one or more systems or components coupled through one or more communication networks (e.g., networks ). For example, the virtual gift card management system may integrate with, or be incorporated into, one or more Internet-based systems (e.g., Internet sites ), retailer systems (e.g., element ) or other computer-based systems that interact with gift card programs. According to one embodiment, these types of systems may be adapted to manage offers associated with gift cards.
