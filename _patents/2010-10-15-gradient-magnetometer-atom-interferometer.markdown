title: Gradient magnetometer atom interferometer
abstract: Measuring a magnetic gradient according to the present invention includes generating a beam of like atoms with magnetic sublevels, applying a first pulse of electro-magnetic radiation to the beam of atoms to create a coherent superposition of the magnetic sublevels in the atoms in which the superposition results in a plurality of beams following separate paths and in which at least two of the paths are arms of an interferometer, applying a second pulse of electromagnetic radiation to both beams of atoms a time T later with characteristics substantially similar to the first pulse and in which the product of the Rabi frequency and T now must equal π (versus π/2 in the first pulse), whereby the states of the atoms in the two arms of the interferometer are coherently interchanged and are redirected towards each other. The beams of atoms are then recombined by apply a third pulse of electromagnetic radiation a time T±Δt after the second pulse with characteristics substantially similar to the first pulse such that the paths form a closed loop. Then, a detecting pulse of light is used to detect the number of atoms in one magnetic sublevel versus another magnetic sublevel.

No. 61\/255,900, filed on Oct. 29, 2009.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, licensed, and used by or for the U.S. Government.","The field of atomic magnetometry has seen significant progress in the last several years. Magnetometers have been demonstrated based on quantum coherence in dilute gases (Budker, D.; Gawlik, W.; Kimball, D. F.; Rochester, S. M.; Yashchuk, V. V.; Weis, A. Rev. Mod. Phys. 2002, 74, 1153-1201, and references within), high density gases (Sautenkov, V. A.; Lukin, M. D.; Bednar, C. J.; Novikova, I.; Mikhailov, E.; Fleischhauer, M.; Velichansky, V.; Weach, G. R.; Scully, M. O. Phys. Rev. A 2000, 62, 023810-1-4; Matsko, A. B.; Novikova, I.; Scully, M. O.; Welch, G. R. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2001, 87, 133601-1-4), and in a spin exchange-free environment (Kominis, I. K.; Kornack, T. W.; Allred, J. C.; Romalis, M. V. Nature 2003, 422, 596; Allred, J. C.; Lyman, R. N.; Kornack, T. W.; Romalis, M. V. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2002, 89, 130801-1-4). Additionally, through a careful trade-off of power, size, etc. against sensitivity, very small yet sensitive magnetometers have been developed. (Schwindt, P. D. D.; Hollberg, L.; Kitching, J. Rev. Sci. Inst. 2005, 76, 126103; Balabas, M. V.; Budker, D.; Kitching, J.; Schwindt, P. D. D.; Stalnaker, J. E. JOSA B 2006, 23, 1001-1006). In particular, sensitivities approaching 100 attoTesla Hzhave been demonstrated. However, in magnetically noisy environments, increased sensitivity does not necessarily improve the overall performance of the system, since the magnetometer can be dominated by ambient noise, rather than the signal. This is often the case in applications involving airborne anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and mine detection. Thus, there is a need for a magnetometer that provides increased sensitivity and still performs well in magnetically noisy environments.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which are a part of this patent disclosure, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention, as claimed, may be practiced. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.","Embodiments according to the present invention involve a system and a method for an atom interferometer gradient magnetometer that utilizes a coherent superposition of magnetic sublevels. In one embodiment the system can be created, using only three levels.

It should be noted that, although the description below is based on laser-cooled atoms, beams of faster moving atoms can be used as well for the invention. Laser-cooled atoms have been used in this embodiment to reduce the size of the device.","The experimental embodiment centers on a standard rubidium 85 magneto-optical trap (MOT), although other atoms can be used; for example, sodium, cesium, potassium and the other alkali and alkaline earth elements. In general, a MOT is a device that cools down non-charged (neutral) atoms to temperatures near absolute zero and traps them at a certain place using spatially varying magnetic fields and circularly polarized light. To simplify the discussion, only the major components of the MOT are presented. However, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that a number of standard optical components that are not shown would be included in any implementation of a MOT and that this configuration is not unique.  show top and side views, respectively, of an ultra-high vacuum chamber  (P<10torr) that contains a MOT .

In this implementation, a repumper field is delivered to the atoms via a second input port along the x-fiber. Other implementations could inject the repumper field along any or all fibers or could frequency-modulate the master and\/or slave to provide the repumper field.","Nulling the Stray Magnetic Field","It is important to have a good idea of what the magnetic field is (in the absence of the trapping magnetic field) at the location of the atoms inside the vacuum chamber. Because embodiments according to the present invention are intended for making measurements in Earth field, shielding was not applied to the experimental chamber. Instead, stray fields were nulled using three orthogonal sets of coils (20 turns per coil) mounted on an aluminum frame in the shape of a cube having sides approximately 69 cm centered on the vacuum chamber. The method of polarization rotation as described, for example, in Labeyrie, G.; Miniatura, C.; Kaiser, R. Phys. Rev. A 2001, 64, 033402-1-7, and Nash, J.; Narducci, F. A. J. Mod. Opt. 2003, 50, 2667-2675, were used to measure the magnetic field. The amount of polarization rotation can be calculated from Equations (34a)-(34f) by calculating the real part of {tilde over (\u03c1)}and it is, of course, a function of the magnetic field. A time sequence similar to Nash, J.; Narducci, F. A. J. Mod. Opt. 2003, 50, 2667-2675, was employed.","The MOT is formed by turning on the trapping field, the repumper, and the gradient coils at t\u00bc0 for 2995 ms, at which time the repumper and the gradients coils are switched off (in 125 ns and 5 ms, respectively). The cooling beams are left on for an additional 5 ms for additional cooling (although no particular effort was made to induce polarization gradient cooling) and to hold the atoms while the gradient coils were decaying. At t=3000 ms, a bias field Bis switched on (switching time of about 3 ms) while the cooling fields are switched off, leaving the atoms in the dark. At t=3005 ms, a scanning probe field whose center frequency is the cooling resonance of the atoms and whose radius is roughly the size of the MOT is turned on along with the repumper (still oriented along the x axis of the MOT), passed though the sample and scanned through the resonance in 2 ms.","The probe field is incident on the MOT at 45\u00b0 with respect to the x-y trapping beams and is linearly polarized 45\u00b0 with respect to a calcite beam splitter located after the MOT. The probe beam enters the vacuum chamber via vacuum port  and exits the chamber via vacuum port . The calcite splitter separates the beam of light into its horizontal and vertical components, but into parallel but displaced beams. This arrangement makes it convenient to send the light onto a two-sided detector and a common transimpedance amplifier for noise reduction. The bias field was switched on after the fall of the trapping beams, rather than at the very beginning of the run because to compare the rotation signal for otherwise equal MOTs. Since the rotation signal is dependent on the density, changing the bias field under which the MOT is formed might change the density. In this manner, the density of the MOT remained the same from shot to shot.","A typical trace is displayed in ). By varying the current in the bias coils, we could reduce the amplitude of the rotation signal until it disappeared and then changed sign (indicating the reversal of the total field B=B+B). A plot of the rotation amplitude versus applied current is shown in ). By selecting the current at which the rotation signal crosses through zero, we can establish the zero point in the magnetic field along the axis of the probe field. In principle, this can be done along the other two axes to zero the field in all three directions. In this particular embodiment, the field can be measured at 90\u00b0 to the current arrangement in the x-y plane, but because of the presence of the z trapping fields, the measurements cannot be repeated along that axis. Thus, the measurement of the Larmor precession is used as an alternate technique to zero the field along the z direction.","Measurement of the Occupation of the Magnetic States","The probe field described in the section above is delivered to the chamber via a two-by-two 50\/50 fiber. Through the introduction of a second scanning laser and a few wave-plates, the relative population in either of the magnetic levels can be probed. For these measurements, the probe field (now denoted by Probe 1) is sent to the chamber along the vertically oriented polarization axis of the fiber so that the field emerging from the fiber is polarized vertically. The light is then sent through a quarter waveplate and then to the chamber. A second waveplate is placed after the chamber followed by a polarizing beam splitter. The quarter waveplate is oriented, in the absence of the MOT, so that the light is completely transmitted to a detector. Light from a second scanning laser (Probe 2), also tuned to the cooling transition is incident on the second input port of the fiber. The polarization of this laser at the input face is horizontal, 90 with respect to the Probe 1 field, so that at the exit port of the chamber, the light is reflected by the polarizing beam splitter, rather than transmitted. The fields of both lasers were kept very weak so as not to influence the relative populations. We followed the timing sequence already described in Section 4.1. Both scanning lasers were turned on at the same time and utilized the same ramp signal for the scan. However, the center frequency of each laser was adjusted so that the Probe 1 laser reached resonance (and passed through it) before the Probe 2 laser. A typical trace is displayed in . Since the absorption is proportional to the population in the ground state, we can use this technique to measure the population in one ground state versus the other. The next step is to apply the techniques described in the section immediately above, to coherently move population from one state to the other, before finally demonstrating our interferometer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["801","802","804","806","808","803","804","806","806","810","804","812","806","807","813","807","814","816"]},"The light out of the fiber  is split three times at polarizing beam splitters ,  and .
