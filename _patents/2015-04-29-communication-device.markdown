Upon operating the controlled apparatus, the user needs to select the apparatus to be operated, via a display unit, buttons, and keys. Thus, the user needs to perform a plurality of operations on the remote control terminal when selecting the controlled apparatus.","The structure in PTL 2 has the following problem. Since an operation sheet needs to be prepared for each electronic apparatus, more operation sheets are needed as the number of electronic apparatuses which the user wants to control increases.","The structure in PTL 3 has the following problem. The remote controller transmits the angle change amount of the movement of the operator to a control device, and the control device determines the location pointed by the operator based on the angle change amount. Thus, a plurality of devices, i.e. a remote control device, a control device, and a display device, need to be provided in order to control the apparatus. Besides, PTL 3 neither discloses nor suggests a method of, in the case of operating a plurality of controlled apparatuses, registering a controlled apparatus selected by the operator and instructions to the selected controlled apparatus.","To solve the conventional problems described above, the present invention has an object of enabling a mobile device such as a mobile phone or a smartphone to easily provide an extended user interface such as universal remote control, home appliance content download, and the like, using various sensors such as an RFID, GPS, and motion sensor of the mobile device.","To achieve the stated object, a wireless communication terminal according to an aspect of the present invention includes: a position sensing unit that obtains position information of the wireless communication terminal; an apparatus information obtainment unit that obtains, from a control target apparatus which is an apparatus to be controlled by the wireless communication terminal, apparatus information for identifying the control target apparatus, by near field communication (NFC); a request generation unit that generates a request for operation information of the control target apparatus based on the apparatus information; an external communication unit that transmits the request to the control target apparatus or a server that holds the operation information, and receives the operation information; a storage unit that stores the received operation information in association with the position information obtained when performing the NFC with the control target apparatus; an operation information transmission unit that transmits the operation information to the control target apparatus; a direction sensing unit that senses direction information of a direction to which the wireless communication terminal is pointed; a directional space obtainment unit that calculates a directional space of the wireless communication terminal, based on the position information obtained by the position sensing unit and the direction information obtained by the direction sensing unit; and a selection unit that selects operation information of an apparatus present in the directional space, from position information of at least one control target apparatus assigned to operation information in the storage unit.","Thus, the communication device according to an aspect of the present invention can store position information of the communication device and operation information of an apparatus in association with each other. Moreover, a controlled apparatus can be operated merely by pointing the mobile device to the controlled apparatus, through the use of position information of the controlled apparatus.","Thus, according to the present invention, a controlled apparatus can be operated merely by pointing the mobile device to the controlled apparatus, through the use of position information of the controlled apparatus. Furthermore, operation information of a home appliance can be easily obtained by single press of a button, using proximity wireless communication.","The following describes embodiments according to the present invention with reference to the drawings. In the following embodiments, various aspects of the communication device according to the present invention are described.","[Embodiment 1]","Embodiment 1 according to the present invention is described below.  is a schematic diagram of Embodiment 1 of the present invention. Here, a communication system including an image capturing device (camera) , a TV , and a server  is illustrated. In , the image capturing device  capturing images is illustrated on a left-hand side, while the image capturing device  reproducing the captured images is illustrated on a right-hand side.","The image capturing device  is an example of the communication device according to the aspect of the present invention. Here, the image capturing device  is implemented as a digital camera. For units used in capturing images, the image capturing device  includes a first power supply unit , a video processing unit , a first antenna , a first processing unit , a second memory , and a RF-ID antenna (second antenna) . The second memory  holds medium identification information , captured image state information , and server specific information . The RF-ID antenna  is used for a RF-ID unit. For units used in reproducing images, the image capturing device  includes the first power supply unit , a first memory , a power detection unit , an activation unit , the second memory , a second processing unit , a modulation unit switch , a communication unit , a second power supply unit , and the RF-ID antenna . The second memory  holds the medium identification information , the captured image state information , and the server specific information .","The TV  is an example of an apparatus (device, appliance) connected to a reader via a communication path. In more detail, the TV  is a television receiving apparatus used to display image data captured by the image capturing device . The TV  includes a display unit  and a RF-ID reader\/writer .","The server  is a computer that holds image data uploaded from the image capturing device  and that downloads the image data to the TV . The server  has a storage device in which data  is stored.","When images of objects such as scenery are captured, the images are converted to captured data (image data) by the video processing unit . Then, in communicable conditions, the image data is transmitted to an access point using the first antenna  for a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and eventually recorded as the data  via the Internet to the predetermined server .","Here, the first processing unit  records the captured image state information  regarding the captured image data onto the second memory  in a RF-ID unit . The captured image state information  indicates at least one of (a) date and time of capturing each of the images, (b) the number of the captured images, (c) date and time of finally transmitting (uploading) an image, (d) the number of transmitted (uploaded) images, and (e) date and time of finally capturing an image. In addition, the captured image state information  includes (f) serial numbers of images that have already been uploaded or images that have not yet been uploaded; (g) a serial number of a finally captured image; and the like.","In addition, the first processing unit  generates a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the data  that is uploaded to the server . The first processing unit  records the server specific information  onto the second memory . The server specific information  is used to access the image data. The medium identification information  is also recorded on the second memory . The medium identification information  is used to determine whether the device embedded with the RF-ID (RF-ID unit) is a camera, a card, or a post card.","When a main power of the camera (the first power supply unit  such as a battery) is ON, the second memory  receives power from the main power. Even if the main power of the camera is OFF, the external RF-ID reader\/writer located outside supplies power to the RF-ID antenna . This enables the passive second power supply unit  without any power like a battery to adjust a voltage to provide power to respective units in a RF-ID circuit unit including the second memory. Thereby, it is possible to supply power to the second memory  so that the data is exchanged between the second memory  and the external device to be recorded and reproduced. Here, the second power supply unit  is a circuit generating power from radio waves received by the second antenna (RF-ID antenna) . The second power supply unit  includes a rectifier circuit and the like. Whenever the main power is ON or OFF, the data in the second memory  is read and written by the second processing unit . When the main power is ON, the data in the second memory  can be read and written also by the first processing unit . In other words, the second memory  is implemented as a nonvolatile memory, and both the first processing unit  and the second processing unit  can read and write data from and to the second memory .","When the image capturing device  completes capturing images of a trip or the like and then the captured images are to be reproduced, the image capturing device  is moved into proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV , as illustrated on the right side of  as being the situation of reproducing images. Then, the RF-ID reader\/writer  supplies power to the RF-ID unit  via the second antenna , and thereby the second power supply unit  provides power to the units in the RF-ID unit , even if the main power (the first power supply unit ) of the image capturing device  is OFF. The captured image state information  and the server specific information  are read by the second processing unit  from the second memory , and transmitted to the TV  via the second antenna . The TV  generates a URL based on the server specific information , then downloads the image data of the data  from the server , and eventually displays, on the display unit , thumbnails or the like of images in the image data. If it is determined based on the captured image state information  that there is any captured image not yet uploaded to the server , the determination result is displayed on the display unit . If necessary, the image capturing device  is activated to upload, to the server , image data of the captured image not yet uploaded.","(a), (b), and (c) in  are an external front view, an external back view, and an external right side view, respectively, of the image capturing device  according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.","As illustrated in (c) in , the first antenna  used for a wireless LAN and the second antenna  used for the RF-ID unit are embedded in a right side of the image capturing device . The antennas are covered with an antenna cover  made of a material not shielding radio waves. The RF-ID unit operates at a frequency of 13.5 MHz, while the wireless LAN operates at a frequency of 2.5 GHz. The significant difference in frequency prevents interference between them. Therefore, the two antennas  and  are seen overlapping with each other from the outside, as illustrated in (c) in . The structure decreases an installation area of the antennas, eventually reducing a size of the image capturing device . The structure also enables the single antenna cover  to cover both of the two antennas as illustrated in (c) in , so that the part made of the material not shielding radio waves is minimized. The material not shielding radio waves, such as plastic, has a strength lower than that of a metal. Therefore, the minimization of the material can reduce a decrease in a strength of a body of the image capturing device . The image capturing device  further includes a lens  and a power switch . The units assigned with numeral references  to  will be described later.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0739","num":"0738"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"1"},"Image data captured by an image capturing unit  is provided to a recording\/reproducing unit  via the video processing unit  and then recorded onto a third memory . The image data is eventually recorded onto an Integrated Circuit (IC) card  that is removable from the image capturing device .","The above processing is instructed by the first processing unit  that is, for example, a Central Processing Unit (CPU). The image data, such as captured photographs or video, is provided to an encryption unit , a transmission unit  in a communication unit , and then the first antenna , in order to be transmitted to an access point or the like by radio via a wireless LAN, WiMAX, or the like. From the access point or the like, the image data is transmitted to the server  via the Internet . In the above manner, the image data such as photographs is uploaded.","There is a situation where a part of the image data fails to be uploaded because, for example, the communication state is not good or there is no nearby access point or base station. In the situation, some images have already been uploaded to the server , and the other images have not yet been uploaded. Therefore, the image data in the server  is different from the image data captured by the image capturing device . In Embodiment 1 of the present invention, the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV  or the like reads the server specific information  and the like from the second memory  in the RF-ID unit  of the image capturing device . Then, based on the readout information, a URL or the like of the server  is generated. According to the URL, the TV  accesses the server  to access the data  such as a file, folder, or the like uploaded by the image capturing device . Then, the TV  downloads the uploaded images from among the images captured by the image capturing device , and displays the downloaded images. The above method will be described in more detail later.","If a part or all of the captured images is not uploaded as image data of the data  in the server , a problem would occur that a user downloading the images to the TV  cannot watch a part of the images on the TV .","In order to solve the problem, in Embodiment 1 of the present invention, the first processing unit  causes a recording\/reproducing unit  to indicate information regarding a state of captured images, such as information of uploading state, to the captured image state information  in the second memory .","The above is described in more detail with reference to . In the second memory , synchronization information  is recorded. The synchronization information  indicates whether or not image data in the server  matches image data captured by the camera, in other words, whether or not the image data in the server  is in synchronization with the image data captured by the camera. In Embodiment 1 of the present invention, the TV  reads the captured image state information  from the second memory  via the second antenna . The captured image state information  makes it possible to instantly determine whether or not the data  in the server lacks any image. If the determination is made that there is any image that has not yet been uploaded, then the determination result is displayed on the display unit of the TV . Here, the TV  also displays a message of \u201cPlease upload images\u201d to a viewer. Or, the TV  issues an instruction to the camera via the RF-ID antenna  to transmit an activation signal to the activation unit , thereby supplying power to the first power supply unit  of the image capturing device . Thereby, the TV  causes the image capturing device  to upload, to the server , the images in the first memory  or the like of the image capturing device , which have not yet been uploaded, via a wireless LAN, a wired LAN, the second antenna (RF-ID antenna) , or the like.","Since transmission via the RF-ID antenna  has a small transfer amount, transmission of the image data as originally captured takes a considerable time to upload and display the image data. This causes a user to feel unpleasant. In order to avoid this, according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention, when the image data is transmitted via the RF-ID antenna , thumbnails of the images not yet uploaded are transmitted instead. The thumbnails can shorten apparent upload time and display time, suppressing unpleasant feeling of the user. Most of current RF-ID of a HF band has a transfer amount of several hundreds kbps. However, development of RF-ID having a quad-speed has been examined. The quad-speed RF-ID has a possibility of achieving a transfer amount of several Mbps. If thumbnails of images not yet uploaded are transmitted, it is possible to transmit several dozens of thumbnails in one second. If thumbnails are displayed in a list, thumbnails of all images including images not yet uploaded can be displayed on the TV within a time period a general user can tolerate. The above is one of practical solutions.","If the image capturing device is forced to be activated to upload images not yet uploaded as described above, the most speedy and stable path is selected from a wireless LAN, the RF-ID antenna , and a wired LAN, to be used for uploading and displaying on the TV. In the situation where the image capturing device  receives power from the outside via the second antenna , the communication unit  transmitting signals to the second antenna  performs communication with the outside by a low-speed modulation method. On the other hand, in the situation where the image capturing device  can receive power from the first power supply unit  or the like, the communication unit  switches the modulation method to a modulation method having a large signal point, such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), or 64-QAM, as needed, in order to achieve high-speed transfer to upload the image data not yet uploaded in a short time. Furthermore, when the power detection unit  detects, for example, that the first power supply unit  or the like does not have enough power or that the image capturing device  is not connected to an external power, the first power supply unit  stops supplying power and a modulation switch unit  switches the modulation method employed by the communication unit  to a modulation method having a smaller signal point or less transfer rate. As a result, it is possible to prevent that the capacity of the first power supply unit  is reduced to be equal to or less than a set value.","There is another solution for power. When power is not enough, the second processing unit , the communication unit , or the like sends a power increase request signal to the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV  via the second antenna , to request for power support. In response to the request, the RF-ID reader\/writer  increases providing power to have a value greater than the set value for the power used in reading data from the RF-ID unit. Since the RF-ID unit receives more power via the second antenna , the RF-ID unit can provide power to the communication unit  or the first processing unit . Thereby, a power amount of a battery  for the first power supply unit  is not reduced. Or, without the battery , the image capturing device  can practically and unlimitedly continue transmission.","As still another method, uploaded-image-data information  in  can be used. In uploaded-image-data information , uploaded-image information  such as serial numbers of photographs, is recorded. It is also possible to use hashed information  generated by hashing the information . As a result, a data amount is reduced.","The TV  can read the above information to be compared to information of images captured by the camera, thereby obtaining information of images not yet uploaded.","As still another method, not-yet-uploaded image data existence identification information  can be used. The not-yet-uploaded image data existence identification information  includes an existence identifier  indicating whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. Since existence of images has not yet been uploaded is notified, data in the second memory  can be significantly reduced.","It is also possible to use not-yet-uploaded-image number  indicating the number of images not yet uploaded. Since the image capturing device  allows the TV  to read the information, a viewer can be informed of the number of images to be uploaded. In this case, a data capacity in addition to the number is recorded as the captured image state information . Thereby, the image capturing device  enables the TV  to display a more exact prediction time required to upload images not yet uploaded.","It is also possible to use not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information  that is generated by hashing information regarding images not yet uploaded.","In addition, it is also possible to record a final capturing time (final capturing date\/time)  in the second memory . Later, the TV  reads the final capturing time . The TV  is connected to the server  to compare the final capturing time  to a capturing date of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server . Thereby, it is possible to easily determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. If images are captured and assigned with serial numbers sequentially from an older image, it is possible to record only a final image serial number . The final image serial number  is compared to a serial number of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server . Thereby, it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. It is also possible to record, onto the second memory , captured image information  that is, for example, serial numbers of all captured images. Thereby, the TV  later accesses the server  to match the serial numbers to images uploaded to the server . As a result, it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. When the captured image information  is used, use of hashed information  generated by hashing the captured image information  can compress the captured image information .","The second memory  further stores Unique IDentification (UID)  of the RF-ID unit, camera ID , and the medium identification information . Even if the main power of the camera (except a sub-power for backup etc. of a clock) is OFF, these pieces of information can be read by the TV  via the second antenna  to be used for identifying the camera or the user or authenticating a device (apparatus). When the user comes back from an overseas trip or the like, the camera is likely to have a small charge amount of the battery. However, according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention, the camera can be operated to transmit information without battery, which is highly convenient for the user. The medium identification information  includes an identifier or the like indicating whether the medium or device embedded with the RF-ID unit is a camera, a camcorder, a post card, a card, or a mobile phone. The identifier enables the TV  to identify the medium or device. Thereby, the TV  can display a mark or icon of the camera or postcard on a screen as illustrated in , as will be described. The TV  can also change processing depending on the identifier.","The second memory  also stores image display method instruction information . For example, in the situation where a list display  in  is selected, when the second antenna  is moved into proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV , the image capturing device  (camera) causes the TV  to display a list of thumbnails of images, such as photographs.","In the situation where slide show  is selected, the image capturing device  causes the TV  to sequentially display images from a newer one or an older one.","In a lower part of the second memory  in , there is a region for recording the server specific information .","The server specific information  allows a camera operator to display images on the TV screen by a preferred method.","The server specific information  includes server URL generation information  that is source information from which a server URL is generated. An example of the server URL generation information  is login ID . The server specific information  has a region in which server address information  and user identification information  are recorded. In practice, login ID  and the like are recorded. In addition, there is a region for storing a password . An encrypted password  may be stored in the region. The above pieces of information are used to generate a URL by a URL generation unit  that is provided in the image capturing device , the RF-ID unit , the camera function used for capturing images in the image capturing device , or the TV . The URL is used for accessing a group of images corresponding to the image capturing device  or the user in the server . If the URL generation unit  is provided in the RF-ID unit , the URL generation unit  receives power from the second power supply unit .","It is also possible to generate URL  without using the above pieces of information and store the generated URL  directly to the second memory .","It is characterized in that the above-described pieces of information stored in the second memory  can be read by both the second processing unit  in the RF-ID unit and the first processing unit  in the camera function.","The above structure allows the TV  reading the RF-ID unit  in the camera to instantly obtain the pieces of information regarding uploading state, the sever address information, the login ID, the password, and the like. Thereby, the TV  can download image data corresponding to the camera from the server , and display the image data at a high speed.","In the above situation, even if the main power of the image capturing device  is OFF, the RF-ID reader\/writer supplies power to the second power supply unit  to activate (operate) the image capturing device . Therefore, power of the battery  in the image capturing device  is not reduced.","Referring back to , the first power supply unit  receives power from the battery  to provide power to the units in the camera. In a quiescent state, however, a third power supply unit  provides weak power to the clock  and the like. In some cases, the third power supply unit  supplies backup power to a part of the second memory .","The RF-ID unit  receives power from the second antenna to provide power to the second power supply unit , thereby operating the second processing unit , or operating a data receiving unit , a recording unit , a reproducing unit , a data transfer unit  (the communication unit ), and the second memory .","Therefore, in a quiescent state of the camera, no power is consumed. As a result, it is possible to keep the battery  of the camera longer.","The processing performed by the image capturing device  (referred to also as a \u201cmedium\u201d such as a camera or card) and the processing performed by the TV and the RF-ID reader\/writer are explained with reference to a flowchart of .","If the main power is OFF in Step in , it is determined in Step whether or not activation setting of the RF-ID reader\/writer for the main power OFF is made. If the activation setting is made, then the RF-ID reader\/writer  is turned ON in Step and changed to be in a power saving mode in Step ","In Step , impedance or the like of an antenna unit is measured, or a nearby sensor is measured. When the RF-ID unit is moved into proximity of an antenna of the RF-ID reader\/writer  in Step , it is detected in Step whether or not the RF-ID unit is in proximity of or contacts the antenna. If it is detected that the RF-ID unit is in proximity of or contacts the antenna, then the RF-ID reader\/writer  starts supplying power to the antenna of the medium in Step . In Step , in the medium, the second power supply unit is turned ON and thereby the second processing unit starts operating. As Step , communication between the medium (camera or card) and the RF-ID reader\/writer  starts.","In Step , the TV determines whether or not the RF-ID reader\/writer  receives communication from the medium. If the RF-ID reader\/writer  receives communication, then mutual authentication starts in Steps and in . If it is determined in Steps and that the mutual authentication is successful, information is read out from the second memory in Step . In Step , the readout information is transmitted to the RF-ID reader\/writer . In Step , the RF-ID reader\/writer  receives the information. In Step , the TV  side makes a determination as to whether or not the identification information or the like of the second memory is correct. If the identification information or the like is correct, then it is determined in Step whether or not the TV  has identification information indicating automatic power ON. If the TV  has identification information, then it is determined in Step whether or not a main power of the TV is OFF. If the main power of the TV is OFF, the main power of the TV is turned ON in Step of . In Step , the TV  side makes a determination as to whether or not the second memory  has forced display instruction. If the second memory  has the forced display instruction, then the TV  side changes an input signal of the TV to a screen display signal for displaying the RF-ID in Step . In Step , the RF-ID reader\/writer  reads format identification information. In Step , the RF-ID reader\/writer  reads information from the second memory by changing a format of the information to a format according to the format identification information. In Step , the TV  side makes a determination as to whether or not the second memory has a \u201cpassword request flag\u201d. If the second memory has the \u201cpassword request flag\u201d, then the RF-ID reader\/writer  reads an \u201cID of TV not requesting password entry\u201d from the second memory in Step . In Step , the TV  side makes a determination as to whether or not ID of the TV  matches the \u201cID of TV not requesting password entry\u201d. If the ID of the TV  does not match the \u201cID of TV not requesting password entry\u201d, then the medium reads out a password from the second memory in Step . In Step , the medium decrypts the password that has been encrypted. In Step , the medium transmits the decrypted password to the TV  side. Here, in Steps , , and , it is also possible to store the password in a storage device in the server  as the data  in the server .","In Step , the RF-ID reader\/writer  receives the password. In Step , the TV  displays a password entry screen. In Step , the TV  determines whether or not the input password is correct. The determination may be made by the server . If the determination is made that the input password is correct, then the TV  performs display based on the information and program read from the second memory in the RF-ID unit in Step ","In Step of , the TV  side determines whether or not the medium identification information  in the RF-ID unit in the second memory indicates that the medium is a camera. If the medium identification information  indicates a camera, then the TV  displays an icon (characters) of a camera (camera icon) on the display unit in Step . On the other hand, if the medium identification information  does not indicate a camera, then it is determined in Step whether or not the medium identification information  indicates a post card. If the medium identification information  indicates a post card, then the TV  displays an icon of a post card (post-card icon) in Step . On the other hand, if the medium identification information  does not indicate a post card, the TV  further determines in Step whether or not the medium identification information  indicates an IC card. If the medium identification information  indicates an IC card, then the TV  displays an icon of an IC card in Step . On the other hand, if the medium identification information  does not indicate an IC card, the TV  still further determines in Step whether or not the medium identification information  indicates a mobile phone. If the medium identification information  indicates a mobile phone, then the TV  displays an icon of a mobile phone on a corner of the TV screen.","In Steps and of , the RF-ID reader\/writer  reads service detail identification information from the server or the second memory. In Step , the TV  side determines whether or not the service detail identification information indicates image display service. In Step , the TV  side determines whether or not the service detail identification information indicates a post card service such as direct mail. In Step , the TV  side determines whether or not the service detail identification information indicates advertising service. In Steps and , the RF-ID reader\/writer  obtains the server specific information  from the second memory of the medium. In Step , the TV  side determines whether or not the second memory stores the URL . If the second memory does not store the URL , then the processing proceeds to Steps and at which the TV  obtains the server address information  and the user identification information  from the second memory.

However, it is also possible to use the UID to identify the image server storing the image data. Here, it is assumed that, in a communication system including a plurality of image servers, UID is associated with an image server storing image data captured by an image capturing device identified by the UID. Under the assumption, if the operation program is created so that a URL of the image server can be identified with reference to the UID, the TV  executing the operation program can identify, by using the UID, the image server associated with the UID from the plurality of image servers and thereby download the image data from the identified image server.","It should also be noted that the identification information for identifying the image capturing device  is not limited to UID. The identification information maybe any other information regarding the image capturing device , such as a serial number, a product serial number, a Media Access Control (MAC) address, or information equivalent to the MAC address, for example, an Internet Protocol (IP) address. Moreover, if the image capturing device  serves as an access point on a wireless LAN, the identification information maybe a Service Set Identifier (SSID) or any information equivalent to SSID.

The operation program may be described in any other programming language. For example, the operation program described in Java\u2122 can be easily executed by various apparatuses (devices), because the program execution circumstances called JavaVM\u2122 have broad versatility.

Then, the operation program is executed to download a server program from the server , and executes the downloaded server program. For example, if the language code indicates Japanese language, the TV  is connected to the server  having a program storage unit  in which a server program compliant to Japanese language is stored, and then the server program is obtained from the program storage unit  to be executed in the TV .

If the language code indicates Japanese language, then the TV  selects, from the server specific information, a sever address of a server having a program storage unit  storing an operation program for processing compliant to Japanese (S). On the other hand, if the language code does not indicate Japanese language, then the TV  selects, from the server specific information, a server address of a server having a program storage unit  storing an operation program for processing compliant to English (S). Next, the TV  is connected to the server  with reference to the selected server address (S). The TV  downloads a server program from the server  (S, S).

In Embodiment 1 of the present invention, RF-ID is used to perform authentication. In more detail, an authentication program including a MAC address  is recorded, as an operation program, in the second memory  in the RF-ID unit  of the image capturing device . When the image capturing device  is moved into proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV , the image capturing device  provides the authentication program to the TV . The authentication program includes not only the MAC address but also a cryptography key for authentication (hereinafter, \u201cauthentication cryptography key\u201d) and an authentication command. When the TV  recognizes that the information provided from the RF-ID unit  includes the authentication command, the TV  performs authentication processing. The communication unit  in the RF-ID unit  cannot communicate with the TV , until the image capturing device  is physically located in proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer . Therefore, it is extremely difficult to intercept the communication between the image capturing device  and the TV  which is performed in a house. In addition, since the image capturing device  is moved into proximity of the TV  to exchange data, it is possible to prevent that the image capturing device  authenticates a wrong device (apparatus), such as the TV  in a neighbor or a DVD recorder  in the user's house.","The following is an example of an authentication method without using RF-ID with reference to . A user inputs, to the TV , (a) MAC addresses of terminals to be authenticated, such as the camera (the image capturing device ) and the DVD recorder , which the user intends to authenticate for communication, and (b) authentication cryptography keys  for the terminals. The TV  receiving the inputs transmits an appropriate message called a challenge , to a target terminal having the MAC address. When the image capturing device  receives the challenge , the image capturing device  encrypts the challenge  using the authentication cryptography key , and returns the encrypted challenge  to the TV  that is a terminal from which the challenge  has been provided. In receiving the encrypted challenge , the TV  decrypts the encrypted challenge  using the authentication cryptography key . Thereby, the TV  can authenticate the authentication cryptography key  to prevent user's error and intervention of other malicious users. Next, the TV  encrypts a cryptography key for data (hereinafter, a \u201cdata cryptography key \u201d) using the authentication cryptography key . Then, the TV  transmits the encrypted data cryptography key to the image capturing device . Thereby, it is possible to perform the encrypted data communication between the TV  and the image capturing device . The TV  performs the above-described processing also with the DVD recorder  and other apparatuses (terminals)  and  in order to share the data cryptography key among them. Thereby, the TV  can perform encrypted communication with all terminals (devices, apparatuses, or the like) connected in the home network.","On the other hand,  illustrates an authentication method using RF-ID. In the authentication method using RF-ID, the image capturing device  (camera) generates an authentication program . The camera provides the generated authentication program from the RF-ID unit  in the camera to a RF-ID unit  in the TV . The authentication program includes an authentication command, a MAC address of the camera, and an authentication cryptography key  for the camera. When the TV receives the authentication program with the authentication command, the TV  retrieves the MAC address and the authentication cryptography key  from the RF-ID unit . The TV  encrypts a data cryptography key using the retrieved authentication cryptography key  and transmits the encrypted data cryptography key to the retrieved MAC address. The transmission is performed by a wireless-LAN device (terminal). In the authentication method using RF-ID, the authentication is performed automatically without any user's input. Therefore, there is no problem caused by user's input errors. In addition, since the image capturing device  (camera) needs to be moved into proximity of the TV , it is possible to prevent intervention of other malicious users. This authentication method using RF-ID can eliminate pre-processing such as the above-described challenge. Moreover, the action of physically moving the image capturing device  (camera) into proximity of the TV  enables the user to easily recognize which terminals the camera has authenticated. Furthermore, if the authentication cryptography key  is not included in the authentication program, the authentication may be performed by a technique of general public key authentication.

It should be noted that the program generation unit  can generate a new operation program based on the above-described information, which is a method of generating a new operation program. The program generation unit  can also generate such a new operation program by updating an operation program that has been already generated.","The program generated by the program generation unit  is executable by the TV . The program should be compiled into a machine language used in a system controller (not shown) of the TV , so that the system controller can execute the program.

For example, there is the situation where, while the user watches on the TV  a TV program provided by general broadcast waves, the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV  becomes communicable with the image capturing device  via the second antenna . In the situation, the forced display instruction  is used to automatically set the TV  into a browser watching mode so that image data provided from the image server is displayed on the TV .

The following is an example in the situation where the option of language code optimization selection in the format identification information  is selected. If the language code of the TV  indicates Japanese language, the program generation unit  selects a Japanese site as the URL to be connected. On the other hand, if the language code of the TV  does not indicate Japanese language, the program generation unit  selects an English site as the URL to be connected. Or, the URL generation unit  may generate two URLs for the Japanese site and the English site, and provide the two URLs to the program generation unit .","The program part storage unit  holds program command information used by the program generation unit  to generate a program. A program part stored in the program part storage unit  may be a general library or an Application Programming Interface (API).

However, the commands (programs) are not limited to the above. For example, if a command for the forced display instruction is to be generated as a program, the program generation unit  can also generate a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus (device) executing the program has a display device or display function, and adds the generated determination command to the program. Thereby, the command for the forced display instruction is executed only if the apparatus executing the program has a display device or display function. As a result, the determination command can prevent confusion in the apparatus executing the program. The same goes for a command for the forced print instruction. It is preferable that the program generation unit  also generates a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus executing the program has or is connected to a printing function, and adds the generated determination command to the program.

On the other hand, if the determination is made that the language code does not indicate Japanese language, then a connection command for an English site is selected from the connection commands in the program (S). It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment 1 that a determination is made as to whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language, and thereby a connection command is selected from the connection command for connecting to a Japanese site and the connection command for connecting to an English command. However, it is also possible that the program includes a plurality of connection programs compliant to various language codes. Thereby, the program can be compliant to two or more language codes.

If the connection is failed, then the display unit of the TV  displays warning indicating the connection failure (S). On the other hand, if the connection is successful, then a command for displaying a slide show of an image file stored in the server is executed to display the slide show (S).","It should be noted that the above is the situation where the operation program is for displaying images as a slide show. However, the operation program is not limited to the above. The program may be used for performing list display, forced display, or forced printing. If the operation program is for forced display, a step (command) of automatically changing setting of the TV  to setting of displaying an image file stored in the server is added to the program. Thereby, the user does not need to change the setting of the TV  by manual in order to display images provided from the image server. In the case of the forced printing, a command for automatically changing setting of the TV  to a printable mode is added to the program. Moreover, in the case of each of the forced printing and forced display, a determination command for determining whether or not the TV  has a printing function or a displaying function is added to the program. Thereby, the forced print command is not executed in an apparatus (device) without a printing function. Furthermore, the operation program in Embodiment 1 of the present invention may be a connection program for leading other programs. For example, the operation program may be a loader program, such as a boot-loader for loading other programs to be executed.","As described above, Embodiment 1 of the present invention is characterized in that the program generation unit  is included in the first processing unit  of the image capturing device  that is a device having RF-ID communication means (such as the data transfer unit  and the second antenna ). It is also characterized in that the program generated or updated by the program generation unit  is executed by a different device (apparatus) except the image capturing device  according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention that is a communication device having RF-ID.","Conventionally, a device having RF-ID needs to transfer ID information (tag information), which the device has, from a RF-ID communication unit to another device (for example, the TV  according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention). The device (apparatus) receiving the ID information should previously hold operation programs each unique to a corresponding device having RF-ID. Therefore, if new products having RF-ID technology appear, the receiving device needs to install an operation program corresponding to the new products and execute the program. Otherwise, the receiving device is excluded as not being compliant to the new products. The installation of operation programs requires technical knowledge. Not everyone can perform the installation. Therefore, if various new devices having RF-ID are produced, other devices such as the TV  of Embodiment 1 of the present invention become obsolete. As a result, property values of user's devices are damaged.","According to the disclosure of Embodiment 1 of the present invention, the device having RF-ID technology has the program generation unit  and sends not ID information (tag information) but a program to another device (apparatus) such as the TV . The apparatus such as the TV  receives and executes the program. Therefore, the receiving apparatus does not need to previously have operation programs for various devices having RF-ID. Even if a new device having RF-ID technology appears, the receiving apparatus does not need to install a new program for the device. Therefore, usability is significantly improved.","Therefore, the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have application programs for respective items, kinds, or application systems of various objects having RF-ID. Thereby, the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have a storage device, either, for holding various application programs. In addition, maintenance such as version-up of the programs in the terminal is not necessary.","The program generated by the program generation unit  is useful if it is executable in any execution platforms such as a Java\u2122 language. Therefore, if the device (apparatus) such as the TV  executing programs has a Java\u2122 virtual machine, programs generated by any devices (apparatuses) can be executed.","It should be noted that the program generation unit  according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention may have a function of updating the program previously stored in the program storage unit  of the second memory . The situation of updating a program produces the same advantages as that in the situation of generating a program. The generating or updating performed by the program generation unit  may be generating or updating data used in executing a program by the TV . In general, the program includes additional initialization setting data. The additional data is used to switch an execution mode or to set a flag. Therefore, generating or updating of the additional data is equivalent to generating or updating of the program, without deviating from the inventive concepts of the present invention. This is because, for execution of a program, it depends on design whether a parameter for mode switching or the like is to be hold and read as data, or is to be included in the program to be executed. Therefore, when the program generation unit  according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention generates or updates a program, the program generation unit  can also generate data such a parameter sequence used by the program. The parameter is generated based on the forced display instruction , the forced print instruction , the image display method instruction information , the format identification information , or the like stored in the second memory .","The following describes characteristic structures and processing of the second memory  and the first processing unit  in the image capturing device  that is a communication device having RF-ID according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention.

The use status detection unit  includes sensors each detecting a trouble in operation of a corresponding unit included in the image capturing device . Results of the detection of the sensors in respective units are provided to the use status detection unit . The sensors for the respective units provide the use status detection unit  with trouble information, battery duration, a power consumption amount, and the like. For example, the image capturing unit  provides the use status detection unit  with information indicating whether or not an image capturing operation of the image capturing unit  has any trouble (whether or not the image capturing unit  functions correctly, and whether or not the image capturing unit  responds to a call from the use status detection unit ). The video processing unit  provides the use status detection unit  with information indicating whether or not data processing for image data captured by the image capturing unit  has any trouble (whether or not the video processing unit  functions correctly, and whether or not the video processing unit  responds to a call from the use status detection unit ). The first power supply unit  provides the use status detection unit  with a voltage level of the battery and a total power consumption amount. The communication unit  provides the use status detection unit  with information indicating whether or not the communication unit  is successfully connected to the server or the Internet (whether or not the communication unit  functions correctly, and whether or not the communication unit  responds to a call from the use status detection unit ). The display unit provides the use status detection unit  with information indicating whether or not display processing has any trouble, whether or not the display unit correctly responds to a call from the use status detection unit , and the display unit functions correctly. Based on the above pieces of status information provided regarding the respective units, the internal trouble detection unit  in the use status detection unit  determines whether or not each of the units has any trouble in its functional operation. If there is a trouble, then the use status detection unit  provides the program generation unit  with information for specifying the trouble. The use status detection unit  has a power consumption detection unit . The power consumption detection unit  generates power consumption information based on the total power consumption information provided form the power supply unit, and then provides the power consumption information to the program generation unit .","The program generation unit  generates a program for displaying, on the TV , the information for specifying a trouble or the power consumption information which is provided from the use state detection unit . For generation of a program, instruction sets to be included in the program are previously stored in the program part storage unit .

This considerably simplify changing or updating of a program, which has been necessary for conventional techniques to change operations of apparatuses. In addition, it is possible to deal with addition of various new functions and an increase of cooperative apparatuses. Moreover, proximity communication using RF-ID technology is a simple operation achieved by simply bringing a device into proximity of an apparatus, which the user can easily understand.

In Embodiment 2, the same password is set for each of the above-described image viewing, printing, and downloading processes. It is preferable, however, to set a different password to each of image viewing, printing, and downloading processes, so that a level of security can be set independently.","As described above, in the system according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention, the image capturing device  uploads captured images to the server connected to the image capturing device  via the first antenna. When the image capturing device  is prevented to the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV , the image capturing device  transmits the server URL generation information , the captured image state information , and the image display method instruction information  from the RF-ID unit  to the TV  by the RF-ID communication. Then, the TV  connects to the server to which the image capturing device  has uploaded the captured images, then downloads the captured images from the server, and displays the captured images. Here, it is determined whether or not the captured images in the server  are in synchronization with the captured images in the image capturing device . If the synchronization is failure, the TV  displays notification of the synchronization failure on the display unit . Thereby, the user can display the captured images only by presenting the image capturing device  to the TV , although the user conventionally has to remove a recording memory from the camera (the image capturing device ) to be equipped to the TV  in order to view the images. Thereby, even the user who is not familiar with operations of digital devices can easily display the images on the TV .","[Embodiment 3]","Embodiment 3 according to the present invention is described below.","First, Embodiment 3 is explained in summary.  is a schematic block diagram of an electronic catalog display system according to Embodiment 3. The electronic catalog display system according to Embodiment 3 includes an electronic catalog server information input device , an electronic catalog notification card , the TV , and an electronic catalog server . The electronic catalog server information input device  includes a RF-ID writer . The electronic catalog notification card  includes a RF-ID unit . The TV  includes a RF-ID reader  and a network communication unit . The electronic catalog server  includes an electronic catalog database  and a customer attribute database .","The electronic catalog server information input device  writes electronic catalog server information from the RF-ID writer  to the RF-ID unit  attached to the electronic catalog notification card . The electronic catalog server information is provided from a user who provides services of an electronic catalog (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201cprovider user\u201d). When a user who receives the services of the electronic catalog (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201ccustomer user\u201d) brings the electronic catalog notification card , in which the electronic catalog server information is written, into proximity of the TV , the RF-ID reader  in the TV  reads the electronic catalog server information from the RF-ID unit . In addition, the TV  transmits, based on the readout electronic catalog server information, a request for obtaining an electronic catalog to the electronic catalog server  set on a network via the network communication unit . Furthermore, when transmitting the request to the electronic catalog server, the TV  transmits also user information, which is previously inputted in the TV , to the electronic catalog server . The electronic catalog server  receives the request for the electronic catalog and the user information from the TV . First, the electronic catalog server  obtains customer attribute data from the customer attribute database  based on the user information. Next, from the electronic catalog database , the electronic catalog server  obtains electronic catalog data associated with the customer attribute data. Then, the electronic catalog server  transmits the obtained electronic catalog data to the TV  from which the request for the electronic catalog has been transmitted. The TV  displays the electronic catalog data received from the electronic catalog server , and thereby receives purchase operations from the customer user to purchase products in the electronic catalog data.","The following describes the electronic catalog display system according to Embodiment 3 in more detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1031","num":"1030"},"figref":["FIG. 49","FIG. 50"],"b":["520","520","520","522","521","523","523","522","524"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1032","num":"1031"},"figref":"FIG. 51","b":["47","502","47","91","21","502","52","105","95","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1033","num":"1032"},"figref":["FIG. 52","FIGS. 7 to 20"],"b":["45","45","45","588","588","583","509","502","504","45","45"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1034","num":"1033"},"figref":["FIG. 53","FIG. 57","FIG. 58","FIG. 54"],"b":["506","506","45","600","45","45","506","506","508","45","506","508","602","507","506","507","506","602","45","600","506"]},"The following describes processing of the TV  after downloading the electronic catalog data, with reference to a flowchart of . The processing regarding obtaining of the electronic catalog server information from the RF-ID unit in Steps S to S is the same whichever the electronic catalog data is downloaded or not. At S, it is determined whether or not the electronic catalog data associated with the electronic catalog server information received from the RF-ID unit has already been downloaded and displayed. If the electronic catalog data has not yet been downloaded, then the TV  downloads the electronic catalog data from the server at S and displays the electronic catalog data at S. The download processing is the same as the download processing described in Embodiment 1.","If it is determined at S that the electronic catalog data has already been downloaded, then the TV  issues a signal of a predetermined key (for example, a signal of a Decide key) to execute operations for the displayed electronic catalog data (S). Here, as illustrated in an example of a screen display of the electronic catalog data in , a screen presents the customer user with a few of options for a next operation to be executed by the customer user for the displayed electronic catalog data. Then, a focus circulates among the options on the screen (as illustrated as options  and  in ) to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. This allows the customer user to execute an operation for selecting or purchasing each product in the electronic catalog data, for example, only by presenting the electronic catalog notification card  having the RF-ID unit  to the TV , when the focus indicates a desired option of the customer user.","The second memory  according to Embodiment 3, which is embedded in the RF-ID unit  on the electronic catalog notification card , may be a Read Only Memory (ROM). In this aspect, the electronic catalog server information input device  serves as a RF-ID memory data input unit in manufacturing the RF-ID unit, or a RF-ID memory data input means in a RF-ID manufacturing system. In general, a RF-ID unit having a ROM unit is inexpensive more than a RF-ID unit having a rewritable memory. Therefore, the RF-ID unit having a ROM allows the provider user sending a great number of electronic catalog notification cards to reduce a cost.","It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment 3 that a focus circulates among the options on the screen of the TV  (as illustrated as options  and  in ) to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. However, the method of operating the electronic catalog data displayed on the screen by using the electronic catalog notification card  having the RF-ID unit  is not limited to the above. For example, it is also possible that the receiving unit  of the TV  sequentially receive pieces of information from the RF-ID unit and counts the sequential receiving processes, then thereby calculates a time period (RF-ID proximity time period) during which the RF-ID unit is in proximity of the TV , and eventually moves a focus indicating a selection candidate displayed on the screen based on the RF-ID proximity time period. With the above structure, the following operation for the electronic catalog is possible. Only when the RF-ID unit is in proximity of the TV, the focus displayed on the screen is circulated to change the selection candidate. If the RF-ID unit is away from the TV, the focus is stopped. After a predetermined time period after stopping of the focus, the selection candidate on which the focus is stopped is decided as selection. In this operation for the electronic catalog, the customer user can actively operate the electronic catalog by using the RF-ID unit, without waiting for the focus, which automatically circulates among options every predetermined time period, to arrive at a user's desired option.","It should also be noted that it has been described in Embodiment 3 that the electronic catalog server information input device  has the key input receiving unit  which receives inputs by the input keys operated by the provider user in order to obtain the electronic catalog server information. However, the following configuration is also possible. That is, the electronic catalog server information input device  has a communication interface to communicate with the image server. The image server holds the server information to be transmitted to the electronic catalog server information input device . The electronic catalog server information input device  receives the server information from the image server, in order to obtain the server information. This configuration in which the server information is stored in the image server allows the electronic catalog server information input device  to eliminate inputting to the image server. Especially, when a plurality of the electronic catalog server information input devices  are operated for a single image server, this configuration is highly convenient.","The conventional techniques have a program that users who are not familiar with operations of digital devices such as personal computers should learn operations of the devices to do online shopping. However, the system according to Embodiment 3 enables users using electronic catalogs to do online shopping and the like, simply by bringing received cards or post cards into proximity of TVs. Therefore, even users who are not familiar with online terminals such as personal computers and mobile phones can easily enjoy shopping on TV screens.","[Embodiment 4]","Embodiment 4 according to the present invention is described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1042","num":"1041"},"figref":"FIG. 59","b":["1","47","46","45","45","45","42","42","45","45","45","42","42","800","800","500","42","45","500","47","800","801","801","801","46","45","45","47"]},"The structure and processing of the image capturing device  according to Embodiment 4 are the same as described in Embodiment 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1044","num":"1043"},"figref":["FIG. 60","FIG. 61","FIG. 61","FIG. 61","FIG. 61"],"b":["45","811","47","1","801","570","47","801","811","584","585","586","584","509","509","45","821","820","810","585","586","810","810","509","823","509","575","576"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1045","num":"1044"},"figref":"FIG. 62","b":["801","42","800","500","801","801","801","801","45","811","47","570","572","573","42","45","573","573","45"]},"It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment 4 that the user inputs the destination information to the TV , but the user may input not only the destination information such as an address and a name but also a message to be printed with an image on a post card. The TV  receives the input message together with the destination information and provides them to the image server . The printer  prints them on the post card.  in  illustrates an example of a screen of the TV  on which a message to be printed is inputted. If the user can select an image to be printed on the post card and also input an message added to the image, a flexibility in generating a post card with RF-ID is increased.","It should also be noted that the TV  according to Embodiment 4 may allow the user to perform operations for images displayed on the TV  by using the post card with RF-ID, in the same manner as described in Embodiment 3 for the processing in which the user operates an electronic catalog displayed on a screen by using RF-ID.","As described above, the system according to Embodiment 4 enables the user to mail a post card with RF-ID to a person living in a distant location, without creating a post card attached with RF-ID by the user himself\/herself. In addition, when the user wishes to print the image(s) stored in the image server onto the post card to be mailed, the system allows the user to perform operation on a TV screen to select an image(s) to be printed. As a result, high usability is achieved.","Conventionally, if the user intends to show images, on a large screen display device, to a different user living in a remote location, the user in the remote location needs to learn operations of the device (apparatus), an operation acquirer has to go to the remote location to operate the device, or the display device in the remote location should be remotely controlled. The system according to Embodiment 4, however, enables such a user in a remote location to easily view images by a simple operation, for example, by bringing a physical medium such as a post card with RF-ID into proximity of a display device.","[Embodiment 5]","Embodiment 5 of the present invention has the following configuration. A mailing object such as a post card is written with fixed information. The image capturing device associates the fixed information with an image or a group of images (image data) stored in the server. A reproduction side reads the fixed information from the RF-ID attached to the post card or the like in order to display the image data associated with the fixed information. The configuration is illustrated in . Referring to , first, the image capturing device reads the fixed information from the mailing object, then associates the fixed information with an image(s), and registers information of the association (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cassociation information) into the server. When the user receives the mailing object for which the registration is completed, the user brings the mailing object into proximity of a RF-ID reader of a TV to read the fixed information from the mailing object. The TV queries the server using the fixed information, and thereby displays the image(s) associated with the mailing object.","Embodiment 5 is characterized in that the RF-ID information in the mailing object is not rewritable (ROM) or in non-rewritable environments so that image data in the server is associated with the mailing object without rewriting the fixed information in the mailing object.","<Image Uploading and Mailing Object Associating by Image Capturing Device>","The images captured by the image capturing device are uploaded to the server using the method described in the prior embodiments.

Then, the second processing unit  performs processing to provide the fixed information of the mailing object to the first processing unit  via the recording unit , the second memory , and the recording\/reproducing unit . The first processing unit  associates the mailing object UID read from the mailing object with an image or image group, according to designation from the user (S). Then, the image capturing device accesses the server  via the first antenna  (S).

When the relay or default server receives the mailing object UID (S), the server searches its database for information regarding the mailing object UID (S). Then, the relay or default server determines whether or not the database holds information regarding the mailing object UID (S). If the database holds the information, then the relay or default server redirects to a server associated with the mailing object UID in the database (S). On the other hand, if the database does not hold the information (in other words, if there is no association), then the relay or default server redirects to an error page (S).","As described above, the mailing object having fixed information in the RF-ID is previously associated with image data stored in the image server. Thereby, when the mailing object with the association is presented to the TV, the user can view an image or image group in the server which is associated with the mailing object UID, without rewriting of the RF-ID of the mailing object. Therefore, even if the user is away from home and cannot rewrite the RF-ID of the mailing object, or even if the RF-ID of the mailing object is not rewritable, the user can associate images in the server with the mailing object. As a result, the user allows a person receiving the mailing object to view the images associated with the mailing object.","It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment 5 that the mailing object UID is transmitted after accessing the server. However, it is also possible to generate a URL from the mailing object UID and the sever address recorded on the mailing object in order to access the server. In this aspect, it is possible to perform the access to the server and the transmission of the mailing object UID at the same time.","According to Embodiment 5, even in an environment where the RF-ID cannot be rewritten, such as in a sight-seeing location, for example, the user can associate captured images with a post card and send the post card to a friend. Thereby, the friend receiving the post card presents the post card to a TV to view the images the user captured in the sight-seeing location. As explained above, even in an environment where the RF-ID cannot be rewritten, the user can create a mailing object associated with images in the server and then send the mailing object to a person to which the user desires to show the images.","If the image capturing device has a RF-ID writer function to rewrite the RF-ID of the mailing object, the processing is the same as processing performed by the TV for associating the mailing object with image data in the server, which will be described below in Embodiment 6. Therefore, the processing is not described in Embodiment 5.","[Embodiment 6]","In Embodiment 6, the following configuration is described. The image capturing device captures images and uploads the images to the image server. Then, a user transmitting the images (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201csending user\u201d) selects an image group from the images in the server. Information for accessing the selected image group is recorded in the RF-ID on the mailing object. The mailing object is mailed to a user receiving the images (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201creceiving user\u201d).

The RF-ID unit  is attached to or incorporated into the mailing object  in order to be sent to the image receiving side together with the mailing object. Furthermore, as described in the prior embodiments, the memory unit  in the RF-ID unit  holds the medium identification information for identifying that the medium having the RF-ID unit  is a mailing object.","Referring to , a TV  is a TV display device provided in the image receiving side.

The TV  is connected to the Internet  via a network connection means not shown.","Next, the processing performed by the above configuration is described.","<Image Group Selecting and Mailing Object Writing by Image Transmission Side>","In the image transmission side in , images captured by the image capturing device  are transmitted to a wireless access point via the second antenna  in the image capturing device  used for wireless communication, such as a wireless LAN or WiMAX. The images are recorded as the image data  onto the image server  via the internet . Then, the image capturing device  is moved into proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV  in order to establish connection with the TV  by wireless communication via the first antenna  of the image capturing device  used for RF-ID. The TV  obtains, from the image capturing device , information for accessing the image data  in the image server . Then, the TV  downloads the images of the image data  to be displayed on the display unit . The above processing is the same as described in the prior embodiments. The above is just a summary.","Next, the sending user checks the images displayed on the display unit  of the TV  in order to set transmission image selection information indicating whether or not each of the images is to be transmitted to the receiving user (in other words, whether or not each of the images is to be permitted to be viewed by the receiving user). The sending user can set also restriction on display for the receiving user, utility form information such as a slide show and printing, which is described in the prior embodiments. The transmission image selection information and the utility form information are transmitted to and recorded onto the image server. The image server manages, as an image group, a set of images selected as transmission images in the transmission image selection information.","The following describes steps performed by the TV  for recording, onto the mailing object , information regarding the image group selected by the sending use, with reference to a flowchart of .","It is assumed that transmission images have been selected and an image group set with the utility form information has been generated. Under the assumption, the sending user brings the mailing object  having the RF-ID unit  into proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV  in order to establish wireless communication between the RF-ID unit  and the RF-ID reader\/writer .","When the TV  becomes able to communicate with the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object  via the RF-ID reader\/writer , the TV  reads information from the memory unit  (S). Then, the TV  determines whether or not the medium identification information indicates that the current communication partner is a mailing object (S). If the current communication partner is a mailing object, then the TV  proceeds to steps for writing to the mailing object. Here, if it is determined in Step S that the current communication partner is not a mailing object, then the subsequent steps are not described here but the TV  proceeds to steps depending on a medium indicated by the medium identification information.","In order to write to the mailing object , first, the TV accesses the image server  via the internet  (S). Thereby, the TV  obtains, from the image server , image group designation information, such as a server URL and an image group address, for allowing the image receiving side to access the image group in the image server  (S).","The TV  transmits the obtained image group designation information to the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object  via the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV  in order to write the image group designation information to the memory unit  in the mailing object , and the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object  records the image group designation information to a rewritable region of the memory unit  (S).","As described above, the mailing object  on which the image group designation information is recorded is mailed by the sending user to a user of the image receiving side.","<Image Reproducing and Viewing by Image Receiving Side>","Next, the image receiving side is described with reference to  illustrating the schematic block diagram of the image receiving side and  illustrating a flowchart of processing performed by the TV in the image receiving side.","Referring to , the receiving user receives the mailing object  from the sending user. Then, the receiving user checks the RF-ID unit  or characters or design indicated on the mailing object  to determine whether the mailing object is incorporated with a means for accessing images. Here, the receiving user needs only to understand that the receiving user can access to the images by using the mailing object . The receiving user does not need to care about the image group designation information and the like in the RF-ID unit .","In order to reproduce and view the images, the receiving user brings the mailing object  into proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV  in the image receiving side so as to start viewing of the images.","If the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object  is in enough proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV , the RF-ID reader\/writer  supplies power to the RF-ID unit  of the mailing object  via antennas (not shown) of both the RF-ID reader\/writer  and the RF-ID unit  in order to activate the RF-ID unit . Thereby, wireless communication between the TV  and the RF-ID unit  of the mailing object  starts.

Then, the TV  displays the images on the display unit  (S).","Furthermore, according to the transmission image selection information indicating the image group managed by the image server  and the utility form information, the receiving user can use functions of, for example, reproducing the images as a slide show, printing the images, and downloading the images to a recording medium (not shown) attached to the TV  or connected to the outside.","In addition, for image printing, the user can print the images by the printer on a LAN (not shown), and also ask, via the internet , a photograph print service provider to print the images.","As described above, with the above configuration according to Embodiment 6 of the present invention, the image group designation information is provided from the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object  to the TV  in the image receiving side. Therefore, the receiving user does not need to input characters of a network access destination to obtain images, for example. In other words, the intuitive and simple operation of simply bringing the mailing object  into proximity of the TV  enables the receiving user to access the image data  stored in the image server . As a result, the receiving user can obtain images from the image server, without knowledge of complicated operations such as menu selection and character inputs.","It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment 6 that the mailing object  is previously attached or incorporated with the RF-ID unit . However, the mailing object may be a general post card or letter paper attached with an independent RF-ID unit  that is provided separately. In this aspect, the above effect can be produced by later attaching the RF-ID unit to the mailing object. This produces further advantages that the sending user can use Embodiment 6 for any desired mailing object.","It should also be noted that, if the access to the image server  requires a login operation, a server login ID and a server login password may also be written in Step S into the rewritable region of the memory unit  in the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object . Here, it is desirable that the login ID and the login password are not plane texts but are written in an encrypted format for security.","It should also be noted that it has been described in Embodiment 6 that the TV  in the image transmission side performs selection of transmission images, setting of the utility form information, and writing of the image group designation information to the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object . However, it is also possible that the image capturing device  having a RF-ID reader\/writer function performs setting of the transmission image selection information and the utility form information and writing of the image group designation information, in order to produce the same effect as described above for obtaining images by the simple operation of the receiving user.","<Variation of Embodiment 6>",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1101","num":"1100"},"figref":["FIGS. 75A and 75B","FIG. 73","FIGS. 75A and 75B"],"b":"45"},"According to the variation of Embodiment 6, the mailing object UID is previously recorded on the memory unit  of the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object . Here, it is desirable to record the mailing object UID on a ROM region of the memory unit  in order to reduce risks of data damages or data manipulation caused by accidental operations.  illustrates a diagram of an example of a data structure of the memory unit .","The TV  in the image transmission side sets the transmission image selection information and the utility form information into the above-described RF-ID unit in order to designate an image group in the image serve . In this situation, the TV  performs processing according to the flowchart of .","The TV  reads information from the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object  (S) and determines based on the medium identification information that the communication partner is a mailing object (S). After that, the TV  obtains the mailing object UID (S). The mailing object UID may be the information read in Step S or be newly obtained from the RF-ID unit . Next, the TV  accesses the image server  via the Internet  (S). The TV  transmits the mailing object UID to the image server , and thereby the image server  associates with the transmitted mailing object UID with an address of the image group and then stores the manages information of the association (association information) (S).","The TV  obtains, from the image server , the server URL enabling the image receiving side to access the image server  (S). The obtained server URL is written into the rewritable region of the memory unit  in the RF-ID unit  on the mailing object  via the RF-ID reader\/writer  (S).","As described above, if the image server associates the image group with the mailing object UID and then stores and manages the association information, the utility form information can be managed separately for each mailing object UID. Therefore, in the situation where there are a plurality of the mailing objects , it is possible to change an operation for receiving images for each mailing object, namely, for each different receiving user.","If, in the configuration described in Embodiment 6, the image receiving side designates an image group for each mailing object, generates a different image group address for each designated image group, and writes the image group address into a corresponding RF-ID unit, the image transmission side needs complicated operations for designating image groups separately although the same advantages as those of Embodiment 6 can be obtained.","Therefore, when the sending user selects the same transmission image group for a plurality of mailing objects, it is preferable that the sending user records and manages different utility form information for each mailing object by using the mailing object UID as described earlier. Thereby, it is possible to reduce operations of the sending user, and to reduce a memory capacity of the image server because it is not necessary to hold pieces of the transmission image selection information separately, thereby producing further advantages.","The processing of  differs from the processing of  in thin Steps S and S are replaced by Steps S and . In Step , the TV  obtains an image group address in addition to the server URL. In Step S, the TV  writes the image group address together with the server URL into the memory unit  of the RF-ID unit .","Thereby, when the image receiving side is to receive images, the image receiving side accesses the designated image group in the image server . Here, the access is permitted only when the mailing object UID of the image group stored and managed in the image server matches the mailing object UID used by the receiving server requesting the access. Thereby, security is increased.","Conventionally, if the user intends to show images, on a large screen display device (apparatus), to a different user living in a remote location, the user in the remote location needs to learn operations of the device, an operation acquirer has to go to the remote location to operate the device, or the display device in the remote location should be remotely controlled. However, like Embodiment 4, the system according to Embodiment 6 enables such a user in a remote location to easily view images by a simple operation, for example, by bringing a physical medium such as a post card with RF-ID into proximity of a display device. In Embodiment 4, generation of the post card with RF-ID and writing of data into the RF-ID is not performed by the user (who captures and sends images or who views the images), but by a service provider. In Embodiment 6, however, the sending user in the image transmission side performs generation of the post card with RF-ID and writing of data into the RF-ID.","[Embodiment 7]","In Embodiment 7 of the present invention, a method of changing setting for a device (apparatus) by using a RF-ID card according to Embodiment 7 of the present invention is described.","The following describes a method of changing setting for a recorder by using a RF-ID card with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1114","num":"1113"},"figref":"FIG. 77"},"A recorder  records broadcast contents obtained by a tuner , onto a Hard Disk Drive (HDD)  or an optical disk drive .

If it is determined in Step  that all pieces of the target apparatus information have been examined, then the processing is terminated as being failure of obtaining the setting information .","In Step , the recorder  obtains, from the server , the setting information  associated with the UID  and the target apparatus information .","As described above, the use of the RF-ID card  enables the user to perform setting of the recorder  without complicated operations. Even if the user is not familiar with operations of apparatuses (devices) the user can easily change the setting of the recorder  by using the RF-ID card . Moreover, the operation executable for the recorder  by using the RF-ID card  is not limited to the setting change. For example, the instruction detail information can designate an operation of obtaining a list of recorded contents in the recorder. In this case, the list is registered in the RF-ID card or the server. Thereby, the user can check the list on a different apparatus (device) other than the recorder by using the RF-ID card.","In addition, the RF-ID card holding information illustrated in the  allows the user to perform timer recording in the recorder simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the recorder. In more detail, if the change target information associated with Index  in  is applied, the recorder can perform timer recording according to setting of \u201cTV program ID\u201d and \u201crecording mode\u201d designated in the instruction target information, simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the recorder. Thereby, the timer recording can be performed without accessing the server. In addition, if the change target information associated with Index  in  is applied, the recorder can perform timer recording according to \u201cTV program code\u201d designated in the instruction target information, simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the recorder. Here, the recorder can obtain, from the server, (a) program ID or a start time and end time, and (b) channel information. As a result, the time recording can be performed according to the setting of the \u201crecording mode\u201d.","Furthermore, it is also possible that \u201crecommended TV program\u201d is designated in the instruction target information in the RF-ID card. After presenting the RF-ID card to the recorder, the recorder obtains ID of the recommended TV program from the server. Thereby, the recorder can obtain a content of the recommended TV program from the server and performs timer recording of the content. The above functions may be used as service for providing the RF-ID card as being a supplement of a TV program guide magazine, for example. This RF-ID card can reduce user's bothersome procedures for timer recording. For another service, it is also possible in the RF-ID card that the instruction detail information designates a download operation, the instruction target information designates video or software in a version where a function is restricted, and the communication information designates a URL of a download website. Such RF-ID cards are provided for free to users. The users can use the video or software as trial, and purchase it if the user likes it.","It should be noted that the description in Embodiment 7 has been given for the recorder, but the present invention is not limited to the recorder.","For example, Embodiment 7 of the present invention may be implemented as a TV having a reader\/writer for the RF-ID card and the setting information processing unit. The TV can register, as the change target information, (a) setting of an initial display channel or initial sound volume immediately after power-on, (b) setting of child lock for excluding adult broadcasts and violence scenes, (c) setting of zapping for favorite channels, (d) setting of contrast and brightness of a screen, (e) setting of a language, (f) setting of a continuous use time, and the like, simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the TV. Thereby, the TV can perform settings according to usability. Furthermore, Embodiment 7 may be implemented also as a vehicle navigation system having a reader\/writer for the RF-ID card and the setting information processing unit. In this aspect, the instruction detail information designates \u201chighlighted display\u201d and the instruction target information designates \u201clandmark information\u201d. Thereby, by using the RF-ID card, the vehicle navigation system can display the designated landmark as being highlighted, by changing a character font, character size, or color. The landmark information may be obtained from a server. In this case, the RF-ID cards, on which the apparatus operation information illustrated in  is recorded, are offered to users at rest areas or interchanges on expressways, sightseeing spots, and the like. Thereby, the RF-ID cards allow vehicle navigation systems of the users to display a recommended landmark, where an event is currently held for example, as highlighted display. In addition, Embodiment 7 may be implemented as a laptop having a reader\/writer for the RF-ID card and the setting information processing unit. The laptop can designate (a) setting of a resolution of a screen, (b) setting of a position of an icon or the like on a display, (c) setting of a wallpaper, (d) setting of a screen saver, (e) setting of start-up of resident software, (f) setting of employed peripheral devices, (g) setting of a dominant hand for a mouse or the like, and the like, by simply by presenting the RF-ID card to the laptop. Therefore, if the user brings the RF-ID card in a business trip, the user can operate a different personal computer at the business trip location, with the same settings as those the user usually uses. Embodiment 7 may be implemented further as a game machine having a reader\/writer for the RF-ID card and the setting information processing unit. The user visiting a friend's house uses a RF-ID card in which the instruction detail information designates setting change. By presenting the RF-ID card to the game machine at the friend's house, the user can change (a) setting of positions of keys on a remote controller and (b) setting of a structure of a menu screen. In addition, the user can save data in the game machine by using the RF-ID card. Moreover, the following service using the RF-ID card is also possible. The RF-ID card holds the instruction detail information designating a download operation. Such RF-ID cards are offered to users as supplements of magazines or the like. The users can use the RF-ID cards to download an additional scenario, a rare item, or the like.","The RF-ID card according to Embodiment 7 of the present invention can be also applied to home appliances connected to one another via a network. In this aspect, the RF-ID card previously holds (a) setting of a temperature of an air conditioner, (b) setting for a temperature of hot water in a bus tab, and the like, depending of the user's preference. Thereby, the user presents the RF-ID card to RF-ID reader\/writers in the user's house so as to manage settings of the home appliances at once. In addition, the RF-ID card may designate an operation for checking foods stored in a refrigerator. Here, information of the foods which is registered in the refrigerator is obtained by using RF-ID tags previously attached to the foods. Or, video of the inside of the refrigerator is captured by using camcorder. Thereby, the user can check a list of the foods on a TV by using a RF-ID reader\/writer to obtain information from the RF-ID card. As described above, the RF-ID card according to Embodiment 7 of the present invention can be applied for various usages. It is also possible to combine (a) RF-ID cards for designating apparatuses (such as four different cards indicating \u201cheating appliance\u201d, \u201ccooling appliance\u201d, \u201cstove\u201d, and \u201cfan\u201d, respectively) and (b) RF-ID cards for designating setting of the apparatuses (such as three different cards indicating \u201cweak\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, and \u201cstrong\u201d, respectively). It is further possible that such RF-ID cards having the apparatus-designating and setting-designating functions are integrated into a single RF-ID card. And, the settings of the apparatuses can be customized.","Although only some exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will be readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the present invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.","For example, if two users (hereinafter, referred to as a user A and a user B) exchanges photographs between them, the user B can view photographs taken by the user A by the following method. The user B has a TV having an apparatus ID and a relay server having a URL. The apparatus ID and the URL are previously stored in a RF-ID (hereinafter, referred to as a RF tag B). The user B generates information (hereinafter, referred to as device generation information B) from the information in the RF tag B and stores the generated device generation information B into the RF tag B. The user B transmits the device generation information B to the user A via e-mail or the like. The user A stores a URL of a server holding the photographs into the relay server, in association with the received device generation information B. Thereby, the user B simply presents the RF tab B to a RF-ID reader\/writer of the TV in order to view the photographs taken by the user A. Here, it is assumed that the RF tag B previously holds an e-mail address of the user A. When the user B simply presents the RF tag B to the RF-ID reader\/writer of the TV, the device generation information B may be automatically written into the TV and a notification of the device generation information B may be automatically transmitted to the e-mail address of the user A. Thereby, even if the user B is not familiar with operations of the devices, the user B can exchange photographs with the user A. Furthermore, it is also possible that the user A encrypts at least one of a URL, login ID, and a password by using the device generation information B and sends, to the user B, a post card with RF-ID on which the encrypted information is recorded. This makes it possible to restrict an apparatus permitted to display the photographs, only to the TV of the user B. It is further possible that the user A sends, to the user B, a post card with two RF-IDs that are a RF-ID for sending and a RF-ID for returning. In this aspect, the user A records, onto the RF-ID for returning, device generation information A that is previously generated by a TV or the like of the user A. This can restrict an apparatus permitted to display photographs stored by the user B. More specifically, when the user B receives the post card with the two RF-IDs and returns the post card to the user A, the user B encrypts, by using the device generation information A, a URL, a login ID, or a password of a server storing the photographs of the user B, and then records the encrypted data onto the RF-ID for returning. Or, when the user B stores the photographs, the user B associates the photographs with the device generation information A. Therefore, an apparatus permitted to display photographs stored by the user B can be restricted.","Moreover, the mailing object UID of the RF-ID on the mailing object may be a combination of (a) a group ID that is common among a plurality of mailing objects and (b) a UID unique that is unique to each mailing object. Thereby, image data in the server is associated not with every mailing object UID but with the group ID. Therefore, when post cards with RF-ID on which the image data is associated with a plurality of targets are mailed, it is possible to eliminate user's bothersome procedures for performing registration for each of the UIDs. It is also possible that the image data stored in the server in association with the group ID is switched to be permitted or inhibited to be viewed for each of the UID. Thereby, if, for example, a printer prints destination addresses on the mailing objects, the printer having a RF-ID reader\/writer reads the UIDs on the mailing objects and thereby associates the UIDs with addresses in an address list, respectively. Thereby, the address list can be used to manage the permission\/inhibition of viewing the images stored in the server.","It is also possible that a post card or card is provided with a plurality of RF-ID tags having various different functions. In this aspect, the single post card or card can switch the functions by disconnecting communication of a part of the RF-ID tags which are not currently used. For example, a post card has (a) an upper portion on which a RF-ID tag having a function of displaying a slide show of photographs is attached and (b) a lower portion on which a RF-ID tag having a function of reproducing video. A user can switch the display function or the reproduction function, by selecting the upper portion or the lower portion to be brought into proximity of a RF-ID reader\/writer. The RF-ID tags having different functions can be provided to a front side and a back side of the post card. It is also possible that covers made of a material blocking communications are applied on the RF-ID tags so that the user can select a RF-ID tag to be used by opening the cover on it.","It is further possible that photographs are stored in a plurality of servers, and a RF-ID tag holds URLs of the servers. Thereby, a user can access the servers to obtain the photographs to display them in a list.","Moreover, the RF-ID reader\/writer may be provided not only to an apparatus (device) such as the TV or the recorder but also to the input means such as a remote controller for operating the apparatus. For instance, if a plurality of apparatuses are connected to one another via a network, an input means for collectively operating the apparatuses may be provided with a RF-ID reader\/writer to operate the respective apparatuses. Furthermore, an input means such as a remote controller may be provided with an individual authentication means for biometric authentication such as fingerprint authentication or face authentication, password, or the like. In this aspect, the input means having a RF-ID reader\/writer exchanges data with a RF-ID tag, only when the individual authentication is successful. It is also possible that the individual authentication information is previously stored in the RF-ID tag, and individual authentication is performed by the apparatus or the remote controller using the RF-ID tag.","It should be noted that the definition of the term \u201cRF-ID\u201d frequently used in the description of the present invention is not limited to narrow meaning. In general, the term \u201cRF-ID\u201d narrowly refers to a \u201ctag having a nonvolatile memory on which identification information is recorded\u201d. RF-ID having a dual interface function or a security function seems commonly called as a \u201cIC card\u201d or the like. However, in the embodiments of the present invention, the \u201cRF-ID\u201d widely refers to an \u201celectronic circuit which has a nonvolatile memory on which individual identification information is recorded and which can transmit the individual identification information to the outside via an antenna\u201d.","Conventionally, if a user who is not familiar with operations of an apparatus (device) wishes to perform complicated settings for the apparatus, it is necessary that a seller, repairer, or serviceperson of the apparatus visits a location of the apparatus to perform the settings or controls the apparatus remotely. Even in remotely controlling the apparatus, the seller, repairer, or serviceperson has to visit the location for setting of the remote control. In Embodiment 7 of the present invention, however, the RF-ID card  enables the user to perform the settings of the apparatus (the recorder ) without complicated operations. Therefore, even the user not familiar with operations of the recorder can easily change the settings of the recorder.","The present invention can be implemented also as an image presentation method of presenting image related to a communication device on an apparatus (device) having a display screen, in a communication system having (a) the apparatus having the display screen, (b) a reader device connected to the apparatus via a communication path, and (c) the communication device performing proximity wireless communication with the reader device. The present invention can be implemented further as a program stored in the communication device with identification information of the communication device, the program being described by codes executed by a virtual machine included in a device performing proximity wireless communication with the communication device, and being for executing: accessing a server connected via a communication network; downloading, form the server, image associated with the identification information from among image stored in the accessed server; and displaying the downloaded image. In addition, the present invention can be implemented as a computer-readable recording medium such as a CD-ROM on which the above program is recorded.","The communication device according to the present invention may be used, of course, as various devices having a RF-ID unit in which identification information and a virtual machine program are stored. For example, the communication device may be electronic devices such as a camera, home appliances such as a rice cooker and a refrigerator, and daily commodities such as a toothbrush.","Here, an embodiment in which a RF-ID reader is provided to a remote controller of a TV or the like is described with reference to diagrams (a) and (b) in , a flowchart (c) in , and a flowchart of .","First, as described earlier, a child device (or child communicator)  such as a camera has the memory (second memory)  and the antenna (second antenna) . When an antenna  of a remote controller  is moved into proximity of the antenna , the antenna  supplies power to the antenna . Thereby, data in the memory  is transmitted from the antenna  to the antenna . The remote controller  converts the received data into digital data by a communication circuit , and then stores the digital data into a memory  (Step in ). Then, a transmission unit of the remote controller  is faced to the TV  and a transmission switch  on the remote controller  is pressed (Step ). Thereby, the data in the memory  is transmitted as light to a light receiving unit  of the parent device (apparatus)  (the TV ) via a light emitting unit  (Step ). The communication may be not light but wireless.","Referring back to a flowchart (c) in , the embodiment of the present invention used in social systems should be applicable even in twenty or thirty years. An example of the program described in a virtual machine language or the like is known Java\u2122. However, such programs are expected to be extended or replaced by totally different programs described in more efficient languages. In order to address the above situation, in the embodiment of the present invention, the parent device  such as the TV holds parent device version information  (or parent device version information n) that indicates a language type or version of a virtual machine language or the like (Step in (c) of ). In the beginning of the memory  of the child device , child device version information  (or child device version information n) indicating a version of a program language or the like for the child device is recorded ((a) in ). Following to the child device version information , a program region  is recorded in the memory . The program region  stores a program in a version , a program in a version , and a program in a version . Following to the program region , a data region  is recorded in the memory .","In Step in the flowchart of , the parent device  stores the parent device version information nof the parent device  is stored. Then, the parent device  obtains the child device version information nfrom the memory of the child device (Step ). Then, the parent device  selects an execution program n having a maximum value of n\u2267n(Step ). The parent device  executes the selected execution program (Step ). Then, it is determined whether or not the parent device  is connected to the Internet (Step ). If the parent device  is connected to the Internet, then the parent device  is connected to the server via the Internet (Step ). The parent device  thereby transmits language information , which is set in the parent device , to the server (Step ). The server provides the parent device  with a program in the language indicated in the transmitted language information , for example in French, and causes the parent device  to execute the program. Alternatively, the server may execute the program on the server itself.","On the other hand, if it is determined in Step that the parent device  is not connected to the Internet, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the parent device  executes a local program in order to display, on a screen of the parent device , attribute information of the child device . The attribute information is, for example, information for notifying a trouble or information regarding the number of stored photographs. As described above, the memory  in the child device  holds the child device version information . The memory  stores a program, procedure, URL, or the like of each generation. The program, procedure, URL, or the like will be developed every 10 years. Such data format on which information is recorded for each generation can be kept being used even in twenty or thirty years in order to operate the parent device . (a) of  illustrates an example of information on which versions or generations of a program are recorded. However, the same advantages are also offered in another example illustrated in (b) of . In (b) of , addresses of data stored in the server are recorded in associated with respective different versions. In this example, a URL in a version , a URL in a version , and a URL in a version are recorded. The above can achieve backward compatibility for many years. For example, it is assumed that a user purchases a product (the parent device ) in version  this year and the product has RF-ID. Under the assumption, it is expected that, in twenty or thirty years, programs described in virtual machine languages or the like such as Java\u2122, which are compliant to versions , , and , will be installed into the parent device . In the situation, the child device  can provide the parent device  with the child device version information . Based on the child device version information , the parent device  can select a program to be compliant to an appropriate version. It is also expected that, in thirty years, the child device will hold information of programs in all versions , , and . Therefore, a different parent device  in version  employs the best function of a version among them. On the other hand, the former parent device  in version  employs a rather limited function of a version older than the version employed by the parent device  in version . As a result, perfect compatibility can be achieved.","The flowchart of  is explained below. In Step , pressing a read switch  on the remote controller , a user brings the remote controller  into proximity of the antenna  of the child device . Thereby, data in the memory  of the child device  is transmitted to the memory  of the remote controller . Next, in Step , facing the remote controller  to the parent device  such as a TV, the user presses a transmission switch  (Step ). Thereby, the data in the memory  is transmitted as light to the parent device  (Step ). In the embodiment of the present invention, the data is referred to as \u201ctag data\u201d for convenience. The parent device  extracts or selects an execution program from the tag data (Step ). The parent device  executes the extracted or selected execution program by a virtual machine language set in the parent device  (Step ). The parent device  reads Internet connection identification information for the parent device  (Step ). In Step , it is determined whether or not the identification information does not indicate \u201cConnectable to the Internet\u201d (in other words, it is determined based on the identification information whether or not the parent device  is connectable to the Internet. If the identification information does not indicate \u201cConnectable to the Internet\u201d until Step , then the parent device  executes a non-connectable-state program in the execution program (Step ). The non-connectable-state program is to be executed when the parent device  is not connectable to the Internet. Then, the parent device  displays a result of the execution on its screen (Step ). In the embodiment of the present invention, the memory  stores not only the information regarding connection to the Internet, but also the non-connectable-state program to be executed when the parent device  is not connectable to the Internet. Therefore, the parent device  can display a result of a minimum required operation when the parent device  is not connectable to the Internet.","On the other hand, if it is determined in Step that the identification information indicates \u201cConnectable to the Internet\u201d, then the parent device  executes a connection program (Step ). The connection program includes a part of the above execution program.","The connection program may be generated by adding, into the execution program in the tag data, data such as a URL of the server, user ID, and a password. More specifically, the added such as a URL of the server, user ID, and a password are added in the data region  illustrated in (a) of . Such connection program can extend the execution program in the tag data, and also reduce a capacity of the nonvolatile memory in the memory . In this case, it is also possible that the connection program in the memory  is recorded onto a memory such as a non-rewritable ROM in the program region , while the URL of the server and the like are recorded onto the data region  that is rewritable. As a result, a tip area and a cost can be reduced.","In Step , the parent device  connects to a server having a specific URL. In Step , it is determined whether or not the server requests the parent device  to upload data to the server. If the server requests for uploading of data, then in Step , the parent device  uploads data and\/or a program to the server. The server executes a program using the data (Step ). The server provides a result of the execution to the parent device  (Step ). The parent device  displays the result and the like of the execution on its screen (Step ).","On the other hand, if it is determined in Step that the server does not request for uploading of data, then, the parent device  downloads information including a specific program from the server having the URL (Step ). The parent device  executes the downloaded program (Step ). Then, the parent device  displays the result of the execution on its screen (S).","The memory in the RF-ID unit or the child device has a limited capacity due to restriction on power consumption, a volume, or a cost. Therefore, a common program cannot be stored in the memory. However, the use of the connection program and the server as described in the embodiment of the present invention allows an infinitely large program to be executed.","A huge program may be executed on the server. Or, such a program may be downloaded from the server to be executed. These aspects are in the scope of the present invention.","The embodiment described with reference to  has been described to use a remote controller of a TV. In this example, the remote controller has a battery, buttons for switching TV channels, an antenna for reading RF-ID, a communication circuit, and an infrared light emitting unit. The remote controller can be replaced by a mobile phone to produce the same effects as described above. Since mobile phones generally have an infrared light emitting unit, they are easily used instead of remote controllers. In addition, mobile phones have a communication line. Therefore, mobile phones can offer the same capability of that of remote controller, being directly connected to the server. However, a communication cost of a mobile phone is burden of a user. A display screen of a mobile phone is significantly smaller than that of a TV. Therefore, a mobile phone may have the transmission switch  as illustrated in . Thereby, if there is a TV near the mobile phone, the user faces the light emitting unit of the mobile phone to the TV to transmit tag data in the memory  of the mobile phone directly to the TV. As a result, the user can view data on a large screen of the TV having a high resolution. The above method does not incur a cost, which is greatly advantageous for the user. The communication using the readout tag data via the mobile phone line is stopped in cooperation with the transmission switch.","In this case, in the same manner as described for as the remote controller with reference to , the mobile phone has at least a reader for RF-ID or a Near Field Communication (NFC) unit. In the future, mobile phones are expected to have a reader function for reading RF-ID or the like. If RF-ID readers are provided to mobile phones, the present invention can be implemented with a much lower additional cost, which is greatly advantageous for the user. Moreover, the present invention can be easily implemented not only as a remote controller or a mobile phone, but also as a Personal Digital Assistance (PDA) terminal, a laptop, or a mobile media player.","[Embodiment 8]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1221","num":"1220"},"figref":"FIG. 88","b":["45","8001","45","8001","110","8003","45","8001","8004","8005","45","8001","8006","8006","8007","8008"]},"In Embodiment 8, consider a situation where, under the above-mentioned environment, the user who is watching video on the TV  () wants to watch it on the TV  () upstairs. In the case of moving to another place to watch the video, it is desirable that the user can watch the video seamlessly from the point up to which the user has already watched. However, in order to seamlessly move the video while maintaining security, user authentication and timing synchronization are necessary, and the user is required to perform complex operations.

The band of 860 to 900 MHz is also called a UHF (UltraHigh Frequency) band. The RFID tag in the UHF band can exhibit a largest communication distance in the passive type (i.e., the type of tag to which power is supplied from outside), and is capable of communication of 2 to 3 m though depending on output magnitude. Accordingly, by simultaneously passing a plurality of products through a RFID reader gate during transportation, RFID information of the plurality of products can be instantly read with efficiency. Hence, the RFID tag is particularly expected to be used in the field of distribution.","However, such a RFID tag of the UHF band has the following problem. Though the RFID tag certainly has an advantage of long-distance communication, the apparatus cannot be traced once it has been delivered to the consumer because the RFID tag is added to the package or the returnable container. Besides, the long-distance feature is not particularly effective in an entity interface, an object interface, or an intuitive interface described in Embodiments 1 to 10 where apparatuses are brought into proximity of each other to trigger an action.","Meanwhile, the RFID tag () described in Embodiments 1 to 10 is assumed to be a HF-RFID tag in a band of 13.56 MHz (though this is not a limit for the present invention). HF-RFID has a feature of short-distance communication (within about several ten cm though depending on output). For instance, the HF-RFID tag is widely used in applications that intuitively trigger an action by bringing two terminals close to each other, such as electronic money and ticket gate systems. This being so, for example when the user wants to display photographs captured by a digital camera on a TV, the user brings the digital camera  close to the RFID reader\/writer  of the TV, thereby realizing an entity interface where an entity (camera) and an entity (TV) operate in conjunction with each other or an intuitive interface where digital camera photographs are displayed on the TV.","In this embodiment, the HF-RFID tag is added to the apparatus (device) as in Embodiments 1 to 10, and also the UHF-RFID tag is added to the package or the returnable container of the apparatus, to ensure product traceability even after the product is reached the use environment of the consumer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1372","num":"1371"},"figref":"FIG. 144"},"Though this embodiment describes the case where the apparatus is a recorder, the apparatus is not limited to such and may be any of a digital home appliance, a food, and the like.","An apparatus M assembled in a manufacturing line is provided with a HF-RFID tag M. The HF-RFID tag M has a memory, which has a structure of a dual interface that is accessible from both the apparatus M and a communication unit of the RFID tag M. A product serial number of the apparatus and a program (command) for copying the product serial number of the apparatus to the UHF-RFID tag are stored in the memory of the HF-RFID tag M, in an assembly stage.","After the assembly of the apparatus M is completed, prior to packaging, a handy reader\/writer M reads the product serial number from the memory of HF-RFID, and also records a device ID of UHF-RFID (UHF-RFID unique information) indicating that the UHF-RFID tag is added to the package or the like.","Next, having packaged the apparatus M, a UHF-RFID tag M is added to a package M. The UHF-RFID tag M may be directly added to the package, or may be added to a management table or the like. After adding the UHF-RFID tag M, the handy reader\/writer M records the product serial number and the like read from the HF-RFID tag M of the apparatus M, to the UHF-RFID tag M. In this embodiment, the handy reader\/writer M is capable of accessing both HF-RFID and UHF-RFID.","Thus, the product serial number of the apparatus M is recorded on the HF-RFID tag M, and the same information is also recorded on the UHF-RFID tag M of the package M. Therefore, in distribution after packaging, there is no need to read the product serial number and the like from the HF-RFID tag that is capable of only short-distance access. By simultaneously passing a plurality of products through the gate, the information can be directly read from the UHF-RFID tag. This contributes to more efficient distribution.","Moreover, after the apparatus M reaches the use environment of the consumer, the HF-RFID tag can be read by a remote controller of a TV and the like. Hence, not only the distribution but also the apparatus reaching the consumer can be traced. As a result, overall traceability that contributes to improved distribution efficiency and prevents accidents caused by aged deterioration during apparatus use can be achieved.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1379","num":"1378"},"figref":"FIG. 145","b":"005"},"The memory of the UHF-RFID tag M stores a UHF device ID M, HF existence identification information M, an apparatus product serial number and actual article number M, a date M, a manufacturer M, a model number, lot number, and product name M, and a status M.","The UHF device ID M is stored in a non-rewritable area of the memory, and is identification information for uniquely identifying the UHF-RFID tag. The UHF device ID M is read by the handy reader\/writer before the apparatus M is packaged, and recorded in the HF-RFID tag M. Hence, even when the correspondence relation between the package and the apparatus is wrong, the correspondence relation can be checked beforehand and appropriate processing can be performed.","The HF existence identification information M is identification information for determining whether or not the HF-RFID tag M is added to the apparatus M. In the case where the HF-RFID tag M is added to the apparatus M, when recording the product serial number and the like read from the HF-RFID tag M to the UHF-RFID tag M upon apparatus packaging, the HF-RFID existence identification information is changed to information indicating \u201cexist\u201d. This makes it possible to determine whether or not to check the correspondence relation between UHF-RFID and HF-RFID, by referencing only the HF existence identification information M.","The apparatus product serial number and actual article number M is at least one of the product serial number read from the HF-RFID tag M and an actual article number associated with the product serial number. The actual article number is a number of the apparatus used in the distribution process. It is possible to uniquely associate the actual article number with the product serial number, by equally managing the product serial number and the actual article number. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the product serial number and the actual article number are not clearly distinguished from each other but are described as the same information.","The date M corresponds to a manufacturing year\/month\/date, and information of a date and time of manufacture of the apparatus M is recorded as the date M. This information may be recorded by the handy reader\/writer M at the time of recording the product serial number to the UHF-RFID tag M, or manufacturing year\/month\/date information stored in the HF-RFID tag M may be read and recorded to the UHF-RFID tag M.","The manufacturer M is identification information of a manufacturer of the apparatus M. This information may be recorded by the handy reader\/writer M at the time of recording the product serial number to the UHF-RFID tag M, or manufacturer information stored in the HF-RFID tag M may be read and recorded to the UHF-RFID tag M.","The model number, lot number, and product name M may be recorded by the handy reader\/writer M, or the corresponding information may be read from the HF-RFID tag M and recorded, in the same way as the date M and the manufacturer M. Regarding the lot number, in the case where lot management from manufacture to distribution can be conducted in a unified fashion, the information may be written by any of the two methods. However, in the case where unified management is not conducted and manufacturing line information is unclear upon packaging, reading the lot number from the HF-RFID tag M and recording it to the UHF-RFID tag M is more advantageous because stricter management can be achieved.","The status M is status information in the distribution form. That is, status information necessary for tracing the apparatus, such as factory storage, factory shipment, distribution center reception, distribution center shipment, and retailer reception, is recorded as the status M. The status M is rewritable in each distribution process.","Moreover, the UHF-RFID tag M stores management server specific information M. The management server specific information M is the same information as the server specific information  in the second memory  of the HF-RFID tag M. When packaging the apparatus M, the server specific information is read from the HF-RFID tag M and copied to the UHF-RFID tag M. This enables unified management to be performed by the same management server for both of the management in the distribution stage using UHF-RFID and the management after the apparatus is delivered to the consumer.","Therefore, after the apparatus M is delivered to the consumer, by reading the management server address information from the HF-RFID tag M, accessing the management server, and making an inquiry by the apparatus product serial number M, trace information from manufacture to distribution managed by the management server can be visualized to the consumer.

This flowchart shows an example where the HF-RFID tag is added after the assembly of the apparatus M. However, in the case of a structure of a dual interface where the apparatus and the HF-RFID tag can both access a shared memory, the HF-RFID tag M is added to the apparatus M during assembly of the apparatus M.","Next, the product serial number of the apparatus M is recorded on the HF-RFID tag M (M). This is a step of recording the product serial number on the HF-RFID tag M in the assembly process through the handy reader\/writer M. The product serial number is obtained from a management server of the manufacturing line using the handy reader\/writer or the like, and recorded on the HF-RFID tag M by proximity wireless communication.","After the product serial number is recorded on the HF-RFID tag M, the apparatus M is packaged (M). The packaging mentioned here denotes packaging for distribution with a cushioning material and the like, or containment into a returnable container and the like.","After completing the packaging, the UHF-RFID tag M is added to the package (including a returnable container surface, a management label, and so on) (M).","Following this, the handy reader\/writer M communicates with a management server M, thereby reading the actual article number associated with the product serial number read from the HF-RFID tag M (M). The actual article number is a management number used in product distribution, and is issued by the management server. The actual article number is in a one-to-one correspondence with the product serial number.","After the actual article number is read from the management server M, the product serial number or the actual article number, and the existence identification information indicating that the HF-RFID tag M is added to the apparatus M, are recorded on the UHF-RFID tag M (M).","As a result of the above processing, the product serial number recorded on the HF-RFID tag M which is added to the apparatus M is copied to the UHF-RFID tag M after apparatus packaging. Typically, the communicable distance of the HF-RFID tag is short, and so it is difficult to access the HF-RFID tag after packaging. In this embodiment, however, the product serial number or the actual article number is recorded on the UHF-RFID tag that has a longer communicable distance than the HF-RFID tag and is added to the package. This allows for apparatus distribution management after packaging.","Moreover, even if the package or the like is discarded after the apparatus is delivered to the consumer, the product serial number and the like can be read by accessing the HF-RFID tag added to the apparatus. Thus, unified management from distribution to consumer use can be achieved, which contributes to traceability over a wide range.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1399","num":"1398"},"figref":"FIG. 147","b":"003"},"First, upon factory shipment of the apparatus M, the product serial number or the actual article number is read from the UHF-RFID tag M by using a handy reader\/writer or passing the product through a UHF-RFID reader gate.

Upon subsequent shipment from the distribution center, the product serial number or the actual article number is read from the UHF-RFID tag M by a handy reader\/writer or a UHF-RFID reader gate, and distribution center shipment completion is registered in the management server M and also the status (M) in the UHF-RFID tag M is rewritten to indicate distribution center shipment completion (M).","Likewise, upon retailer shipment, retailer shipment completion is registered in the management server M, and the status M in the UHF-RFID tag M is rewritten to indicate retailer shipment completion (M).","Lastly, when the apparatus M reaches the consumer, the product serial number is read from the HF-RFID tag M by the reading unit of the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV remote controller or the like, and registered in the management server M in association with TV identification information (M). Accordingly, in this embodiment too, the server specific information  is recorded in the second memory  of HF-RFID beforehand. The server specific information  in this embodiment indicates the management server M, and includes a URL for connecting to the management server M. Hence, by reading the HF-RFID tag M of the apparatus M using the TV remote controller or the like having the RF reader\/writer, management information from manufacture to distribution can be obtained from the management server M. In addition, by managing the product serial number in association with the TV identification information in the management server M, it is possible to store a list of apparatuses possessed by the user in the management server in association with the user's TV, without managing personal information of the user.","When the user's apparatus has a problem, a message warning the user is adequately displayed on the TV, with it being possible to prevent a serious accident.","As described above, according to this embodiment, in the manufacturing stage the apparatus and the package are respectively provided with the HF-RFID tag and the UHF-RFID tag, which each carry existence identification information of the other tag. Moreover, the product serial number and the management server specific information stored in the HF-RFID tag are copied to the UHF-RFID tag. As a result, it is possible to provide a system in which management can be performed even after the apparatus reaches the consumer while maintaining distribution management convenience, unlike a conventional system where traceability is attained only during distribution.","Though this embodiment describes management from manufacture to delivery to the user, the present invention has the same advantageous effects even when the user discards or recycles the apparatus. A procedure in this case can be realized in the same way as in this embodiment.","For example, in , upon factory shipment, the product serial number and the like recorded on the HF-RFID tag M added to the apparatus M are copied to the UHF-RFID tag M added to the package M after packaging. The same applies to shipment to a disposal facility or shipment to a recycling center, other than factory shipment. In the case of shipment to a disposal facility, after disposal completion, disposal completion is registered in the management server. This enables unified management to be performed while the product is manufactured, used by the consumer, and put into disposal. Recently, there is a problem of illegal disposal due to disposal cost. However, referencing HF-RFID or UHF-RFID of an illegally disposed apparatus makes it instantly clear in which part of the distribution stage the illegal disposal has been conducted. Thus, the problem of illegal disposal can be alleviated according to this embodiment.","In the case of shipment to a recycling center, since use status information, a problem detection status, a total use time, and the like detected by the use status detection unit  are recorded in an area accessible from the HF-RFID tag, such information can be used for determination of whether or not the apparatus is recyclable, price determination, and so on.

Communication devices MS and MR included in a home network share the same home ID using a home network M and the home network communication devices M. The communication devices MS and MR may share the home ID using the proximity wireless communication devices M. The communication device according to this embodiment (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201ctransmitting communication device MS\u201d) can share the home ID with another communication device (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201creceiving communication device MR\u201d) in the same house, by transferring a sharing command and home ID to the receiving communication device via the proximity wireless communication devices M. In the transmitting communication device MS, a home ID sharing unit MS in a home ID management unit MS provides the sharing command and the home ID that is held in a home ID storage unit MS, to a proximity wireless communication device MS. For example, when the proximity wireless communication device MS of the transmitting communication device MS is moved into proximity of a proximity wireless communication device MR of the receiving communication device MR, information is transferred between them. Thereby, the home ID in the transmitting communication device MS is stored into the proximity wireless communication device MR of the receiving communication device MR. If a home ID storage unit MR in the receiving communication device M does not hold any home ID, a home ID sharing unit MR in the receiving communication device MR stores the received home ID into the receiving communication device MR itself. Thereby, it is possible to quite easily share the home ID between the communication devices. On the other hand, if the home ID storage unit MR already holds home ID, the receiving communication device MR transmits both the held home ID and the received home ID to the registration server M. In receiving both home IDs, the registration server M manages both home IDs virtually as a single home ID. The registration server M may notify both communication devices of one of the home IDs to unify them. Even in this case, the registration server M manages both home IDs virtually as a single home ID since there are non-always-connected devices in the home network. It is possible that ID of a non-always-connected device is updated every time of being connected to the home network and the virtual management by the registration server M ends when updating of all of the registration devices (namely, devices to be registered which are included in the home network) are completed. Thereby, it is possible to unify originally plural home networks into a single network.","The home ID sharing can be performed by using the home network. When a communication device is to be connected to the home network M and a home network connection detection unit MS of the communication device detects that the communication device does not hold home ID, the communication device broadcasts a request for home ID sharing to terminals connected to the home network M. Terminals holding home ID among the terminals connected to the home network M transmit the home ID to the communication device. Thereby, the home ID sharing is completed prior to start of communication. Here, if a master terminal to respond to requests for home ID sharing is previously selected from among terminals holding the home ID, it is possible to prevent that a device requesting home ID sharing receives responses from a plurality of terminals thereby overburdening the home network. If there is no response, the communication device terminal requesting home ID sharing may obtain home ID by itself.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1425","num":"1424"},"figref":"FIG. 158","b":["1101","1102","1101","1701","1101","1101","1702","1101","1101","1101","1703","1101","1101","1101","1101","1705","1101","1101","1101","1706","1101","1707","1101","1101","1708","1101","1101","1101","1709","1101","1101","1710","1101","1711"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1426","num":"1425"},"figref":"FIG. 159","b":["1101","1102","1101","1752","1101","1101","1753"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1427","num":"1426"},"figref":"FIG. 160","b":["1101","1101","1101","1101","1005","1101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1428","num":"1427"},"figref":"FIG. 161","b":["1101","1103","1101","1801","1802","1101","1101","1804","1101","1303"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1429","num":"1428"},"figref":"FIG. 162","b":["1101","1103","1851","1101","1101","1852","1101","1101","1101","1853","1101","1101","1101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1430","num":"1429"},"figref":"FIG. 163","b":["1103","1854"]},"[Embodiment 16]","A communication device according to Embodiment 16 of the present invention is described in detail with reference to the drawings.

The communication device Y includes a reader\/writer function of reading the terminal apparatus information from the terminal apparatus Y. The communication device Y is, for example, a portable device such as a mobile phone or a remote controller terminal of a TV.","The server Y is a server connected to the communication device Y in order to communicate with the communication device Y, via a general-purpose network such as the Internet.

The CPU Y controls the failure sensor unit Y, the use history logging unit Y, the memory Y, and the modulation unit Y which are units included in the terminal apparatus.","The failure sensor unit Y is a unit that detects a location and detail of a failure occurred in each unit included in the terminal apparatus Y. A piece of failure information detected by the failure sensor unit Y is accumulated in a Random Access Memory (RAM) in the memory Y. The detected failure information is represented by an error code that is uniquely defined depending on a location and condition of the failure.","The use history logging unit Y is a unit that performs logging for each piece of use history information every time the terminal apparatus Y is operated by the user. The use history information applied with logging is accumulated into the RAM Y in the memory Y. In general, when use history information is used to examine how a failure has occurred, several pieces of use history information up to occurrence of the failure have high priorities of being examined. Therefore, it is desirable that the use history logging unit Y according to this embodiment uses the RAM Y as First In First Out (FIFO) to chronologically accumulate new pieces of use history information into the RAM Y. Moreover, when use history information is used to examine how a failure has occurred, it is desirable that several pieces of use history information up to a timing detected by the failure sensor unit Y are stored as priorities into the RAM.

The modulation method varies depending on employed NFC standard. For example, Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Phase Shift Keying (PSK), and the like are used.","An example of the antenna Y is a loop antenna. The antenna Y generates electromagnetic induction from radio waves emitted from an antenna of the communication device Y. The antenna Y performs at least processing of providing power to the modulation unit Y and the memory Y to be operated. In addition, the antenna Y overlaps reflected waves of the radio waves emitted from the communication device Y with signals modulated by the modulation unit Y to transmit the terminal apparatus information that is stored in the memory Y to the communication device Y.","As described above, the terminal apparatus according to this embodiment detects failures occurred in each unit included in the terminal apparatus. Then, the terminal apparatus performs logging for use histories to accumulate the use histories into the memory. Then, if the terminal apparatus is moved into proximity of the communication device Y to be capable of performing proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y, the terminal apparatus can transmit the terminal apparatus information stored in the memory into the communication device Y.","Next, the communication device Y according to this embodiment is described. It should be noted that the subject of this embodiment is the communication device Y.","The communication device Y includes an antenna Y, a CPU Y, a demodulation unit Y, a memory Y, a position information determination unit Y, a GPS antenna Y, a communication memory Y, an information adding unit Y, and a communication unit Y.","The antenna Y performs polling for calling any terminal apparatuses in order to search for a terminal apparatus communicable with the communication device Y by proximity wireless communication. In receiving a response to the polling, the antenna Y establishes proximity wireless communication with the responding terminal apparatus Y to receive modulated terminal apparatus information from the terminal apparatus Y, and provides the modulated terminal apparatus information to the demodulation unit Y. In general, the polling processing is always necessary even if there is no terminal apparatus communicable with the communication device Y by proximity wireless communication. This consumes power. Therefore, the communication device Y is provided with a switch (not shown) for controlling a timing of start of polling, so that polling processing is performed when the switch is turned ON.

The position information determination unit Y includes a latitude\/longitude positioning unit (GPS) Y, an altitude positioning unit Y, and a position correction unit Y. The position information determination unit Y does not need to always determine a location of the communication device Y (location information) if the location information is generated at a timing where the communication device Y becomes communicable with the terminal apparatus Y using the antenna Y. As a result, power consumption of the communication device Y can be reduced.","The latitude\/longitude positioning unit Y is a general Global Positioning System (GPS) that receives radio waves from satellites to perform 3-dimensional (3D) positioning of the earth.","The altitude positioning unit Y is a general altimeter. The altitude positioning unit Y may be any various altimeters, such as an altimeter receiving radio waves to extract an altitude, an altimeter detecting an air pressure to measure an altitude, and the like. The altitude positioning unit Y is provide to the communication device Y so that an altitude can be detected even in a building where GPS cannot receive radio waves.","The position correction unit Y is a unit that corrects a value measured by the GPS to generate more accurate position information. In general, when radio waves from satellites cannot be received in a room or the like, the GPS cannot generate correct position information. Therefore, the position correction unit Y includes an electronic compass and a 6-axis acceleration sensor. The electronic compass is used to detect a direction in which the communication device Y moves and the acceleration sensor is used to detect a speed of the movement. Thereby, it is possible to correct position information generated by the GPS in a location where the GPS is difficult.","Regarding the information adding unit Y, when the terminal apparatus information that has been provided from the terminal apparatus Y and stored into the memory Y is to be transmitted to the server Y, the information adding unit Y adds (a) the product serial number of the communication device Y that is stored in the ROM Y in the memory Y and (b) the position information measured by the position information determination unit Y, to the terminal apparatus information. This enables the server Y to determine which communication device transmits the terminal apparatus information, where the transmitting terminal apparatus is located, for example, and then manage the results of the determination. For example, if a manufacturer of the terminal apparatus finds that the terminal apparatus has a possibility of causing serious accidents, the information in the database of the server Y allows the manufacturer to determine where the terminal apparatus is. Thereby, the possibility of causing serious accidents can be reduced. As a result, it is possible to increase sense of safety and security of the user using the terminal apparatus. Furthermore, when the communication device Y has a display function as mobile phone terminals have, the above-described terminal apparatus information generated by the information adding unit Y makes it possible to determine with which communication device the terminal apparatus having a possibility of accidents can perform proximity wireless communication, and thereby display a notification of the possibility of accidents in the terminal apparatus on the communication device Y. Thereby, even if such a terminal apparatus generally does not have any display function and is not connected to a general-purpose network, it is possible to transmit a notification of the accident possibility of the terminal apparatus to the communication device Y in order to warn the user using the terminal apparatus. As a result, it is also possible to provide a terminal apparatus that can increase sense of safety and security of the user using the terminal apparatus.","The communication unit Y is a unit that communicates with the server Y via the Internet by using general LAN, wireless LAN, or mobile phone network. Thereby, the communication unit Y transmits, to the server Y, the terminal apparatus information added with the product serial number and the position information of the communication device Y as the communication device information.

However, the present invention is not limited to the above. For example, it is also possible that image data of a room arrangement created by the user is transmitted from the mobile device N to the registration server N, and therefore managed by the product information management unit N.

In the system, the terminal apparatus can be operated by the mobile device when the mobile device points to the terminal apparatus, through the use of sensor information or the like of the mobile device. The system is described in detail below, with reference to drawings.","(Overall System Structure)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1769","num":"1768"},"figref":["FIG. 195","FIG. 195"],"b":["100","101","102","104"]},"The terminal apparatus  and the mobile device  can communicate with each other by using proximity wireless communication. Here, the proximity wireless communication in this embodiment is assumed to be (1) communication between a Radio Frequency Identification (RF-ID) tag (ISO 14443) and a reader\/writer, which is performed by electromagnetic induction of 13.56 MHz band (High Frequency (HF) band), radio waves between 52 MHz to 954 MHz band (Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band), or the like, or (2) communication of Near Field Communication (NFC) (ISO\/IEC 21481) of 13.56 MHz band. Since the communication distance is typically limited to several tens of centimeters in the HF band and several centimeters in the UHF band, communication is established by holding the mobile device over the terminal apparatus (or touching the mobile device to the terminal apparatus).","In this embodiment, the description is given for a structure in which the mobile device  has a reader\/writer function and the terminal apparatus  has an IC tag function. However, this embodiment is applicable to any structure so long as the terminal apparatus  and the mobile device  can exchange information using proximity wireless communication. That is, a structure in which the mobile device  has an IC tag function and the terminal apparatus  has a reader\/writer function is also included within the scope of the present invention. Moreover, for the NFC, a peer-to-peer (P2P) communication function, a card emulation, and a reader\/writer emulation have been standardized. These functions make no difference which device\/apparatus should have an IC tag or a reader\/writer. For the sake of simplicity in the description, it is assumed in this embodiment that the mobile device  has a reader\/writer function and the terminal apparatus  has an IC tag function.","The terminal apparatus  includes a controller , a main memory , a proximity wireless communication unit , and an antenna .","The controller  is, for example, a CPU which is a system controller of the terminal apparatus . The controller  performs system control at least for the terminal apparatus  other than the proximity wireless communication unit .","The main memory  is a memory capable of storing control software for operation in the controller  and various data sensed in the terminal apparatus , and is typically implemented in LSI of the controller  (though the main memory  may instead be provided as an external memory). For example, the main memory  is a RAM, a nonvolatile memory, or the like.","The proximity wireless communication unit  performs communication with the reader\/writer in the mobile device . The proximity wireless communication unit  modulates data to be transmitted to the reader\/writer, and demodulates data transmitted from the reader\/writer. In addition, the proximity wireless communication unit  generates power from radio waves received from the reader\/writer in order to establish at least proximity wireless communication, and also extracts clock signals from the received radio waves. At least the proximity wireless communication unit  in the terminal apparatus  is thereby operated by the power and clock generated from the radio waves from the reader\/writer. Therefore, the proximity wireless communication unit  can perform proximity wireless communication with the mobile device  even if a main power of the terminal apparatus  is OFF.","The antenna  is a loop antenna for the proximity wireless communication with the reader\/writer in the mobile device .","The mobile device  includes an antenna , a display unit , and keys .","The antenna  is an antenna for the proximity wireless communication with the terminal apparatus . The mobile device  performs polling towards the IC tag on the terminal apparatus . When the communication with the terminal apparatus  is established, the mobile device  reads information from the terminal apparatus  or writes information into the terminal apparatus .","The display unit  displays the result of proximity wireless communication between the mobile device  and the terminal apparatus  and data transmitted from the server device . For example, the display unit  is a liquid crystal display or the like.","The keys  are an interface for the user to operate the mobile device . A structure in which the display unit  is a touch panel and therefore also serves as the keys  is applicable, too.","The mobile device  activates the proximity wireless communication unit in the mobile device  according to the user's input by the keys . After the activation, the mobile device  starts polling for proximity wireless communication to the terminal apparatus . In general, polling keeps emitting radio waves to unspecified receivers. Therefore, the mobile device  driven by a battery is under load in terms of battery duration. In view of this, the mobile device  may be provided with a dedicated button for polling. This prevents unnecessary polling, and also alleviates the user's load in operating the device.","The server device  is a server having a database. The server device  is typically implemented as a Web server having a database. The server device  is connected to the mobile device  via the Internet . The server device  registers, onto the database, information transferred from the mobile device , and transfers, to the mobile device , information indicating the result. The display unit  of the mobile device  displays the received information.","With the system structure described above, information sensed in the terminal apparatus  can be registered in the database in the server device  via the mobile device . For example, the terminal apparatus  transfers information for uniquely identifying the terminal apparatus, such as a product serial number, a model number, or manufacturer identification information, to the mobile device  using proximity wireless communication. The mobile device  transfers the information received from the terminal apparatus  via proximity wireless communication, information stored in the mobile device  (e-mail address, phone number, mobile terminal identification information, or SIM card ID) for specifying the user or the mobile device  itself, and information (GPS information, A-GPS information, position information estimated from a base station in a mobile network, etc.) for specifying a position of the mobile device  in the case where the mobile device  is capable of sensing position information, to the server device . The server device  registers these information in the database. The series of operations can eliminate the user's load of inputting various information. In other words, the user can substantially perform user registration and the like for the terminal apparatus  merely by holding the mobile device  over the terminal apparatus .","Moreover, transmitting trouble occurrence state information or use history information as the sensed information of the terminal apparatus  allows the manufacturer to promptly determine and deal with an initial failure of a specific lot. Moreover, the structure offers advantages to the manufacturer that can specify functions used by each user from the use history information and use the specified information for next product development.","(Structure of Mobile Device)","The following describes the mobile device  according to this embodiment in detail, with reference to

pointed by the mobile device , based on the directional space information obtained by the directional space obtainment unit  and the position information of the terminal apparatus  stored in the

corresponding to the pressed key , to the terminal apparatus .","The operation history obtainment unit  obtains information of the remote control command transmitted by the operation information transmission unit , thus obtaining the user's operation history of the terminal apparatus .","The sound sensor  senses sound around the mobile device . For example, the sound sensor  is a microphone.","With the above structure, it is possible to store the terminal apparatus information, the position of the terminal apparatus , and the remote control information of the terminal apparatus  in the storage unit  in association with each other. It is also possible to calculate the direction pointed by the mobile device  using the sensor information, call the remote control information of the terminal apparatus  existing in the calculated directional space from the storage unit , and set the remote control command of the mobile device  based on the remote control information of the terminal apparatus . For example, merely by pointing the mobile device  to a home appliance such as an air conditioner or a TV which the user of the mobile device  wants to operate, the user can operate the pointed home appliance with the mobile device .","Moreover, the movement determination unit  determines whether or not the mobile device  is still. Such detection of the still state of the mobile device  can be used as a trigger to set the mobile device  as a remote controller of the terminal apparatus  in the direction pointed by the mobile device . Thus, the mobile device  can be set as a remote controller without the user's key operation or the like.","Besides, the pointing direction of the mobile device  can be obtained by the direction sensing unit . Accordingly, in the case where, when operating the terminal apparatus  using the mobile device  via infrared communication, the direction of infrared communication deviates from the terminal apparatus , a warning message such as \u201cPlease direct the mobile device  slightly to the right\u201d can be presented to the user.","In addition, the sound information of the terminal apparatus , such as sound generated upon channel switching in the case of a TV or reaction sound notifying the user of successful reception of remote control information in the case of an air conditioner or the like, can be obtained by the sound sensor . This enables the mobile device  to recognize whether or not the operation command is successfully delivered, with no need for transmission of a specific feedback signal indicating that the signal is received by the terminal apparatus . Hence, even when the terminal apparatus  is not connected to a general-purpose network, proper operation history of the terminal apparatus  can be collected from the terminal apparatus  via the mobile device .","Furthermore, the detection of the terminal apparatus  by the proximity wireless detection unit  is used as a trigger to initialize the relative position information obtained by the relative position obtainment unit  and set the absolute position information in the absolute position obtainment unit  to position information obtainable from the apparatus information or via the GPS sensor  or the external communication unit .

This enables the mobile device  to recognize whether or not the reception of the operation command is completed, with no need for transmission of a specific feedback signal indicating that the signal is successfully received by the terminal apparatus .","In such a case, the mobile device  retransmits the operation command.","After this, in the case of determining that the predetermined number of retransmissions is exceeded, the mobile device  outputs a warning to the user to perform the key operation again, such as \u201cPlease input again\u201d, to the display unit . The mobile device  then enters a state of waiting for the user to input the operation command.","Though this embodiment describes an example where the apparatus information of the terminal apparatus  is obtained using proximity wireless communication, the present invention is not limited to such. For instance, a bar-code including the apparatus information may be attached to the terminal apparatus , and read using an optical scanner of a digital camera or the like in the mobile device .  is a diagram showing an example of reading the apparatus information of the terminal apparatus  from a bar-code according to this embodiment. An air conditioner  and a mobile device  are shown in . The mobile device  has the same structure as the mobile device , except that an optical scanner is included. A 2D bar-code  including apparatus information is attached to the air conditioner . The apparatus information of the 2D bar-code is obtained using the optical scanner of the mobile device . In this way, even when the terminal apparatus  does not have a proximity wireless communication function, it is still possible to obtain the apparatus information of the terminal apparatus . Hence, the apparatus information can be obtained even in a situation where the terminal apparatus  is installed at a high place as in the case of an air conditioner and so it is difficult to touch the terminal apparatus  for establishing proximity wireless communication.","In the case where a plurality of terminal apparatuses  are situated in proximity and it is difficult for the apparatus specification unit  to specify one terminal apparatus  or in the case where the user wants to operate a plurality of terminal apparatuses  simultaneously, the plurality of terminal apparatuses  are operated using the mobile device .  is a diagram showing an example of operating a plurality of illumination apparatuses. In , display is made so that illumination switches operable on an illumination switch board can be operated simultaneously by pointing the mobile device  to the illumination switch board. For example, it is possible to set operation information for kitchen illumination and dining room illumination in the mobile device  and operate the two illumination apparatuses simultaneously, as shown in (a) in . Besides, if illumination intensity is analogously changeable as in the case of LED or the like, display may be made as shown in (b) in .","In the case where terminal apparatuses  such as a TV and a recorder are closely located, it is difficult to display all remote control commands of the terminal apparatuses  on the display unit  because the TV and the recorder each have a large number of remote control commands for operation. Accordingly, in the case where there are a large number of remote control commands, the display unit  performs display so that the user can select a terminal apparatus  for which the mobile device  is used as a remote controller. (a) in  is a diagram showing a display example for prompting the user to select a TV or a recorder. In (a) in , the mobile device  serves as a TV remote controller when setting of TV remote control is \u201cON\u201d, and a recorder remote controller when setting of recorder remote control is \u201cON\u201d.","In the case where the mobile device  is capable of obtaining the current operation status of the terminal apparatus , the mobile device  may set remote control information according to the current operation status. This makes it unnecessary to display all remote control commands, as a result of which the user interface can be simplified. For example, in the case of a TV or the like, the operation status may be obtained using a general-purpose network such as the Internet. (b) in  is a diagram showing an example of setting remote control information in the mobile device  according to the current operation status. In (b) in , it is assumed that the TV is ON and the recorder is OFF, and the mobile device  obtains this current operation status. Since there is at least no possibility of using a power ON command as a TV operation, the power ON command does not need to be included in TV remote control in the mobile device . Meanwhile, the recorder is OFF, and so a recorder remote control operation initially selected by the user is likely to be a power ON operation. Thus, remote control commands presented to the user can be narrowed down according to the operation status of the terminal apparatus .","Though this embodiment describes the case where the mobile device  calculates the directional space information of the mobile device  and specifies the terminal apparatus  existing in the pointing direction of the mobile device , the server device  may perform the specification. For example, the mobile device  transmits angular velocity information, acceleration information, and position information to the server device  via the external communication unit . The server device  specifies the terminal apparatus  existing in the pointing direction of the mobile device  based on the angular velocity information, the acceleration information, and the position information received from the mobile device , and transmits remote control information of the specified terminal apparatus  to the mobile device .","In this embodiment, altitude information of the mobile device  may be used, too. As an example, the altitude information of the mobile device  can be obtained using a barometer.","In this embodiment, a detection range of a remote controller for a terminal apparatus  such as a TV or an air conditioner may be variable depending on a degree of mobility, a degree of operation urgency, a size of the apparatus, or the like. For example, the reduction of a detection range for a terminal apparatus , such as an air conditioner, which is unlikely to be moved, can prevent false operation during operation of another terminal apparatus . On the other hand, the increase of a detection range of a remote controller for a terminal apparatus , such as a fan, which is likely to be moved, makes it possible to operate the terminal apparatus  even if the position of the terminal apparatus is changed to some extent.","Moreover, in the case where the terminal apparatus  is far from the mobile device , the range in which the mobile device  can operate the apparatus decreases. In view of this, the threshold \u03b1 for defining the directional space range may be variable depending on the distance between the terminal apparatus  and the mobile device .","It is also possible for the user who is on the first floor of a building to operate a terminal apparatus  on the second floor by pointing the mobile device , as shown in . In such a case where the terminal apparatus  exist on a different floor from the mobile device , the terminal apparatus  exists in a different room from the mobile device , or the operated apparatus is away from the mobile device  by a predetermined distance or more, a list of apparatuses in the room or the like may be displayed when pointing the mobile device . In so doing, it is possible to operate the terminal apparatus  at a remote location even when the user does not exactly remember the location of the terminal apparatus  in a next room or the like.","[Embodiment 20]","The following describes Embodiment 20 of the present invention.  is a diagram showing a home network environment assumed in this embodiment.

This is because the mobile terminal always holds the 3D coordinate information. When the mobile terminal is close to each of the child device, the parent device, and the relay device via NFC, or when the mobile terminal, which is close to each of the devices\/apparatuses, receives information from the device, the mobile terminal exchange physical position relationships among the devices\/apparatuses with the devices\/apparatuses. As a result, the mobile terminal can obtain the 3D position information as well as the network ID information such as a MAC address from each of the devices\/apparatuses. By processing the obtained data by the mobile terminal or by a server in or outside the user's home, a physically optimum network configuration can be attained. This network configuration information can be easily calculated when the 3D position relationships are known. In detail, it is possible to easily determine that the configuration where (a) a sub network PAN ID includes an apparatus having a MAC address , another apparatus, and a relay device having a MAC address , (b) a sub network PAN ID includes the SEG having a MAC address  with Internet protocols, and other apparatuses having MAC addresses  and , respectively, all of which are connected by radio, and (c) the PAN ID and the PAN ID are connected to each other via the relay device can offer maximum energy saving, stability, and loop prevention, as shown in an example in the lower part of .","Here, the conventional methods such as ZigBee require a one-to-one relationship between the SEG and the child device. This is because addition of a relay device requires optimization of designing and setting of the whole network configuration, and there has been no method for easily obtaining 3D position relationships of respective devices\/apparatuses. Such conventional methods are possible in networks used in company offices that can afford cost and effort. However, general home cannot afford such cost and effort for home appliances such as air conditioners, a microwave, and a solar panel. Therefore, the addition of relay device in a home network has not been easy.","However, in the present invention, it is possible to obtain position information and ID information such as MAC addresses of the apparatuses (home appliances), only by making the mobile terminal touch the apparatuses by using NFC or by inputting data into the mobile terminal positioned very close to the apparatuses. Therefore, the server or the mobile terminal can obtain the configuration information without cost and effort. If the mobile terminal is operated to record the obtained configuration information directly or indirectly onto the SEG or the relay device, it is possible to easily generate optimum network configuration information. Furthermore, the use of NFC allows the user to check unauthorized actions by using a cryptography key or 3D position information, thereby increasing security. Therefore, the addition of relay device is possible also at home, and it is possible to achieve stable wireless communication over a long distance between a solar panel on the roof and a SEG on the first floor, or a long distance between a SEG at home and a heat pump system or a charging system outside home, for example. Then, in these cases, the use of the server makes it possible to calculate the network configuration information at high accuracy by using 3D coordinates. Therefore, it is possible to configure an ideal network system, and prevent abnormal communication such as loop. As a result, transmission efficiency can be increased.","[Embodiment 21]","In Embodiment 21, the description is given for a system that enables the mobile terminal to serve as a remote controller for operating an apparatus by using a 3D product map of a building with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2032","num":"2031"},"figref":["FIG. 189","FIG. 190","FIGS. 189 and 190","FIGS. 236"],"b":["102","237","238"]},"First, in S, the mobile terminal obtains position information of the mobile terminal using GPS information.","Next, in S, the mobile terminal obtains position information that is to be used as a reference point. For example, in the case where an unlocking system, which locks\/unlocks keys by the mobile terminal via proximity wireless communication, is cooperated with an entrance key of the building, the mobile terminal obtains an apparatus ID of the unlocking system via proximity communication when the entrance key is unlocked by the proximity communication of the mobile terminal. Then, the mobile terminal sets, as the reference point, position information associated with the obtained apparatus ID (position \u201c\u201d in ). Here, the database in which the apparatus ID and the position information are stored in association with each other may be held in the server or the mobile terminal. It should be noted that the mobile terminal may obtain the position information of the entrance key directly from the entrance key by using proximity communication, or of course, from another apparatus except the unlocking system.","In S, the user holding the mobile terminal enters the building. Here, the mobile terminal may detect the user's entrance based on output information of a sensor provided to a door, and set a position of the door to be the reference point.","The following describes the situation where the user walks from position \u201c\u201d to position \u201c\u201d in , in S. In S, the mobile terminal obtains information of a step length of the user walking at home from a database, and detects the number of steps n in a target section by using an acceleration sensor, a geomagnetic sensor, or a vibrating gyro. Multiplying the step length by the number of steps n results in the traveling distance. In addition, the mobile terminal detects the traveling direction by using the vibrating gyro and the geomagnetic sensor. Based on the calculated traveling distance and traveling direction, the mobile terminal calculates a relative position of the mobile terminal with respect to the reference point in the 3D space, and records the calculated position information onto a database in the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal may transmit the position information and the traveling information of the mobile terminal, to the server.","The following describes the situation where the user is at position \u201c\u201d in , in S. In S, when the user moves to in front of the TV on the first floor and points the mobile terminal to the TV, if the TV is on a normal line passing 3D coordinate information of the position of the mobile terminal in a direction measured by the mobile terminal, the mobile terminal is connected to the TV via a network and the TV becomes remotely controllable by the mobile terminal.","The following describes the situation where the user moves from position \u201c\u201d to position \u201c\u201d in , in S. In S, when the user moves on the first floor, enters a Japanese-style room, and points the mobile terminal to the air conditioner, the mobile terminal is connected to the air conditioner on a network so that the mobile terminal can serve as a remote controller of the air conditioner. Here, in the same manner as in S, the mobile terminal detects a traveling distance from position \u201c\u201d to position \u201c\u201d based on the step length and the number of steps of the user, and thereby calculates 3D position information (relative position information) of the mobile terminal. The 3D position information is stored into the database in the mobile terminal or the server.","Furthermore, in S in , when the user moves from position \u201c\u201d to position \u201c\u201d in , a traveling distance is calculated based on the number of steps, and then stored into the database in the mobile terminal or the server. As described above, such traveling information for each traveling section is accumulated in the database for each user. Therefore, the accumulation is used as a walking history of each user depending on each traveling section. A step length of each user is learned from the walking history to increase its accuracy.","In S, when the user reaches a staircase in the home, the mobile terminal starts calculating (a) a traveling change in the height and (b) a horizontal traveling distance, regarding user's traveling on the staircase. Here, it is assumed that m represents a height of one stair and that k represents a length of one stair. Under the assumption, multiplying the number of steps by m results in the traveling change in the height, and multiplying the number of steps by k results in the horizontal traveling distance. It is noted that m and k are accumulated in the database, so that m and k are learned from the past data to increase their accuracy.","The following describes the case where the user ascends by a lift and not by the staircase, in S. In this case, characteristic data of the lift in the building is recorded on the database. A time r required to ascend from a floor P to a floor Q is obtained from the database, and the floor number to which the user ascends is measured based on the required time r. It is also possible to increase the accuracy of P, Q, and r by learning them from past data. In addition, start and stop of the ascending lift is detected by the acceleration sensor.","If it is determined in S that the ascending has been completed, then the processing proceeds to S.","In S, a horizontal traveling distance of the ascending is calculated by multiplying the step length by the number of steps, and a traveling direction of the ascending is detected by the vibrating gyro. Based on the horizontal traveling distance and the traveling direction, the mobile terminal generates 3D position information of the mobile terminal. If there is 3D structure data of the building, the position information is modified based on the 3D structure data to increase its accuracy. In S which follows, it is assumed that the user moves out from the lift or the staircase and temporarily stops at the front-left of a TV on the second floor (at position \u201c\u201d in ).","In S, it is determined whether or not an accumulated error E in the accumulated pieces of 3D position information is greater than a predetermined error allowable value. The accumulated error E is calculated by multiplying a traveling distance by 5%. If it is determined that the accumulated error E is greater than the error allowable value, then the processing proceeds to S.","In S, the mobile terminal searches apparatuses having (relative or absolute) position information registered in the database, for an apparatus having position information closest to the position information of the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal then presents the searched-out apparatus on the screen of the mobile terminal. The operator takes a photograph of the apparatus by a camera unit of the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal recognizes the apparatus based on the image photographed by the camera unit, and calculates a relative angle and a distance between the mobile terminal and the apparatus in order to modify a reference position.","Subsequently, in S in , the mobile terminal obtains network information (MAC address, IP address, communication key, and the like) of the apparatus based on apparatus ID of the apparatus, and is thereby connected to the apparatus. When the user presses a Lock button on the mobile terminal while pointing the mobile terminal to the apparatus, the connection between the mobile terminal and the apparatus is fixed. As a result, the mobile terminal can serve as a remote controller of the apparatus or display video data of the apparatus on the screen of the mobile terminal.","Finally, in S, the mobile terminal completes the remote control operation function.","By the above-described processing, the mobile terminal can obtain a relative position of the mobile terminal with respect to a reference point, and can thereby serve as a remote controller of an apparatus only by pointing the mobile terminal to the apparatus without using correct absolute position information.","Furthermore, if an error in the traveling distance measured by the acceleration sensor is large, it is possible to decrease the error of the position information by using a step length, position information of the apparatus, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2050","num":"2049"},"figref":"FIG. 239"},"First, in the case of determining that the reference point of the mobile terminal cannot be obtained yet in S, the process proceeds to S.

It has been described in this embodiment that the target apparatus to be operated by the mobile device is a recorder and that the user records a TV program currently watched on a TV onto the recorder. However, this embodiment is not limited to the above example. The apparatus may be a display apparatus. In this case, the user may display the currently watching TV program or content on the target apparatus, instead of recording the TV program or content onto the target apparatus. As a result, the user can watch a currently-watched TV program, Web page, or content also on a different display apparatus, without necessity of inputting information of the TV program, Web page, or content by using a keyboard of a remote controller of the different display apparatus. Furthermore, a Web page which the user is watching on the mobile device can be displayed also on the display apparatus.","Embodiment 22 is further described below, with reference to the flowchart in .","After S, it is assumed that, on the mobile device , the user is watching the same video as that displayed on the TV (S).","When the user wishes to use the mobile device  as a remote controller of the apparatus, the user presses the remote control mode button displayed on the display screen of the mobile device  (Yes in S). As a result, the screen of the mobile device  switches to the remote control mode for the apparatus (S). Here, the program for controlling the target apparatus (TV) which has been obtained at S includes a remote control mode button display function and a remote control mode control program (or script).","With the above structure, by pointing the mobile device to the TV to be controlled, the user can display a remote control mode for the TV on the mobile device and control channels and a sound volume of the TV, without using a remote controller of the TV. Moreover, there is no need to download a TV remote control application and select a program corresponding to the TV unlike a conventional mobile phone, as a program for the TV to which the remote controller is pointed is automatically downloaded. This simplifies the operation of switching to the remote control mode.","Next, in the case where a use frequency or a communication rate between the remote controller and the apparatus is low (Yes in S), the remote controller obtains ZigBee or infrared communication protocol from the server, to switch to a wireless communication standard of lower power consumption.","With the above structure, automatic selection of a communication standard optimal to a corresponding function can reduce power consumption of the mobile device and the peripheral apparatus.","Next, in the case where the user presses a Lock Release button displayed on the screen of the mobile device  (Yes in S), the mobile device  releases connection from the apparatus (TV or the like) (S), and returns to the initial screen (S). The above step is shown in  in .","With the above structure, when the user wishes to cause the mobile device to execute functions of different apparatuses, it is possible to selectively switch the functions.","Embodiment 22 is further described below, with reference to the flowcharts in .","First, the mobile device  obtains position information of the mobile device (S). The method of obtaining the position information of the mobile device has already been described in detail with reference to , so that the description will not be repeated below.","Next, the user displays a cooking recipe using a Web browser or the like on the mobile device  (S).","In the situation where the specific recipe is displayed on the mobile device , the user points the mobile device  to an apparatus (a microwave, a cooking machine, or the like) which the user intends to use for cooking, while pressing the Move button on the mobile device  (Yes in S). This step is shown in \u201cC\u201d in .","Here, the mobile device  extracts, from the database, apparatus candidates in the direction pointed by the mobile device , based on 3D (relative or absolute) coordinate information of positions of the mobile device  and the apparatus, direction information indicating the direction pointed by the mobile device , attitude information of the apparatus, and area information of the apparatus (S).","In the case where there are a plurality of apparatus candidates in the direction pointed by the mobile device  (Yes in S), the mobile device  displays a list of the apparatus candidates with their position relationships on the screen of the mobile device  (S). When the user changes the direction pointed by the mobile device  (Yes in S), the mobile device  changes the display of the apparatus candidates on the screen of the mobile device  according to the changed direction, based on determination as to how much each of the apparatus candidates is closer to the center of the direction pointed by the mobile device  (S). Here, regarding the apparatus candidate display on the display screen of the mobile device , an apparatus candidate closer to the center of the direction pointed by the mobile device  is displayed closer to the center of the display. It is also possible that the apparatus candidate closer to the center of the direction pointed by the mobile device  is displayed higher in the display, or displayed with a target cursor.","When the apparatus that the user desires to operate is displayed at the center of the display, the user releases the Move button (S). The Move button may be a physical switch of the mobile device , or may be a virtual button displayed on a touch panel of the mobile device . Or, the Move button may be a different device logically connected to the mobile device .","When the specific apparatus (microwave in this example) pointed by the mobile device  is specified, the mobile device  obtains or downloads, from the database in the server or the mobile device , network connection information (a MAC address, an IP address, a communication key, a communication standard, a communication protocol) of the apparatus, a performance capability of the apparatus, a program for controlling the apparatus, a script for the apparatus, and the like (S).","In the case where the specified apparatus has a cooking capability (Yes in S), the mobile device  transmits, to the specified apparatus, recipe information (cooking details and method (ranging, oven-frying, mixing, kneading, baking, swearing, thawing, heating, and steaming, etc.), cooking extent (temperature, time, etc.)) or recipe source information (URL, etc.), authentication information (authentication protocol, key), and the like together with a recording instruction (S).","Upon receiving the recording request from the mobile device , the apparatus performs connection, receives the recording data, and records the data according to the request (S).","The apparatus transmits the recorded cocking data such as cooking recipe details to the mobile device  (S).","The mobile device  displays, on the mobile device , the cooking details of the apparatus.

Furthermore, even if the recipe is not stored in the microwave or the cooking machine, the recipe can be recorded onto the apparatus without any complicated procedures. In addition, the cooking appliance does not need to have a device such as a browser or a touch panel. As a result, a cost of the cooking appliance can be reduced.","S in  is described in detail below, with reference to the steps from  in .","If the user unlock (releases) the Lock button (Yes in ), the mobile device returns to the previously-displayed screen (here, the screen displaying the TV).","If the user does not release the Lock button (No in ) and wishes to record the displayed information onto the recorder (Yes in ), the user points the mobile device in a direction from \u201cA\u201d to \u201cB\u201d in  while pressing the Move button ().","The mobile device detects an apparatus existing in the pointed 3D direction from 3D coordinate information by using a 3D direction sensor in the mobile device, and is connected to the apparatus (recorder) (). Here, the display shown in is displayed.","If the user releases the Move button in the state of (), the mobile device transmits a request for recording a currently-displayed TV program, to the apparatus (recorder). The display shown in is displayed on the screen of the mobile device, and the recorder starts recording of the TV program displayed on the mobile device.","Furthermore, if the user changes the direction pointed by the mobile device from direction \u201cB\u201d to direction \u201cA\u201d in  (), the display shown in is displayed on the mobile device.","The following describes effects of this embodiment with reference to . In , solid lines show directions of \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d, respectively, from the mobile terminal to the respective apparatuses, in the case where the display screen  is pointed to the front sides of the TV, the recorder, and the microwave, respectively. Dotted lines show directions of the mobile terminal, in the case where the display screen  is pointed to the rear sides of the TV, the recorder, and the microwave, respectively. In a conventional method merely using a motion sensor, which is applied to games and the like, when the display screen  is pointed to the front side of the TV, the direction \u201cA\u201d is rotated to the left (in other words, in counterclockwise direction) to be switched to the direction \u201cB\u201d. Therefore, the target apparatus is switched from the TV to the recorder as the operator intends. However, when the display screen  is pointed to the rear side of the TV, the direction \u201cA\u201d is rotated in clockwise direction, which is opposite to the counterclockwise direction, to be switched to the direction \u201cB\u201d to point to the recorder. Therefore, the motion sensor wrongly detects that the target apparatus pointed by the mobile terminal is switched from the TV to the microwave. As a result, the mobile terminal wrongly selects the microwave and displays it on the display screen. Therefore, the mobile terminal performs false operation which the operator does not intend.","In this embodiment, however, 3D mapping coordinate information of the TV, the recorder, and the microwave are registered by using NFC and the server beforehand. The mobile terminal also stores 3D coordinate information of the mobile terminal itself. Therefore, when the mobile terminal is moved to the rear side of the TV located at the center of a large room and then rotated in clockwise direction from the direction \u201cA\u201d shown by the dotted arrow to the TV to the direction \u201cB\u201d shown by the dotted arrow to the recorder, the mobile terminal can correctly select the recorder to be displayed, based on the 3D coordinate information of the positions of the TV, the recorder, and the mobile terminal and the direction pointed by the mobile terminal. As a result, the screen of the mobile terminal displays the recorder. Furthermore, the mobile terminal is linked to the recorder. As described above, this embodiment can offer special advantages of preventing false operations.","Generally, there are few dozens of home appliances at home. In this embodiment, when NFC communication is performed by touching such a home appliance by the mobile terminal, a distance between the mobile terminal and the home appliance is about 5 cm to 10 cm. If the mobile terminal has correct position information, the position information with accuracy of about 5 cm to 10 cm is sent to the server. In other words, in this embodiment, the few dozens of home appliances at home are set to be reference points for position determination. Conventionally, there has been a problem that there is no reference point that is a reference in position determination so that a position in a building cannot be determined correctly. This embodiment, however, can offer significant advantages that most of home appliances can serve as reference points.","(Position Information Obtainment Method in Communication Method Having Plural Transmission Paths)","As shown in , there is a communication method, such as Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), which uses a plurality of antennas to establish a plurality of transmission paths to transmit data. The following describes a method of obtaining position information in the case where a parent device  and a mobile terminal (mobile device)  communicate with each other by the above-mentioned communication method. The parent device  communicates with the mobile terminal  via three transmission paths , , and . In practice, there are nine transmission paths (3\u00d73 transmission paths), though not shown in the drawing. In this case, the mobile terminal  using the communication method such as MIMO calculates a transfer function A according to the illustrated expression in Step . The mobile terminal  further calculates transmission information such as eigenvectors X and Wi, an eigenvalue \u03bb, and the like, and performs communication. Here, the nine transmission paths have respective different characteristics, such as different eigenvectors, phases, and amplitudes. More specifically, in Step , characteristics of the respective transmission paths are extracted. In Step , a radio field strength is measured. In Step , transmission characteristics of the respective transmission paths are determined based on the 3D coordinate information of the mobile terminal  stored in the mobile terminal itself and the direction information of the mobile terminal . In Step , transfer functions of the respective transmission paths corresponding to the coordinate information and the radio field strength as well as the 3D coordinate information and the direction information are transmitted to a server .","In Step  in , the server  generates a pattern of (a) the 3D coordinate information of the mobile terminal  determined at a specific time, (b) the direction of the mobile terminal , (c) transmission characteristics (transfer function, eigenvalue, eigenvector of the transmission path), and (d) the strength. As shown in Step , the generated pattern is compressed with the transmission patterns , , (in more detail, AAA, ADA, CAB, for example) corresponding to the respective pieces of 3D coordinate information , , and , thereby mapping the patterns into a 3D coordinate space. In Step , the resulting transmission patterns (pieces of transmission information) are recorded onto a database in the server  in which 3D coordinate positions are stored. Here, it is also possible to record characteristics of a change in the transmission information for a predetermined time period during which the mobile terminal is moved.","As described above, the pieces of transmission information are recorded onto the database in the server. Here, such transmission information (transmission pattern) of the mobile terminal  is recorded in association with each user. Though the mobile terminal transmits position information with a low accuracy to the server, pieces of input transmission information (transmission patterns) are learned to record position information with a higher accuracy on the database.","Next, in Step , it is assumed that the mobile terminal transmits current transmission information to the server in order to obtain current position information. In Step , the server matches (a) the transmission pattern transmitted from the mobile terminal with (b) each of the transmission patterns (pieces of transmission information) recorded on the database in the server. For example, \u201cAAA\u201d is searched for by using a pattern matching method. In the case where there is any transmission pattern candidate in the database which is similar to the transmission pattern transmitted from the mobile terminal and the radio field strength of the mobile terminal (Step ) and also the number of such candidates is one (Step ), the server transmits, to the mobile terminal, 3D coordinate position information of the transmission pattern candidate in the database.","On the other hand, if there is not only one candidate, the process proceeds to Step . Consider the case where there are three transmission patterns of AAA, which are patterns , , and as shown in . In Step , based on low-accuracy 3D coordinate information  stored in the mobile terminal, the plurality of candidates are narrowed down (filtered) to only candidates close to the mobile terminal. As a result, the number of candidates can be reduced. If the number of candidates is not one, the server instructs the mobile terminal to use the low-accuracy 3D coordinate information stored in the mobile terminal in Step . On the other hand, if the number of candidates is one (Step ), the server  transmits 3D coordinate information of the transmission pattern to the mobile terminal (Step ).","However, the mobile terminal  in a room cannot obtain GPS position information from satellites. Therefore, a position of the mobile terminal  in a room is determined by using the three-axis vibrating gyro, the acceleration sensor, and the geomagnetic sensor. However, as the mobile terminal  is far from a reference point, more errors are accumulated to decrease an accuracy.","However, in the case of the method according to this embodiment, such as MIMO, which uses a plurality of transmission paths, the number of patterns such as transfer functions is increased. Therefore, there are more transmission patterns in a room in comparison with the situation using one transmission path. Each of the patterns is changed with a move of \u03bb\/2. In other words, if a pattern from which characteristics of a transmission path are extracted is known, it is possible to determine a position with a high accuracy of \u03bb\/2. For example, in the case of 1 GHz, it is possible to determine a position with an accuracy of 15 cm. The method has a problem that there would be a plurality of identical transmission patterns in the same room. In this embodiment, however, the mobile terminal  includes the position detection unit so that false patterns can be eliminated from pieces of low-accuracy position information. Thereby, the mobile terminal  can obtain high-accuracy position information.","Moreover, MIMO can change directions of beams emitted from a plurality of antennas. If a beam direction from the mobile terminal to the parent device is changed, it is possible to change a level of received signals such as a strength of a transmission path of a receiver, for example. Move of the mobile terminal  changes the state of the transmission path. Therefore, if the 3D coordinate position of the parent device is known, the position of the mobile terminal  can be calculated.","As described above, according to this embodiment, a mobile device (communication device), such as a mobile telephone or a Smartphone, can easily serve as an extended user interface, such as a multiple remote controller or a home appliance content download interface, of a target apparatus, by using a RF-ID unit of the mobile device and various sensors such as a GPS and a motion sensor.","[Embodiment 23]","The following describes Embodiment 23 of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2178","num":"2177"},"figref":["FIG. 258","FIG. 258"],"b":["401","401"],"i":["c","e"]},"The following describes a flow of processing by which a user, who holds the mobile device and is first near a building (user's home or the like) before entering the building, starts determining a position of the mobile device in the building by using a sensor in the mobile device.","With reference to , the processing of determining a position of the mobile device in the building is described. At the beginning, in Step , the mobile device determines whether or not a GPS sensor or a function of detecting radio waves in the building in the mobile device is running. If the GPS sensor or the function is running (Yes), then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile device determines whether or not coordinate information of a current position of the mobile device which are detected by the GPS sensor are close to the target building (user's home, for example) that has been registered, or whether or not the mobile device detects waves emitted from an apparatus in the target building which is to be connected via wireless LAN. Thereby, the mobile device detects whether or not the mobile device is close to the target building. If it is detected that the mobile device is close to the target building (home) (Yes in Step ), then the processing proceeds to Step . If the determination in Step is No, then the processing is repeated until the determination in Step becomes Yes. On the other hand, if the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the user at the entrance of the building (user's home) selects an \u201cindoor position determination mode\u201d on a user interface of the mobile device in order to start position determination in the building. Then, the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , if the angular velocity sensor, the geomagnetic sensor, and the acceleration sensor of the mobile device are not running, then the mobile device activates these sensors and the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , it is determined whether or not a map and reference point information can be obtained from a map management server on a Cloud system or from a SEG (server in the user's home). If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile device obtains the map and the reference point information.","If the mobile device has an enough storage, the mobile device holds the map and the reference point information. How to store and obtain the map and the reference point information is not limited. It is also possible that the map and the reference point information are stored in the SEG or the server on the Cloud system, and the mobile device inquires the SEG or the server on the Cloud system about the map and the reference point information based on detection results of the sensor in the mobile device, so that the mobile device performs, via a network, the same processing as that in the case where the mobile device holds the map and the reference point information.","It is further possible that the mobile device obtains a limited part of the map and a limited part of the reference point information, regarding only a location close to a position of the mobile device. Thus, these information may be partially incorporated in the mobile device and put to use.","If the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile device detects a predetermined characteristic change pattern (a move of a sliding door indicated by repetition of a previously-measured angle change, or a move on stairs indicated by a vertical acceleration change, for example). If such a pattern is detected in Step (Yes), then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , it is determined whether or not a \u201csimilar characteristic change pattern\u201d similar to the detected pattern is registered in the mobile device. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Circle  in . If the determination in Step is No, then the detection routine is repeated until the determination in Step becomes Yes.","Here, the characteristic change pattern in Step is, for example, a change G in a vertical direction of an acceleration in a Z-axis (vertical) direction which indicates that the user holding the mobile device ascends three steps of stairs within three seconds. The detection of the change indicates that the user holding the mobile device reaches a height of a floor of the entrance. Then, within five seconds, for example, the angular velocity sensor detects that a Yew direction is changed by 90 degrees, which indicates that the user faces the entrance.","In this case, it is recognized that opening of a door is a user's usual action. As a result, it is determined that the mobile device is currently close to a reference point near the entrance door. In the situation, if the user is almost still for five seconds, for example, it is determined that the user is unlocking a key of the entrance. If the server or the mobile device holds coordinate information of the position in front of the entrance, position information of the mobile device is updated to the coordinate information. Then, the absolute coordinate system indicated by latitude\/longitude of GPS information is switched to the relative coordinate system in the building. The switch to the relative coordinate system can eliminate conversion to coordinates to latitude\/longitude, and also reduce conversion errors.","Consider the situation where the entrance door has a RF-ID (NFC) lock. Regarding the RF-ID according to this embodiment, coordinate information and a coordinate accuracy evaluation point Vs are recorded on the lock or the server. When the mobile device touches the lock, a distance between the mobile device and an antenna unit of the lock is within 5 cm. Therefore, if a coordinate accuracy evaluation point Vm of coordinate information of a position of the mobile device is greater than the coordinate accuracy evaluation point Vs, coordinate information of the lock is replaced by the coordinate information of the mobile device. On the other hand, if the coordinate accuracy evaluation point Vm of the mobile device is smaller than the coordinate accuracy evaluation point Vs, the above replacement is not performed. According to this embodiment, coordinate information and a coordinate accuracy evaluation point of the coordinate information are recorded on a RF-ID unit of an apparatus such as an air conditioner or a TV or on a server corresponding to the apparatus, so that, every time the mobile device touches the apparatus, higher-accuracy coordinate information and a higher-accuracy evaluation point are updated. As a result, the accuracy of position coordinate information of each apparatus is increased for every touching.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2187","num":"2186"},"figref":["FIG. 260","FIG. 261"],"b":["403","403","403","403","403","403","403","2"],"i":["a","b","c","d","d ","e","f"]},"Here, in Step , the use of the angular velocity sensor, the geomagnetic sensor, and the acceleration sensor enables the mobile device to measure a move amount of the user to determine a 3D position of the user. It is also possible to use a sound sensor, an atmospheric pressure sensor, and the like to detect a location or a floor number where sound occurs. As a result, an accuracy of the position determination can be further increased.","According to this embodiment, it is possible to prevent the situation where the sensors in the mobile device are always ON whenever the mobile device is inside and outside a target building. As described in the example of this embodiment, the sensors for determining positions inside the building are turned ON only when the mobile device is detected as being close to the building. When the mobile device is not close to the building, the mobile device is at a sleep mode or turned OFF to save energy, if not needed for other use.","Furthermore, the angular velocity sensor is turned OFF or switched to a sleep mode, when the mobile device exists on a straight-line part on the map of the building, such as a path along which only rectilinear travel is possible. It is also possible to use the geomagnetic sensor to determine a direction. Then, the angular velocity sensor is turned ON at a curved part or a fork in the path. For example, the existing common three-axis angular velocity sensors consume energy of about 5 mA to 10 mA. Turning ON and OFF of the angular velocity sensor as necessary can reduce power consumption. Moreover, the existing common geomagnetic sensors consume energy of about 1 mA that is less than that of the common angular velocity sensors. Therefore, when high-accurate angular velocity detection and attitude detection by the angular velocity sensor are not necessary, it is possible to use only the geomagnetic sensor to detect the attitude of the mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2191","num":"2190"},"figref":["FIG. 261","FIG. 265","FIG. 265"],"b":["404","404","404","404","404","404","404","404","404","3","404","404","404","404","3"],"i":["a","a ","b","b","c","d","e","f","g","a ","h","h","i"],"sub":["1","1","1","2","2","2"]},"As described above, by recognizing a room where the mobile device is, it is possible to control a target apparatus (TV, for example) in the room, even if there are two TVs in different rooms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2193","num":"2192"},"figref":"FIG. 262"},"If a shape of a room is complicated and is not a simple cuboid, such a room is considered as a combination of a plurality of cuboids.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2195","num":"2194"},"figref":"FIG. 262"},"As shown in the drawing, when it is detected that the mobile device () having the angular velocity sensor at a sleep mode () enters an area (range) within 3 meters from the reference point, the angular velocity sensor is turned ON () to detect the reference point with a higher accuracy.

First,  is explained. In Step , it is determined whether or not the user holding the mobile device arrives at a position of a lift. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise (No in Step ), Step is repeated.","In Step , it is determined whether or not the user holding the mobile device enters the lift. If the user holding the mobile device enters the lift (Yes in Step ), then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise (No in Step ), Step is repeated.","If there are a plurality of lifts having different performance in the building, it is determined in Step , based on position information, which lift the user enters and on which floor (floor number) the lift currently exists. In Step , the mobile device obtains \u201ccharacteristic information\u201d of the target lift from the server. The characteristic information includes: (a) a time period required to ascend or descend from the n-th floor to the m-th floor; (b) information of Ts and load change characteristics; (c) an absolute or relative height of each floor; and (d) a position of a lift door on each floor. In Step , a vertical acceleration along the Z-axis is measured. In Step , if an acceleration in the same direction as the gravity direction is increased, or if atmospheric pressure is decreased, it is determined that the user starts ascending in the lift. Therefore, measurement of an elapsed time of the ascending starts. In Step , if an acceleration in the same direction as the gravity direction is decreased, or if increase of atmospheric pressure stops, it is determined that the ascending stops. Therefore, the measurement of the elapsed time is stopped to calculate the elapsed time TA. In Step , information of a \u201ctime period required from the n-th floor to the m-th floor\u201d is calculated based on (a) the floor from which ascending starts, (b) the elapsed time TA, and (c) the required time period information of the lift, and then information of a \u201cfloor (floor number) at which the mobile device arrives\u201d is determined based on the \u201ctime period required from the n-th floor to the m-th floor\u201d. In Step , it is determined whether or not the mobile device is moved outside the lift. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Circle  in .","On the other hand, if the determination in Step is No, then the processing returns to Step ","It should be noted that, in the case where the lift is descending, detected values of data such as an acceleration and atmospheric pressure are opposite to those in the case where the lift is ascending. Therefore, the floor at which the mobile device arrives is determined in the same manner as described with the above steps.","It should also be noted that, in the case where the lift is stopped for someone before arriving at the user's target floor, a move amount from start of ascending or descending to each stop is considered until the user holding the mobile device eventually goes out of the lift.","Next,  is explained. In Step , height information or floor number information of the above-described \u201cfloor (floor number) at which the mobile device arrives\u201d is recorded as Z information in the current 3D coordinate information of the mobile device. In Step , it is determined in Step whether or not the user holding the mobile device goes out by a few steps from a door of the lift. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise (No in Step ), Step is repeated. In Step , the mobile device obtains (a) position information of an entrance of the floor and (b) coordinate accuracy evaluation point Vs of the entrance, which are previously stored in the server or the memory in the mobile device. In addition, the mobile device obtains coordinate information of the current position of the mobile device measured by sensors and the like in the mobile device. Then, the processing proceeds to Circle  in . In this case, if the coordinate accuracy evaluation point Vs of the entrance is higher than the coordinate accuracy evaluation point Vm of the entrance which is stored in the mobile device, the coordinate information (coordinate value) of the entrance is written over the coordinate information stored in the mobile device to re-set information of the reference point (the entrance). As a result, the accuracy of the coordinate information stored in the mobile device is increased. After that, as a distance and a time period of move of the mobile device are increased, the coordinate accuracy evaluation point Vm stored in the mobile device is decreased if a next reference point is not set. The decrease is executed by a program corresponding to characteristics of a model of the mobile device. The program is downloaded by the mobile device.","In the case where the user holding the mobile device gets on an escalator, the mobile device detects both (a) an acceleration upwards along the Z-axis, which is averagely steady, and (b) an acceleration in a move direction, which is also averagely steady. The accelerations show a considerably characteristic pattern as long as the user holding the mobile device does not walk up an escalator. Therefore, based on detection of such a pattern, it is possible to determine that the user gets on an escalator and ascends or descends. Then, a step-number sensor detects that the user gets out of the escalator, and therefore information of the reference point can be re-set.","As described above, it is possible to obtain the floor number and height information of the floor at which the user holding the mobile device arrives by a lift.","[Embodiment 24]","In Embodiment 24, the description is given for processing performed when a mobile device touches a NFC tag of a home appliance with reference to . Here, the mobile device has a NFC reader\/writer, the home appliance has the NFC tag and a home appliance CPU, and a server manages information of the mobile device and information of the home appliance.","With reference to , in Step , the home appliance CPU included in the home appliance regularly records data regarding the home appliance onto a memory in the NFC tag. Therefore, when the mobile device (hereinafter, referred to also as a \u201cmobile terminal\u201d) accesses the tag of the home appliance, the home appliance can provide the mobile terminal with information stored in the home appliance which can be read not by the mobile terminal but only by the home appliance CPU.","In Step , the mobile terminal (mobile device) is activated.","In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not an application program for operating the home appliance has already been activated on the mobile terminal.

If it is determined that the user makes the mobile terminal touch the NFC tag (Yes in Step ), then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal issues a request for reading data from the tag. In Step , the home appliance reads the data from the memory in the tag.","In Step , the home appliance determines whether or not to access the home appliance CPU. If it is determined that it is necessary to access the home appliance CPU (Yes at S), then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the home appliance accesses to the home appliance CPU. In Step , the home appliance reads information by accessing the home appliance CPU. In Step , the home appliances transmits provides the information read from the home appliance CPU, to the memory in the tag of the home appliance, or stores the information in the home appliance. Then, the processing proceeds to Step S. Therefore, when the mobile terminal accesses the tag of the home appliance, the home appliance can provide the mobile terminal with the information stored in the home appliance which can be read not by the mobile terminal but only by the home appliance CPU.","If the determination in Step is No, then Step is repeated. On the other hand, if the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step S","If the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Step ","In Step , the home appliance transmits the required information to the mobile terminal. In Step , the mobile terminal receives the information including a tag ID, a signature, a key ID, an apparatus model, an error code, a use history (the number of uses), log data, a product serial number, an operating state (current state) of the home appliance, a URL, position information, an on-sale mode identifier, and the like.","In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not the mobile terminal is within the service range.

In Step , the mobile terminal displays the apparatus model and the error code or letters converted from the error code, and the processing proceeds to Step S. Therefore, even if the mobile terminal does not hold pieces of attribute information each indicating details and the like of the corresponding error code, the mobile terminal can present the user with the error information of the home appliance.","In Step , the mobile terminal displays information for explaining details of the error based on the error code, and the processing proceeds to Step S. Therefore, even if the mobile terminal is outside the service range, the mobile terminal holds relationship information indicating a relationship between each error code and error details, and thereby converts an error code provided from the touched home appliance to corresponding error details. As a result, the mobile terminal can present the user with error details based on the error code provided from the home appliance, so that the user can easily understand the error. When a relationship between an error code and error details is to be changed, it is possible that the mobile terminal receives also a manufacturer code from the tag of the home appliance, then manages a relationship table indicating a relationship between each error code and error details for each manufacturer, and changes the relationship. If common error codes for apparatuses are defined by each manufacturer, it is also possible that the mobile terminal receives also a manufacturer code from the tag of the home appliance, then manages a relationship table indicating a relationship between each error code and error details for each manufacturer, and changes the error details. As a result, it is possible to decrease the number of kinds of errors registered in the mobile terminal. Furthermore, it is possible that the mobile terminal manages a relationship table indicating a relationship among a manufacturer code of a manufacturer, an apparatus model of the manufacturer, an error code, and error details, and changes the error details.","In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not the mobile terminal holds a telephone number, an e-mail address, or a URL for inquiring an apparatus model of the home appliance. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step Sof Circle  in .","If the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Step Sof Circle  in .","With reference to , in Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not the on-sale mode identifier provided from the server or the tag of the home appliance is ON. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal displays a menu screen.","An on-sale mode represented by the on-sale mode identifier indicates that the home appliance is on sale in an electronics retail store. In general distribution of home appliances, products are manufactured by a manufacturer, then a part of them are stored in a warehouse, and a pat selected at random from the stored products are displayed in electronics retail stores. Consumers checks a usability or design of such a displayed product in the electronics retail store. However, there is a problem described below.","The processing from Step offers advantages to the manufacturer, because the processing from Step enables the user to easily perform user registration only by making the mobile terminal touch a target home appliance. Consumers, who touch a product in an electronics retail store, do not always decide to buy the product. If a malicious consumer does not intend to buy a home appliance displayed in a store but makes his\/her mobile terminal touch the home appliance, the touching results in registration of the consumer as a user of the home appliance. In recent years, user registration is vital information for a manufacturer to specify purchasers of products to be recalled. Therefore, many manufacturers offer financial or additional merits to purchasers who perform user registration. Therefore, such a situation would increase malicious consumers attempting to perform user registration for products which the consumers do not intend to buy. Technologies of preventing such malicious user registration have been highly demanded. In Steps and , based on the on-sale mode identifier held in the server or the tag of the home appliance, the mobile terminal determines whether or not the home appliance is on sale (at the on-sale mode). If the home appliance is at the on-sale mode, the mobile terminal prohibits user registration for the home appliance and displays a menu screen to notify the on-sale mode. As a result, it is possible to prevent malicious user registration. It is possible that the on-sale mode is changed or referred to by the server. In this case, the server does not need to directly touch the target home appliance. Therefore, the sever can change the on-sale mode for a large number of home appliances at once, or can control the home appliances in distance locations. It is also possible that the on-sale mode is changed or referred to by the home appliance or the tag of the home appliance. In this case, it is possible to change an on-sale mode for each of home appliances displayed in stores, for example.","Referring back to Step , if the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal searches a database for a target home appliance based on the tag ID and the apparatus model, and thereby determines whether or not the home appliance has already been registered (in other words, whether or not user registration has already been performed for the home appliance). If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not a user ID of the mobile terminal and the user ID registered in the server are identical or belong to the same family. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal displays a menu screen corresponding to a general apparatus model. Therefore, if the mobile terminal has already performed user registration for the home appliance, the mobile terminal does not need to display an unnecessary user registration screen again and again to a purchaser of the home appliance. Recently, almost everyone has one or more mobile terminals. Therefore, for example, if the user performs user registration for a purchased washing machine by using a mobile terminal of his\/her father, and makes a mobile terminal of his\/her mother touch a NFC tag of the washing machine, it is wrongly determined that a different user requests user registration. As a result, the mobile terminal of the user's mother displays a user registration change screen, even if the father and the mother live in the same home. In order to solve the above problem, as indicated in Step , the user ID of the mobile terminal of the user is associated with user IDs of the mobile terminals of the family members of the user. Therefore, in the above example, if it is determined that the mobile terminal of the user's mother and the mobile terminal of the user's father belong to the same family, it is determined that the user registration has already been performed for the washing machine correctly. As a result, the mobile terminals of the user's family do not need to display a user registration screen again and again.","If the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal displays the user registration screen. In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not there is position information of a current position of the mobile terminal which is detected by the GPS or the like. If the determination in Step is Yes, the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not the mobile terminal is positioned at a specific region such as a building in which a target apparatus (an apparatus model of a target home appliance) is on sale. The processing proceeds to Circle  in .","If the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Circle  in .","The following explains .","In Step , the mobile terminal displays, on its screen, the above-mentioned telephone number, e-mail address, or URL for inquiring the apparatus model. In Step , the mobile terminal is connected to the server and determines whether or not there is data to be exchanged with the server. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise (No in Step ), the processing proceeds to Step , and is completed.","In Step , the mobile terminal displays \u201cMove to the service range\u201d to persuade the user to move into the service range. In Step , the mobile terminal causes the data (information) read from the tag of the home appliance to be in a \u201csavable state\u201d where the data can be saved in a memory. In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not the mobile terminal is in the service range. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise (No in Step ), then the processing returns to Step ","In Step , the mobile terminal is connected to the server having the URL recorded on the tag of the home appliance or on the mobile terminal. In Step , user authentication is performed. In Step , the mobile terminal transmits, to the server, the data read from the tag or information generated based on the data, or the mobile terminal processes the data or the information by executing an application program provided from the server.","As a result, even if the mobile terminal touches the home appliance outside the service range, after the user moves into the service range, the mobile terminal can display a menu screen regarding user authentication, user registration\/change, or the target apparatus.","The following explains .","In Step , the mobile terminal (here, it is assumed that the mobile terminal does not belong to a target building) determines whether or not it is possible to determine a current position of the mobile terminal by using the GPS or the like. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not the determined position (position information) of the mobile terminal almost matches one of pieces of position information registered in the server. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step ","In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not the matching position information in the server is assigned with an identifier indicating that \u201cOther users (other user IDs) are accepted\u201d. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal is set to be at a guest mode. On the other hand, if the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Step and is terminated.","At the guest mode, the mobile terminal (for example, a mobile terminal of a visitor except family members of the user) can operate only a predetermined home appliance at one of the positions registered in the server. For example, it is assumed that a visitor except family members of the user visits the user's home. Here, it is also assumed that the user wishes to allow the visitor to use a mobile terminal of the visitor as a remote controller of a TV in the user's home, but does not want to let anyone except the family members see a laundry history of a user's washing machine. Under such assumption, the TV is assigned with the identifier indicating \u201cOther users (other user IDs) are accepted\u201d which is currently ON, while the washing machine is assigned with the same identifier which is currently OFF. Furthermore, the introduction of the guest mode allows any visitor to use a part of functions of his\/her mobile terminal. For example, the gust mode inhibits anyone except family members in a target home from seeing a laundry history of a washing machine in the home, but permits anyone to display an error code of the washing machine on his\/her mobile terminal.","If the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal displays, on its screen, a question such as \u201cHas the address been changed?\u201d or \u201cHas the owner been changed?\u201d If an answer of the question is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . In Step , the mobile terminal displays an address change menu or an user change menu.","As a result, this offers the following advantages. For example, it is assumed that the user moves with his\/her home appliances to a new home and therefore a user's address registered in user registration at purchase of the home appliances is changed. Under the assumption, if the user forgets to register a new address in the user registration, the mobile terminal of the user can automatically persuade the user to perform the user registration.","If the determination in Step is No, then the processing proceeds to Step to be continued.","The following describes a variation of this embodiment in the case where a home appliance is on sale in an electronics retail store, with reference to .","In Step , the mobile terminal determines whether or not the mobile terminal is in a target region. If the determination in Step is Yes, then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise (No in Step ), the processing proceeds to Step .

The target region is indicated by GPS information or the like. The determination in Step may be made based on a current position of the mobile terminal, or a beacon of the store. The determination in Step may also be made with reference to home appliance distribution route information and a present time.","This produces the following advantages. For example, if a home appliance is displayed in a retail store, it is possible to prevent a malicious user from performing malicious user registration for the displayed home appliance which the user has not yet purchased.","In Step , the mobile terminal (having a user ID) and the server performs user authentication.

Then, in communicable conditions, the image data is wirelessly transmitted to an access point using the second antenna  for a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and eventually recorded as the data  via, for example, the Internet to the predetermined server .","Here, the first processing unit  records the captured image state information  regarding the captured image data onto the second memory  in a RF-ID unit  in the image capturing device . The captured image state information  recorded by the first processing unit  or the like indicates at least one of (a) date and time of capturing each of the images, (b) the number of the captured images, (c) date and time of finally transmitting (uploading) an image, (d) the number of transmitted (uploaded) images, and (e) date and time of finally capturing an image. In addition, the captured image state information  includes (f) serial numbers of images that have already been uploaded or images that have not yet been uploaded; (g) a serial number of a finally captured image; and the like.","In addition, the first processing unit  generates a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the data  that is uploaded to the server . The first processing unit  records the server specific information  (URL) onto the second memory . The server specific information  is used to access the image data (the data  in ). The medium identification information  is also recorded on the second memory . The medium identification information  is used to determine whether the device embedded with the RF-ID (RF-ID unit ) is a camera, a card, or a post card.","When a main power (the first power supply unit  such as a battery) of the camera (the image capturing device ) is ON, the second memory  receives power from the main power. Even if the main power of the camera is OFF, the external RF-ID reader\/writer located outside supplies power to the RF-ID antenna  of the RF-ID unit . This enables the passive second power supply unit  without any power like a battery to adjust a voltage to provide power to respective units in a RF-ID circuit unit including the second memory . Thereby, it is possible to supply power to the second memory  so that the data in the second memory  is recorded\/reproduced and transmitted\/received by the image capturing device .","Here, the second power supply unit  is a circuit generating power from radio waves received by the second antenna . The second power supply unit  includes a rectifier circuit and the like. Whenever the main power is ON or OFF, the data in the second memory  is read and written by the second processing unit . When the main power is ON, the data in the second memory  can be read and written also by the first processing unit . In other words, the second memory  is implemented as a nonvolatile memory, and both the first processing unit  and the second processing unit  can read and write data from and to the second memory .","When the image capturing device  completes capturing images of a trip or the like and then the captured images are to be reproduced, the following processing is performed as illustrated on the right side of  as being the situation of reproducing images. The image capturing device  is moved into proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV , by the user of the image capturing device  or the like. Then, the RF-ID reader\/writer  supplies power to the RF-ID unit  via the antenna . Based on the supplied power, the second power supply unit  provides power to the units in the RF-ID unit , even if the main power (the first power supply unit ) of the image capturing device  is OFF.","The captured image state information  and the server specific information  are read by the second processing unit  from the second memory , and transmitted to the TV  via the antenna  by the second processing unit  or the like.","The TV  generates a URL based on the server specific information , then downloads the image data of the data  from the server  specified by the URL, and eventually displays, on the display unit , thumbnails or the like of images in the image data.","If it is determined based on the captured image state information  that there is any captured image not yet uploaded to the server , the determination result is displayed on the display unit .

The antennas are covered with an antenna cover  made of a material not shielding radio waves.","The RF-ID unit operates at a frequency of 13.5 MHz, while the wireless LAN operates at a frequency of 2.5 GHz. The significant difference in frequency prevents interference between them.","Therefore, the two antennas  and  are seen overlapping with each other from the outside, as illustrated in (c) in . The structure decreases an installation area of the antennas, eventually reducing a size of the image capturing device .","The structure also enables the single antenna cover  to cover both of the two antennas as illustrated in (c) in , so that the part made of the material not shielding radio waves is minimized. The material not shielding radio waves, such as plastic, has a strength lower than that of a metal. Therefore, the minimization of the material can reduce a decrease in a strength of a body of the image capturing device . The image capturing device  further includes a lens  and a power switch .

The image data is eventually recorded onto an Integrated Circuit (IC) card  that is removable from the image capturing device .","The above processing is instructed by the first processing unit  that is, for example, a Central Processing Unit (CPU). The image data, such as captured photographs or video, is provided to an encryption unit , a transmission unit  in a communication unit , and then the first antenna , in order to be transmitted to an access point or the like by radio via a wireless LAN, WiMAX, or the like. From the access point or the like, the image data is transmitted to the server  via the Internet . In the above manner, the image data such as photographs is uploaded.","There is a situation where a part of the image data fails to be uploaded because, for example, the communication state is not good or there is no nearby access point or base station. In the situation, some images have already been uploaded to the server , and the other images have not yet been uploaded.","Therefore, the image data in the server  is different from the image data captured by the image capturing device .","In Embodiment A1 of the present invention, the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV  or the like reads the server specific information  and the like from the second memory  in the RF-ID unit  of the image capturing device . Then, based on the readout information, a URL or the like of the server  is generated. According to the URL, the TV  accesses the server  to access the data  such as a file, folder, or the like uploaded by the image capturing device . Then, the TV  downloads the uploaded images from among the images captured by the image capturing device , and displays the downloaded images. The above method will be described in more detail later.","If a part or all of the captured images is not uploaded as image data of the data  in the server , a problem would occur that a user downloading the images to the TV  cannot watch a part of the images on the TV .","In order to solve the problem, in Embodiment A1 of the present invention, the first processing unit  causes a recording\/reproducing unit  to indicate information regarding a state of captured images, such as information of uploading state, to the captured image state information  in the second memory .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2413","num":"2412"},"figref":"FIG. 317","b":"52"},"The above is described in more detail with reference to .","In the second memory , synchronization information  () is recorded. The synchronization information  indicates whether or not image data in the server  matches image data captured by the camera, in other words, whether or not the image data in the server  is in synchronization with the image data captured by the camera.","In Embodiment A1 of the present invention, the TV  reads the captured image state information  from the second memory  via the second antenna .","The captured image state information  makes it possible to instantly determine whether or not the data  in the server lacks any image.","If the determination is made that there is any image that has not yet been uploaded, then the determination result is displayed on the display unit of the TV . Here, the TV  also displays a message of \u201cPlease upload images\u201d to a viewer. Or, the TV  issues an instruction to the camera via the RF-ID antenna  to transmit an activation signal to the activation unit , thereby supplying power to the first power supply unit  of the image capturing device . Thereby, the TV  causes the image capturing device  to upload, to the server , the images in the first memory  or the like of the image capturing device , which have not yet been uploaded, via a wireless LAN, a wired LAN, the RF-ID antenna , or the like.","Since transmission via the RF-ID antenna  has a small transfer amount, transmission of the image data as originally captured takes a considerable time to upload and display the image data. This causes a user to feel unpleasant.","In order to avoid this, according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention, when the image data is transmitted via the RF-ID antenna , thumbnails of the images not yet uploaded are transmitted instead.","The thumbnails can shorten apparent upload time and display time, suppressing unpleasant feeling of the user.","Most of current RF-ID of a HF band has a transfer amount of several hundreds kbps. However, development of RF-ID having a quad-speed has been examined. The quad-speed RF-ID has a possibility of achieving a transfer amount of several Mbps. If thumbnails of images not yet uploaded are transmitted, it is possible to transmit several dozens of thumbnails in one second. If thumbnails are displayed in a list, thumbnails of all images including images not yet uploaded can be displayed on the TV within a time period a general user can tolerate. The above is one of practical solutions.","If the image capturing device is forced to be activated to upload images not yet uploaded as described above, the most speedy and stable path is selected from a wireless LAN, the RF-ID antenna , and a wired LAN, to be used for uploading and displaying on the TV.","In the situation where the image capturing device  receives power from the outside via the second antenna , the communication unit  transmitting signals to the second antenna performs communication with the outside by a low-speed modulation method. On the other hand, in the situation where the image capturing device  can receive power from the first power supply unit  or the like, the communication unit  switches the modulation method to a modulation method having a large signal point, such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAN), or 64-QAN, as needed, in order to achieve high-speed transfer to upload the image data not yet uploaded in a short time.","Furthermore, when the power detection unit  detects, for example, that the first power supply unit  or the like does not have enough power or that the image capturing device  is not connected to an external power, the first power supply unit  stops supplying power and the modulation switch unit  switches the modulation method employed by the communication unit  to a modulation method having a smaller signal point or less transfer rate. As a result, it is possible to prevent that the capacity of the first power supply unit  is reduced to be equal to or less than a set value.","There is another solution for power. When power is not enough, the second processing unit , the communication unit , or the like sends a power increase request signal to the RF-ID reader\/writer  of the TV  via the second antenna , to request for power support. In response to the request, the RF-ID reader\/writer  increases providing power to have a value greater than the set value for the power used in reading data from the RF-ID unit. Since the RF-ID unit receives more power via the antenna , the RF-ID unit can provide power to the communication unit  or the first processing unit . Thereby, a power amount of a battery  for the first power supply unit  is not reduced. Or, without the battery , the image capturing device  can practically and unlimitedly continue transmission.","As still another method, uploaded-image-data information  in  can be used. In uploaded-image-data information , uploaded-image information  such as serial numbers of photographs, is recorded. It is also possible to use hashed information  generated by hashing the information . As a result, a data amount is reduced.","The TV  can read the above information to be compared to information of images captured by the camera, thereby obtaining information of images not yet uploaded.","As still another method, not-yet-uploaded image data existence identification information  can be used. The not-yet-uploaded image data existence identification information  includes an existence identifier  indicating whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. Since existence of images not yet uploaded is notified, data in the second memory  can be significantly reduced.","It is also possible to use not-yet-uploaded-image number  indicating the number of images not yet uploaded. Since the image capturing device  allows the TV  to read the information, a viewer can be informed of the number of images to be uploaded. In this case, a data capacity in addition to the number is recorded as the captured image state information . Thereby, the image capturing device  enables the TV  to display a more exact prediction time required to upload images not yet uploaded.","It is also possible to use not-yet-uploaded image information hashed information  that is generated by hashing information regarding images not yet uploaded.","In addition, it is also possible to record a final capturing time (final capturing date\/time)  in the second memory . Later, the TV  reads the final capturing time . The TV  is connected to the server  to compare the final capturing time  to a capturing date of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server . Thereby, it is possible to easily determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded.","If images are captured and assigned with serial numbers sequentially from an older image, it is possible to record only a final image serial number . The final image serial number  is compared to a serial number of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server . Thereby, it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded.","It is also possible to record, onto the second memory , captured image information  (e.g. serial numbers of all captured images). Thereby, the TV  later accesses the server  to match the serial numbers to images uploaded to the server . As a result, it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. When the captured image information  is used, use of hashed information  generated by hashing the captured image information  can compress the captured image information .","The second memory  further stores Unique IDentification (UID)  of the RF-ID unit, camera ID , and the medium identification information . Even if the main power of the camera (except a sub-power for backup etc. of a clock) is OFF, these pieces of information can be read by the TV  via the second antenna  to be used for identifying the camera or the user or authenticating a device (apparatus). When the user comes back from an overseas trip or the like, the camera is likely to have a small charge amount of the battery. However, according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention, the camera can be operated to transmit information without battery, which is highly convenient for the user. The medium identification information  includes an identifier or the like indicating whether the medium or device embedded with the RF-ID unit is a camera, a camcorder, a post card, a card, or a mobile phone. The identifier enables the TV  to identify the medium or device. Thereby, the TV  can display a mark or icon of the camera or postcard on a screen as illustrated in , as will be described.

The above pieces of information are used to generate a URL by a URL generation unit  that is provided in the image capturing device , the RF-ID unit , the camera function used for capturing images in the image capturing device , or the TV . The URL is used for accessing a group of images corresponding to the image capturing device  or the user in the server .

In the situation, the forced print instruction  is used to automatically print image data stored in the image server by a printer (not shown) connected to the TV . If this option is selected, the program generation unit  generates a program for forcing the TV  to print image data by the printer.","The format identification information  is information of a format by which image data is to be displayed. When an option of language code optimization selection in the format identification information  is selected, the program generation unit  generates a program for selecting a URL to be connected, based on the language code set in the TV . The following is an example in the situation where the option of language code optimization selection in the format identification information  is selected. If the language code of the TV  indicates Japanese language, the program generation unit  selects a Japanese site as the URL to be connected. On the other hand, if the language code of the TV  does not indicate Japanese language, the program generation unit  selects an English site as the URL to be connected. Or, the URL generation unit  may generate two URLs for the Japanese site and the English site, and provide the two URLs to the program generation unit .","The program part storage unit  holds program command information used by the program generation unit  to generate a program. A program part stored in the program part storage unit  may be a general library or an Application Programming Interface (API). In order to generate a connection command for connecting the TV  to the server, the program generation unit  combines a server connection command \u201cConnect\u201d in the program part storage unit  with the URL generated by the URL generation unit . Thereby, the program generation unit  generates or updates a connection program for connecting the TV  to the server indicated by the URL.","The program writing unit  is an interface used to write the program generated by the program generation unit  to the second memory .","The program provided from the program writing unit  is stored into a program storage unit  in the second memory  via the recording\/reproducing unit .","When the image capturing device  is moved to bring the RF-ID unit of the image capturing device  into proximity of the RF-ID reader\/writer  connected to the TV , the reproducing unit reads out the program from the program storage unit  in the second memory .

The TV  receives the transmission signals via the RF-ID reader\/writer . The TV  executes the received program.","The TV  has the product serial number , the language code , and a program execution virtual machine .","The product serial number  is a product serial number of the TV . From the product serial number , it is possible to learn a manufacture date\/time, a manufacture location, a manufacturing line, and a manufacturer of the TV .","The language code  is predetermined in the TV  to be used in displaying a menu, for example. The language code  is not limited to be predetermined, but can be switched to another by the user.","The program execution virtual machine  is a virtual machine that executes a received program. The program execution virtual machine  may be implemented as hardware or software. For example, the program execution virtual machine  may be a Java\u2122 virtual machine. The Java\u2122 virtual machine is a stack or interpreter virtual machine that executes defined instruction sets. If the image capturing device  has the virtual machine, the program generated by the program generation unit  in the image capturing device  is compliant to any execution platforms.

In order to generate the connection command, the program generation unit  selects an instruction set (for example, \u201cConnect\u201d in the drawing) for a server connection command from the program part storage unit , and combines the selected instruction set with the URL. Thereby, a server connection program (for example, \u201cConnect (URL)\u201d) is generated.","Then, the program generation unit  examines the forced display instruction  in the second memory  so as to determine whether or not the forced display instruction  is selected (S). If the forced display instruction  is selected, then the program generation unit  calls an instruction set for a forced display program from the program part storage unit , and thereby generates a forced display command (S). The generated forced display command is added to the program (S).","On the other hand, if the forced display instruction  is not selected, then the program generation unit  does not generate the forced display command, but proceeds to S.","Next, the program generation unit  makes a determination as to whether the forced print instruction in the second memory  is selected (S). If the forced print instruction is selected, then the program generation unit  generates a forced print command for forcing the TV  to print, by a printer, an image file stored in the server  (S).

However, the commands (programs) are not limited to the above. For example, if a command for the forced display instruction is to be generated as a program, the program generation unit  can also generate a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus (device) executing the program has a display device or display function, and add the generated determination command to the program. Thereby, the command for the forced display instruction is executed only if the apparatus executing the program has a display device or display function. As a result, the determination command can prevent confusion in the apparatus executing the program. The same goes for a command for the forced print instruction. The program generation unit  may also generate a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus executing the program has or is connected to a printing function, and add the generated determination command to the program. Thereby, the command for the forced print instruction is executed only if the apparatus executing the program has or is connected to a printing function.","The following describes execution of the program generated or updated by the program generation unit  in the image capturing device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2582","num":"2581"},"figref":"FIG. 349","b":"7005"},"The program is transmitted from the image capturing device  to a device (apparatus) different from the image capturing device  via the second antenna  of the image capturing device .

On the other hand, if the determination is made that the language code does not indicate Japanese language, then a connection command for an English site is selected from the connection commands in the program (S). It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A1 that a determination is made as to whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language, and thereby a connection command is selected from the connection command for connecting to a Japanese site and the connection command for connecting to an English site. However, it is also possible that the program includes a plurality of connection programs compliant to various language codes. Thereby, the program can be compliant to two or more language codes.

If the connection is failed, then the display unit of the TV  displays warning indicating the connection failure (S). On the other hand, if the connection is successful, then a command for displaying a slide show of an image file stored in the server is executed to display the slide show (S).","It should be noted that the above is the situation where the operation program is for displaying images as a slide show. However, the operation program is not limited to the above. The program may be used for performing list display, forced display, or forced printing. If the operation program is for forced display, a step (command) of automatically changing setting of the TV  to setting of displaying an image file stored in the server is added to the program. Thereby, the user does not need to change the setting of the TV  by manual in order to display images provided from the image server. In the case of the forced printing, a command for automatically changing setting of the TV  to a printable mode is added to the program. Moreover, in the case of each of the forced printing and forced display, a determination command for determining whether or not the TV  has a printing function or a displaying function is added to the program. Thereby, the forced print command is not executed in an apparatus (device) without a printing function. Furthermore, the operation program in Embodiment A1 of the present invention may be a connection program for leading other programs. For example, the operation program may be a loader program, such as a boot-loader for loading other programs to be executed.","As described above, Embodiment A1 of the present invention is characterized in that the program generation unit  is included in the first processing unit  of the image capturing device  that is a device having RF-ID communication means (such as the data transfer unit  and the second antenna ). It is also characterized in that the program generated or updated by the program generation unit  is executed by a different device (apparatus) except the image capturing device  according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention that is a communication device having RF-ID.","Conventionally, a device having RF-ID needs to transfer ID information (tag information), which the device has, from a RF-ID communication unit to another device (for example, the TV  according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention). The device (apparatus) receiving the ID information should previously hold operation programs each unique to a corresponding device having RF-ID. Therefore, if new products having RF-ID technology appear, the receiving device needs to install an operation program corresponding to the new products and execute the program. Otherwise, the receiving device is excluded as not being compliant to the new products. The installation of operation programs requires technical knowledge. Not everyone can perform the installation. Therefore, if various new devices having RF-ID are produced, other devices such as the TV  of Embodiment A1 of the present invention become obsolete. As a result, property values of user's devices are damaged.","According to the disclosure of Embodiment A1 of the present invention, the device having RF-ID technology has the program generation unit  and sends not ID information (tag information) but a program to another device (apparatus) such as the TV . The apparatus such as the TV  receives and executes the program. Therefore, the receiving apparatus does not need to previously have operation programs for various devices having RF-ID. Even if a new device having RF-ID technology appears, the receiving apparatus does not need to install a new program for the device. Therefore, usability is significantly improved.","Therefore, the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have application programs for respective items, kinds, or application systems of various objects having RF-ID. Thereby, the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have a storage device, either, for holding various application programs. In addition, maintenance such as version-up of the programs in the terminal is not necessary.","The program generated by the program generation unit  is useful if it is executable in any execution platforms such as a Java\u2122 language. Therefore, if the device (apparatus) such as the TV  executing programs has a Java\u2122 virtual machine, programs generated by any devices (apparatuses) can be executed.","It should be noted that the program generation unit  according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention may have a function of updating the program previously stored in the program storage unit  of the second memory . The situation of updating a program produces the same advantages as that in the situation of generating a program. The generating or updating performed by the program generation unit  may be generating or updating data used in executing a program by the TV . In general, the program includes additional initialization setting data. The additional data is used to switch an execution mode or to set a flag. Therefore, generating or updating of the additional data is equivalent to generating or updating of the program, without deviating from the inventive concepts of the present invention. This is because, for execution of a program, it is merely a matter of design whether a parameter for mode switching or the like is to be held and read as data, or is to be included in the program to be executed. Therefore, when the program generation unit  according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention generates or updates a program, the program generation unit  can also generate data such a parameter sequence used by the program.

The use status detection unit  includes sensors each detecting a trouble in operation of a corresponding unit included in the image capturing device . Results of the detection of the sensors in respective units are provided to the use status detection unit . The sensors for the respective units provide the use status detection unit  with trouble information, battery duration, a power consumption amount, and the like. For example, the image capturing unit  provides the use status detection unit  with information indicating whether or not an image capturing operation of the image capturing unit  has any trouble (whether or not the image capturing unit  functions correctly, and whether or not the image capturing unit  responds to a call from the use status detection unit ). The video processing unit  provides the use status detection unit  with information indicating whether or not data processing for image data captured by the image capturing unit  has any trouble (whether or not the video processing unit  functions correctly, and whether or not the video processing unit  responds to a call from the use status detection unit ). The power supply unit  provides the use status detection unit  with a voltage level of the battery and a total power consumption amount. The communication unit  provides the use status detection unit  with information indicating whether or not the communication unit  is successfully connected to the server or the Internet (whether or not the communication unit  functions correctly, and whether or not the communication unit  responds to a call from the use status detection unit ). The display unit provides the use status detection unit  with information indicating whether or not display processing has any trouble, whether or not the display unit correctly responds to a call from the use status detection unit , and the display unit functions correctly. Based on the above pieces of status information provided regarding the respective units, the internal trouble detection unit  in the use status detection unit  determines whether or not each of the units has any trouble in its functional operation. If there is a trouble, then the use status detection unit  provides the program generation unit  with information for specifying the trouble. The use status detection unit  has a power consumption detection unit . The power consumption detection unit  generates power consumption information based on the total power consumption information provided form the power supply unit, and then provides the power consumption information to the program generation unit .","The program generation unit  generates a program for displaying, on the TV , the information for specifying a trouble or the power consumption information which is provided from the use state detection unit .

The pieces of image ID  are chronologically assigned to captured images by the image capturing device  in capturing the images.","The list display flag  corresponds to the list display (flag)  stored in the second memory  of the image capturing device . The TV  uses the list display flag  to determine whether or not image data downloaded from the server  is to be displayed in a list format. If the list display flag  indicates \u201cyes\u201d, the data processing unit  of the TV  generates a list of the downloaded images, stores the list to the memory unit , and then displays the list on the display unit .","The slide show flag  corresponds to the slide show (flag)  stored in the second memory  of the image capturing device . The TV  uses the slide show flag  to determine whether or not image data downloaded from the server  is to be displayed as a slide show. If the slide show flag  indicates \u201cautomatic\u201d, the data processing unit  of the TV  generates a slide show of the downloaded images, stores the slide show to the memory unit , and then displays the slide show on the display unit .

Then, the TV  connects to the server to which the image capturing device  has uploaded the captured images, then downloads the captured images from the server, and displays the captured images. Here, it is determined whether or not the captured images in the server  are in synchronization with the captured images in the image capturing device . If the synchronization is failure, the TV  displays notification of the synchronization failure on the display unit . Thereby, the user can display the captured images only by presenting the image capturing device  to the TV , although the user conventionally has to remove a recording memory from the camera (the image capturing device ) to be equipped to the TV  in order to view the images.

Here, as illustrated in an example of a screen display of the electronic catalog data in , a screen presents the customer user with a few of options for a next operation to be executed by the customer user for the displayed electronic catalog data. Then, a focus circulates among the options on the screen (as illustrated as options  and  in ) to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. This allows the customer user to execute an operation for selecting or purchasing each product in the electronic catalog data, for example, only by presenting the electronic catalog notification card  having the RF-ID unit  to the TV , when the focus indicates a desired option of the customer user.","The second memory  according to Embodiment A3, which is embedded in the RF-ID unit  on the electronic catalog notification card , may be a Read Only Memory (ROM). In this aspect, the electronic catalog server information input device  serves as a RF-ID memory data input unit in manufacturing the RF-ID unit, or a RF-ID memory data input means in a RF-ID manufacturing system. In general, a RF-ID unit having a ROM unit is inexpensive more than a RF-ID unit having a rewritable memory. Therefore, the RF-ID unit having a ROM allows the provider user sending a great number of electronic catalog notification cards to reduce a cost.","It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A3 that a focus circulates among the options on the screen of the TV  (as illustrated as options  and  in ) to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. However, the method of operating the electronic catalog data displayed on the screen by using the electronic catalog notification card  having the RF-ID unit  is not limited to the above. For example, it is also possible that the receiving unit  of the TV  sequentially receive pieces of information from the RF-ID unit and counts the sequential receiving processes, then thereby calculates a time period (RF-ID proximity time period) during which the RF-ID unit is in proximity of the TV , and eventually moves a focus indicating a selection candidate displayed on the screen based on the RF-ID proximity time period. With the above structure, the following operation for the electronic catalog is possible. Only when the RF-ID unit is in proximity of the TV, the focus displayed on the screen is circulated to change the selection candidate. If the RF-ID unit is away from the TV, the focus is stopped. After a predetermined time period after stopping of the focus, the selection candidate on which the focus is stopped is decided as selection. In this operation for the electronic catalog, the customer user can actively operate the electronic catalog by using the RF-ID unit, without waiting for the focus, which automatically circulates among options every predetermined time period, to arrive at a user's desired option.","It should also be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A3 that the electronic catalog server information input device  has the key input receiving unit  which receives inputs by the input keys operated by the provider user in order to obtain the electronic catalog server information. However, the following configuration is also possible. That is, the electronic catalog server information input device  has a communication interface to communicate with the image server. The image server holds the server information to be transmitted to the electronic catalog server information input device . The electronic catalog server information input device  receives the server information from the image server, in order to obtain the server information. This configuration in which the server information is stored in the image server allows the electronic catalog server information input device  to eliminate inputting to the image server. Especially, when a plurality of the electronic catalog server information input devices  are operated for a single image server, this configuration is highly convenient.","The conventional techniques have a program that users who are not familiar with operations of digital devices such as personal computers should learn operations of the devices to do online shopping. However, the system according to Embodiment A3 enables users using electronic catalogs to do online shopping and the like, simply by bringing received cards or post cards into proximity of TVs.

A decryption unit  decrypts encrypted information in the image server information and the registration image ID. Next, the URL generation unit  generates a URL from which only images identified by the registration image ID from among images stored in the image server  are downloaded to the TV . More specifically, the URL generation unit  may designate an internal directory of the server in the generated URL or may use a method of embedding the registration image ID to the URL as a URL option.
