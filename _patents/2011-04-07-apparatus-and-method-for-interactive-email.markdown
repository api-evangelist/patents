More particularly, this invention relates to interactive email.","Email communications is ubiquitous. The volume of email that an individual receives tends to desensitize one to the information received. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide interactive email techniques that encourage enhanced interactivity, targeting and engagement.","A non-transitory computer readable storage medium includes executable instructions to deliver to a community of users an email with a widget including a graphical user interface that solicits input. Solicited input is collected from the community of users via the widget. The email is revised to dynamically display at least a portion of the solicited input.","Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","1","102","104","1","104","106","102","110","112","114","112","116","120","114","120","122","120","122","122","102"]},"The system  also includes a server with standard components, such as a central processing unit , input\/output devices  and a network interface card  connected via a bus . A memory  is also connected to the bus . The memory  includes executable instructions to implement operations of the invention. In one embodiment, the memory  stores widget resources . A widget is an element of a graphical user interface that displays an information arrangement that is changeable by the user, such as a window, a text box, a radio button and the like. Widgets are basic visual building blocks which, combined in an application, hold the data processed by the application and the available interactions on this data.","The present application references Engagement Widgets\u2122 (EW). A communication generator  includes executable instructions to incorporate the EWs into original email messages sent to a community of recipients. As discussed below, the EWs are used to query for information from the email recipients and to present summaries of the responses of other recipients.","To facilitate follow-up activity, subsequent emails may be targeted to sub-sets of the original recipients who responded to a given EW's question(s) in a given way, using email address qualifiers designed for this purpose. Submitting responses for an EW may also cause an additional web server request to occur within a given community site or to some other web server on the internet, thus registering this response with that site and\/or retrieving additional information from that site for presentation to the recipient. These operations may be implemented with the communication generator .","A rendering engine  includes executable instructions to provide embedded images, created in real-time with live data, when the email is rendered in the recipient's inbox. The rendering engine  may also provide a link to view an individualized version of the email reflecting the latest data. This provides the user with the most up-to-date, and most individually-relevant information possible, thus encouraging enhanced interactivity and engagement.","The memory  also stores a response database . As discussed below, the response database logs user responses to queries in emails. The database can be utilized by the communication generator  and the rendering engine  to provide real-time data feedback to an email user. The modules in memory  are exemplary. The operations of the invention may be implemented in a single module or various modules. The modules need not be on a single computer, rather, they can be distributed throughout a networked environment.","Server  typically operates in conjunction with an Online Community Site that maintains a list of email addresses for communicating to and among one or more groups of the members of a given community. Examples include social web sites which support interest groups, online blogs with subscriber lists, and sites for maintaining contact lists. Entities that maintain one or more group lists of recipients are referenced herein as \u201cOnline Community Sites.\u201d","Depending on the type of Online Community Site, and on how it's configured, management of these recipient lists may either be active, where one or more community leaders actively create the community group(s) and subgroup(s) and manage their membership, or passive, where members are free to join and associate themselves with one or more groups and create new groups and subgroups, or some combination. The definition of groups and subgroups therefore includes the lists of people with names and unique identifiers which may have been created actively, with individuals actively signing-up or registering for the list, or passively, with lists created and managed by an organization. The definition of membership also includes active and passive joining by individual people, where they are all defined as members once being collected into a community.","Basic information provided by the Community Online Site may include:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","102","104","172"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":"a.

Consider the following.\n\n","Other supplemental actions may include the following.\n\n","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the potential range of applications for EWs is very broad, but includes virtually any application where a response or action is requested of an email recipient. A partial list of potential types of requests includes:\n\n","A partial list of applications which could employ the above types of requests includes:\n\n","When a recipient of an EW-enhanced email (or visitor of an EW-enhanced page on the community web site) submits an EW response, the response is typically recorded in the response database , as described above, but may also generate an EW-specific action. This action may either be an internal action, within this community site, or an external action, causing an HTTP request with customized query arguments to some external web site or internet server. A simple example of an action-enabled EW is presented in , allowing a recipient to join a new subgroup in the Online Community Site by clicking on \u201cJoin.\u201d Another simple example could cause a particular community event to be added to the user's electronic calendar, for instance.","The following Application Programming Interface (API) example reference design is intended to allow the easy creation of new action-enabled EWs by the Editors and Publishers for use in their interactive emails and EW-enhanced online pages.","With the EW submission, a unique \u201cAction ID\u201d and customized set of \u201cAction Variables\u201d are sent to the server . Action variables may include:\n\n","The Action ID indicates which button or other link was clicked to cause the submission of the response. For instance, an EW for placing an order could provide two buttons: one to register the order with the intention to be billed later and the other to register the order and be transferred directly to PayPal\u00ae to pay for the order now (enabled by an underlying EW action mapped to that button's action ID).","The EW-Action Mapping configuration specifies how the list of possible actions for a given EW, each identified by their Action ID, and accompanied by their Action Variables, is translated and used to invoke a specific internal or external action. Actions may either be \u201cinternal,\u201d for the associated Online Community Site, or \u201cexternal,\u201d for any web site or server accessible over the Internet (including the associated Online Community Site). The configuration of internal actions are specific to that given site. Configuration of external actions for the action associated with a given EW Action Identifier may include the following settings:\n\n","A key feature of interactive emails, enabled by Engagement Widgets\u2122 is the ability to send emails to well-targeted subsets of the members in a community. This is enabled by the specification and handling of Email Address Qualifiers, which can also control other aspects of the email message handling. The creation of Email Address Qualifiers can be done manually by the user when sending email via any 3party email service tool or provider, or with the assistance of the community website where the qualifiers can be visually selected from a form, and the formal email address computed by the site. Examples of the types of targeted recipients and other email controls enabled by these qualifiers include:\n\n","The email address qualifiers are pre-pended to the group email address to further qualify which recipients should receive the associated email, or control other aspects of the handling of the email message. Example strings that could be prepended to the group email address may include:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0142"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","610","620"]},"The following provides an example language for specifying the qualifiers as part of an email address.\n\n","Email address \u201cticketed\u201d techniques are used to ensure that the identity of the user submitting responses or viewing pages online is authentic. These techniques are also used to ensure that a user has been granted access to the associated page and\/or engagement widgets. \u201cTicketed\u201d identification attributes are added to the web addresses for the submission buttons and other links in the email. An example implementation adds the following data as query arguments to such links in the email:\n\n","An example link in the email could be:\n\n","In this example, userId is a numeric user identifier, pageId is the numeric identifier for the web page, dateSeed is a combination of the date along with an appended seed (%3A is the code for a colon, so this date is 31Mar11-08:07:18 appended by seed 6973), pageTicket is the integrity check value.","After the user clicks on a ticketed link, the server will first ensure the validity of the user and page being accessed before registering any data being submitted and\/or returning the page content to the user's browser.
