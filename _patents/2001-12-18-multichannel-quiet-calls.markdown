Swinehart, and Tomas Sokoler, and originally entitled, \u201cA TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATING CONVERSATION UTTERANCES TO A REMOTE LISTENER IN RESPONSE TO A QUIET SELECTION,\u201d issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,286,649 on Oct. 23, 2007, entitled, \u201cTELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATING CONVERSATION UTTERANCES TO A REMOTE LISTENER IN RESPONSE TO A QUIET SELECTION.\u201d","Telecommunication infrastructures provide the ability to converse with a party and be notified of other incoming calls, (i.e. \u201ccall waiting\u201d). In addition to being notified of incoming calls, individuals can place an existing call on hold and transfer to another call, or set up conference calls and simultaneously converse and hear multiple parties at the same time.","The ability to be notified of incoming calls (i.e. call waiting) has some negative aspects. For example, when a party is conversing on one call (\u201ccall 1\u201d) and they are notified of a second incoming call (\u201ccall 2\u201d) they must either place the exiting conversation on hold and switch to the other call or ignore the incoming call altogether. Typical responses to the incoming call are \u201cI'm on the other line, can you wait a minute?\u201d or \u201cI'm on the other line, I'll call you back.\u201d Once they have informed the incoming call or of their situation they then return to the original call.","Conference calls also have some negative aspects. For example, during a conference call including caller A, Caller B, and Caller C, each caller can hear the conversation of each of the other callers. Currently, there is no way for Caller A to speak privately with Caller B so that Caller C cannot hear the conversation unless he contacts him using another telephone connection.","Therefore, there is a desire to provide a system and method for transmitting information to other callers without interrupting an existing conversation. Additionally, there is a desire to provide a system and method for mixing audio from multiple telephone connections for a party to hear simultaneously while being able to converse with only selected individuals.","Embodiments of the present invention allow people to converse with at least one party while concurrently relaying information to other parties on other channels.","The invention, roughly described, comprises a method for communicating over multiple channels. The method may include the steps of communicating over a first channel, selecting a second channel, selecting a phrase and obtaining an internal representation of a phrase element associated with the selected phrase. Once a phrase has been selected, an audible utterance is generated based on the internal phrase element that is provided over the selected second channel.","In one aspect, the invention comprises a multi-channel telecommunication system. The multi-channel telecommunication system includes an audio input, a channel representation, and a phrase representation. The channel and phrase representation are stored on memory. A phrase element associated with the phrase representation wherein the phrase element has an internal representation of an audible utterance may also be stored in the memory. A processor coupled to the audio input, display and memory, provides a first control signal and a second control signal, and an audio generator generates an audible utterance responsive to the first control signal and the conversation element. A channel selector coupled to the processor and audio generator, selects a channel responsive to the second control signal and provides the audible utterance over the selected channel.","In a further aspect, the system may comprise a plurality of input channels a processing device for storing an internal representation of a phrase element and a scanning device, coupled with the processing device, for reading a first code associated with the phrase element and for reading a second code associated with at least one of said input channels. The processing device provides an audible utterance over the channel associated with said second code in response to reading the first code and the second code.","In yet another aspect, the invention comprises a general purpose computing device, such as personal digital assistant, a laptop, personal computer, etc. The general purpose computing device may include a display, displaying a channel representation and a phrase representation, and a memory for storing the channel representation, phrase representation and a phrase element associated with the phrase representation. The phrase element has an internal representation of an audible utterance. A processor, coupled to the display and memory, generates a first control signal responsive to selection of the channel representation and a second control signal response to selection of the phrase representation. An audio generator, coupled to the processor and memory, generates an audible utterance responsive to the second control signal and the phrase element and a channel selector, coupled to the processor and audio generator, activates a channel responsive to the first control signal and provides the audible utterance over the selected channel.","A further aspect of the invention comprises a telecommunication infrastructure. The infrastructure may include a first electronic device, coupled to the telecommunication infrastructure over a first channel, a second electronic device, coupled to the telecommunication infrastructure over a second channel, and a third electronic device, coupled to the telecommunication infrastructure. The third electronic device is used for selecting the first channel or the second channel and selecting a phrase representation. A processing device, coupled to the telecommunication infrastructure, stores a phrase element associated with the phrase representation, and a software program for providing an audible utterance over the selected first or second channel in response to a selected phrase representation.","In a further aspect, the invention comprises a method for communicating with a plurality of recipients over a plurality of channels. The method may comprise the steps of communicating over a first channel with a first recipient, receiving an indication over a second channel of a second recipient, selecting a channel for generating an audible utterance selecting a phrase representation, and generating an audible utterance over the selected channel based on the selected phrase representation.","I. Overview","The method and system described herein (generally known as \u201cMulti-Channel Quiet Calls\u201d or \u201cMulti-Channel Quiet Call technology\u201d) provides the ability for a participant to deal concurrently with multiple communication channels (e.g., two or more telephone calls). All participants are allowed to continue using audible technology (e.g., a telephone) over normal telecommunication infrastructures. Embodiments of the present invention transform a user's silent input selections into equivalent audible signals that may be directly transmitted to a recipient on a specific communication channel.","An embodiment of a Multi-Channel Quiet Call system is illustrated in . The Multi-Channel Quiet Call system may include a first individual , a second individual , and a third individual . Individual  attempts to communicate with individual  over telecommunication infrastructure . Specifically, individual  uses a telephone  to dial a telephone  of individual .","While individual  is communicating with individual , individual  attempts to communicate with individual  over telecommunication infrastructure . Specifically, individual  uses a telephone  to dial the telephone  of individual . Multi-Channel Quiet Call technology  allows individual  to relay audible information to individual  without interrupting the conversation being conducted with individual .","A. Advantages","The present embodiments of the invention have at least the following advantages for both placing and receiving multiple telephone calls. First, an individual can concurrently interact over multiple communication channels. Non-audible input operations (pressing a key or button, touching a display) are translated into appropriate audio phrases and relayed to a designated recipient or recipients.","Second, the relayed phrase is conducted audibly for the recipients.","Third, the phrases permitted are expressive. Expressive representations for different kinds of phrases may be defined (e.g., lists of phrases suitable for greetings and answering incoming calls\u2014\u201cHello, I'll be right there,\u201d \u201cHello, I cannot talk now, please leave a message,\u201d etc. Phrase structures may be predefined, recorded as needed, or synthetically generated on demand (e.g., text-to-speech).","Fourth, the communication interface is easy to use when a user is engaged in other calls or activities. The interface includes channel and phrase representations so that they may be easy to recognize (e.g., icon, text label) and invoke (e.g., point and click). The phrase representations maybe grouped into any type of organizational structure, or left ungrouped. For example, the phrase representations may be grouped by individuals (e.g.: indexed by caller identification), by category (e.g.: greetings, information, goodbyes), etc.","Fifth, the communication interface is situation-appropriate. The interface is designed to fit unobtrusively into different situations (e.g., a pen interface for an individual, a control panel for a receptionist, etc.).","Sixth, embodiments of the present invention operate within an existing communication infrastructure. An embodiment uses available resources that an individual is likely to have (e.g., PC, PDA, data-capable cellular telephone) and\/or adding low-cost components to assist in the transformations. The interface may be implemented on a wide variety of hardware that are interchangeable during or between calls and interoperable with each other over existing communication channels.","Seventh, embodiments of the present invention may be used concurrently with a \u201cQuiet Call system.\u201d An example of such a quiet call system is described in above incorporated co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/657,370 entitled \u201cA METHOD FOR GENERATING CONVERSATION UTTERANCES TO A REMOTE LISTENER IN RESPONSE TO A QUIET SELECTION,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/658,243 entitled \u201cA PERSONAL COMPUTER AND SCANNER FOR GENERATING CONVERSATION UTTERANCES TO A REMOTE LISTENER IN RESPONSE TO A QUIET SELECTION,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/658,673 entitled \u201cA PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANT FOR GENERATING CONVERSATION UTTERANCES TO A REMOTE LISTENER IN RESPONSE TO A QUIET SELECTION,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/658,612 entitled \u201cA TELEPHONE ACCESSORY FOR GENERATING CONVERSATION UTTERANCES TO A REMOTE LISTENER IN RESPONSE TO A QUIET SELECTION,\u201d and Ser. No. 09\/658,245 entitled \u201cA TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATING CONVERSATION UTTERANCES TO A REMOTE LISTENER IN RESPONSE TO A QUIET SELECTION.","Eighth, according to an embodiment, audio input from multiple channels maybe mixed so an individual can simultaneously monitor more than one channel. For example, if an individual is on hold and an incoming call is received, audio from the two calls can be mixed and the individual can conduct a conversation and simultaneously monitor the progress of the call on hold. Alternatively, a graphical representation of audio on a second channel can be visually displayed to a user.","B. A Multi-Channel Quiet Call Example","Amy, a receptionist at a law firm, is conducting her daily routine of receiving incoming calls and routing them to various attorneys, staff, and other office personnel.","Early that morning Bob, a client of the firm, calls wanting to speak to Chad, an associate attorney at the firm, regarding a very important case that Chad has been handling for Bob. Just as Amy is answering Bob's phone call, a second call from Dennis is received. Dennis, a senior partner at the firm, is currently in an arbitration meeting and is at critical decision point and needs to speak with another attorney at the office to clarify a particular issue. Amy knows that she can take the first call from Bob and concurrently communicate to the second caller, Dennis, that she will be with him in just a moment using the Multi-Channel Quiet Call System.","As Amy takes the first call, with her well-rehearsed greeting, \u201cThank you for calling the X,Y,Z firm, how may I direct your call,\u201d she also directs to Dennis, with a click of a button, the verbalized greeting \u201cThank you for calling the X,Y,Z firm, I will be with you in a moment.\u201d Once Amy has directed the call from Bob to Chad's office she then switches to Dennis and directs his call to Eugene, an available attorney who has been helping Dennis prepare for the arbitration. A Multi-Channel Quiet Call system allows Amy to quickly defer an incoming call while simultaneously conversing on another call.","During the conversation between Bob and Chad, they reach an agreement as to a settlement amount Bob is willing to pay to have his case settled. Chad informs Bob that before they present the offer he would like to conduct a limited amount of research, which might result in reducing the amount needed to settle. Chad ends the conversation promising to contact Bob as soon as possible with the results of his research.","As Bob is awaiting the return telephone call from Chad, he decides to call his bank to ensure that he has a sufficient amount of cash on hand to complete the deal. As is typical, Bob is placed on hold by his bank and is subjected to the bank's soothing background music. As Bob is holding with the bank he receives the promised return call from Chad. Instead of either letting Chad's call go to voice-mail or taking the call and risk missing the opportunity to speak to a live individual at the bank, Bob knows that he can converse with Chad and continue to listen for a live person to answer his call at the bank using his Multi-Channel Quiet Call System. Bob accepts Chad's call and selects to mix the audio from both calls so that if a person picks up on the call to the bank, he can quickly switch conversations. A Multi-Channel Quiet Call System allows Bob to monitor multiple channels at the same time while conversing over one of the channels.","As Chad is informing Bob that his search proved beneficial and that the amount Bob is likely to owe should be reduced by half, a representative from the bank suddenly takes Bob's call to the bank off hold. Knowing that the conversation must change quickly or the bank representative may either return him to the hold queue or disconnect him completely, Bob, with a few strokes of an electronic pen over a barcode, sends a verbalized message to the bank representative that they will get immediate attention, while he concurrently informs Chad that their conversation must conclude. Once Bob has thanked Chad for his assistance and instructed him to prepare the settlement agreement, he ends the call and switches to the bank representative and transfers the necessary money into his account. A Multi-Channel Quiet Call System allows Bob to quickly switch from one conversation to another.","Late that evening, as Chad is preparing the settlement agreement on his computer, the computer suddenly takes control, shuts off the screen and begins to beep loudly, disrupting the few remaining late working attorneys. After unsuccessfully attempting to remedy the problem, Chad, knowing he must complete the settlement agreement by morning, reluctantly calls the computer manufacturer's technical support line and begins to press buttons in response to the automated questions. Frustrated and confused, Chad soon becomes lost in the maze of automated queries. Chad, knowing that the computer company utilizes a Multi-Channel Quiet Call System to oversee customers as they travel through the automated system, sends out a verbal cry for help.","In response to Chad's cry for help, a technician, already alerted to Chad's situation due to his constant restarting of messages, directs verbal assistance into the line using Multi-Channel Quiet Call Technology and directs him to his desired query. A Multi-Channel Quiet Call System allows the computer manufacturer to audibly oversee multiple customers by mixing audio channels and\/or by viewing a site map or graph of the automated system and positions of individuals within the system. Using a Multi-Channel Quiet Call system, the computer manufacturer can provide guidance to customers who become lost or confused as they travel through their automated system.","II. A Multi-Channel Quiet Call System","A Multi-Channel Quiet Call system as described herein is an electronically assisted relay of information (e.g., telephone calls) between three or more parties that has the following attributes:","At least one party is in a multiple-contact situation. For example, a receptionist may be in contact with two incoming telephone calls; an individual holding on one call listening to background music while simultaneously conversing verbally on a second call; an operator audibly overseeing several calls as they progress through an automated system; a voice dispatcher (e.g., taxi cab dispatcher) sending out information to multiple parties; etc.","The parties in the multiple-contact situations use an alternative, quiet mode of discussion (e.g., keyboard, buttons, touchscreen, etc.) to produce audible phrases that are transformed into an equivalent electronic representation and directed and transmitted to other parties over one or more channels.","The parties in the multiple-contact situations can select which parties receive the equivalent electronic representation of the phrase that is being transmitted.","The term Multi-Channel Quiet Call technology is used herein to signify the communication mechanism, including hardware and\/or software, that allows people in multiple-contact situations to communicate easily and expressively with two or more parties at the same time, and\/or audibly monitor two or more channels at the same time. A multi-channel quiet call is conducted using this technology.","In an embodiment of the present invention, two Multi-Channel Quiet Call modes of operation are defined: (A) Conducting a Multi-Channel Quiet Call, and (B) Preparing for a Multi-Channel Quiet Call.","A. Conducting a Multi-Channel Quiet Call",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},"A user views a channel representation  and phrase representation , as illustrated by blocks  and  in , respectively, and makes selections about which channels will receive a selected utterance and which utterance will be transmitted over the selected channels.

In another embodiment, channel representation  and phrase representation  may be viewed using a graphical user interface as illustrated in .","A Channel Selector associated with channel representation  in response to user input activates which channels are to receive an electronically generated utterance and controls which channels the user is verbally conversing over. Additionally, channel selector selects multiple channels for mixing the audio using audio mixer  so a user can monitor audio of multiple channels simultaneously. In an embodiment, channel selector may be hardware, such as a mechanical switch, or a software routine for selecting a desired channel.","A Phrase Element associated with phrase representation  is stored in an utterance data store , that when selected is retrieved and submitted to an audio generator  to produce the electrical output signals needed for communication. Audio-to-channel connector  provides this electrical output signal which is then routed to the appropriate channels through channel selector ","A channel-to-user connector  allows the user to monitor the selected channels and hear the party they are conversing with. For example, channel-to-user connector  may be an earpiece, a speaker, or any other audio output device.","An audio input  allows a user to voice into the active conversation channel.","In an embodiment, a stored data extractor  may be included in the system which converts data stored in other formats (e.g., PC calendar entries, address books) into a format suitable for audio generation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["39","39","36"]},"Alternatively, in an embodiment, any one of, or all of utterance data store , associated element , stored data extractor , audio generator , and audio mixer  may be incorporated into telephony processor .

Multi-Channel Quiet Call System Components","a. Channel Representation","A channel representation  of a channel selector which activates the channels for receiving utterances and\/or mixing audio of incoming channels is displayed to a user. An example of a Channel representation GUI is illustrated in . Another example of a channel representation GUI is illustrated in .","Channel representation  may take any form that allows a user to interface with channel selector and select a desired channel or channels, including graphical (e.g., icons, symbols, figures, graphs, checkboxes, buttons, other GUI widgets, and sequences and\/or a combination thereof), textual (e.g., displayed text, labeled input forms, and sequences and\/or combinations of the above), and physical (e.g., buttons, switches, knobs, labels, barcodes, glyphs, Braille or other tangible representation, electronic tags, and sequences and\/or a combination thereof).","A user interacts silently with channel representation  by inspecting it according to its kind (e.g., visually or tactually) and invoking it according to its kind (type, point and click, press, eye tracking, scanning, etc.).","Channel representation  may be presented using one or more display surfaces (e.g., computer display, touchscreen, paper, physical device, etc.) or display forms (e.g., pages, frames, screens, etc.). When multiple surfaces or forms are used these may be organized in different ways according to user needs (sequentially, hierarchically, graph-based, unordered, etc.). A user selects between different surfaces or forms according to its kind (e.g., GUI selection, physical manipulation such as flipping or turning, button press, etc.).","b. Channel Selector","Channel selector activates which channels are to receive an electronic representation of a selected phrase while simultaneously maintaining a connection between the user and the channel they are conversing on. Additionally, channel selector may activate which channels are to have their audio mixed using audio mixer  for simultaneous listening by a user. Channel selector may select one, two, all, or any other combination of channels for audio mixing.","Channel selector may transmit utterances over selected channels while a user continues conversing on another channel in numerous ways. For example, channel selector maybe a mechanical device, such as a series of switches which keep an audio channel between the user and the party they are conversing with active while simultaneously activating other audio channels for transmission of a selected phrase. In an embodiment, the transmitted phrase is not transmitted over the conversing channel.","In an embodiment, channel mixing is performed by a user sending commands via channel representation  to channel selector . Channel selector activates the selected channels and the incoming audio is mixed by audio mixer  and sent to channel to user connector  for audible listening by a user.","c. Phrase Representation","Phrase representation  of a phrase element (i.e., phrases, words, letters, numbers, symbols, sound effects, and sequences and\/or a combination thereof) that a user may invoke for initiating phrase utterances is displayed to a user. An example of a phrase representation GUI is illustrated in . Another example of a phrase representation GUI is illustrated in .","A phrase representation  may take any form that does not require a user to vocalize a selection of a phrase element , including graphical (e.g., icons, symbols, figures, graphs, checkboxes, buttons, other GUI widgets, and sequences and\/or a combination thereof), textual (e.g., displayed text, labeled input forms, and sequences and\/or combinations of the above), and physical (e.g., buttons, switches, knobs, labels, barcodes, glyphs, Braille or other tangible representation, electronic tags, and sequences and\/or a combination thereof).","A user interacts silently with each phrase representation  by inspecting it according to its kind (e.g., visually or tactually) and invoking it according to its kind (type, point and click, press, eye tracking, scanning, etc.).","Phrase representation  may be presented using one or more display surfaces (e.g., computer display, touchscreen, paper, physical device, etc.) or display forms (e.g., pages, frames, screens, etc.). When multiple surfaces or forms are used these may be organized in different ways according to user needs (sequentially, hierarchically, graph-based, unordered, etc.). A user selects between different surfaces or forms according to its kind (e.g., GUI selection, physical manipulation such as flipping or turning, button press, etc.).","A user may update a phrase element and an associated phrase representation  in a visible display as follows. First, an individual can add a new phrase element and\/or an associated phrase representation.","Second, an individual can delete a phrase element and\/or an associated phrase representation.","Third, an individual can change the kinds of phrase representations of phrase elements (e.g., text, label, icon).","Fourth, an individual can change a phrase representation of a phrase element according to its kind (e.g., text values, label values, icon images).","Fifth, an individual can change a phrase element associated with one or more phrase representations.","Sixth, an individual can add, delete, or modify the association of a phrase element and its phrase representation.","Seventh, an individual can invoke upload\/download commands for phrase elements, their display phrase representations, and associated internal phrase representation.","Eighth, an individual can invoke record and playback capabilities for selected phrase elements.","d. Utterance Data Store","Each phrase element (i.e., phrases, words, letters, numbers, symbols, sound effects, and sequences and\/or combinations of the above) has one or more internal representations suitable for creation of audible utterances that may be communicated over an audio channel, such as a telephone line. Phrase element stored in utterance data store  includes, for example, sound file formats, record and playback formats, text, MIDI sequences, etc. These internal representations may be stored in and retrieved from utterance data store . In an embodiment, utterance data store  is readable and writeable computer memory as known in the art. Retrieval may be accessed randomly, sequentially, by query, or through other such known methods. Data for retrieved phrase elements are passed to an audio generator .","e. Audio Generator","An audio generator  transforms the internal representations of phrase elements into audible formats suitable for transmission over an audio channel, such as a telephone connection. In an embodiment, audio generator  is a text-to-speech generator, sound card, sound effects generator, playback device, in combination and\/or an equivalent.","f. Audio Input","Direct audio connection  (e.g., microphone) at the locale of the user may be used to converse over an active channel.","Audio recording into an utterance data store may be made by selecting one or more elements from the phrase representation, invoking a record command and speaking in audio input .","g. Audio Output","Audio output  allows for audio generation from an utterance data store  by selecting one or more elements from a conversational representation  and invoking a playback command. Audio output provides the ability to listen to audio when programming phrases.","h. Audio Mixing","Audio Mixer  mixes the audio from two or more incoming channels and streams the audio to channel to user connector  for output to a user. Audio may be mixed by merging audio signals from each incoming channel using hardware, software, or a combination of both. Hardware may include any means of analog or digital signal processing (e.g.: Voice-over-IP (VoIP)). Software may include software for merging of bitstreams or the combination of data through a transformation. Many transformations may be defined and any one or combination may be used. A transformation may be, for example, adjusting volume, frequency, sampling, compression, and filtering into a distinguishable audio pattern that may be interpreted as audio activity (e.g. mumbling, speaking, music, buzzing).","In an alternative embodiment, instead of mixing audio a graphical representation of audio on second channel is displayed to a user. The graphical display alerts the user, as a result of a graphical change, when the audio changes from either a hold noise (e.g.: background music) to a live person.","i. Audio-to-Channel Connector","Audio-to-channel connection is provided between user conversational inputs generated from the audio input  or audio generator  that delivers signals appropriate for telephone transmission to receiving parties.

The text is either configured with the telephone, obtained previously from a telecommunication provider (e.g., downloaded in a previous voice or data call), obtained, or customized during a current call. Communication could be through telephone information fields such as caller ID or through in-band signaling such as Dual-Tone Multi Frequency (\u201cDTMF\u201d), for touch tone signaling, fax tones, or a custom signaling technique that is in some way more audibly appealing (e.g., rhythmic or musical sequences).","If a telephone supports dedicated selection keys, these may be used to navigate the channel and phrase element selections. When one of the options is selected, a message with the encoded selection including the selected channel or channels is sent back to the server with in-band signaling. The selection message is used to activate the selected channels, access and transmit the corresponding phrase element through the selected channel.","If the telephone does not support selection keys, the standard numeric pad maybe used for the selection (e.g., *, 1, 2, etc.). The associated DTMF signal might be suppressed from the other party by carrier or provider specific mechanisms. Alternatively, the telephone could support alternative tone generation that is not so audibly disturbing (e.g., other frequency or rhythmic patterns).","In an embodiment, a receiving caller's telephone  would have the Multi-Channel Quiet Call technology to access a Multi-Channel Quiet Call server  and Multi-Channel Quiet Call Systems as illustrated in ","In an alternative embodiment, a third party provider is brought into the call (most likely by the receiving caller) as illustrated in . In this case, a direct line would be kept active between the receiving caller and one of the callee's, and a conference call would be established to accept an additional incoming caller and control phrase element selection signals (most likely as DTMF or other audible pattern), translate the signals into corresponding audible utterances and transmit the audible utterance to the incoming caller.","The following describes various in-band telecommunication infrastructure embodiments. First, a proxy answer at a Multi-Channel Quiet Call server embodiment may be used. Calls to a telephone are actually first placed through a service number. This may be made transparent to initiating callers  and  by providing the service number as the point of contact. A Multi-Channel Quiet Call server  (e.g., telephony program or service provider function) answers the incoming calls from callers  and  and dials a receiving caller's telephone . Callee answers telephone  and completes a connection to the first initiating caller . The receiving telephone , then quickly makes a connection to Multi-Channel Quiet Call server  (e.g., through a conference call or as a relay with the server application acting as an intermediary, as shown in ) which receives signaling from callee telephone  and sends utterances to a second caller . Callee makes Multi-Channel Quiet Call input selections that are signaled to Multi-Channel Quiet Call server  for transmitting the appropriate audible utterance to the second caller . The in-band signaling may itself be audible to initiating caller  (e.g., as in a continuous three-way call connection shown in ) or may be screened from initiating caller  (e.g., as in a relay connection or shown in ). Additionally, the conversation between the first caller  and the receiving callee will not be audible to second caller . The Multi-Channel Quiet Call server  also allows the callee to change conversations between caller  and caller .","b. Out-of-Band Selection for Adding Voice Audio","A selected channel and phrase element may be communicated to a Multi-Channel Quiet Call server through some means other than a voice channel of the telephone call.  illustrates an out-of-band telecommunication infrastructure embodiment . As with in-band signaling, each call may be placed through a service number (proxy answer approach described above) or directly to the receiving caller's telephone. A Multi-Channel Quiet Call server is connected to the voice calls through a relay configuration.","The following describes out-of-band control embodiments.","First, a related voice and data connections embodiment may be used. Telecommunication systems (such as Integrated Services Digital Network, (\u201cISDN\u201d) carry voice and data on separate channels. For example, instead of the telecommunication provider sending a ring voltage signal to ring a bell in your telephone (in-band signal), the provider sends a digital packet on a separate channel (out-of-band signal). A call is processed by a telecommunications service provider by establishing a voice channel and a related control data stream. Control information is sent to a Multi-Channel Quiet Call server independently from a voice communication using the alternate data channel. A Multi-Channel Quiet Call server, being in connection with each channel, introduces the appropriate utterances to the appropriate channels as described above.","Second, a digital communication, such as Code Division Multiple Access (\u201cCDMA\u201d) and VoIP, encode voice and data as bits and allow for simultaneous communication by interleaving the packets on digital channels.","Third, a separate data connection embodiment may be used. In an embodiment, a handset is set up with a separate data connection or a second device (e.g., wirelessly connected PDA) to communicate control information between a receiving caller and Multi-Channel Quiet Call server.","Fourth, an additional telephone connection embodiment maybe used. A handset is set up with a multiple channel capability or several telephones could be used. One call would communicate control information between a receiving caller's Multi-Channel Quiet Call Phone  and Multi-Channel Quiet Call server . The other telephone One  and other telephone Two  would each have a connection between all parties (initiating callers, receiving caller, and server application). However, the conference call center would control, based on channel selections from Multi-Channel Quiet Call Phone , which channels receive which communications.","Fifth, when using a channel supporting simultaneous mixed digital voice and data (e.g., VoIP combined with an IP-enabled phone acting as the Multi-Channel Quiet Call Phone), synthetic or pre-recorded conversation elements and channel selections may be stored as simple data packets on a telephone handset.","Out-of-band signaling has the advantage that the control signals do not have to be hidden, disguised (e.g., as rhythmic patterns), or endured (e.g., touch tones). The disadvantage is that several communication channels require management, except in the case of intermixed voice and data packet communication (e.g., VoIP).","ii.
