No. 61\/537,928, filed on 22 Sep. 2011, herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to pyrazolopyridyl compounds, which selectively inhibit aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) with diminished inhibition or affect on steroid-11-\u03b2-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) inhibitors. The inventive compounds potentially have utility in treating cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension or heart failure. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the inventive compounds as well as processes for their preparation.","Aldosterone is a steroid hormone secreted in the adrenal cortex. In primary cells of the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney, aldosterone binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) results in the retention of sodium and water and excretion of potassium, which in turn leads to increased blood pressure. Aldosterone also causes inflammation that leads to fibrosis and remodeling in the heart, vasculature and kidney. This inflammation may proceed by MR-dependent as well as MR-independent mechanisms (Gilbert, K. C. et al., Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes Obes., vol. 17, 2010, pp. 199-204).","Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone and eplerenone, have been used previously to block the effects of aldosterone binding to MR. When given in addition to standard therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and loop diuretics, the nonselective MRA spironolactone and the selective MRA eplerenone significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure or myocardial infarction (Pitt, B. et al., New Engl. J. Med., vol. 341, 1999, pp. 709-717; Pitt, B. et al., New Engl. J. Med., vol. 348, 2003, pp. 1382-1390). However, the nonselective MRA spironolactone can also bind to and act at other steroid receptors, and as a consequence its use is associated with sexual side effects such as gynecomastia, dysmenorrhoea and impotence (Pitt, B. et al., New Engl. J. Med., vol. 341, 1999, pp. 709-717; MacFadyen, R. J. et al., Cardiovasc. Res., vol. 35, 1997, pp 30-34; Soberman, J. E. et al., Curr. Hypertens. Rep., vol. 2, 2000, pp 451-456). Additionally, both spironolactone and eplerenone are known to cause elevated plasma potassium levels (hyperkalemia) and elevated aldosterone levels.","An alternative method of blocking the effects of aldosterone is to inhibit its biosynthesis. CYP11B2 is a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes the final oxidative steps in the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone, a steroidal precursor, to aldosterone (Kawamoto, T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 89, 1992, pp. 1458-1462). Compounds that inhibit CYP11B2 should thus inhibit the formation of aldosterone. Such compounds, particularly those of nonsteroidal structure, should provide the beneficial effects of MRAs, without the adverse effects derived from steroid receptor binding or MR-independent inflammatory pathways. The art has recognized that reducing aldosterone levels by inhibiting aldosterone synthase could represent a new pharmaceutical strategy that might be useful in treating a disorder or disease characterized by increased stress hormone levels and\/or decreased androgen hormone levels in a patient (WO2011\/088188 to Novartis). Compounds possessing this activity might be expected to treat disease states such as heart failure, cachexia, acute coronary syndrome, Cushing's syndrome or metabolic syndrome.","CYP11B1 is a related enzyme that catalyzes the formation of glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, an important regulator of glucose metabolism. Because human CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 are greater than 93% homologous, it is possible for nonselective compounds to inhibit both enzymes (Kawamoto, T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 89, 1992, pp 1458-1462; Taymans, S. E. et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., vol. 83, 1998, pp 1033-1036). It would be preferable, however, for therapeutic agents to selectively inhibit CYP11B2 and the formation of aldosterone with diminished inhibition of, or affect on, CYP11B1 and the production of cortisol.","WO 2009\/135651 to Elexopharm describes 6-pyridin-3yl-3,4,-dihydro-1H-quinolin-2-one derivatives as being CYP11B2 inhibitors.

The production of specific stereoisomers or mixtures thereof may be identified in the Examples where such stereoisomers or mixtures were obtained, but this in no way limits the inclusion of all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof from being within the scope of this invention.","The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for example mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, in all ratios. Thus, enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis\/trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture by customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally, a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of Formula I or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Where compounds of this invention are capable of tautomerization, all individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are included in the scope of this invention.

The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (H) and deuterium (H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and\/or intermediates.","When the compounds of Formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups the invention also includes the corresponding physiologically or toxicologically acceptable salts, in particular the pharmaceutically utilizable salts. Thus, the compounds of Formula I which contain acidic groups can be used according to the invention, for example, as alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or as ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include but are not limited to sodium salts, potassium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as, for example, ethylamine, ethanolamine, triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of Formula I which contain one or more basic groups, i.e. groups which can be protonated, can be used according to the invention in the form of their acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids as, for example but not limited to, salts with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acids, oxalic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, sulfaminic acid, phenylpropionic acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, isonicotinic acid, citric acid, adipic acid, etc. If the compounds of Formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule the invention also includes, in addition to the salt forms mentioned, inner salts or betaines (zwitterions). Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula I by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula I which, owing to low physiological compatibility, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of physiologically (i.e., pharmaceutically) acceptable salts.","Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may exist in amorphous form and\/or one or more crystalline forms, and as such all amorphous and crystalline forms and mixtures thereof of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.

For example, esters can optionally be made by esterification of an available carboxylic acid group or by formation of an ester on an available hydroxy group in a compound. Similarly, labile amides can be made. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters or amides of the compounds of this invention may be prepared to act as pro-drugs which can be hydrolyzed back to an acid (or \u2014COO\u2014depending on the pH of the fluid or tissue where conversion takes place) or hydroxy form particularly in vivo and as such are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug modifications include, but are not limited to, \u2014Calkyl esters and \u2014Calkyl substituted with phenyl esters.","Accordingly, the compounds within the generic structural formulas, embodiments and specific compounds described and claimed herein encompass salts, all possible stereoisomers and tautomers, physical forms (e.g., amorphous and crystalline forms), solvate and hydrate forms thereof and any combination of these forms, as well as the salts thereof, pro-drug forms thereof, and salts of pro-drug forms thereof, where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.","Compounds of the present invention are effective at inhibiting the synthesis of aldosterone by inhibiting CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) and they are therefore useful agents for the therapy and prophylaxis of disorders that are associated with elevated aldosterone levels. Accordingly, an embodiment of the instant invention is to provide a method for inhibiting aldosterone synthase, and more particularly selectively inhibiting CYP11B2, in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering a compound of Formula I to the patient in an amount effective to inhibit aldosterone synthesis, or more particularly to selectively inhibit CYP11B2, in the patient. A selective inhibitor of CYP11B2 is intended to mean a compound that preferentially inhibits CYP11B2 as compared to CYP11B1. The inhibition of CYP11B2, as well inhibition of CYP11B1, by the compounds of Formula I can be examined, for example, in the inhibition assays described below.","In general, compounds that have activity as aldosterone synthase inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which have an ICof less than or equal to about 10 \u03bcM; preferably less than or equal to about 250 nM; and most preferably less than or equal to about 100 nM, in the V79-Human-CYP11B2 Assay described below. In general, aldosterone synthase inhibitors that are selective for inhibition of CYP11B2 as compared to CYP11B1 are those that show at least 3-fold greater inhibition for CYP11B2 compared to CYP11B1; preferably at least 20-fold inhibition for CYP11B2 compared to CYP11B1; and more preferably at least 100-fold greater inhibition for CYP11B2 compared to CYP11B1, in the V79-Human-CYP11B2 Assay as compared to the V79-Human-CYP11B1 Assay.","Due to their ability to inhibit CYP11B2, the compounds of the present invention may be useful to treat and\/or ameliorate the risk for hypertension, hypokalemia, renal failure (e.g., chromic renal failure), restenosis, Syndrome X, nephropathy, post-myocardial infarction, coronary heart diseases, increased formation of collagen, fibrosis and remodeling following hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases, renal dysfunction, liver diseases, vascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, retinopathy, neuropathy, insulinopathy, endothelial dysfunction, heart failure (e.g., congestive heart failure), diastolic heart failure, left ventricle diastolic dysfunction, diastolic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, ischemia, myocardial and vascular fibrosis, myocardial necrotic lesions, vascular damage, myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac lesions, vascular wall hypertrophy, endothelial thickening or necrosis of coronary arteries.","The dosage amount of the compound to be administered depends on the individual case and is, as is customary, to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus, it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated, and also on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used, on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic, or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of Formula I. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the compound will be administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient, including a course of therapy lasting days, months, years or the life of the patient.","In general, a daily dose of approximately 0.001 to 30 mg\/kg, preferably 0.001 to 20 mg\/kg, in particular 0.01 to 10 mg\/kg (in each case mg per kg of bodyweight) is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose is preferably administered in a single dose or, in particular when larger amounts are administered, can be divided into several, for example two, three or four individual doses, and may be, for example but not limited to, 0.1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1 mg, 1.25 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, etc., on a daily basis. In some cases, depending on the individual response, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes animals, preferably mammals and especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of said disease or medical condition.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. A \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The tems \u201cpreventing\u201d or \u201cprevention\u201d are used herein to refer to administering a compound before the onset of clinical symptoms.","It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment of hypertension, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention of myocardial infarction.","In the methods of treatment of this invention, the compound may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as, for example, orally, parenterally, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred, particularly solid oral dosage units such as pills, tablets or capsules.","Accordingly, this invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. For oral use, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as pills, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, mannitol, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other customary additives, for example, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, dispersants, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants.","Oral immediate-release and time-controlled release dosage forms may be employed, as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques for aesthetic purposes, to mask taste or for other reasons. Coatings can also be used to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.","Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.","Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose.","The instant invention also encompasses a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier is comprised of one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Furthermore, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for inhibiting aldosterone synthase, inhibiting CYP11B2, for normalizing a disturbed aldosterone balance, or for treating or preventing any of the medical conditions described herein, in dosage amounts described herein.","The amount of active compound of Formula I and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical composition may be, for example but not limited to, from 0.1 to 200 mg, preferably from 0.1 to 50 mg, per dose on a free acid\/free base weight basis, but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical composition and potency of the active ingredient it could also be lower or higher. Pharmaceutical compositions usually comprise 0.5 to 90 percent by weight of the active compound on a free acid\/free base weight basis.","Since the compounds of Formula I inhibit aldosterone synthase, apart from use as pharmaceutically active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine, they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aid for biochemical investigations in which such an effect on aldosterone synthase and aldosterone levels is intended, and also for diagnostic purposes, for example in the in vitro diagnosis of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of Formula I can also be employed as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.","One or more additional pharmacologically active agents (or therapeutic agents) may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I. An additional active agent (or agents) is intended to mean a pharmaceutically active agent (or agents) different from the compound of Formula I. Generally, any suitable additional active agent or agents, including but not limited to anti-hypertensive agents, anti-atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound, anti-diabetic agents and\/or anti-obesity agents may be used in any combination with the compound of Formula I in a single dosage formulation (a fixed dose drug combination), or may be administered to the patient in one or more separate dosage formulations which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents (co-administration of the separate active agents).","Examples of additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g, alacepril, benazepril, captopril, ceronapril, cilazapril, delapril, enalapril, enalaprilat, fosinopril, imidapril, lisinopril, moexepril, moveltipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, spirapril, temocapril, or trandolapril); dual inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) such as omapatrilat, sampatrilat and fasidotril; angiotensin II receptor antagonists (e.g., candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan) neutral endopeptidase inhibitors (e.g., thiorphan and phosphoramidon), aldosterone antagonists, renin inhibitors (e.g., enalkrein, RO 42-5892, A 65317, CP 80794, ES 1005, ES 8891, SQ 34017, aliskiren (2(S),4(S),5(S),7(S)\u2014N-(2-carbamoyl-2-methylpropyl)-5-amino-4-hydroxy-2,7-diisopropyl-8-[4-methoxy-3-(3-methoxypropoxy)-phenyl]-octanamid hemifumarate) SPP600, SPP630 and SPP635), endothelin receptor antagonists, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine, bepridil, diltiazem, felodipine, gallopamil, nicardipine, nifedipine, niludipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine veraparmil), potassium channel activators (e.g., nicorandil, pinacidil, cromakalim, minoxidil, aprilkalim, loprazolam), diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide); including loop diuretics such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide, bumetanide and torsemide, sympatholitics, beta-adrenergic blocking drugs (e.g., acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, metoprolol tartate, nadolol, propranolol, sotalol, timolol); alpha adrenergic blocking drugs (e.g., doxazocin, prazocin or alpha methyldopa) central alpha adrenergic agonists, peripheral vasodilators (e.g. hydralazine), lipid lowering agents (e.g., simvastatin and lovastatin which are marketed as ZOCOR\u00ae and MEVACOR\u00ae in lactone pro-drug form and function as inhibitors after administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of dihydroxy open ring acid HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as atorvastatin (particularly the calcium salt sold in LIPITOR\u00ae), rosuvastatin (particularly the calcium salt sold in CRESTOR\u00ae), pravastatin (particularly the sodium salt sold in PRAVACHOL\u00ae), and fluvastatin (particularly the sodium salt sold in LESCOL\u00ae); a cholesterol absorption inhibitor such as ezetimibe (ZETIA\u00ae), and ezetimibe in combination with any other lipid lowering agents such as the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors noted above and particularly with simvastatin (VYTORIN\u00ae) or with atorvastatin calcium; niacin in immediate-release or controlled release forms, and particularly in niacin in combination with a DP antagonist such as laropiprant (TREDAPTIVE\u00ae) and\/or with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor; niacin receptor agonists such as acipimox and acifran, as well as niacin receptor partial agonists; metabolic altering agents including insulin sensitizing agents and related compounds (e.g., muraglitazar, glipizide, metformin, rosiglitazone), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin, alogliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, dutogliptin, and gemigliptin); or with other drugs beneficial for the prevention or the treatment of the above-mentioned diseases including nitroprusside and diazoxide.","In general, the compounds in the invention may be produced by a variety of processes know to those skilled in the art and by know processes analogous thereto. The invention disclosed herein is exemplified by the following preparations and examples which should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. Alternative mechanistic pathways and analogous structures will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The practitioner is not limited to these methods and one skilled in the art would have resources such as or at his or her disposal to assist in devising an alternative method of preparing a specific compound.","The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the procedures of the following Schemes using appropriate materials and are further exemplified by the specific Examples which follow. Moreover, by utilizing the procedures described herein, one of ordinary skill in the art can readily prepare additional compounds of the present invention claimed herein.","Throughout the synthetic schemes, abbreviations are used with the following meanings unless otherwise indicated:","AcCN=acetonitrile; aq=aqueous, Ar=aryl; BSA=bovine serum albumin; Bu=butyl, t-Bu=tert-butyl; n-BuLi=n-butyllithium; CELITE=diatomaceous earth; conc, conc.=concentrated; c-Pr=cyclopropyl; Cy=cyclohexyl; DECALIN=decahydronaphthalene; dba=dibenzylideneacetone; DCM=dichloromethane; dffp=1,1\u2032-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene; DIPA=dissopropyl amine; DMEM=Dulbecco's modified eagle medium; DMF=N,N-dimethylformamide; DMSO=dimethylsulfoxide; eq.=equivalent(s); EDTA=ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; Et=ethyl; EtOAc=ethyl acetate; EtOH=ethanol; FBS=Fetal Bovine Serum; h, hr=hour; HAS=hydroxylamine-o-sulphonic acid; HPLC=High pressure liquid chromatography; HTRF=homogenous time resolved fluorescence; i-PrOH=isopropanol; i-Pr=isopropyl; LCMS=liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy; Me=methyl; MeOH=methanol; min, min.=minute; MS=mass spectroscopy; NCS=N-chlorosuccinimide; NMR=nuclear magnetic resonance; PBS=phosphate buffered saline; PdCl(dppf)=dichloro[1,1\u2032-bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene]palladium(II); Pd(dba)=tris(dibenzylidineacetone)dipalladium; Pd(dppf)Cl=1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II); Pd\/C=palladium on activated carbon; Ph=phenyl; Pr=propyl; Py=pyridyl; PyBOP=(benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate; OAc=acetate; RT, rt=room temperature; sat.=saturated; S-Phos=2-dichlorocyclohexylphosphino-2\u2032,6\u2032-dimethoxybiphenyl; TBAF=tetrabutylammonium fluoride; THF=tetrahydrofuran; triflate, and TfO=trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride.","As will be known to those skilled in the art, in all schemes, the products of Formula I and all synthetic intermediates may be purified from unwanted side products, reagents and solvents by recrystallization, trituration, preparative thin layer chromatography, flash chromatography on silica gel as described by W. C. Still et al, J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 2923, or reverse-phase HPLC. Compounds purified by HPLC may be isolated as the corresponding salt.","Additionally, in some instances the final compounds of Formula I and synthetic intermediates may be comprised of a mixture of cis and trans isomers, enantiomers or diastereomers. As will be known to those skilled in the art, such cis and trans isomers, enantiomers and diastereomers may be separated by various methods including crystallization, chomatography using a homochiral stationary phase and, in the case of cis\/trans isomers and diastereomers, normal-phase and reverse-phase chromatography.","Chemical reactions were monitored by LCMS, and the purity and identity of the reaction products were assayed by LCMS (electrospray ionization) and NMR. LCMS spectra were recorded in some instances, for example, on an Agilent 1100 series instrument equipped with an Xterra MS C18 column (3.5 \u03bcM, 3.0\u00d750 mm i.d.) and UV detector. 1H NMR spectra were recorded, for example, on a Varian 500 HHz spectrometer and are internally referenced to residual protio solvent signals.

Unless otherwise noted, all LCMS ions listed are [M+H]. All temperatures are degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted.","In the Examples, some intermediates and final compounds having a chiral carbon were prepared as racemates, and some chiral intermediates were resolved and the enantiomers were used separately to synthesize enantiomeric downstream intermediates and final products. In some cases racemic final products may have been resolved. In the instances where chiral compounds were separated by chiral HPLC purification, the term \u201cenantiomer A\u201d or \u201cent A\u201d refers to the first eluting enantiomer and the downstream compounds derived from this enantiomer.

The term \u201crac\u201d refers to a racemic mixture. As a result, the chemical nomenclature may indicate that an S and\/or an R enantiomer was obtained, but the absolute stereochemistry of the separate enantiomers A and\/or B was not determined.","Preparative HPLC was performed, for example, using a SunFire Prep C18 OBD column (5 \u03bcM, 19\u00d7100 mm i.d.) on Gilson instruments equipped with UV detectors.","Flash chromatography on silica gel was performed, for example, using pre-packed silica gel columns on Biotage Horizon or Biotage SP-1 instruments equipped with UV detectors.","The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood.
