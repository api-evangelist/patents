{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to conferences, and more particularly, to a conference and collaboration application that supports features for enabling geographically dispersed individuals to communicate with one another.","Organizations today use conferencing and collaboration solutions to hold meetings with several parties in multiple geographic locations. Features typical of these conferencing and collaboration solutions include the ability to schedule a conference with both internal and external parties. These conferences use audio and video conferencing, text chat, application sharing and remote desktop sharing via an Internet connection. Audio conference bridge capabilities are provided with control over individual callers. Conference and collaboration solutions allow the sharing of a presentation with remote parties, sharing the display of a specific application with remotes parties and sharing a desktop display with remote parties.","White-boarding capabilities with conference and collaboration solutions allow participants to annotate documents being shared with participants, for example, slides and text documents. These solutions also allow the conference moderator to pass control of the presentation such that the remote party that has gained control can direct what is being displayed to all conference participants. Private chats between conference attendees are available and the ability to see who has joined the conference and who is currently speaking is provided by these solutions. Conference and collaboration solutions poll conferencing participants to solicit feedback as well as provide recording capabilities.","Within conference and collaboration solutions, a moderator starts a meeting by arriving at the meeting room at the scheduled time and finding the number within their email or calendar application that needs to be dialed to access the audio conference bridge. The moderator then manually dials the number on the conference phone in the room. Once the audio conference bridge solution answers the call, the moderator manually enters their conference identification number and passcode using the conference phone dial pad. A projector or monitor video cable available in the room is plugged into their laptop such that they can display the presentation material to the in-room participants.","The moderator then logs into their laptop and accesses the collaboration session by either launching the application on their computer or by logging into the service website. Once in the conference and collaboration application or service, the moderator logs into the prescheduled meeting by entering their conference identification number and passcode. The moderator enables video conferencing with any external parties who are video conference enabled. Sometimes, this is a completely separate video conferencing system that has no integration with the conference and collaboration application. The presentation material is opened to be shared with internal and external participants and is then shared with external participants via a menu item.","As shown, this type of conferencing and collaboration solution initiating a conference is manually intensive and time consuming. With these separate solutions, the typical conference room meeting that includes outside parties involves connecting a laptop to a projector through a local connection, accessing and opening the presentation material on the laptop and thereafter, getting it to display on the attached display device, which can include having to adjust display settings. During the meeting, the moderator also calls or answers external meeting participants who are dialing in for the meeting and then setting up a video conference with the external participants on the video conferencing system. This consumes time and effort before the meeting can be productive. This is compounded by the fact that meeting room users are infrequent users of the systems provided in the room and are therefore not proficient in the use of these systems.","A conferencing and collaboration system and methods thereof aimed at simplifying the initiation of a meeting in a conference room while reducing the time and effort required is therefore needed. These, as well as other related advantages and features, will be described in the present disclosure.","The description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of presently preferred embodiments of the disclosure and is not intended to represent the only forms in which the present disclosure can be constructed and\/or utilized.

Conventional Ethernet technology or internal or external modems can serve as the network interfaces. A cable or DSL modem can be used as a network interface. While the above embodiment describes a single computer system acting as the server for the conference and collaboration application , the functionality can be distributed over multiple computing systems. The databases can also be distributed over a cloud computing environment known to those skilled in the relevant art. In one embodiment, the server is configured in a distributed architecture, wherein the databases and processors are housed in separate units or locations. While more than one conference and collaboration application  is provided, those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that fewer or more of these devices can be placed within the system . The application  can be maintained remotely through the Internet  as depicted at a top portion of , more directly as shown on the right portion or both.","The server for the conference and collaboration application  can be connected to other components within the system  through a LAN . While a LAN  has been used, those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that other types of networks can be used, for example, the Internet , intranet, wide-area network (WAN), personal-area network (PAN), campus-area network (CAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), global-area network (GAN), virtual private network, or any other type of network supporting communication between devices described herein. The LAN  can include both wired and wireless connections, including optical links. Data and other information can be distributed from the application  to and from the conference devices .","The conference and collaboration application  can function with a VoIP system . The VoIP system  is utilized to route audio and video from the conference devices  and the conference and collaboration application . Communication between the conference devices , the VoIP system  and the conference and collaboration application  can occur via the LAN .","Conference calls between the conference devices  can be designed so that the conference and collaboration application  can cause the moderator's conference device  to call the other participants directly and conference them together or the conference and collaboration application  can cause the participant's conference device  to call the moderator's conference device  and add them to the conference on the moderator's conference device . These calls are setup and routed by the VoIP system  for the conference and collaboration application . Alternatively, the moderator can choose to utilize the audio conference bridge capability provided as part of the conferencing and collaboration application . In this case, the conference and collaboration application  can cause each of the conference devices  to dial into the assigned conference bridge for the scheduled meeting.","For participants who are not connecting via a conference device , a meeting invitation is sent by the conference and collaboration application  that includes a phone number and conference identification number that participants would dial to be connected into the audio conference bridge that is being used for the conference. In this case, the VoIP system  would route participants calling into the conference bridge to the conference and collaboration application . The conferencing and collaboration application  can support live streaming or broadcasting of conference calls as well via the Internet , enabling a larger audience access to the call without dialing into a bridge. The conference and collaboration application  can be a captive application that is a shared resource within a company or organization or it can be provided as a hosted service offered via the Internet  that is paid for on a pay-per-use basis.","With reference to the conference devices , a processor for implementing logic, memory, a display, and an input device can be provided in each. A system bus can be used for video and audio data as well as propagating signals for processing the video and audio.

A conference and collaboration application  can also be provided to host the conference via the Internet  as shown in the top portion. The conference and collaboration application  can operate on a server, similar to the one described above.","While numerous components have been described within the system  above, those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that fewer or more components can be used. The system  can be integrated with multiple conference devices  in different locations to perform actions such as uploading presentation material to the devices  for display, pass presentation navigation actions from a moderator operating a conference device  to remote conference devices , pass navigation control from a moderator of a conference device  to remote devices  and pass files uploaded by a remote user device  to connected devices .","By combining a conference and collaboration application  and conference devices , meetings can be automatically setup by the conference and collaboration application  by remotely controlling the conference devices . The conference and collaboration application  can cause the conference devices  to dial into the audio conference bridge and connect remote video conferencing participants. The conference and collaboration application  can then upload presentation materials to conference devices  for display in the rooms . In addition, the conference device  can provide local information to the conference and collaboration application  that can be displayed to remote participants. More details describing these actions will be provided below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","110","102","102","102","102","104"]},"Initially, the user enters in a meeting date, time and duration through one of the methods described above. At block , the application  can receive the meeting details. The user of the application  or moderator can also reserve a meeting room  that has a conference device  in it. The application  can allow the moderator or system administrator to pre-configure an association between the meeting rooms  within the organization and the conference devices  contained within them. Typically the conference devices  can have an extension number that is stored within the VoIP system  it is connected to. The VoIP system  can be queried by the application  to determine the IP address of conference devices  such that it can communicate with them. In this way, the application  is able to determine and communicate with the conference device  in the scheduled meeting room .","At block , the application  can receive a meeting room  reservation for the moderator of the meeting to use. The application  can also enable the moderator to reserve a meeting room  that contains a conference device  for one or more participants being invited. This can be used when one or more of the participants are in another office at a different geographic location within the organization. The conference and collaboration application  can use this information to distribute presentation materials to the conference devices  at both locations and to automatically initiate the conference at both locations when it is time for the meeting to start.","At block , the moderator can attach meeting materials, if desired. These meeting materials can be provided in any format useable by the conference devices . In one embodiment, the application  can reformat these materials if they cannot be properly displayed on the devices . Display information for each of the devices  can be maintained by the VoIP system  or alternatively, the application . The moderator can select invitees to attend the meeting. At block , the application  can receive information about the invitees who can be associated with conference devices .","At block , the conference and collaboration application  can provide invitations to the invitees that were selected by the moderator. In one embodiment, invitations can be sent via email. The emails can be sent by the user's calendar application with text being supplied by the application  or the application  can provide a lookup email address feature itself such that a corresponding email address can be found with a name received by the application . Alternatively, invitations can be sent through a text message or the like to the invitees. The application  can provide instructions within the email to invitees not connecting via a conference device  including information required to access the meeting and any presentation materials at block . In one embodiment, the application  can include any dial-in numbers for the audio conference bridge as part of the instructions. The processes can end at block .","Referring now to , a flow chart showing illustrative procedures for implementing a meeting in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure is provided. While one embodiment showing procedures for setting up the meeting was described above, those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the moderator can schedule meetings through other ways. The processes for implementing the meeting can begin at block . At block , the conference and collaboration application  can monitor a list of scheduled meetings.","At decision block , the application  can determine whether a meeting is to commence. When the established meeting does not occur within a relatively close period of time, the application  can continue to monitor the scheduled meetings at block . As the time for a meeting approaches, at block , the conference and collaboration application  can fetch the presentation materials that were uploaded by the user. In one embodiment, the presentation materials are fetched five minutes before the meeting is scheduled to start.","At block , the application  can upload the presentation materials to the conference devices  in the scheduled meeting rooms  so that they are ready to be displayed to both in-room and external participants. In one embodiment, the conference devices , when enabled, can display the presentation materials to in-room participants via the projector or monitor  of the room .","At block , when the user or moderator of the meeting arrives, they can log into a conference device  in the meeting room . In one embodiment, the moderator can provide their network credentials by entering their extension number or a username and a passcode. Alternately, the conference device  can detect the user's presence in the room  using a built-in Bluetooth\u2122 interface to automatically log in the moderator based on a unique device identifier, for a Bluetooth\u2122 device they are carrying, which had been stored previously within the application.","At block , when the moderator logs into the conference device , the conference and collaboration application  can connect the conference devices  to the audio conference bridge without any user intervention. At decision block , the conference and collaboration application  can determine whether the presentation for display includes more than one file. When only one file is provided, at block , the file can be displayed on the conference devices . Alternatively, if more than one file is provided, the display on the conference device  operated by the moderator can provide a list of files at block . At block , and if more than one file was fetched for the meeting, the moderator can choose which file to display or an order for displaying the files. The conference device  operated by the moderator can provide white boarding capabilities where the presentation can be marked up on the device  and then communicated to other devices  by the conference and collaboration application .","At decision block , the application  can determine which conference devices  are capable of handling video. When the conference devices  are capable of performing a video conference, the conference and collaboration application  can start video conferencing between the conference devices  including those within local and remote rooms  at block . For devices  that do not have video capabilities, or those who do not want to implement video, they can still attend the conference via audio only. The application  can then begin the conference at block . Non-conferencing devices can also be implemented within the system  that can be provided both audio and video.","When the conference is over, the processes can end at block . In one embodiment, the conference and collaboration application  can be offered as a hosted conference and collaboration application  via the Internet . Because the conference and collaboration application  can cause the conference devices  to perform actions, many of the manual steps required with today's solutions can be automated. This can shorten the amount of time required to get a conference session started and eliminates many of the opportunities for error that exist with the current manual entry of information.","The conference and collaboration application  can determine if the remote locations are meeting rooms  that are equipped with conference and collaboration application aware conference devices . If so, the conference and collaboration application  can connect the conference devices  directly without utilizing its audio bridge. In this way, consuming an audio bridge port can be avoided making it available for other conference calls resulting in an overall reduction in the number of bridge ports required.","The conference and collaboration application  can provide additional features and benefits for the system .  is flow chart showing illustrative procedures for determining status information about a conference device  in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Intelligent status information can be provided to the application  as well as other conference devices . The conference device  can pass information to remote participants via its graphical user interface (GUI). The processes can begin at block .","At block , the conference device  can detect wireless devices that are within range. This can be automatically derived based on Bluetooth\u2122 enabled devices that are present around the conference device . When the conference device  detects that a user's device is present, it can include it in a list of attendees who are present in the room . At block , the conference device  can register these devices. In one embodiment, users would register their Bluetooth\u2122 device to the conference device  by walking through a Bluetooth\u2122 device identification process on the conference device .","After generating a list of attendees who are present in the meeting room  that the conference device  is located in, the attendees can be prompted for their name by the conference device  at block . The attendee can pick their device from the list and then enter their name. The identification of the user device along with their name can be passed to the conference and collaboration application  where it would be stored for use in identifying and displaying who is present in a meeting room . At block , the application  can provide information about the attendees to other conference devices . The processes can end at block .","Those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the conference and collaboration application  can be used to manage other information coming out of the conference devices . For example, when conference device microphones have been muted, the information can be provided to the application  and in turn, be passed to other conference devices . By maintaining and distributing this information, indicators to remote participants showing that the users in the conference room  have muted their microphones so they cannot be heard by remote participants is provided. Furthermore, indicators for video successfully being received by the conference device  and currently being displayed to in-room participants can be provided. This information can be provided to the remote parties indicating that the status of their video feed within the meeting room  has been successful. Information about participants in a meeting room  who choose to turn off a particular remote party's video feed from being displayed in the room  can also be provided to other devices . In addition, this can be communicated to that remote party via the conference and collaboration application .","In an organization, multiple meeting rooms  in different geographic offices can be equipped with the conference and collaboration application aware conference devices . In this environment, additional capability can be provided when the conference and collaboration application  recognizes that there are conference devices  that it can control at each end of a conference call. The additional capability that is provided includes uploading of presentation material from the conference and collaboration application  to all conference devices  in the conference call, displaying of a file on the moderator's conference device  causing it to display the same file on the remote conference devices  and providing navigation and editing within a presentation by the moderator of a conference device  causing the same navigation and editing to occur on remote conference devices.","Furthermore, the conference and collaboration application  can allow the moderator to walk through and modify a presentation displayed within the meeting room  as well as display it to remote participants via their remote conference devices . The moderator can pass navigation and editing controls of the presentation to a remote conference device . A remote participant can upload additional presentation files on their conference device  and also cause it to be uploaded to the moderator's conference device  via the conference and collaboration application  for display and editing.","In software implementations, computer software and\/or data is stored on a machine readable medium as part of a computer program product, and is loaded into a computer system or other device or machine via a removable storage drive, hard drive, or communications interface.
