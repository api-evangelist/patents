Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a telephony communication system, and more particularly to a computer network telephony system.","2. Description of Related Art","Conventional network telephone communication is developed on the basis of an IP (Internet Protocol) network. A conventional network telephone system employs a normal fixed-line type of telephone set as a terminal. A service gateway converts audio signals transmitted from the normal telephone into IP packets, which are then transmitted over the IP network. Since the IP packets need not monopolize a particular communication channel, the cost of a long-distance telephone call using the network telephone system is greatly reduced.","However, the service gateway is generally provided by a telecommunication service provider, which charges subscribers for the service gateway. As a result, the cost of a short-distance telephone call using the network telephone system may be higher than the cost of making the same call using a normal telephone line. That is, the low-cost advantages of the network telephone system are generally limited to long-distance calls, and exclude short-distance calls. In addition, the service gateway may have to deal with a vast number of active subscribers during peak periods. At such times, the service gateway is liable to switch to a busy status, in which it is not able to cope with more call requirements. Newly active subscribers are made to wait.","Consequently, what is needed is a network telephony system that can convert the audio signals into the IP packets without the need for a service gateway.","Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a telephony system for reliable and low-cost communication over a network.","In order to fulfill the above-mentioned primary object, the present invention provides a telephony system for reliable and low-cost communication over a network. The telephony system comprises a kernel space, a media express processor operating environment for providing a set of software facilities for task synchronization, and a user space. The kernel space comprises a board support package, a ucLinux module, a digital signal processor interface module, a transfer control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) stack for performing TCP\/IP, and a real-time transport protocol\/real-time transport control protocol (RTP) module. The user space comprises a digital signal processor manager, an H.323\/session initiation protocol (H.323\/SIP) stack for performing H.323 protocol or SIP, a system managing module, an event dispatcher, a line state machine, a call manager, a call logging module, and a directory module for storing, editing, searching and removing contact information of users.","Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","110","120","130","110","111","112","113","114","115","111","1111","1112","1113","1114","112","113","114","115","113","115","113","120"]},"The user space  comprises a UI module , a digital signal processor (DSP) manager  for controlling and monitoring the digital signal processor, an H.323\/session initiation protocol (SIP) stack  for performing an H.323 protocol or SIP, a system managing module , an event dispatcher  for transmitting an event message to a user, a line state machine  for setting up and controlling a call connection over the network, a call manager , a call logging module , a directory module  for storing user contact information, and a debug and diagnosis module  for initializing and monitoring system hardware.","The UI module  provides an access interface for the user, and comprises a keypad driver (not shown) for scanning a keypad and debouncing key presses entered by the user, a display manager (not shown) for controlling display hardware such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), and audio input\/output drivers for controlling audio hardware such as a speaker, a handset and a ringer. The system managing module  comprises a web server  and a command line interface (CLI) , for providing an interface for system configuration, administration and maintenance. A call signaling interface (CSI)  between the H.323\/SIP stack  and the line state machine  offers an application programming interface (API) for initiating and terminating a call connection. The call manager  is responsible for dealing with call events. The call events comprise requests by users to set up call connections over the network, and termination of call connections by users. The call logging module  is for storing call information, such as successful connection information and unsuccessful connection information. The directory module  provides an interface for the system managing module  and the call manager  to store, edit, search and remove the user contact information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","111","112","120","135","140","510","131","134","137","138","139","512","113","514","113","516","113","115","518","115"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["520","115","522","115","113","524","113","526","113","528","113","530","131"]},"While a preferred embodiment and preferred methods of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not by way of limitation.
