Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information search provision apparatus and an information search provision system, and particularly relates to an information search provision apparatus and an information search provision system for providing contents such as texts, images, programs, etc., to be posted on a web page on a network such as Internet, as search results.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, as use of the Internet has progressed, the number of WWW (World Wide web) users, the major application thereof, has rapidly increased and the flow of electronic information has becoming extremely active. Accompanying this, a problem of difficulty for users to retrieve truly desired information has emerged due to a dramatic increase in the amount of information. In order to reduce such problems, various search engines came out on networks such as the Internet.","Technology has been disclosed wherein a web page on which the targeted information was found when users performed searches in the past is estimated, and from the estimated results, points are given to the search keywords as well as the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the web page, and the presenting order in later searches is determined for search results of contents according to the descending order of points.","[Patent Document 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-29943","According to Patent Document 1, the possibility of a web page containing the desired information to be found by the users certainly becomes high. However, when contents posted on a web page is used and if the contents are unreliable contents, it is highly likely that the users suffer from disadvantages. Therefore, it is necessary to create a new information search system to reduce such an inconvenience.","The present invention has been conducted in view of such an objective, and the purpose of which is to provide an information search provision apparatus and an information search provision system for realizing a new information search service to differentiate reliable contents from unreliable contents.","One embodiment of the present inventions relates to an information search provision apparatus. This information search provision apparatus is an information search provision apparatus for acquiring a search conditional statement and providing contents, matching the search conditional statement, as a search result, and the apparatus comprises: a collection unit which collects contents, to be evaluated, posted on a web page via a network at a predetermined timing; and a reliability control unit which increases or decreases a degree of reliability of the contents to be evaluated, depending on whether it is possible for the collection unit to collect the contents to be evaluated.","According to this embodiment, the contents can be evaluated in terms of reliability, depending on whether it is possible to collect the contents to be evaluated. As a result, reliable contents can be separated from unreliable contents, thus realizing a highly convenient information search service for users.","An information search provision apparatus according to this embodiment may further comprise: a search condition receiving unit which acquires a search conditional statement from a user; a search unit which searches contents matching the acquired search conditional statement; and a reliability presenting unit which presents to the user a degree of reliability of the searched contents. The apparatus may further comprise a prediction unit which predicts the degree of reliability of the contents to be evaluated, based on an element contributed to estimating a duration of contents contained in the contents to be evaluated, wherein the reliability presenting unit may present the predicted reliability to the user.","The reliability control unit may gradually increase the degree of reliability of the contents to be evaluated, in a period of time during which the contents to be evaluated is acquired continuously at a predetermined timing by the collection unit. For example, suppose that the contents to be evaluated had been collected by the collection unit after the first timing and thereafter the contents to be evaluated have not been collected by the collection unit since the second timing and thereafter the contents to be evaluated have been collected by the collection unit since the third timing. Then, an increase range controlling unit may control the increase range in a manner that the increase range of reliability of the contents to be evaluated at the third timing is lower than that at the first timing.","An information search provision apparatus according to this embodiment may further comprise a history increase range controlling unit which controls an increase range in the degree of reliability of the contents to be evaluated, according to a history on whether it is possible to collect the contents to be evaluated. The apparatus may further comprise a relationship determining unit which determines the presence or absence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated, wherein the reliability control unit may control in a manner that an increase range of the contents to be evaluated when the presence of a relation is determined by the relationship determining unit is set higher than that when the absence thereof is determined.","Based on whether or not related information indicative of the presence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated is contained in the contents to be evaluated, the relationship determining unit may determine the presence or absence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated. Based on whether or not related information indicative of the presence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated is contained in the highly reliable contents, the relationship determining unit may determine the presence or absence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated.","Another embodiment of the present inventions relates also to an information search provision apparatus.

However, herein, function blocks realized by the collaboration of these are illustrated. Therefore, it is understandable among those in the industry that these function blocks may be realized solely by the hardware or the software, or in various forms depending on the combination of these.","The search condition acquisition unit  acquires a search conditional statement from a user that has been sent by the transmitting unit . Then, if the search conditional statement is in the form of a natural sentence, the search condition acquisition unit  may send the search conditional statement to a keyword extracting unit (not illustrated). Then, the keyword extracting unit will break down the search conditional statement into morphemes (In particular, nouns are extracted as keywords such as \u201cbeef,\u201d \u201cdish,\u201d \u201crecipe,\u201d etc.), using examples from previous search conditional statements, and the search condition acquisition unit  acquires the combination of these keywords as a new search conditional statement.","The search unit  searches contents that match the search conditional statement acquired in the search condition acquisition unit , the reliability degree of the contents, or contents-associated information, from searched information files stored in the search information storage . Then, the search unit  may perform a search using what is known as an index file, or in other words, files containing index words with respect to the contents stored in the search information storage . Accordingly, a speedy search may be accomplished. The search results provision unit  provides a list of information obtained from a search as the search results to the terminal apparatus . Then, the reliability presentation unit  presents, to the terminal apparatus , the reliability degree to be described later of the searched contents. Accordingly, users are able to ascertain the extent of the reliability degree of the contents.","The access unit  accesses the web server  by referring to location information indicating the location of the web server , such as an IP address, contained in access history files in the access history storage  to be described later. As another example, the access unit  may access a web page by referring to the URL or domain name of the web page. The access unit  related to the present embodiment is presumed to access every IP address, including unused IP addresses, contained in the access history files, once a day, such as at 12:00 A.M., following that order. Furthermore, the frequency of accesses by the access unit  may be \u201ctwice a day\u201d or even \u201conce every two days\u201d\u2014not limited to \u201conce a day.\u201d Access by the access unit  may be irregular instead of regular.","The access determining unit  determines whether access by the access unit  to a particular web page was possible. Then, when it is determined that access was not possible, the access determining unit  sets an \u201cx\u201d flag in the column of the present date in the Access History column to be described later, under the IP address. Alternatively, when it is determined that access by the access unit  was possible, the access determining unit  sets an \u201co\u201d flag in the column of the present date in the Access History column to be described later, under the IP address.","The time specifying unit  specifies the time at which access by the access unit  to the web page first became possible, by referring to the access history files. More specifically, the time specifying unit  regards the date when \u201cx\u201d in the past access history until then first switched to \u201co\u201d as the web page provision start date. The time specifying unit  sets the present date in the column of the web page provision start date to be described later, when it is determined that the present date is equivalent to the web page provision start date. When the web page already exists on the network  and an access was made by the access unit  later, the time specifying unit  may determine that the date when an access was made is equivalent to the web page provision start date.","Meanwhile, in recent years, the shortage of IP addresses has been a problem, accompanied by the increase of servers connected to the Internet. According to the present embodiment, unused IP addresses may be specified by regarding IP addresses with an \u201cx\u201d flag for an extended period of time as being unused. Consequently, if the third-party organizations, etc., managing IP addresses provide their unused IP addresses to information providers who wish to acquire other IP addresses, the IP addresses may more effectively be used.","The access history storage  contains access history files including correspondence between a determination by the access determining unit  and the time at which the access unit  has accessed the web page. As many IP addresses as possible existing on a network  are presumed to be held in the access history files. Needless to say, some IP addresses may be retained, or possibly none. The search information storage  contains searched information files containing contents collected by the collecting unit  to be described later, contents-associated information, and degrees of reliability, etc.","The collecting unit  collects the contents to be evaluated, posted on a web page at a predetermined time-herein once a day-when it is determined by the access determining unit  that access to the web page was possible. Furthermore, when an access is made using an IP address or a domain name by the access unit , the collecting unit  may collect the contents to be posted on all the web pages on the web server. In the event of collecting contents, the collecting unit  generates contents-associated information of the collected contents, to be held in the search information storage . If meta tags are stated in the header of the HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) sentence within the contents, such as between <HEAD> and <\/HEAD>, the collecting unit  may follow the contents of an indication described in the area surrounded by the meta tag. In other words, if a registration into the information search provision apparatus  is clearly stated as unnecessary, the collecting unit  does not have to collect information of the page.","The reliability controlling unit  increases or decreases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated at a predetermined time\u2014herein once a day\u2014depending on whether it was possible for the collecting unit  to collect the contents to be evaluated. More specifically, when it was possible to collect the contents to be evaluated from a web page, the reliability controlling unit  increases the reliability degree that has been set for the contents to be evaluated, by a predetermined range of increase. Alternatively, when the collecting unit  was unable to collect the contents to be evaluated from the web page, the reliability degree that has been set for the contents to be evaluated is decreased. Moreover, from the web page provision start date, the reliability controlling unit  starts controlling the increase or decrease of the reliability degree of the contents to be posted on a web page.","Furthermore, the reliability controlling unit  gradually increases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated, during a period of time in which it continues to be possible to collect, by the collecting unit , the contents to be evaluated at a predetermined time. Moreover, in the present embodiment, the reliability degree of contents is increased or decreased, which is essentially the same as increasing or decreasing the reliability degree of the web page posting the contents and the reliability degree of the web server that publishes the web page or of the information provider running the web server. Furthermore, this is essentially the same as increasing or decreasing the reliability degree of various other service-providing servers included in a computer system provided by the information provider running a web server, such as a mail server, an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server, or a news server, etc.","According to the information search provision apparatus  related to the present embodiment, by setting the reliability degree for contents, it becomes possible to present, to users, the extent of the reliability degree of the contents. Consequently, the users are able to easily ascertain the reliability degree of the contents through information search services provided by the information search provision apparatus . For example, when dealing with other corporations, one company may wish to know the background of the other party. On such an occasion, the reliability degree of a web page provided by the corporation may be found through the search results from an information search provision apparatus . When dealing with overseas corporations, this is especially significant, as there are many occasions on which the background of the other party is not known compared to cases with domestic corporations. Furthermore, because the request from a credit agency for a credit check of the other party in the transaction, for investigating the credit of that corporation, may be eliminated, effort and cost may be reduced.","According to the information search provision apparatus  in the present embodiment, as contents are continuously posted on a web page, the reliability degree is increased. Therefore, as a web server  provides a web page stably over a long period of time, a higher reliability degree can be set. Suppose that a web page is, for example, the page for a shopping mall providing Internet shopping services; if the reliability degree of the contents posted on the web page is high, users are able to ascertain that the provider providing the web page has been continuously running its business stably for a long time. On the other hand, if the reliability degree is low, the provider of the web page may have just started business, or it may be highly likely that the dealer unscrupulously continues to move the company's web page.","According to the information search provision apparatus  in the present embodiment, by differentiating reliable contents from unreliable contents, based on the reliability degree to be presented to users, the users may select only contents having a high reliability degree from among the search results. Accordingly, the users are able to use services provided by reputable dealers by selecting contents having a high reliability degree. Consequently, the information search provision apparatus  is capable of accomplishing services that are particularly convenient for users.","A history increase range controlling unit  controls the range of increase in the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated, according to the history of whether it was possible for the collecting unit  to collect the contents to be evaluated. For example, if the contents to be evaluated were first collected by the collecting unit  after \u201cJan. 1, 2004,\u201d and then the contents to be evaluated were not collected by the collecting unit  after \u201cFeb. 1, 2004,\u201d and further, the contents to be evaluated were collected by the collecting unit  after \u201cMar. 1, 2004,\u201d the history increase range controlling unit  controls the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated on \u201cMar. 1, 2004\u201d in a manner in which it is set lower than the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated on \u201cJan. 1, 2004.\u201d Furthermore, the history increase range controlling unit  may, after a certain period of time, lower the range of increase of the reliability degree of contents that have been controlled to the range of increase estimated when it was not low. More specifically, the reduced range of increase as of \u201cMar. 1, 2004\u201d may also be added to the range of increase for the current reliability degree, a year later, on \u201cMar. 1, 2005.\u201d","Accordingly, the range of increase of the reliability degree of a web page from which contents have continued to be collectable for a long period of time becomes greater than the range of increase of the reliability degree of a web page from which the contents have become no longer collectable in the process. Thus, the range of increase for both may be differentiated. Consequently, the importance of continuously providing contents can be more evident.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["180","302","304","306","308","310","312","128","306","304"]},"The IP Address column  includes an IP address for the web server  to be connected to the network .

Such a request is presumed to have been agreed upon in advance with the contents organizer generating the event. The contents organizer generating the event publicizes an event according to the requested method, and transmits the event information to the generated event receiver . For example, in , it is clear that an event generated by company D, which is the contents organizer generating the event (expected number of recruits to be hired is announced to be 500 people), is an event to be publicized without being posted on a web page.","The generated event receiver  receives said generated event information to be held in the requested information storage . Afterwards, the event-monitoring unit  monitors whether the event stored in the requested information storage  has been extracted by the event extracting unit . When an event that is to be publicized without being posted on a web page is extracted, the information source of the contents of the contents organizer is determined to be an independent report. Alternatively, when an event that is to be publicized by being posted only on a web page is extracted, the information source of the contents of the contents organizer is determined to be a web page.","The contents information source controlling unit  stores results monitored by the event-monitoring unit  in the corresponding contents information source  in , held in a search information storage . In addition, values may be entered for the contents information source  according to research based on auditing the contents operators.","The event generation controlling unit  extracts events, and stores data shown in  in the event storage  after identifying the event organizer (the contents organizer who has posted the event) and the contents information source. If there is an identical event in the event storage , the event generation controlling unit  increases the value of corresponding items among items related to the event, including a posting in the event organizer's own contents , an independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents , a web page generated after having been posted in the own contents , and an independent report generated after having been posted in the own contents . If there is no identical event, a record is added as a new event; then, the event  and the event organizer  are entered. Furthermore, a  is entered into either the posting in the event organizer's own contents  or the independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents , whichever corresponds most closely. Normally, for an event, after a certain period of time, the number of appearances are considered to be decreased. Therefore, after a certain period of time following the first time when an event is generated, when the event is extracted, the unit may do nothing.","The update appropriateness determining unit  determines whether an event organizer's own contents are updated appropriately by referring to the event storage .","For instance, when an event shown in  is (September 6, announcement of expected number of recruits to be hired, company W), and the event organizer is \u201ccompany W,\u201d it indicates that the posting in the organizer's own contents are \u201c0\u201d and the independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents are \u201c10.\u201d It is determined as not having been posted in the own contents, even though it had been posted in other contents. In this case, it is determined that an appropriate update has not been made. Likewise, when an event is (February 6, Mr. R. Kagoshima's visit, company A), and the event organizer is \u201ccompany A,\u201d it indicates that the posting in the organizer's own contents are \u201c1,\u201d the independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents are \u201c5,\u201d the web page generated after having been posted in the own contents are \u201c6,\u201d and the independent report generated after having been posted in the own contents are \u201c8.\u201d This can be determined as, even though it had been posted in the own contents, the posting in the own contents were delayed due to the prior posting in the other contents. Furthermore, in this case, it is determined that an appropriate update has not been made. However, for values such as \u201can independent report generated prior to the posting\u201d in the own contents, it may be determined depending on whether the appropriate update has been made, when exceeding the threshold value. An example in which the update has been made appropriately in one in which the event is (February 4, a new release of product X, company A), and the event organizer is (company A). In this case, after having been posted in the own contents, the event was posted in other contents. In this case, it is determined that an appropriate update has not been made. Even in such a case, if \u201cthe independent report generated after having been posted\u201d in the own contents are \u201c0\u201d or extremely low, then it is determined that the event is not important enough to be picked up as contents for an independent report, so as to whether the update is appropriate, it may be treated as being undetermined.","In the present embodiment, a means for determining whether the contents have been appropriately updated is to observe how an event generated by an organizer of the contents to be evaluated proliferates its own contents, which is the contents to be evaluated, or to other contents. When this is accomplished, those who run the contents will try to update information on a timely basis, and moreover contribute to enhancement of the reliability degree of the contents.","Furthermore, in the present embodiment, even if an event requested from the event generation request unit  is independent, both an event that is to be publicized without being posted on a web page and an event that is to be publicized by being posted only on a web page may be requested from the event generation request unit  at the same time.

As an example, a search controlling unit  in  may be installed on a search server, and function blocks other than that may be placed on a collection server side. Needless to say, the configuration in  may be divided at a unit other than this, to distribute to the search server and to the collection server.

When an item that increases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated is contained therein, the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated may be increased. Hereafter, an example of such an item is described. Furthermore, this analysis unit is presumed to internally comprise a source analysis unit that analyzes the source of a timer or a program for acquiring time information.\n\n","In the embodiments, all the contents stored in a search information storage  is the subject to be presented as the search results. As a further different modified example, the information search provision apparatus  may comprise a presentation limit unit that presents only contents having a high reliability degree to users from the search results. There are web pages with malicious contents on the Internet, and by not presenting contents with a low reliability degree to users in the first place, accesses to web pages with a low reliability degree may be reduced among all users.","In Embodiment 7, the reliability degree of own contents and other contents related to each other was controlled at the same time, depending on consistency or lack thereof of an item to be assessed, such as recruitment related information. As a further different modified example, among contents acquired by a contents acquisition unit , the reliability degree of own contents may be raised as more contents posts items to be assessed. For example, suppose the item to be assessed is recruitment information \u201crecruiting new graduates,\u201d the reliability controlling unit  increases the reliability degree of the own contents, as more contents contains \u201crecruiting new graduates.\u201d","As a further different modified example, the information search provision apparatus  related to Embodiment 1 through 8 may further comprise a predicting unit that predicts the reliability degree of contents in future. The predicting unit predicts the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated, based on an element contributed to estimating the duration of contents contained in the contents to be evaluated. The element contributed to estimating the duration of contents is, for example, equivalent to the age of an individual if the contents information provider is an individual, equivalent to the growth rate of the company in case of a corporation. To take an example of the former, if an individual's age is \u201c30,\u201d by \u201c80 years old\u201d the life of a normal being, or in other words the reliability degree of contents 50 years later, is predicted. In the event of prediction, the reliability degree of the contents 50 years later may be predicted, based on conditions under which the range of increase of the current reliability degree is to be maintained. A reliability presentation unit  presents the predicted reliability degree to users. Accordingly, if the reliability degree has been further increased, the users may use the contents more comfortably, not only by knowing the way the reliability degree changed in the past, but also by knowing the reliability degree of contents in the future.","In Embodiment 1, the reliability degree was controlled depending on whether it was possible for a collecting unit  to collect the contents. As a further different modified example, when the contents are not collected by the collecting unit , a confirming unit newly installed on an information search provision apparatus  may make a confirmation in relation to the absence of contents collection with respect to an item to be confirmed. Hereafter, an example of an item to be confirmed is described. Server transfer information or a keyword contained in server failure information is already held in a confirmation item storage (not illustrated).\n\n","When such server transfer information or server failure information is contained in the contents to be evaluated, even if the contents to be evaluated is not collected, a reliability controlling unit  may control the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated so as not to be decreased. Furthermore, then, during a period in which the information is being posted in the contents, an access determining unit  sets an \u201co\u201d flag in an Access History column  of the contents to be evaluated. Moreover, for example, when the absence of the collection of the contents to be evaluated continues for ten days, the confirming unit may grasp the status of the information provider providing the web server, by accessing a database of a third party organization that manages the domain name, a key for which is a domain name of the web server on which the contents to be evaluated is posted. Accordingly, when there is no reason attributed to the responsibility of the information provider but the information provider is still unable to provide the contents, it is possible to save the contents by not decreasing the reliability degree of the contents.","In Embodiment 1 thorough 8, as the search results, the information search provision apparatus  shows a list of contents and the reliability degree of the contents to the user. As a further different modified example, using information such as when a user went to an actual shop or is involved in purchasing or selling by Internet shopping, the information search provision apparatus  acquires an evaluation value related to the reliability degree of the contents from the user to be reflected on the current reliability degree of the contents. In the present modified example, an evaluation value acquisition unit is newly installed on the information search provision apparatus  related to Embodiment 1 through 8.","The evaluation value acquisition unit acquires an evaluation value related to the reliability degree of contents from a user. Through the evaluation value acquisition unit, an evaluation value represented in a ten step evaluation of \u201c\u22125\u201d through \u201c5\u201d from low to high is acquired, the evaluation value is added by a reliability controlling unit  to the current reliability degree of the contents. Accordingly, it is possible to involve an evaluation with respect to the contents from the user when the contents are used. Thus, information search service capable of presenting the reliability degree with further accuracy may be realized.","In Embodiment 2, based on whether related information indicating the presence of a relationship between contents having a high reliability degree and the contents to be evaluated was contained in the contents having a high reliability degree, the presence or absence of the relationship was determined, in the present modified example, based on whether related information indicating the presence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and contents having a high reliability degree is contained in the contents to be evaluated, the presence or absence of the relationship is determined. For instance, a relationship determining unit  determines whether the related information, such as a link from the contents to be evaluated to contents having a high reliability degree is contained in the contents to be evaluated. More specifically, the relationship determining unit  determines whether the URL of the web page posting the contents having a high reliability degree is included in \u201c\u2212\u201d of a tag \u201c<A HREF=\u201c\u2212\u201d> contained in the contents to be evaluated. Then, the URL of the web page posting the contents having a high reliability degree is acquired by the relationship determining unit  from searched information files held in a search information storage .","A reliability controlling unit  controls in a manner in which the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the presence of the relationship is determined by the relationship determining unit  is set higher than the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the absence of the relationship is determined. Accordingly, such as it is possible to differentiate a case in which a link to a web page with a high reliability degree is available in the contents to be evaluated from a case in which a link to a web page with a high reliability degree is not available. If URLs matching with multiple sets of contents having a high reliability degree are found in the contents to be evaluated, the reliability controlling unit  may increase the range of increase of the reliability degree by the number of matching contents. For instance, if there are three matches, then, \u201c3\u201d is further added to the current range of increase of the contents to be evaluated. Accordingly, as more links to contents having a high reliability degree become available in the contents to be evaluated, the range of increase of the reliability degree may be greater.","In Embodiment 2 and Modified Example 9, the presence or absence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and the contents having a high reliability degree has been determined. As a further different modified example, the presence or absence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and contents with a low reliability degree is determined. A method of determining the presence or absence of the relationship by the relationship determining unit  in the present modified example is the same as the method of determining the presence or absence of the relationship in Embodiment 2 and Modified Example 9. In other words, based on whether related information indicating the presence of a relationship between the contents with a low reliability degree and the contents to be evaluated is contained in the contents with a low reliability degree, the relationship determining unit  determines the presence or absence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and the contents with a low reliability degree. Furthermore, based on whether related information indicating the presence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and the contents with a low reliability degree is contained in the contents to be evaluated, the relationship determining unit  may determine the presence or absence of the relationship between the contents to be evaluated and the contents with a low reliability degree.","In case of the former decision, a reliability controlling unit  does not reflect the determination of the presence of absence of the relationship made by the relationship determining unit  to increase or decrease the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated. Since the contents with a low reliability degree are more likely to possess unreliable information, it is significant to ignore the existence of the related information such as links, etc. In case of the later decision, the reliability controlling unit  controls in a manner in which the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the presence of a relationship is determined by the relationship determining unit  is set lower than the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the absence of the relationship is determined. Accordingly, such as it is possible to differentiate a case in which a link to contents with a low reliability degree containing a contents against a public order and moral such as sexual contents or violent contents, etc., is present in the contents to be evaluated from a case in which a link to a web page with a low reliability degree is absent.","In Embodiment 6, from a single aspect, the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated has been increased or decreased, in the present modified example, from multiple aspects, the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated is increased or decreased. Then, an element extracting unit  extracts an element contributing to the increase or decrease in the reliability degree of said contents to be evaluated in terms of each aspect in evaluating the reliability degree. More specifically, the aspect in evaluating the reliability degree is, such as \u201chiring,\u201d from the contents acquired by a related contents acquisition unit  the element extracting unit  extracts an element related to \u201chire,\u201d which contributes to the increase or decrease in the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated.","The aspect in evaluating the reliability degree, such as keywords related to \u201chire\u201d may be held in an aspect storage preliminary (not illustrated). The keywords related to \u201chire\u201d may be, for example, \u201cthe actual number of people hired\u201d or \u201cthe number of people expected to be hired,\u201d etc. Then, on the contents acquired by the related contents acquisition unit , the element extracting unit  designates keywords held in the aspect storage and keywords held in said contribution storage, and conducts a search to acquire matching information. More specifically, when the search is performed with \u201cthe actual number of people hired\u201d and \u201cincrease\u201d as an AND condition, the element extracting unit  may extract an element contributing to increase in the reliability degree from an aspect of \u201chiring.\u201d","The reliability controlling unit  increases or decreases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated, by referring to the element extracted in terms of the each aspect in evaluating the reliability degree. For example, if the contents to be evaluated are provided by \u201cABC company,\u201d and if posted in the acquired contents as \u201cthe number of people hired by ABC company increased,\u201d then from an aspect of \u201chire\u201d an element \u201cincrease\u201d is extracted by the element extracting unit , and the element is classified into said a first group by a classifying unit . Then, a reliability controlling unit  increases the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated from an aspect in evaluating the reliability degree of \u201chire\u201d. Furthermore, the reliability controlling unit  may set the reliability degree in terms of each aspect to increase or decrease the reliability degree of the each aspect, based on the result extracted by the element extracting unit  in terms of each aspect in evaluating the reliability degree. Then, the reliability controlling unit  may sum each reliability degree respectively obtained in terms of each aspect, as the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated. According to the present modified example, the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated may be evaluated from various aspects, thus increasing the accuracy of the reliability degree.","According to the present invention, an information search service that is highly convenient to users may be provided."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings which are meant to be exemplary, not limiting, and wherein like elements are numbered alike in several Figures, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 39"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 42"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
