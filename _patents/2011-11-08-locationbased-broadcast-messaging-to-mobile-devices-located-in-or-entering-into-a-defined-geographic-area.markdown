title: Location-based broadcast messaging to mobile devices located in or entering into a defined geographic area
abstract: For a location-based broadcast messaging service, a broadcast server receives a broadcast request from a business application server. The broadcast request includes a message, at least one identifier for target mobile devices, and an identifier for a location. The broadcast server sends a location query including the identifier for the location to location agents associated with the target mobile devices. In response to receiving the location query, each location agent determines whether the location of the associated mobile device is within or otherwise satisfies a requirement related to the identified location. If the location of the device is within the identified location or satisfies the requirement, the location agent sends a query response to the broadcast server and receives, from the broadcast server, the message included in the broadcast request. The broadcast request can include a time-period identifier, such that the location agent determines the device location during the time-period.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present subject matter relates to techniques and equipment for a location-based broadcasting messaging service for broadcasting messages to mobile devices located in or entering into a defined geographic area.","In recent years, mobile communication services have expanded and increased in popularity around the world. Many advanced networks offer wireless mobile communication service for voice calls, mobile messaging services (e.g. text and\/or multimedia) and data communications.","Broadcast messaging services, enabling the sending of mobile messaging service messages to large numbers of mobile devices, are increasingly used to send notifications to large numbers of subscribers. Examples of such notifications include advertisements, notices relating to users' accounts, and alerts. For example, subscribers to an alert system of a public transportation authority may receive mobile messaging service messages related to service disruptions for a particular subway line. Similarly, subscribers to a campus security alert system may receive mobile messaging service messages related to campus security alerts. In both cases, each mobile messaging service message is broadcast instantly to all subscribers of a particular messaging service. As a result, users subscribing to multiple mobile messaging service alert services are likely to be overwhelmed by large numbers of alerts on their mobile devices. Also, users who are not in the vicinity of a location associated with the alert, but who still subscribe to the alert service, will still receive all notifications even though the alerts are not currently relevant to them. A need therefore exists for a system that selectively provides to a user broadcast messages that that are relevant to the user, for example based on the user's location, profile and sender filtering criteria to send the messages to the mobile users.","An alert system for broadcasting mobile messaging service messages alerting users about imminent threats to life or property has been discussed for development. The proposed alert system is configured to send alert messages to all mobile devices located within an extended geographical area, such as the coverage area of multiple mobile base stations, and cannot limit the geographical area to a finer granularity. This alert system further is configured to send the alert message to all mobile devices located within the area, and therefore does not allow broadcast messages to be provided only to selected mobile devices. In order to ensure that mobile devices having entered an area have received the alert message, the alert system requires that the alert re-broadcast at regular intervals to all mobile devices located within the area. The inability to send the message to particular devices results in the messages being sent to all devices, thereby creating excessive network traffic and negatively affecting battery life on the devices.","A need therefore exists for a messaging service that allows broadcast messages to be sent only to devices located within geographical areas defined with a high-level of granularity. A need exists for a messaging service to send broadcast messages to selected mobile devices. A need further exists for a messaging service that identifies mobile devices having entered a geographical area, in order to send a broadcast message only to those mobile devices having entered the geographical area.","The teachings herein alleviate one or more of the above noted problems by providing location-based broadcast messaging services to mobile devices. The examples in the drawings and detailed description enable mobile devices that are located within or otherwise satisfy a geographic location condition to receive a broadcast message.","A system for transmitting a message to mobile devices through a mobile traffic network includes a broadcast server and a privacy server. The broadcast server is in communication with a business application server through a communication network, and receives from the business application server a broadcast request including a message to be broadcast and one or more identifiers for a plurality of mobile devices. The privacy server is in communication with the broadcast server, and generates a list of confirmed mobile device identifiers in response to receiving a list of identifiers of mobile devices. In response to receiving the broadcast request, the broadcast server sends to the privacy server a list of identifiers of mobile devices corresponding to the one or more identifiers, and receives a list of confirmed identifiers from the privacy server. The broadcast server then sends a query to a location agent of each of the mobile devices identified in the list of confirmed identifiers received from the privacy server, receives a response to the query from at least one of the location agents, and transmits the broadcast message from the broadcast request to the mobile device associated with each location agent from which the broadcast server received a response to the query.","In one example, the broadcast request received from the business application server includes an identifier for a location, and the query sent to the location agent of each of the mobile devices includes the identifier for the location. In the example, the broadcast server is configured to receive the query response from at least one location agent upon a location of the mobile device associated with the at least one location agent satisfying a requirement related to the location identified in the broadcast request.","In accordance with a method of transmitting a message to mobile devices, the message is received with an identifier for a geographic location from a business application server intending to send the message. A list of identifiers for target mobile devices is also received. Using the list of identifiers for target mobile devices, a location query is sent to a location agent associated with each target mobile device, the location query including the identifier for the geographic location. Responses to the location query are received indicating which of the target mobile devices satisfy a requirement related to the identified geographic location, and the message received from the business application server is transmitted through a mobile traffic network to target mobile devices indicated as satisfying the requirement related to the identified geographic location. In one example, the method includes steps of receiving one or more identifiers for mobile devices from the business application server intending to send the message, and sending to a privacy server a list of mobile device identifiers corresponding to the one or more identifiers, such that the received list of identifiers for target mobile devices includes is received from the privacy server and includes a list of identifiers for mobile devices confirmed as having opted in to a broadcast messaging service, and such that the location query is sent to a location agent associated with each confirmed target mobile device included in the list received from the privacy server. In other examples, an indication of a time-period associated with the message is further received from the business application server, and the location query sent to location agents includes the indication of the time-period.","A location agent is disclosed including a non-transitory storage device, and programming in the storage device for execution by a processor. The programming configures the location agent to perform functions to receive a location query identifying a geographic location through a mobile traffic network from a broadcast server, determine a current location of a mobile device, and upon determining that the current location of the mobile device satisfies a requirement related to the identified geographic location, send a response message through the mobile traffic network to the broadcast server indicating that the mobile device satisfies the requirement related to the identified geographic location.","Additional advantages and novel features will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following and the accompanying drawings or may be learned by production or operation of the examples. The advantages of the present teachings may be realized and attained by practice or use of various aspects of the methodologies, instrumentalities and combinations set forth in the detailed examples discussed below.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth by way of examples in order to provide a thorough understanding of the relevant teachings. However, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present teachings may be practiced without such details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and\/or circuitry have been described at a relatively high-level, without detail, in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present teachings.","The various methods and systems disclosed herein relate to broadcast messaging services that provide location-based messaging to potentially large numbers of mobile devices. In particular, the service enables a user, such as a business, corporate, or other enterprise customer, to send a mobile messaging service message to selected mobile devices located within, entering into, and\/or exiting from a particular geographical location (\u201cgeo-location\u201d) during a particular period of time. The user provides message contents, a list of identifiers for the target mobile devices (e.g., a list of target mobile device numbers (MDNs) identifying the devices), and an identification of the geo-location to a carrier-operated broadcast messaging server. The broadcast messaging server confirms that target mobile devices have opted into the messaging service.","The broadcast messaging server sends a location query to a location agent associated with each confirmed target mobile device. The location query includes an identifier for the geo-location. The location agent associated with each confirmed target mobile device determines whether the corresponding mobile device is located within or otherwise satisfies one or more requirements relating to the geo-location. Based on determining that the corresponding mobile device is located within the geo-location (or satisfies another requirement relating to the geo-location), the location agent sends a response message to the broadcast messaging server. Alternatively, based on determining that the mobile device enters the geo-location (or satisfies the requirement relating to the geo-location) during the particular period of time, the location agent sends a response message to the broadcast messaging server. Upon receiving the response message, the broadcast messaging server sends the broadcast message contents to the mobile device. The methods and systems are described in more detail with references to the accompanying drawings below.","A broadcast message, as defined herein, is a message having a common message content that is sent (or is intended to be sent) to a plurality of target devices, such as to a plurality of identified target devices meeting certain requirements. The broadcast message content can be sent to some or all of the target devices at the same time or at different times. The target devices can be identified in a list of target devices associated with the broadcast message. The requirements can include one or more location and\/or time requirements. In one example, the broadcast message content is sent to all identified target devices that satisfy a location requirement at the beginning of a time-period requirement, and sent to all remaining identified target devices that satisfy the location requirement at a later time during the time-period.","The location-based broadcast messaging services can be used in a variety of contexts. For example, a hospital may need to page doctors located within a 30-mile radius of an emergency. The hospital may thus provide a message requesting emergency help from doctors, a list of doctors' mobile device numbers, and a geo-location defining a 30-mile radius around the emergency, in order to recruit doctors located near the emergency. Doctors located further from the emergency, and thus not available to respond to the emergency, would not be paged. In another example, a school may use the service to notify students located on or near school grounds of a security threat at the school. A traffic command center may advise drivers of its subscription base who are entering a city-center of a traffic shutdown in the city center. A store can provide a promotion coupon to those subscribers of its location-based broadcast messaging service who are located near one of its stores (or come to be located near one of its stores during the promotion period). A construction company may remotely disable heavy machinery equipped with mobile device receivers during a curfew period (e.g., 6 pm to 6 am), and\/or based on location (e.g., to disable machinery that is not located in a worksite or a storage yard). The location-based broadcast messaging service can also be used in other applications requiring location-based and\/or time-based messaging to potentially large numbers of mobile devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["100","100","103","103","103","103","100","100","103","103","103","103","101","105","101","113","113","113"],"i":["a","b ","a","b ","a","b ","a ","b","a","b "]},"Upon receiving the broadcast request, the broadcast server  confirms the privacy status of target mobile devices , identified in the broadcast request. In detail, the broadcast server  sends the list of identifiers for potential target mobile devices to a privacy server , and receives from the privacy server  a list of confirmed mobile device identifiers identifying those target mobile devices that have opted-in to the location-based broadcast messaging service.","Two different types of mobile devices and , and associated location agents and (referred to generally as location agent(s) ), can be used to receive broadcast messaging services. Each type of mobile device , and location agent , is shown in a respective one of  for ease of description and illustration. However various types of mobile devices , and locations agents , can be used together in either of systems and . In general, the location agent is an application that is installed on and runs on the mobile device . However, in some instances, the location agent does not run on the mobile device . For example, the location agent may not run on the mobile device if the mobile device does not have the ability or processing power to run a location agent application, if the mobile device does not have the ability to determine its location or run location-based applications, or if the mobile device operates on a different mobile carrier's network. In such instances, the location agent for the mobile device runs on a location server  associated with the mobile device . A location server  can be associated with multiple mobile devices , and run multiple location agents such that each location agent is associated with an associated one of the multiple mobile devices . In general, a location agent  is associated with a single mobile device . However, in some examples, a location agent  may be associated with multiple mobile devices .","Regardless of whether the location agent , runs on the mobile device or on a location server , the broadcast server  sends a geo-location query to a location server  associated with each confirmed mobile device , . In turn, the location server  forwards the geo-location query to the location agent , associated with each confirmed mobile device , . In one example, the location server  forwards the geo-location query to the location agent running on mobile device , while in another example, location server  forwards the query to the location agent running on location server . The geo-location query includes the geo-location  information. Each location agent , determines whether the associated mobile device , is located within or otherwise satisfies one or more requirements relating to the area identified by the geo-location  during the time-period identified by the geo-location. For example, the requirements can specify determining whether the associated mobile device , enters or exits the area identified by the geo-location  during a define time-period. If so, the location agent , sends a geo-location response message to the broadcast server  and, in response to the geo-location response, the broadcast server  sends the broadcast message contents to the corresponding mobile device , ","Alternatively, if the location agent , determines that the associated mobile device , does not currently satisfy requirements relating to the area identified by the geo-location , the location agent monitors the mobile device's location for the duration of the time-period identified by the geo-location. If at any time during the time-period, the mobile device , is determined to satisfy requirements relating to the geo-location area, e.g. that the mobile device , is located within or is entering the area of the geo-location, the location agent , sends a geo-location response message to the broadcast server , and the mobile device , receives the broadcast message contents from the broadcast server .","The location agent  may determine the location of an associated mobile device  in one of several ways. A location agent , such as location agent , may communicate directly with GPS or location-determining circuitry or software running on the mobile device  in order to determine the location of the mobile device , and\/or determine whether the mobile device satisfies a requirement related to the geo-location . A location agent , such as location agent , may alternatively or additionally communicate with one or more mobile positioning server(s)  to determine the location of the mobile device . The mobile positioning server(s)  may themselves be in communication with the mobile device , or with one or more servers of a mobile carrier network. In one example, the mobile positioning server(s)  may include a home location register (HLR) for identifying a mobile switching center (MSC) currently serving the mobile device , and include the serving MSC for acquiring an identification of a cell (cell ID) the mobile device  is located in. In such an example, the location agent  or location server  may be configured to translate the cell ID received from the serving MSC into geographic location coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), in order to determine the location of the mobile device .","In some instances, the location agent  may store records of one or more recent locations of the mobile device  in a cache memory, each record including a time-stamp of the time at which the mobile device  was at the location. In response to receiving a geo-location query, the location agent  may use the cached record of the mobile device location instead of determining a current or updated location of the mobile device. In particular, the location agent  may use the cached record if the time-stamp associated with the record is recent (e.g., the different between a current time and the time-stamp is less than a predetermined time-period).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["113","113","113","113","113","113","113","113","113","113","113","113","113","113","113","113"],"i":["a ","b","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a","a ","a","a","a","a "]},"In general, the geo-location  can have an associated time-period , which can be indicated as part of geo-location data. The time-period data defines one or more time intervals during which the geo-location is active and mobile devices should be provided with the broadcast message. The time-period can include a single time, such that mobile devices located within or otherwise satisfying a requirement relating to the geo-location at that time are provided with the broadcast message. The time-period can include a time-interval (specified by data including at least one start-time and one end-time), such that mobile devices satisfying one or more requirements relating to the geo-location at the beginning of the time-period are provided with the broadcast message, and any mobile devices satisfying any of the requirements relating to the geo-location during the time-period are provided with the broadcast message. The time-period data can indicate a particular day of (or interval during) the week, day of (or interval during) the month, or a date (or date interval) in addition to the time information. The time-period can be a recurring time-period (e.g., every day from 7 pm to 5 am). The time-period data can also include non-time identifiers such as \u201cnow\u201d to indicate that the message should be sent at a current time (or as soon as possible after the current time), or delay identifiers such as \u201cin 60 minutes\u201d to indicate the message should be sent sixty minutes after the current time. Non-time identifiers may be accompanied by a time-stamp for the time at which the time-period data was generated, so as to measure the time-period identified by the non-time identifier with respect to the time-stamp. If no time-period information is provided, a default time-period can be used. The default time-period may cause the message to be sent out a single time, e.g., at a current time (or as soon as possible after the current time). The time-period can be composed of multiple times and\/or time-intervals (e.g., from 6 am to 9 am and from 5 pm to 8 pm). Different time-periods can also be associated with different areas identified by the geo-location, for example in order to provide a location-based broadcast messaging notifications to mobile devices located in a first location between 9 am and 12 pm and to mobile devices located in a second location between 11 am and 2 pm. A mobile device is found to satisfy a requirement relating to geo-location  if the mobile device location satisfies the requirement relating to a geo-location area criterion during a time-period set out by the geo-location time-period ","The location-based aspect of the broadcast messaging service relies on determining a current location of each of the mobile devices . The determination of mobile device location can be performed using any one or more of a global positioning system (GPS); an assisted GPS positioning system; triangulation based on positions of and signals received from mobile base station(s); hybrid approaches based on a combination of GPS and triangulation; and\/or any other appropriate methods for determining the location of the mobile device . In order to determine the mobile device location , the mobile device can include a GPS receiver and\/or processor, for receiving signals from GPS satellites and\/or determining a device location based on the received signals. The mobile device can additionally or alternatively include circuitry for performing triangulation, such as circuitry for measuring signal strength and\/or signal delay from one or more base stations. Systems and circuitry for determining mobile device position can also be included in base stations and\/or servers that are in communication with the mobile devices , such as location server  or mobile positioning server(s) . In one example, location server  includes circuitry for performing triangulation to determine the location of a mobile device, such as circuitry for measuring signal strength and\/or signal delay of signals received from a mobile device at one or more base stations. In another example, location server  receives device position information from mobile devices associated with the location server . In yet another example, mobile positioning server(s)  include a HLR for identifying a MSC currently serving a mobile device , and a serving MSC server for acquiring an identification of a cell (cell ID) the mobile device  is located in. In such an example, the location server  or location agent  may be configured to translate the cell ID received from the serving MSC into geographic location coordinates (such as longitude and latitude), in order to determine the location of the mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1"],"b":["201","105","101","201","201","113","201","201","201"],"i":["a","c ","a "]},"The message content can additionally or alternatively include other appropriate types of content that should be provided to the mobile device. In one such further example, the message content may include control data to deactivate or disable machinery located within the area corresponding to the geo-location information. A piece of machinery having an ignition system controlled by a mobile device can thus have its ignition system disabled by the mobile device in response to the mobile device receiving broadcast message content control data to disable the ignition system. As a result, an owner of the machinery can ensure that the machinery is automatically disabled when not located within a work site (e.g., if the machinery is stolen, or if the machinery is in transit to\/from a worksite). In another example, the message content includes a command to send a notification or message to the request initiator if a device crosses a geo-location boundary. As such, a mobile device controlling the ignition system of a piece of machinery can receive a command to send a notification or message from the mobile device to an owner of the machinery (or other request initiator). The notification of message may include device location information and\/or device status information (enabled\/disabled).","The geo-location  includes an identification of an area and information indicating an applicable time-period for determining one or more requirements relating to the geo-location  associated with the broadcast request. The broadcast request can either include the full area and time-period information, or include one or more identifier(s) for a pre-defined area, requirement related to an area, or time-period. The area information can thus include identifier(s) for, e.g., a pre-defined area identified as \u201cGreater San Francisco metro area\u201d and corresponding to an area encompassing the metropolitan area of the city of San Francisco and surrounding cities. The time-period information can include identifiers for, e.g., a pre-defined time-period identified as \u201cMorning rush-hour\u201d and corresponding to a time-period for a current (or subsequent) rush-hour period such as a period from 5 am to 9:30 am on a weekday. The pre-defined identifiers and associated areas and\/or time-period indicators are generally defined before the broadcast request  is received by the broadcast server . The identifiers can be defined by an administrator of the broadcast server , by an administrator or user of the business application server , or by another appropriate person or entity. Once they are defined, the pre-defined identifiers and associated areas and\/or time-period indicators can be stored on the broadcast server , or on a server in communication with the broadcast server . When a broadcast request including an identifier is received in the broadcast server , the area, requirements related to the area, and\/or time-period associated with the identifier are retrieved from storage for use in broadcasting the message content.","The one or more identifiers for mobile devices is a list of mobile device identifiers (IDs), or an identifier for a list of mobile device identifiers. The list of mobile device IDs includes identifiers for at least two target mobile devices that should be provided with the message content information if the mobile devices satisfy the geo-location location and time requirements. Generally, the list of mobile device IDs includes a list of mobile directory numbers (MDNs), mobile identification numbers (MINs), international mobile subscriber identity numbers (IMSIs), or other identifiers for uniquely identifying target mobile devices. The one or more identifiers can alternatively be an identifier for a pre-defined distribution list of target mobile devices that is stored on or accessible from the broadcast server . For example, a \u201cdevice IDs\u201d identifier of the broadcast request  can be an identifier for a distribution list (e.g., \u201cXYZ Corporation employee broadcast distribution list\u201d for a corporation; \u201cfrequent shopper list\u201d for a particular merchant; or the like), such that the broadcast server  can retrieve from a storage a list of target mobile device identifiers corresponding to the identifier. The pre-defined distribution list can be provided in advance by a user of the system, by a system administrator, or any other appropriate entity.","In some examples, broadcast request  can include additional information or components. Broadcast request  can include an indicator of broadcast message priority. The indicator of broadcast message priority can be used by the broadcast server , the location server , and\/or the location agent  to determine whether any message should be preferentially or more promptly processed by the system. For example, a broadcast message having a time-sensitive content may be given a high priority, to ensure that the message is preferentially processed by the server(s), agent(s), and mobile device(s) such that the message may be provided to mobile devices promptly or with minimum delay. A broadcast message having high priority can include a public safety message, such as a message reporting an imminent threat to safety or security. A broadcast message having a lower priority, in contrast, may be processed by the server(s), agent(s), and mobile device(s) only after all high priority message have been processed. The indicator of message priority may be provided to the broadcast and location servers to ensure that the servers preferentially process high-priority messages. The indicator of message priority may also be included with the geo-location information  provided to location agents , such that the agents preferentially process high-priority messages. In situations in which the location of a mobile device is periodically, the indicator of message priority may also be used to determine the time-period on which monitoring is performed. In one example, a location agent  may frequently monitor the location of a mobile device  when a high-priority geo-location query is received (e.g., by monitoring the location of the mobile device  every minute, or other short time-period), while the location agent  may monitor the location less frequently when a lower priority query is received (e.g., by monitoring the location every 10 minutes, or other longer time-period).","The communications and signaling between systems involved in providing the location-based broadcast messaging services will now be described in more detail with reference to .  show signal flow timing diagrams showing the communication messages exchanged between business application server , broadcast server , location server , location agent , and mobile device .","The location-based broadcast messaging service is initiated by the business application server  at step , when the business application server  sends a broadcast request  to the broadcast server . The broadcast request  includes broadcast request message content , geo-location , and one or more identifiers for target mobile devices. The broadcast request  can be sent to the broadcast server  as a mobile messaging service message, as a packet-data message, or by any other appropriate means. The broadcast request  can be generated and provided to the broadcast server  using an application programming interface (API) running on business application server , using a web-portal provided by a network carrier or administrator of the broadcast server , or using other appropriate means.","Upon receiving the broadcast request , broadcast server  proceeds at step  to confirm the target mobile devices identified in the broadcast request . As described in relation to , the target mobile devices are identified by one or more identifiers included in the broadcast request, the one or more identifiers including a list of mobile device IDs or an identifier for a list of mobile device identifiers. The confirmation can include one or more of confirming whether the target mobile devices corresponding to the mobile device identifiers of the list are registered for the location-based broadcast messaging services, run or have associated location agents for providing the messaging service, have accepted or opted-in to a privacy policy associated with the messaging service, and\/or have accepted or opted-in to receiving broadcast messages from the request initiator. In general, the confirmation of target mobile devices or their identifiers includes the broadcast server  sending to the privacy server  the list of target mobile device IDs identified in the broadcast request, and receiving in response a list of confirmed mobile device IDs identifying, among the target mobile device IDs, those mobile device IDs corresponding to mobile devices that have opted-in to the privacy policy associated with the messaging server. The confirmation performed at step  is described in further detail in relation to  below. Upon completing the confirmation, the broadcast server  has access to a list of confirmed mobile device IDs. In one example, however, the broadcast server  and the privacy server  may be a single server, and all of the operations described herein as being performed by the privacy server  may instead by performed by the broadcast server  itself. In the example, broadcast server  may maintain a local database in memory storing mobile device identifiers of mobile devices having accepted or opted-in to the location-based broadcast messaging service and to the associated privacy policy.","Following the confirmation of target device IDs, the broadcast server  sends a geo-location query message via the location server  to the location agent  of each mobile device included in the list of confirmed mobile device IDs (steps , ). The geo-location query is generally (but not necessarily) sent only to the location agents  of devices included in the confirmed list. The geo-location query message includes the geo-location information, including the identifiers for the area and the associated time-period characterizing the geo-location received by the broadcast server  in the broadcast request at step . The geo-location query message also includes a unique identifier associated with the broadcast request. In the case of mobile devices that run their own associated location agents , the geo-location query ,  is transmitted to the location agent running on the mobile device . In the case of mobiles devices that do not run their own associated location agents , the geo-location query ,  is transmitted to the location agent associated with the mobile device and running on a corresponding location server .","In response to receiving the geo-location query, each location agent  retrieves the time-period information contained in the geo-location query . If the time-period spans or includes the current time, the location agent  determines the current location of the associated mobile device (step ) and compares the current location to the geo-location area information. If the location agent determines that the mobile device is within or otherwise satisfies a requirement related to the geo-location area, the location agent immediately sends a geo-location response message to the broadcast server via the location server (steps , ). The geo-location response message generally includes an identifier for the particular location agent  and\/or for the particular mobile device  associated with the location agent , as well as the identifier included in the geo-location query message and associated with the broadcast request. The geo-location response message optionally includes location information identifying the current location of the mobile device  associated with the location agent . If the location agent  determines that the mobile device  is not currently within or does not currently satisfy a requirement related to the geo-location area, the location agent stores the geo-location query information and monitors the location of the mobile device for the remaining duration of the time-period (step ) associated with the geo-location. If the mobile device  is determined to be within or to satisfy a requirement related to the geo-location area at any time during the time-period, the geo-location response message is generated and sent to the location server via the broadcast server (steps , ).","In the location determination and monitoring (steps , ) is performed by the location agent . In embodiments in which the location agent runs on the mobile device , the location determination and monitoring can include communicating with a GPS or locator module of the mobile device in order to obtain location information. In embodiments in which the location agent runs on a location server , however, the location determination and monitoring may rely on one or more mobile positioning server(s). In an example shown in , the location agent sends a HLR query message (step ) to a home location register (HLR) in order to determine a current location of the mobile device . The HLR query can identify the mobile device whose location is requested, for example by including an identifier such as a MDN, MIN, or the like. In response to the HLR query, the HLR may send a response message (step ) identifying a mobile switching center (MSC) currently serving the mobile device . The location agent may then send a MSC query message (step ) identifying the mobile device to the serving MSC and, in response to the query, receive from a MSC response message (step ) including a cell ID identifying a carrier network cell including the mobile device , or identifying a base transceiver station (BTS) having the mobile device in range. The location agent may then use the received cell ID information to determine the location of the mobile device, for example by calculating approximate longitude and latitude coordinates for the device based on the cell ID information. The location agent may perform steps - to determine the location of the mobile device (e.g., during step ), and\/or may periodically repeat the steps when monitoring the location of the mobile device (e.g., during step ).","In response to receiving the geo-location query (step ), each location agent  may determine whether a requirement relating to the geo-location  specifies determining whether an associated mobile device  enters or exits the area identified by the geo-location. If no such requirement is specified, the location agent  may only need to determine and\/or monitor a current location of the associated mobile device  at steps  and . However, if such a requirement is specified, the location agent may need to determine and\/or monitor both a previous and a current location of the associated mobile device . To this extent, the location agent  may determine a location of the mobile device, for example at the beginning of a time-period associated with the requirement, and may store the determined location as a \u201cprevious\u201d location in a memory of the mobile device. The location agent  may store further locations as \u201cprevious\u201d locations in the memory, and use a determined current location of the mobile device as well as one or more previous locations of the mobile device to determine whether the requirement relating to the geo-location is satisfied at any time during a time-period associated with the requirement. Alternatively, the location agent  may monitor a location of the mobile device during the time-period, and may cause a \u201cprevious\u201d location flag to be set in a memory of the location agent when the location agent determines that the mobile device is outside of the area identified by the geo-location and the requirement is one for entering the area (or, conversely, the flag is set when the mobile device is inside of the area and the requirement is one for exiting the area). After the \u201cprevious\u201d location flag is set, the location agent may determine that the requirement is satisfied when the location agent determines that the mobile device is within the area identified by the geo-location and the flag is set (or, conversely, when the mobile device is determined to the outside of the area, if the requirement is one for exiting the area). The \u201cprevious\u201d location flag is thus set based on a determination of a previous location of the mobile device, and serves as an identifier for a previous location of the mobile device.","In general, when the mobile device  is first determined to be within or to satisfy a requirement related to the geo-location, or when the geo-location time-period expires (whichever occurs first), the location agent  erases the geo-location query information from memory and stops monitoring the location of the mobile device  with respect to the geo-location query. As such, the mobile device  receives the broadcast message associated with the geo-location query at most a single time. In an alternate example, the location agent  flags the geo-location query information as satisfied in the memory when the geo-location requirement is satisfied. The flag may indicate a time or location of the mobile device , or an area the mobile device  was within, at the time the geo-location requirement is satisfied. The location agent  can then use the flag information to determine when and\/or where the broadcast message was previously provided to the mobile device, and can optionally re-deliver the message to the same mobile device at a different time or location. For example, the message may be re-delivered at later time(s) if a time-period associated with the geo-location is long (e.g., exceeds several hours, days, or weeks) or includes multiple intervals, or re-delivered in different location(s) if an area associated with the geo-location includes an expansive area or multiple separate areas. In the example, the mobile device  may receive the broadcast message associated with the geo-location query multiple times.","If the time-period associated with the geo-location does not span or include the current time, and the time-period includes a future time, the location agent  stores the geo-location query information. The location agent  then monitors the location of the mobile device with respect to the stored geo-location boundary information for the duration of the time-period (step ), as described above. A mobile device may store multiple geo-location queries, and\/or may monitor the device's location with respect to multiple geo-location queries at the same time. The monitoring of the device's location can be performed continuously. However, the location monitoring is more commonly performed on a periodic interval (e.g., at 1 minute intervals). The periodic interval can be the same for all location agents or mobile devices, can be agent or device dependent (e.g., location agents running on mobile devices may monitor on a short interval, such as a 1 minute interval, while agents running on location servers may monitor on longer intervals, such as a 5 minute interval), or can be dependent on the geo-location query and\/or broadcast request. For example, a geo-location query or a broadcast request may specify a monitoring interval, or specify a message type or alert level used by the broadcast server or the location agent in setting the monitoring interval.","As described in the previous paragraphs, if the mobile device is determined to be within or to satisfy a requirement related to the geo-location at any time during the associated time-period, the geo-location response message is generated by the location agent  and transmitted to the broadcast server  (steps , ). The geo-location response message is thus generally (but not necessarily) only sent during the time-period associated with the geo-location. The geo-location response message generally includes an identifier for the mobile device and\/or for the associated location agent , as well as the identifier associated with the broadcast request and included as part of the geo-location query message. In response to receiving a geo-location response message from a location agent , the broadcast server  retrieves the message content associated with the broadcast request identified in the response message (step ) and transmits the message content to the mobile device  identified in or associated with the location agent identified in the response message (step ). The message content is generally transmitted to the mobile device  as a mobile messaging service message, or as another appropriate type of message or transmission based on the type of message content included in the broadcast request.","While steps  through  are described above with respect to an exemplary location agent , the steps are performed on or with respect to the location agents of all mobile devices included in the list of confirmed mobile device IDs obtained at step .","The broadcast server  optionally keeps track of mobile devices that a broadcast message is sent to in a \u201cSent-to\u201d list. At the time of sending the broadcast message (step ), the broadcast server  can update the \u201cSent-to\u201d list (step ) to include the mobile device identifier of the mobile device  the broadcast message content was sent to. In situations in which the geo-location response message includes an identifier for the location of a mobile device, the \u201cSent-to\u201d list can also store the identifier for the location of the mobile device.","The broadcast server  provides the business application server  having made the broadcast request with delivery status information of the broadcast message at step . The delivery status information can be sent immediately following the sending of the broadcast message contents to a mobile device (step ) and can identify the mobile device the broadcast message contents were sent to. Alternatively, the delivery status information can be sent to the business application server  on a periodic basis (e.g., every 30 minutes) or after the end of the time-period associated with the broadcast request, and can either identify all mobile devices that the broadcast message was sent to (i.e., include the entire \u201cSent-to\u201d list) or identify all mobile devices that the broadcast message was sent to since the last delivery status information message was sent.","In general, the geo-location response message is sent to the broadcast server via the location server at steps ,  only if the mobile device is determined to be within, or to satisfy a requirement related to, the geo-location. In another example however, the location agent may be configured to provide a response message to the broadcast server even if the mobile device does not satisfy any requirement. The response message may include status information for the mobile device, such as an indication of whether the mobile device is powered on, whether the location agent can determine the location of the mobile device, or the like. In such an example, the broadcast server may provide device status information to the business application server for all identified mobile devices as part of the delivery status message.","Various steps may be added to, removed from, reordered, or substituted from the timing diagram of . For example, step  may be accompanied or replaced by a step involving the broadcast server sending a message to a device or server other than the mobile device associated with the mobile agent involved in steps -. In one instance, step  may involve sending a message to a server to alert the server that the mobile device associated with the mobile agent involved in steps - has satisfied the geo-location. For example, step  may involve sending a message to a machinery dispatching center to alert the machinery dispatching center that a mobile device installed in a piece of heavy machinery has exited a geo-location defining a secure boundary around a construction site. In response to the alert, an operator of the machinery dispatching center may verify whether the piece of heavy machinery is permitted to cross the secure boundary, and contact law enforcement officials if needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 3","FIG. 4A","FIG. 3"],"b":["101","111","303","111","101","301","101","101"]},"Following receipt of a list of target mobile device identifiers (or an identifier for a list of mobile device identifiers), the broadcast server  sends a privacy status query to the privacy server  at step . The privacy status query includes the received list of target mobile device identifiers, or the list of target mobile device identifiers associated with the received identifier. In response to receiving the query, the privacy server confirms the device identifiers by determining, for each listed device identifier, whether the associated mobile device has accepted or opted-in to the privacy policy associated with the location-based broadcast messaging service (step ). To this end, the privacy server maintains a database in memory storing mobile device identifiers of mobile devices having accepted or opted-in to the location-based broadcast messaging service and to the associated privacy policy. The privacy server thus generates a list of confirmed mobile device identifiers which includes target mobile device identifiers that match an identifier stored in the database. The privacy server database, a broadcast server database, or another server or storage location accessible by the broadcast server may include additional information relating to each stored device identifier, such as an indication of whether the associated mobile device has a location agent installed thereon, whether the associated device relies on a location agent running on a location server, and\/or an address for the location agent running on a location server and associated with the device. In one example, the list of confirmed mobile device identifiers includes, in association with each confirmed identifier, the address of the location agent associated with the corresponding mobile device.","Once the privacy server  has assembled the list of confirmed device identifiers, the privacy server  generates and sends to the broadcast server a privacy status response message including the list of confirmed mobile device identifiers (step ).

In situations in which the privacy status query was sent in response to receiving a pre-defined distribution list, the broadcast server may store for future use the received list of confirmed identifiers with an identifier for the list in a storage for pre-defined distribution list.","As part of the confirmation of device IDs performed at step , the privacy server  may perform additional steps to obtain the consent of mobile device to the privacy policy. In particular, the privacy server may, in response to receiving the list of confirmed mobile device IDs, compile a list including mobile device IDs included in the list of target IDs identified in the broadcast request and not included in the list of confirmed mobile device IDs. The privacy server  may send, to each mobile device  associated with one of the mobile device IDs included in the compiled list, a location privacy consent request message (step ) to determine whether a user of the mobile device  wants to receive the broadcast message.

The hardware elements, operating systems and programming languages of such user terminal devices also are conventional in nature, and it is presumed that those skilled in the art are adequately familiar therewith.","Hence, aspects of the methods of location-based broadcast messaging service outlined above may be embodied in programming. Program aspects of the technology may be thought of as \u201cproducts\u201d or \u201carticles of manufacture\u201d typically in the form of executable code and\/or associated data that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium. \u201cStorage\u201d type media include any or all of the tangible memory of the computers, processors or the like, or associated modules thereof, such as various semiconductor memories, tape drives, disk drives and the like, which may provide non-transitory storage at any time for the software programming. All or portions of the software may at times be communicated through the Internet or various other telecommunication networks. Such communications, for example, may enable loading of the software from one computer or processor into another, for example, from a privacy server or host computer of the service provider into the computer platform of a location server or a mobile device.","Hence, a non-transitory machine readable medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, a tangible storage medium or physical transmission medium. Non-volatile storage media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as any of the storage devices in any computer(s), mobile devices, or the like that may be used to implement the location-based broadcast messaging service shown in the drawings. Volatile storage media include dynamic memory, such as main memory of such a computer platform or mobile device. Tangible transmission media include coaxial cables; copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a bus within a computer system. Carrier-wave transmission media can take the form of electric or electromagnetic signals, or acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media therefore include for example: a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD or DVD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards paper tape, any other physical storage medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave transporting data or instructions, cables or links transporting such a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read programming code and\/or data. Many of these forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a processor for execution.","While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and\/or other examples, it is understood that various modifications may be made therein and that the subject matter disclosed herein may be implemented in various forms and examples, and that the teachings may be applied in numerous applications, only some of which have been described herein. It is intended by the following claims to claim any and all applications, modifications and variations that fall within the true scope of the present teachings.","Unless otherwise stated, all measurements, values, ratings, positions, magnitudes, sizes, and other specifications that are set forth in this specification, including in the claims that follow, are approximate, not exact. They are intended to have a reasonable range that is consistent with the functions to which they relate and with what is customary in the art to which they pertain.","The scope of protection is limited solely by the claims that now follow. That scope is intended and should be interpreted to be as broad as is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the language that is used in the claims when interpreted in light of this specification and the prosecution history that follows and to encompass all structural and functional equivalents. Notwithstanding, none of the claims are intended to embrace subject matter that fails to satisfy the requirement of Sections 101, 102, or 103 of the Patent Act, nor should they be interpreted in such a way. Any unintended embracement of such subject matter is hereby disclaimed.","Except as stated immediately above, nothing that has been stated or illustrated is intended or should be interpreted to cause a dedication of any component, step, feature, object, benefit, advantage, or equivalent to the public, regardless of whether it is or is not recited in the claims.","It will be understood that the terms and expressions used herein have the ordinary meaning as is accorded to such terms and expressions with respect to their corresponding respective areas of inquiry and study except where specific meanings have otherwise been set forth herein. Relational terms such as first and second and the like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities or actions. The terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, such that a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements does not include only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. An element proceeded by \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d does not, without further constraints, preclude the existence of additional identical elements in the process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises the element.","The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition, in the foregoing Detailed Description, it can be seen that various features are grouped together in various embodiments for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus the following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description, with each claim standing on its own as a separately claimed subject matter."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The drawing figures depict one or more implementations in accord with the present teachings, by way of example only, not by way of limitation.
