A common safety mechanism is a fastener, which may be a locking bar, that is arranged with a locking device so that when the bar is attached to the cabinet the drawers being lodged in the cabinets are prevented from moving outward, thereby, making safe to unwanted exposure of the materials therein.","The locking bars serve well their intended purpose, but the actual use thereof suffers practical drawbacks. More particularly, sometimes the locking bar is removed to allow the drawers to be opened and the contents thereof revealed to an authorized person, but sometimes the authorized persons forget to reattach the locking bar to the cabinet, thereby exposing the contents of the cabinet to adverse contingencies. Further, the cabinets are sometimes placed at remote locations preventing them from being viewed during conduct of normal activities, thereby, leaving the contents of cabinets susceptible to uncontrolled viewing. Normally, monitoring these remote locations undesirably involves time-consuming tasks of individuals that sometimes suffer from human error drawbacks. It is desired that a monitoring system be provided to determine whether the safety mechanism is in place so as to secure the container or cabinet no matter where the container or cabinet is located.","It is an object of the present invention to provide for a system for monitoring the status of containers or cabinets housing confidential, classified or highly classified materials.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an electrical status monitoring system that determines the presence or absence of the security mechanism that ensures the security of a container or cabinet, even if the container or cabinet is located at a remote location.","It is a further object of the present invention to display the security status information of a secured container or cabinet at a central location.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide for an electronic system for monitoring a large number of containers or cabinets containing proprietary or classified documentation located at remote facilities utilized for military or commercial applications.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide for a system for monitoring the secured condition of containers or cabinets containing secured information and which does not suffer high labor intensity cost, and human error drawbacks of prior art systems.","In accordance with one aspect, an electronic monitor is provided for detecting the presence and absence of a fastener that secures a cabinet with the presence thereof preventing the opening of one or more drawers being housed in the cabinet. The electronic monitor comprises; (a) a first electrode fixed at a predetermined location of the fastener; and (b) a current sensing network having second and third electrodes located in the cabinet in a predetermined manner so that the first electrode contacts both the second and third electrodes when the fastener secures the cabinet. The current sensing network generates current flow and an output signal when the first, second and third electrodes are in contact and which is representative that the fastener is secured. The electronic monitor further comprises a (c) transmitter connected to the output of the current sensing network and generates a predetermined signal of a selected communication system upon detection of a change in current flow.","In accordance with another aspect, an electronic monitoring system is provided for detecting and displaying at a central location the presence and absence of one or more fasteners that respectively secure one or more cabinets with the presence thereof preventing the opening of one or more drawers being housed in each of the one or more cabinets. The electronic monitoring system comprises; (a) a first electrode fixed at a predetermined location on each of the respective fasteners; and (b) a current sensing network for each of the one or more cabinets and having second and third electrodes located on a respective cabinet in a predetermined manner so that the first electrode of a respective fastener contacts both the second and third electrodes of its respective cabinet when the respective fastener secures the respective cabinet. The current sensing network generates current flow and an output signal when the first, second and third electrodes are in contact and which is representative that the respective fastener is secured. The electronic monitoring system further comprises a (c) transmitter located on each of the cabinets and connected to the output of a respective current sensing network and generating predetermined signals of a communication link upon detection of a change in said current flow. Each of the transmitters generates predetermined signals which are different from each other. The electronic monitoring system further comprises a (d) receiver located at the central location and accepting and recognizing all of the different predetermined signals of all of the transmitters and generating respective output signals representative of the presence and absence of respective fasteners attached to respective cabinets.","With reference to the drawings,  illustrates an electronic monitoring system  for detecting and displaying at a central location  the presence and absence of fastener devices including bars, locks and clamps located at a remote location  and respectively secured to one or more cabinets , . . . , with the presence thereof preventing the opening of one or more drawers being housed in each of the one or more cabinets , , .","More particularly, each of the cabinets , . . . has a fastener , which in one form may be a locking bar, that secures the contents of a respective cabinet  from adverse contingencies and electronics  that respectively generate output signals , . . . which represent the presence and absence of a respective fastener  securing a respective cabinet .","Each of the output signals , . . . is accepted and recognized by a receiver  at the central location . The receiver  generates respective output signals of the received signals which are representative of the presence and absence of the respective fastener  securing the respective cabinet  and which are displayed, via signal path  to respective indicators , . . . to be further discussed hereinafter with reference to FIG. .","The purpose of the electronic monitoring system  is to determine whether the fastener, such as a vertical locking bar  for a security container or cabinet  is attached or unattached with the attachment thereof preventing the contents of cabinets  from being viewed. The status of the attached\/unattached locking bar  is sent back to a central monitor, more particularly, to receiver , which displays the status information. This configuration shown in  may be used in a military or commercial building to monitor the status of a large number of cabinets  containing proprietary or classified documentation no matter where the cabinets  are located. In the military where classified information is stored in security containers, such as cabinets . . . or in the commercial environment where proprietary information may be guarded, as well as secured, there is a need for a centralized monitoring system, such as the electronic monitoring system  of the present invention. Further details of the cabinets , . . . and fasteners , . . . may be further described with reference to FIG. .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["16","18","18","16","16","16","32","34","36","18","18","16","30","18","18","20","20","16","18","16","40","40"]},"In general, the magnet A is placed on the cabinet  with  and  electrodes attached to the magnet A as shown in FIG. . The other magnet B preferably rests on the surface of the locking bar  and has an embedded electrode  that makes contact with the other  and  electrodes when the magnets A and B meet. If desired, the magnet B may be embedded in the locking bar . The magnet B is positioned adjacent and preferably in contact with the electrode  and, similarly, the magnet A is positioned adjacent and preferably in contact with the electrodes  and . When the locking bar  is put in place, an electrical connection is made between the  and  electrodes in the cabinet  and the electrode  in the locking bar , and current flows through the circuit included in the electronics , as shown by directional arrows  and . When the locking bar  is removed, the electrical connection between the first, second and third (,  and ) is broken and the current becomes 0. The presence of current flow, and more particularly the change in current flow, causes the electronics.  to generate signal  and which is representative that the locking bar  has either been attached (presence) or unattached (absence) to the cabinet .","More particularly, with reference to , the first electrode  is fixed at a predetermined location on the fastener  and the second and third electrodes  and , respectively are located on the cabinet  in a predetermined manner, so that when the locking bar  is inserted into the brackets A and B, the first electrode  contacts both the second and third electrodes  and  providing electrical connection therebetween. Conversely, when the locking bar  is removed from the cabinet  the electrical connection is broken.","Although the magnet A, and the bar magnet B perform well in assisting the electrical mating of the electrodes ,  and , other devices may be used. For example, the desired mating may be accomplished by mechanical means, such as extensions from the locking bar  mating with cutouts in the cabinet . The primary function is to ensure that the first electrode  electrically mates with the electrodes  and  of the current sensing network  shown in  when the locking bar  is in place.","The current sensing network  comprises a source of electrical energy that may be selected from the group consisting of a DC battery  and AC excitation , each of which have first and second ends  and  respectively. The current sensing network  further comprises a current sensor , as well as the second and third electrodes  and  that are spaced apart from each other, with the second electrode  connected to the first end  of the source of electrical excitation. The third electrode  is connected to a second end  of the current sensor , which has its first end  connected to second end  of the source of electrical energy. The current sensor  has an output  connected to the input of a transmitter .","The current sensor  operates in a manner known in the art and upon detection of a change in current flow, generates output signal on signal path . The output signal on signal path  may also activate a status light . The electronics  may further comprise test , which is connected across the electrodes  and , as shown in FIG. . The test switch , when depressed, causes current flow which is sensed by current sensor  which, in turn, generates an output signal on signal path  which, in turn, causes the transmitter  to generate the output signal .","The transmitter  generates a predetermined signal of a selected communication link upon the detection of current flow. The predetermined signal is preferably a radio frequency (RF) signal and the communication link may be selected from the group consisting of a frequency shift key (FSK) technique and an amplitude shift key (ASK) technique.","In one embodiment, an FSK sequence of pulses is transmitted by transmitter  whenever the current sensor  senses a change in the magnitude of the current, such as DC current going from 0 to a positive (+) quantity, or conversely when the DC current goes from a positive (+) quantity to 0. When the current sensor  detects a change in the current's magnitude, the RF transmitter  is activated and the FSK pulse stream commences. A short sequence of pulses (10 pulses per sequence), each having a duration of 10 milliseconds in one embodiment, provides a high degree of reliability in the receiver  detection capability, to be further described hereinafter with reference to FIG. . An alerting device  of  (also to be further described with reference to ) at the centralized status monitor receiver  associated with each cabinet . . . is initialized at installation to the OFF state when the locking bar  is put in place for the first time at its respective cabinet . After installation, the alerting device  will remain OFF until a sequence of pulses is received, indicating that the cabinet . . . has been opened; then, the alerting device  will be activated to the ON state. Thereafter, the alerting device  state will change each time a pulse sequence, in the form of signal , is transmitted by transmitter  and received by receiver .","A FSK pulse sequence will be transmitted when the locking bar  is either removed or put in place and the electrical connection between electrodes ,  and  is either broken or established. A bit switch device, which may be part of each transmitter , enables one to set the cabinet identification number (e g., 001). More particularly, the transmitter  installed in cabinet , may be enabled to transmit the binary code 001, whereas the transmitter  installed in cabinet may be enabled to transmit the binary code 111. The receiver , as well as the alerting device , may be further described with reference to FIG. .","The receiver  is shown in , which illustrates an arrangement for handling cabinets . . . where each respective transmitter  transmits an output signal , . . . . The receiver  comprises an antenna , which receives all the different signals from all the transmitters and provides a respective output thereof. The receiver  further comprises a band pass filter  that is selected to receive and pass all of the predetermined signals . . . that are within the selected band of frequencies of interest. The band pass filter  provides a respective output for each of its received signals.","The receiver  further comprises matched filters , , , , , , , and . Each of the filters . . . is connected to the output of the band pass filter  and each is separately selected to receive and pass a particular wave form comprising an output signal and corresponding to a respective transmitter. For example, matched filter is selected to pass the waveform that is particular to the transmitter  contained in the electronics  of cabinet . Each output of the match filter . . . is routed to a signal processor , which provides respective output signals representative of the presence and absence of the fastener  being secured to its respective cabinet . More particularly, for example, if the signal processor  receives a signal from the matched filter that received signal represents a current change has been sensed by the current sensor  in cabinet , which, in turn, represents that the locking bar , has either been removed (absence) from cabinet , or installed (presence) on cabinet . The receiver  further comprises the cabinet status devices . . . , previously discussed with reference to FIG.  and each of which comprise an alerting device  and a cabinet identification (ID) , each having a switch  and wherein the cabinet ID  displays the associated binary code, e g., 000 for cabinet . Each of the cabinets . . . further preferably are respectively provided with a storage device . . . , which tracks the number of pulses received.","The arrangement shown in  is associated with a conventional matched filter detector . . . for eight (8) possible FSK signals (1 per cabinet), a storage device  , which tracks and records the number of detection's in response to the signal processor , and an alerting device  showing the status of each cabinet  locking bar .","In this embodiment, the storage device  changes state when 5 out of 10 pulses are detected. At installation, the unique container identifier and FSK frequency sequence is set by using the digital bit set mechanism shown in , that is, if the locking bar  is in place the associated switch  is closed. More particularly, for example, if locking bar is in place, then switch is closed and the cabinet ID is energized indicated by binary code (000). This mechanism sets the specific FSK frequency sequence unique to that cabinet. In one configuration, the code is as follows: f represents 0 and f represents 1. Cabinet , more particularly its transmitter , identified as 000 would generate an FSK sequence f, f, f; cabinet , more particularly its transmitter , identified as 001 would generate an FSK sequence f, f, f; and cabinet , more particularly its transmitter , identified as 111 would generate an FSK sequence f, f, f.","In another embodiment, the FSK RF signal is replaced by an ASK (amplitude shift key) signal. The number of FSK pulses or ASK pulse per sequence may vary. The detection scheme, which was 5 out of 10 in our example, may be redefined all done in a manner known in the art.","It should now be appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides for an electronic monitoring system that allows a fastener, such as a locking bar  to be used in an arrangement comprising of a large number of cabinets. The monitoring system  enables the security person to obtain information about the status of each cabinet . The electronic monitoring system  of the present invention can be implemented at one location using a computer to display the status of each container which, yields the benefits of saving time and effort commonly expended by security persons in a military or commercial complex.","It will be understood that various changes and details, steps and arrangement of parts and method steps, which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The appended claims particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of this invention.
