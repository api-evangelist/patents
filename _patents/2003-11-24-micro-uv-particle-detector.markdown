No. 60\/428,824 filed Nov. 25, 2002 and titled \u201cMICRO UV DETECTOR,\u201d which application is commonly assigned and incorporated by reference herein.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates generally to particle detectors and, in particular, to micro UV detectors.","It is well known that biological materials fluoresce when irradiated with light in the ultraviolet region. In general, the excitation light has a wavelength from about 260 to 360 nm. The emission from the biological materials can be anywhere from the excitation wavelength (scattered) to the visible range. Many particle detectors for detecting biological agent aerosols, e.g., the Tier-3 Biological Aerosol Warning System, are based on this phenomenon.","Historically, these particle detectors use a laser for the excitation process. One or more photon detectors, or photo multipliers, are used to capture emission from the sample particles and scattering. Many particle detectors also employ a flow-through design, where the sampled particles pass through the excitation light at a relatively fast pace. This is done to improve the sampling statistics. However, these particle detectors are often undesirably large, heavy, and expensive and consume undesirable amounts of power for many applications, such as field applications, e.g., particle detectors for use with military ground forces, on moving ground and air platforms, within structures, etc.","For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need in the art for alternative particle detectors for detecting biological agent aerosols.","The above-mentioned problems with particle detectors for detecting biological agent aerosols and other problems are addressed by the present invention and will be understood by reading and studying the following specification.","Embodiments of the present invention provide particle detectors capable of detecting biological agent aerosols. The particle detectors direct opposing flows into a beam of ultra-violet light to generate fluorescence from the particles. The opposing flows act to reduce to the particle velocities within the light, thus increasing the residence time of the particles within the light.","For one embodiment of the present invention, a particle detector includes a spherical\/ellipsoid shell comprising spherical and ellipsoid mirrors that define a focal point within an interior of the shell, a pair of opposing tubes passing through the spherical\/ellipsoid shell and directed at the focal point for directing particles to the focal point, and a light source directed at the focal point for directing light at the particles to generate fluorescence from the particles at or near the focal point.","For another embodiment, a method for detecting particles includes directing a pair of opposing particle flows at a focal point within a spherical\/ellipsoid cavity having an ellipsoid mirror and a spherical mirror, directing ultra-violet light at the focal point to illuminate the particles at or near the focal point to generate fluorescence from the particles at or near the focal point, and directing fluorescence generated at or near the focal point to a target point.","Further embodiments of the invention include methods and apparatus of varying scope.","In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["1","1","2","38","3","1","2","2","1","3"]},"A light emitter  (shown in ) inserts into a hole  (shown in ) in end cap .

Ellipsoid mirror  is discussed in more detail below. A spherical mirror  and a filter  insert into a recess  in a body  (shown in ) of detector . Spherical mirror  is discussed in more detail below.","Filter  can be any standard, commercially available glass filter that is capable of removing the same frequency light emitted by the light emitter . Filter  may be coated with a reflective or adsorbing coating that acts to substantially prevent fluorescence from the glass. Filter  will, however, allow longer wavelength light to pass through it. For one embodiment, cut off frequencies of filter  are 350\u2013400 nm. Brysen Optical Corporation (Florida, USA) manufactures a suitable filter.","Body  can be of any rigid material such as plastic, metal, or the like. Body  has a recess (not shown) opposite recess  (e.g., at the bottom of body ) to receive a photon counter . A Hamamatsu H7467 manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (Hamamatsu, J P) is a suitable photon counter. Photon counter  counts photons passing through filter  and thus measures the total fluorescence signal produced within detector .

An interior of spherical\/ellipsoid shell  defines a spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  within detector , as shown in .  shows emitter  passing radially through hole  of ellipsoid mirror  so that LED light source is located within spherical\/ellipsoid cavity .  also shows sample tubes  passing radially through holes  of ellipsoid mirror  into spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  so that sample tubes  are positioned opposite one another.","Ellipsoid mirror  can be fabricated out of any rigid material, such as aluminum. An interior surface  (shown in ) of ellipsoid mirror  is reflective to ultra-violet light. For one embodiment, interior surface  is coated with an enhanced aluminum coating that for another embodiment has maximum reflective properties for wavelengths between about 350\u2013700 nm. Spherical mirror  can be fabricated out of any rigid material, such as aluminum. An interior surface  (shown in ) of spherical mirror  is reflective to ultra-violet light. For one embodiment, interior surface  is coated with an enhanced aluminum coating that for another embodiment has maximum reflective properties for wavelengths between about 350\u2013700 nm. For some embodiments, notches  (shown in , , and ) are disposed in spherical mirror . Notches  extend radially between and pass through the interior surface  and an outer surface  of spherical mirror , and thus extend radially from spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  to an exterior of spherical\/ellipsoid shell , as shown in .","Surfaces  and  of spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  define a focal point  within spherical\/ellipsoid cavity , as shown in . Any light emitted at or near focal point  is directed to a target point  located, for one embodiment, outside of spherical\/ellipsoid cavity , e.g., below spherical mirror , as shown in . This is illustrated by ray traces , for another embodiment, in . Substantially all of the light at or near focal point  that does not irradiate target point  directly is reflected off of the ellipsoid mirror  and spherical mirror  and is focused on target point .","The excitation energy from light source is also directed at focal point , as shown in . This can be accomplished by focusing the light from light source using lenses (not shown), directing it using fiber optics (not shown), or by physically placing LED light source at or near focal point . For another embodiment, light source is replaced with a laser-based UV light source that is mounted so its beam hits focal point .","Prior to hitting target point , the light emitted at or near the focal point  passes through the filter  installed below the spherical mirror , as shown in . Filter  removes selected wavelengths of light. For one embodiment, filter  removes the excitation wavelength produced by a light source, such as light source or the laser, while allowing longer wavelengths between about 350 and 700 nm to pass. The light passed through filter , and the filtered light is directed from filter  through target point  to the photon counter . Photon counter  measures any light, specifically fluorescence, produced at focal point . This can also be accomplished using other light-measuring devices, such as a photomultiplier. For one embodiment, photon counter  counts the number of photons during a period of time to determine the intensity of the fluorescence signal. For another embodiment, photon counter  outputs the intensity is a digital value.","The detected photons counted by the photon counter  are transmitted to a data processor of a computer , as shown in . For one embodiment, an interface , such as an RS232 interface of photon counter , connects photon counter  to computer  via a line . The computer controls the counter's integration time and records the actual counts. Software within the computer determines if preset alarm thresholds are exceeded. In such a case, the computer would generate appropriate warning messages. Alternatively, a dedicated microprocessor could fulfill this role.","The focal point  is also used for the collection of aerosol particles (particles contained within a gas flow, such as air). Directing sample flow tubes  at focal point , as shown in , and directing the aerosol particles through sample flow tubes  into spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  so that the particles exit the tubes and travel toward focal point  accomplishes this. Placing sample flow tubes  in opposition to one another, as shown in , acts to cause particles exiting one tube to be influenced by the flow from the opposing tube. This acts to reduce the velocity (or inertia) of the particles at focal point  that produces a stalling effect, thereby increasing the residence time of the particles at focal point  and thus the residence time of the particles within the excitation beam produced by the light source. For another embodiment, the flow in the respective sample flow tubes is substantially balanced. This acts to further increase the residence times. For other embodiments, exits  of sample tubes  are substantially equidistant from focal point , and\/or their inside diameters D (shown in ) are substantially equal.","For various embodiments, the stalled effect depends on a distance S (shown in ) between an exit  of each of the sample flow tubes  and the focal point , the inside diameter D of the sample flow tubes , and a flow rate through the sample flow tubes . For example, the residence time of the particles within the excitation beam is increased by about a factor of 100 compared to flow-through detectors without opposing flows for two sample tubes, each having an inside diameter D of about 2 mm, each located at a distance S of about 2 mm from focal point , and each having a flow rate of about 1 liter\/minute therethrough.","Increasing the residence time of the particles within the excitation beam acts to increase the sensitivity of detector  compared to flow-through detectors without opposing flows. Moreover, it acts to reduce the power requirements of detector  compared to flow-through detectors without opposing flows. Increasing the residence time of the particles within the excitation beam also acts to increase the total number of photons that interact with the particle and those emitted as fluorescence.","The air and particles are exhausted from spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  through notches  in spherical mirror . For various embodiments, notches  distribute the flow so that the flow does not form eddies and turbulent streams.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["20","1","20","2","2","52","24","24","25","18","1","1","19","1","64","25","24","18","24","25","18","52","20"]},"For one embodiment, the flows through internal conduits  are combined within detector  and exit detector  as a single flow. Using two internal conduits  acts to reduce or prevent turbulence in the flow through notches  in spherical mirror . Pump  exhausts the flow through an exhaust port . An arrow  in  indicates the exhausted flow.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4","FIG. 7"],"b":["50","2","16"]},"For various embodiments, filter  is used to remove the wavelength emitted from the light source due to scatter off of the sample particles. For some embodiments, the scattered light is detected using an independent photo detector (not shown), such as a photodiode mounted elsewhere within spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  to measure the scatter component.","In operation, pump  is attached to detector , as shown in . As result, ambient air containing particles, e.g., of biological materials, is drawn into the two (or four) sample flow tubes . The particles are directed through sample flow tubes  and, for some embodiments, reach a near-terminal velocity within the air stream as it accelerates within sample flow tubes . Upon exiting sample flow tubes , some of the particles, e.g., between about 2\u201310 microns, flow toward the opposing sample flow tube . As these particles get closer to the opposing tube, the opposing flows act to reduce the velocities of the particles at or near the focal point  to produce the stalling effect. The reduced particle velocities provide additional time for irradiation by light from the light source. These particles are then directed through the notches , into the internal channels  and , through pump , and are exhausted, as indicated by arrow . The bulk air component and smaller particles bend and flow to the notches  in the spherical mirror  after exiting sample flow tubes  without flowing to focal point . This flow is directed through the notches , into the internal channels  and , through pump , and is exhausted, as indicated by arrow .","The LED light source is positioned near focal point  and is positioned so that its UV light illuminates the area at and around focal point  and thus the particles at or near focal point . In the case of particles of biological materials or other materials capable of fluorescing, the UV light generates fluorescence from the particles. Most of the fluorescence is directed toward surfaces  and  of spherical\/ellipsoid shell , as shown in  by ray traces . Surfaces  and  reflect and focus the fluorescence. Any fluorescence hitting surface  of ellipsoid mirror  is reflected and focused to the target point  below spherical mirror. Any fluorescence hitting interior surface  of spherical mirror  is reflected back to the focal point  and onto surface . This reflected fluorescence is again reflected and focused by interior surface  back to the target point .","Fluorescence focused to the target point passes through filter . Filter  removes any scattered light from the irradiating light source and any other undesired wavelengths from the fluorescence and outputs fluorescence photons. The fluorescence photons are received at photon counter  that outputs an electrical signal indicative of the fluorescence. The electrical signal is sent to an external microprocessor or computer  for measuring the fluorescence. An alarm is generated when this signal exceeds a preset threshold.","For another embodiment, emitter , and thus LED light source , is replaced with an external ultra-violet light source , such as a UV laser, that is mounted externally of end cap  so its beam  hits focal point , as illustrated in  according to another embodiment of the present invention. For one embodiment, beam  is directed through an external filter  located externally of end cap , as shown in , for removing undesired wavelengths of light from light source . Beam  is then directed through the hole  in end cap  and through the hole  in ellipsoid mirror  that is aligned with hole  to access the focal point . Beam  is then directed through an outlet hole  in ellipsoid mirror  for exiting spherical\/ellipsoid cavity , through an outlet  in end cap , and, for one embodiment, into an optical light dump  connected to an exterior of end cap . Light dump  acts to prevent light from beam  from being reflected back into spherical\/ellipsoid cavity . For another embodiment, a housing  connected to an exterior of end cap  and closed by a cover  contains light source  and external filter .","For one embodiment, each tube  passes substantially concentrically through a tube  to form a flow passage  between an exterior of tube  and an interior of tube , as shown in . Aerosol particles flow into spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  through sample flow tubes  and travel toward focal point  after exiting sample flow tubes , as indicated by arrows  in . Instead of exhausting the air and particles from spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  through the notches  in spherical mirror , as described above, the air and particles are exhausted from spherical\/ellipsoid cavity  through flow passages , as indicated by arrows  and are subsequently directed to pump .","Embodiments of the present invention provide particle detectors capable of detecting biological agent aerosols. For one embodiment, a particle detector includes a spherical\/ellipsoid shell comprising spherical and ellipsoid mirrors that define a focal point within an interior of the shell, a pair of opposing tubes passing through the spherical\/ellipsoid shell and directed at the focal point for directing particles to the focal point, and a light source directed at the focal point for directing light at the particles to generate fluorescence from the particles at or near the focal point. Opposing tubes result in opposing particle flows. The opposing particle flows act to reduce the velocity (or inertia) of the particles at the focal point, thereby increasing the residence time of the particles within the light produced by the light source. This acts to reduce the power requirements and increase the sensitivity of the detector compared to flow-through detectors without opposing flows.","Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement that is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown.
