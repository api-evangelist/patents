Anal. (CHO) C, H.","The following results lead to some observations. Because of the interesting biological properties of resveratrol (1), combined with the remarkable in vivo anticancer activity of combretastatin A-4 (2a) and its sodium phosphate prodrug (2b), a series of resveratrol structural modifications were investigated as an extension of applicant's combretastatin and phenstatin (2c) SAR research. (Ndayikengurukiye, H., et al., Alkoxylated p-phenylenevinylene Oligomers: Synthesis and Spectroscopic and Electrochemical Properties, 1997, 53, 13811-13828.) Suitable application of the experimental procedures already developed for synthesis of combretastatin A-4 and its prodrug derivatives was extended to obtaining the cis and trans stilbenes as well as the benzophenones. (Pettit, G. R., et al., Antineoplastic agents 291. Isolation and synthesis of Combretastatin A04, A-5, and A-6, 1995, 38, 1666-1672; Pettit, G. R., et al., Antineoplastic agents 443. Synthesis of the Cancer Cell Growth inhibitor Hydocyphenstatin and its Sodium Diphosphate Prodrug, 2000, 43, 2731-2727.)","The cytotoxicity data from the resveratrol stilbenes was determined. The cis-isomer of resveratrol (1b) exhibited slightly less inhibitory effects on the cancer cell lines tested than did the trans-isomer. The trimethoxy stilbenes 4a,b are between 10-100 fold more active against tumor cell lines than the parent compound resveratrol (1), with compound 4a (the cis-stilbene) far more active than 4b.","Demethylation at any position yielded much less cytotoxic compounds than 4a, but the cis-stilbenes 14c, 14g and 14k all retained anticancer activity comparable to that of resveratrol. The corresponding trans-isomers 14d, 14h and 14l were all slightly less active than their cis counterparts.","Previous work by applicant had found that phenstatin (2c) retained most of the cytotoxic properties of combretastatin A-4 (2a); this suggested that the properties of compound 16a, as well as additional benzophenones might possibly be worthy of further investigation. (Pettit, G. R., et al., Antineoplastic Agents. 379. Synthesis of Phenstatin Phosphate, 1998, 41, 1688-1695.) While the cytotoxic properties of most of these compounds were quite similar to those of the stilbene derivatives of resveratrol the trimethoxy derivative was again the most potent of the series. However, it was 10-100-fold less active than compound 4a, the analogous cis-stilbene.","General conclusions arising from the structure-activity relationship study of resveratrol based on cytotoxic effects on P-388 and human tumor cell lines can be summarized as: 3,4\u2032,5-OCH>>resveratrol,4\u2032-OH,prodrug,3-OH>3,5-OH,3,4\u2032-OH>>3,4\u2032,5-OH. The trimethoxy derivatives (4a,b,16a) were all superior in activity to resveratrol (1) as well as the remaining variations. Resveratrol (1), however, was comparable in activity to several of the other cis-stilbenes described here, including the 4\u2032-hydroxy (14g) and the 3-hydroxy (14c) cis-derivatives.","For this reason the synthesis of the prodrug of the 4\u2032-hydroxystilbene 14c and the 3-hydroxystilbene 14g was attempted. The synthesized prodrug 14n was essentially identical to 14c in its effects on the growth of cancer cells. From the known antimitotic activity of combretastatin A-4 (2a) and phenstatin (2c) and their potent interactions with tubulin, it seemed possible that the most cytotoxic compounds prepared in the current series would also inhibit this important cellular protein.","Several of the newly synthesized compounds were therefore examined for inhibitory effects on tubulin assembly, in a direct comparison with 2a and 2c. Compound 4a proved to be more inhibitory than 2a, while, in contrast, 16a was somewhat less potent than 2c. Resveratrol (1) was inactive as an inhibitor of tubulin assembly. Compound 14c, representing demethylation at position 3 of 4a, was 16-fold less active than 4a.","Combretastatin A-4 (2a) binds in the colchicine site of tubulin and is exceptionally potent as an inhibitor of the binding of radiolabeled colchicine to tubulin. (Lin, C. M., et al., Antimitotic natural products Combretastatin A-4 and Combretastatin A-2: Studies on the Mechanism of Their Inhibition of the Binding of Colchicine to Tubulin, 1989, 28, 6984-6991.) The two new active compounds, 4a and 4c, were compared to 2a and phenstatin (2c) for their effects on colchicine binding to tubulin. Combretastatin A-4 (2a) displayed its usual potency, inhibiting colchicine binding by 98% when the two drugs were present in equimolar (5 \u03bcM) concentrations and by 91% when 2a was present at 2 \u03bcM (the tubulin concentration in these experiments was 1.0 \u03bcM).","Compound 4a was essentially equivalent to 2a as an inhibitor of colchicine binding. Phenstatin (2c), despite its greater inhibition of polymerization, was less potent than combretastatin A-4 (2a) as an inhibitor of colchicine binding, while 16a had the least activity in both assays. The reasons for these discrepancies are at present unknown but do not appear to derive from salt or temperature differences in the reaction condition.","There is also some indication that Resveratrol (1) contained in the roots of has apparently been used in Chinese and Japanese traditional medicine as a treatment for gonorrhea (Kubo, M., et al., 1981, 35, 58.) In the present study, its activity against the etiologic agent of gonorrhea, , was demonstrated in broth microdilution assays (Table IV). Stilbene production has been correlated with the resistance of grape leaves to fungal infection. (Langcake, R., et al., The Relationship of Resveratrol Production to Infection of Grapevine Leaves by 1979 18:244-253.) Most of the stilbenes evaluated for antimicrobial action had antifungal activity (Table IV). The dimethyl derivative of cis-resveratrol (14c), with both antibacterial and antifingal activities, was the most active of the stilbenes and benzophenones tested (Table IV). Further biological evaluation of such resveratrol structural modifications should include chemopreventive potential targets such as COX-1 and COX-2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"308pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
