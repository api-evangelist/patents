title: Associating multiple physical mailboxes with same user object in messaging system
abstract: Architecture that employs an abstraction of a mailbox store that allows clients to connect to alternate mailboxes associated with a single mail-enabled user, using the same mechanism the user utilizes to connect to the user's main mailbox. On top of this basic infrastructure, new features can be built, including server-hosted e-mail archives and mailboxes mirrored from other e-mail systems. In support thereof, the architecture also includes a mechanism for mailboxes to expose all or only a subset of mailbox features, and to advertise which mailbox features are supported.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Users are becoming connected in more ways than one. For example, cell phones and computers provide the principal means for communicating with other users, and each can be associated with message accounts. Moreover, users are now able to freely create message accounts such as for e-mail and text messaging via websites. Thus, users may have multiple accounts via which to send and receive information. However, having multiple accounts spread across various locations, websites, and clients, for example, introduces new problems with communications technologies that originally facilitate more efficient and effective communications.","Moreover, the capability to store substantially all messages can impose significant burden on client machines, thereby driving a need to store such messages off the client and on servers. However, again, storing different accounts and account messages across different locations is a suboptimal solution to an increasingly mobile society and to system resources.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some novel embodiments described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview, and it is not intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The disclosed architecture provides an abstraction of a mailbox store that allows clients to connect to multiple \u201calternate\u201d mailboxes associated with a single user, exposing the same mechanism used to connect to a user's primary (or \u201cmain\u201d) mailbox. On top of this basic infrastructure, other features can be built such as server-hosted e-mail archives and mailboxes mirrored from other e-mail and PIM data systems. In support thereof, a mechanism is provided for an abstraction layer to expose all or a subset of the alternate mailbox features, and to advertise which alternate mailbox features are supported per alternate mailbox.","Clients can be agnostic to this architecture, by enabling the clients to logon to alternate mailboxes using the same mechanism used to logon to the user's primary mailbox, as though the alternate mailboxes were actually separate mailboxes. The alternate mailboxes can support all or a subset of mailbox features, and a mechanism is provided for the alternate mailboxes to advertise the mailbox features supported.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of the various ways in which the principles disclosed herein can be practiced and all aspects and equivalents thereof are intended to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The need to associate more than one physical store for a mailbox belonging to a user in an e-mail environment can manifest itself in several ways. One such way enables user-accessible archives of e-mail and PIM (personal information management) data to be stored on a server, which were previously stored on the client machine of the end user. An archive is associated with the user's main mailbox account, supports backward compatibility for alternate-mailbox-agnostic clients, and advertises the mailbox features it supports. Another way allows users to mirror content from e-mail and PIM data accounts on other messaging and PIM systems to a centralized, hosted e-mail server. To avoid \u201cbleeding\u201d of personal e-mail data between personal e-mail and work e-mail, a separate mailbox can be provided on the e-mail centralized server for each remote account that is being mirrored. For purposes of backward compatibility, there is a strong desire to provide this functionality with minimal (if any) changes to the clients accessing the e-mail server.","The disclosed architecture provides an abstraction of a mailbox store that allows clients to connect to alternate mailboxes associated with a single mail-enabled user, using the same mechanism the user utilizes to connect to the user's main mailbox. On top of this basic infrastructure, new features can be built, including server-hosted e-mail archives and mailboxes mirrored from other e-mail systems. In support thereof, the architecture also includes a mechanism for mailboxes to expose all or only a subset of mailbox features, and to advertise which mailbox features are supported.","Reference is now made to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding thereof. It may be evident, however, that the novel embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof. The intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","104","106","102","108","106","104","106","104"]},"The system  can further comprise a mirror component  for mirroring the message data  from other accounts  to the storage component . In other words, the other accounts  can exist separately at different remote locations relative to the storage component location. The other accounts  can include a client-based e-mail account, information associated with a client-based PIM application, server-based messaging account, and so on.","The multiple accounts  can include alternate accounts that comprise mirrored accounts of different mailbox accounts associated with correspondingly different e-mail systems, archives of other accounts, and other account types, as desired. For example, one e-mail system can be a web-based account, another e-mail system can be a corporate account, and so on. The mirror component  periodically reaches out to each of the other accounts  and pulls the associated messaging data into the mirrored accounts in the storage component .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","106","202","204","204","206","208","202","204","108","204","202","102","208","106","104","204","204","102","202","204"]},"Put another way, the computer-implemented data system  comprises the storage component  centrally located for storing a main mailbox account  and alternate mailbox accounts  of a user and corresponding e-mail data (e.g., message data ) and PIM data  of the accounts , the mirror component  for mirroring the e-mail data (the message data ) and the PIM data  of the main mailbox account  and other mailbox accounts from other locations (the other accounts ) to the storage component , and the abstraction component  for providing access to the alternate mailbox accounts  via the main mailbox account .","The archive accounts  store archives of the e-mail data and PIM data  of the main mailbox account . In an alternative embodiment, the archive accounts can store archives for the mirrored accounts  as well. The alternate mailbox accounts  advertise all or a subset of account features that the alternate mailbox accounts  support. The account features can be enabled or disabled based on capabilities flags. The alternate mailbox accounts  are accessible via the same session interface employed to access the main mailbox account .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","308","310","304","312","314","306","312","312","312","316","318"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","302","304","306","308","310","304","312","314","306","312","312","312","402","318","404","404"]},"Because alternate mailboxes are associated with a single main mailbox, the alternate mailboxes do not need the added management burden of being exposed (e.g., in a directory) as a new kind of mailbox-enabled user object, but can instead be represented as an association of attributes on a single user object. The user object can be used to represent a mailbox, and includes attributes such as the mailbox distinguished name and home mailbox database GUID (globally unique identifier). To support alternate mailboxes, the user object can be extended to include a list of the associated alternate mailboxes. The entries encoded in this list include data such as the mailbox GUID, home mailbox database, display name, SMTP address, mailbox quota, and mailbox type (e.g., archive, mirror, etc.).","For example, a user object with a primary mailbox on company.com (user1@company.com) and two alternate mailboxes can have the following data in an alternate mailboxes list:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ID","HomeMdb","DisplayName","SmtpAddress","Quota","Flags"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["{Guid1}","{homeMdbGuid}","Annual","(null)","Unlimited","Archive"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Archive"]},{"entry":["{Guid2}","{homeMdbGuid}","User 1","user1@e-mail.com","1 GB","Mirror"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Mirrored"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Mailbox"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"To connect to an alternate mailbox, a client uses the same mailbox session API that is used to connect to the main mailbox. This API accepts the distinguished name (DN) or e-mail address of the mailbox to open, recognizes the DN or e-mail address of an alternate mailbox, and finds the DN or e-mail address of the alternate mailbox in the directory.","For clients that are agnostic to the alternate mailbox architecture, a user profile is created (e.g., manually or through a discovery mechanism) that stores this DN. Clients that are alternate mailbox-aware can check the directory at runtime for the set of alternate mailboxes associated with a user, rather than storing the DN. Once the client has connected to the alternate mailbox, the client interacts with the mailbox as it would any other mailbox.","The two scenarios driving alternate mailbox support in mailbox servers (e.g., mailbox archiving and mailbox mirroring) place different requirements on the functionality that the mailbox exposes. For archive mailboxes, certain actions (e.g., send, deliver) and settings (e.g., out-of-office, rules) are only relevant for a user's primary mailbox. Thus, these actions and settings can be disabled for the alternate mailbox. For mirrored mailboxes, however, all mailbox features and settings can be fully enabled on all of this type of alternate mailbox.","To support these two scenarios (and provide expansion to other alternate mailbox types), a mechanism is provided to turn mailbox features on or off, based on a set of \u201cCapabilities\u201d flags. This mechanism also enables the mailbox session to advertise to clients which features the mailbox supports. Alternate mailbox-aware clients can use this data to turn user interface elements on or off, for example, depending on the capabilities of the session.","Following is a sample data format that can be employed to represent session capabilities of a mailbox.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"[Flags]"]},{"entry":[{},"internal enum SessionCapabilitiesFlags"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003None","= 0x0000,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanSend","= 0x0001,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanDeliver","= 0x0002,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanCreateDefaultFolders","= 0x0004,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003MustHideDefaultFolders","= 0x0008,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanHaveDelegateUsers","= 0x0010,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanHaveExternalUsers","= 0x0020,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanHaveRules","= 0x0040,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanHaveJunkE-mailRule","= 0x0080,"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanHaveMasterCategoryList = 0x0100,"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanHaveOof","= 0x0200,"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003CanHaveUserConfigurationManager = 0x0400,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003MustCreateFolderHierarchy = 0x0800,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003Default = CanSend | CanDeliver |"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003CanCreateDefaultFolders |"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003CanHaveDelegateUsers | CanHaveExternalUsers |"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003CanHaveRules | CanHaveJunkE-mailRule |"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003CanHaveMasterCategoryList | CanHaveOof |"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003CanHaveUserConfigurationManager"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Included herein is a set of flow charts representative of exemplary methodologies for performing novel aspects of the disclosed architecture.

By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution, and a component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.

In order to provide additional context for various aspects thereof,  and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of the suitable computing system  in which the various aspects can be implemented. While the description above is in the general context of computer-executable instructions that can run on one or more computers, those skilled in the art will recognize that a novel embodiment also can be implemented in combination with other program modules and\/or as a combination of hardware and software.","The computing system  for implementing various aspects includes the computer  having processing unit(s) , a system memory , and a system bus . The processing unit(s)  can be any of various commercially available processors such as single-processor, multi-processor, single-core units and multi-core units. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the novel methods can be practiced with other computer system configurations, including minicomputers, mainframe computers, as well as personal computers (e.g., desktop, laptop, etc.), hand-held computing devices, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, and the like, each of which can be operatively coupled to one or more associated devices.","The system memory  can include volatile (VOL) memory  (e.g., random access memory (RAM)) and non-volatile memory (NON-VOL)  (e.g., ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, etc.). A basic input\/output system (BIOS) can be stored in the non-volatile memory , and includes the basic routines that facilitate the communication of data and signals between components within the computer , such as during startup. The volatile memory  can also include a high-speed RAM such as static RAM for caching data.","The system bus  provides an interface for system components including, but not limited to, the memory subsystem  to the processing unit(s) . The system bus  can be any of several types of bus structure that can further interconnect to a memory bus (with or without a memory controller), and a peripheral bus (e.g., PCI, PCIe, AGP, LPC, etc.), using any of a variety of commercially available bus architectures.","The computer  further includes storage subsystem(s)  and storage interface(s)  for interfacing the storage subsystem(s)  to the system bus  and other desired computer components. The storage subsystem(s)  can include one or more of a hard disk drive (HDD), a magnetic floppy disk drive (FDD), and\/or optical disk storage drive (e.g., a CD-ROM drive DVD drive), for example. The storage interface(s)  can include interface technologies such as EIDE, ATA, SATA, and IEEE 1394, for example.","One or more programs and data can be stored in the memory subsystem , a removable memory subsystem  (e.g., flash drive form factor technology), and\/or the storage subsystem(s) , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . Generally, programs include routines, methods, data structures, other software components, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.","The one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data  can include the components and entities of the system  of , the components and entities of the system  of , the components and entities of the infrastructure  of  and infrastructure  of , and the flow charts and diagrams of , for example.","All or portions of the operating system , applications , modules , and\/or data  can also be cached in memory such as the volatile memory , for example. It is to be appreciated that the disclosed architecture can be implemented with various commercially available operating systems or combinations of operating systems (e.g., as virtual machines).","The storage subsystem(s)  and memory subsystems ( and ) serve as computer readable media for volatile and non-volatile storage of data, data structures, computer-executable instructions, and so forth. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer  and includes volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media. For the computer , the media accommodate the storage of data in any suitable digital format. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media can be employed such as zip drives, magnetic tape, flash memory cards, cartridges, and the like, for storing computer executable instructions for performing the novel methods of the disclosed architecture.","A user can interact with the computer , programs, and data using external user input devices  such as a keyboard and a mouse. Other external user input devices  can include a microphone, an IR (infrared) remote control, a joystick, a game pad, camera recognition systems, a stylus pen, touch screen, gesture systems (e.g., eye movement, head movement, etc.), and\/or the like. The user can interact with the computer , programs, and data using onboard user input devices  such a touchpad, microphone, keyboard, etc., where the computer  is a portable computer, for example. These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit(s)  through input\/output (I\/O) device interface(s)  via the system bus , but can be connected by other interfaces such as a parallel port, IEEE 1394 serial port, a game port, a USB port, an IR interface, etc. The I\/O device interface(s)  also facilitate the use of output peripherals  such as printers, audio devices, camera devices, and so on, such as a sound card and\/or onboard audio processing capability.","One or more graphics interface(s)  (also commonly referred to as a graphics processing unit (GPU)) provide graphics and video signals between the computer  and external display(s)  (e.g., LCD, plasma) and\/or onboard displays  (e.g., for portable computer). The graphics interface(s)  can also be manufactured as part of the computer system board.","The computer  can operate in a networked environment (e.g., IP) using logical connections via a wired\/wireless communications subsystem  to one or more networks and\/or other computers. The other computers can include workstations, servers, routers, personal computers, microprocessor-based entertainment appliance, a peer device or other common network node, and typically include many or all of the elements described relative to the computer . The logical connections can include wired\/wireless connectivity to a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), hotspot, and so on. LAN and WAN networking environments are commonplace in offices and companies and facilitate enterprise-wide computer networks, such as intranets, all of which may connect to a global communications network such as the Internet.","When used in a networking environment the computer  connects to the network via a wired\/wireless communication subsystem  (e.g., a network interface adapter, onboard transceiver subsystem, etc.) to communicate with wired\/wireless networks, wired\/wireless printers, wired\/wireless input devices , and so on. The computer  can include a modem or has other means for establishing communications over the network. In a networked environment, programs and data relative to the computer  can be stored in the remote memory\/storage device, as is associated with a distributed system. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers can be used.","The computer  is operable to communicate with wired\/wireless devices or entities using the radio technologies such as the IEEE 802.xx family of standards, such as wireless devices operatively disposed in wireless communication (e.g., IEEE 802.11 over-the-air modulation techniques) with, for example, a printer, scanner, desktop and\/or portable computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), communications satellite, any piece of equipment or location associated with a wirelessly detectable tag (e.g., a kiosk, news stand, restroom), and telephone. This includes at least Wi-Fi (or Wireless Fidelity) for hotspots, WiMax, and Bluetooth\u2122 wireless technologies. Thus, the communications can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices. Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11x (a, b, g, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wire networks (which use IEEE 802.3-related media and functions).","The illustrated aspects can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where certain tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules can be located in local and\/or remote storage and\/or memory system.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a schematic block diagram of a computing environment  that supports mid-tier alternate mailboxes. The environment  includes one or more client(s) . The client(s)  can be hardware and\/or software (e.g., threads, processes, computing devices). The client(s)  can house cookie(s) and\/or associated contextual information, for example.","The environment  also includes one or more server(s) . The server(s)  can also be hardware and\/or software (e.g., threads, processes, computing devices). The servers  can house threads to perform transformations by employing the architecture, for example. One possible communication between a client  and a server  can be in the form of a data packet adapted to be transmitted between two or more computer processes. The data packet may include a cookie and\/or associated contextual information, for example. The environment  includes a communication framework  (e.g., a global communication network such as the Internet) that can be employed to facilitate communications between the client(s)  and the server(s) .","Communications can be facilitated via a wire (including optical fiber) and\/or wireless technology. The client(s)  are operatively connected to one or more client data store(s)  that can be employed to store information local to the client(s)  (e.g., cookie(s) and\/or associated contextual information). Similarly, the server(s)  are operatively connected to one or more server data store(s)  that can be employed to store information local to the servers . The server(s)  can include the mid-tier functionality, entities, and components as described herein, as well as the backend stores and network services.","What has been described above includes examples of the disclosed architecture. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components and\/or methodologies, but one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that many further combinations and permutations are possible. Accordingly, the novel architecture is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
