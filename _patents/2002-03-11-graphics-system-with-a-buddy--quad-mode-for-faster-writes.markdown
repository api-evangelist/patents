{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to the field of computer graphics and, more particularly, to high performance computer graphics systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","Early graphics systems were limited to two-dimensional (2D) graphics, were configured to compute a gray scale value for each pixel displayed, and acted as simple translators or interfaces to a display device. Modern high performance graphics systems, however, may support three-dimensional (3D) graphics with one or more special effects such as anti-aliasing, texturing, shading, fogging, alpha-blending, and specular highlighting. 3D graphics data may be several orders of magnitude larger than comparable 2D graphics data. 3D graphics data may include a set of information components for each vertex of the geometric primitives used to model the objects to be imaged.","In recent years, demand for high performance graphics systems that can render complex three-dimensional (3D) objects and scenes have increased substantially. This increase is at least in part due to the demand for new applications such as computer-generated animation for motion pictures, virtual reality simulators\/trainers, and interactive computer games. These new applications place tremendous computational loads upon graphics systems. Modem computer displays have also improved and have a significantly higher pixel resolution, greater color depth, and are able to display more complex images with higher refresh rates than earlier models. Consequently, modern high performance graphics systems incorporate graphics processors with a great deal of complexity and power, and the color value of one pixel may be the accumulated result of many calculations involving several models and mathematical approximations.","With each new generation of graphics system, there is more image data to process, the processing is more complex, and there is less time in which to process it. This need for more processing power is being met with the combination of more hardware resources and\/or more efficient processes.","The problems set forth above may at least in part be solved by a system and method for rendering polygons and storing sample data. In some embodiments, parameter values may be rendered for only one sample position of multiple neighboring sample positions. The parameter values rendered for the one sample position may then be stored in multiple memory locations that correspond to the multiple neighboring sample positions. The parameter values rendered for one sample position may be stored in multiple memory locations with a single write transaction. In some embodiments, utilization of a method for storage of a rendered sample to multiple memory locations may be subject to a conditional test. These methods may calculate a value needed for the specified conditional test from vertex data and compare the calculated value with a specified limit. For example, a multiple storage mode may only be utilized for polygons greater than a certain size.","The graphics system may include an input, a render processor, and a plurality of memories. In some embodiments, additional components may be connected to the system including one or more display devices, one or more input devices, and\/or a host processor.","The input may receive 3-D graphics data corresponding to a polygon that may include vertex data, instructions for assembling the vertexes into polygons, and instructions for selection of a mode or a conditional mode for storing rendered parameter values for one sample position into multiple memory locations. The mode of storing is referred to herein as mode N, where N is a positive integer that specifies the number of memory locations. A render processor may be operable to determine if parameter values of a group of neighboring sample positions within the polygon meet the specified conditions for a conditional mode. The render processor may also store parameter values rendered for a first sample position (selected from a group of N neighboring sample positions) in N memory locations that correspond to the N neighboring sample positions. Parameter values include, but are not limited to color values (red, green, and\/or blue), alpha, and Z.","The user may specify the storage mode N and the media processor may incorporate the specified mode with the graphics data for a polygon. In other embodiments, the storage mode may be set for all processing, for the processing of regions of the image such as the sky, or for processing large objects with insubstantial differences in color. The mode may be varied dynamically in response to a need for real time display of a very complex image or for situations where the complexity of the image changes dramatically in real time.","For mode  (also referred to as Buddy Mode), the plurality of memory locations may be designed to receive parameter values for two neighboring sample positions identical to the parameter values rendered for the first sample position of the two sample positions. For mode  (also referred to as Quad Mode), the plurality of memory locations is designed to receive parameter values for four neighboring sample positions identical to the parameter values rendered for the first sample position of the four sample positions.","Utilization of a method for storage of a rendered sample to multiple memory locations may be subject to a conditional test. Each specific conditional test may be designed to primarily utilize a multiple storage method in regions of the image or portions of objects that may have a reduced probability of creating undesirable artifacts in the rendered image. Areas of the image that are smooth and\/or evenly colored may be prime candidates for a conditional multiple storage method as described herein.","A method with a conditional test may calculate the value or values needed for the specified test from vertex data and compare the calculated value with a specified limit. In some embodiments, a multiple storage mode may only be utilized for polygons greater than a certain size. In other embodiments, a multiple storage mode may be utilized for polygons that have an absolute Z slope less than a threshold value. In these applications, a user may utilize a high threshold value as a means to speed processing and ensure a real time display of a complex image. In some embodiments, a multiple storage method is utilized for polygons that have insubstantial differences between parameter values for neighboring sample positions within the polygon. Still other embodiments may use a conditional mode called Edge mode N. In these embodiments, if an edge of the polygon intersects a sample bin, each sample position that is within the sample bin and within the polygon is individually rendered and stored. If an edge of the polygon does not intersect the sample bin, then the sample positions that are within the sample bin and within the polygon may be processed with a mode N method discussed above.","The efficiency improvements of the various methods discussed may vary with the selection of a storage mode N, and may be influenced by the number of individual memories connected to a common bus and the number of samples per pixel specified.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.

For example, the texture buffer may not be included in an embodiment that does not provide texture mapping. In other embodiments, all or part of the functionality incorporated in either or both of the media processor or the hardware accelerator may be implemented in software.","In one set of embodiments, media processor  is one integrated circuit and hardware accelerator is another integrated circuit.

Depending upon the shading algorithm being used (e.g., constant, Gourand, or Phong), lighting may be evaluated at a number of different spatial locations.","As illustrated, media processor  may be configured to receive graphics data via host interface . A graphics queue  may be included in media processor  to buffer a stream of data received via the accelerated port of host interface . The received graphics data may include one or more graphics primitives. As used herein, the term graphics primitive may include polygons, parametric surfaces, splines, NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines), sub-divisions surfaces, fractals, volume primitives, voxels (i.e., three-dimensional pixels), and particle systems. In one embodiment, media processor  may also include a geometry data preprocessor  and one or more microprocessor units (MPUs) .

Media processor  may also include a direct interface such as bus interface unit (BIU) . Bus interface unit  provides a path to memory  and a path to hardware accelerator  and video output processor  via controller .","Hardware Accelerator\u2014","One or more hardware accelerators  may be configured to receive graphics instructions and data from media processor  and to perform a number of functions on the received data according to the received instructions. For example, hardware accelerator  may be configured to perform rasterization, 2D and\/or 3D texturing, pixel transfers, imaging, fragment processing, clipping, depth cueing, transparency processing, set-up, and\/or screen space rendering of various graphics primitives occurring within the graphics data.","Clipping refers to the elimination of graphics primitives or portions of graphics primitives that lie outside of a 3D view volume in world space. The 3D view volume may represent that portion of world space that is visible to a virtual observer (or virtual camera) situated in world space. For example, the view volume may be a solid truncated pyramid generated by a 2D view window, a viewpoint located in world space, a front clipping plane and a back clipping plane. The viewpoint may represent the world space location of the virtual observer. In most cases, primitives or portions of primitives that lie outside the 3D view volume are not currently visible and may be eliminated from further processing. Primitives or portions of primitives that lie inside the 3D view volume are candidates for projection onto the 2D view window.","Set-up refers to mapping primitives to a three-dimensional viewport. This involves translating and transforming the objects from their original \u201cworld-coordinate\u201d system to the established viewport's coordinates. This creates the correct perspective for three-dimensional objects displayed on the screen.","Screen-space rendering refers to the calculations performed to generate the data used to form each pixel that will be displayed. For example, hardware accelerator  may calculate \u201csamples.\u201d Samples are points that have color information but no real area. Samples allow hardware accelerator  to \u201csuper-sample,\u201d or calculate more than one sample per pixel. Super-sampling may result in a higher quality image.","Hardware accelerator  may also include several interfaces. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, hardware accelerator  has four interfaces. Hardware accelerator  has an interface  (referred to as the \u201cNorth Interface\u201d) to communicate with media processor . Hardware accelerator  may receive commands and\/or data from media processor  through interface . Additionally, hardware accelerator  may include an interface  to bus . Bus  may connect hardware accelerator  to boot PROM  and\/or video output processor . Boot PROM  may be configured to store system initialization data and\/or control code for frame buffer . Hardware accelerator  may also include an interface to a texture buffer . For example, hardware accelerator  may interface to texture buffer  using an eight-way interleaved texel bus that allows hardware accelerator  to read from and write to texture buffer . Hardware accelerator  may also interface to a frame buffer . For example, hardware accelerator  may be configured to read from and\/or write to frame buffer  using a four-way interleaved pixel bus.","The vertex processor  may be configured to use the vertex tags received from the media processor  to perform ordered assembly of the vertex data from the MPUs . Vertices may be saved in and\/or retrieved from a mesh buffer .","The render pipeline  may be configured to rasterize 2D window system primitives and 3D primitives into fragments. A fragment may contain one or more samples. Each sample may contain a vector of color data and perhaps other data such as alpha and control tags. 2D primitives include objects such as dots, fonts, Bresenham lines and 2D polygons. 3D primitives include objects such as smooth and large dots, smooth and wide DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) lines and 3D polygons (e.g. 3D triangles).","For example, the render pipeline  may be configured to receive vertices defining a triangle, to identify fragments that intersect the triangle.","The render pipeline  may be configured to handle full-screen size primitives, to calculate plane and edge slopes, and to interpolate data (such as color) down to tile resolution (or fragment resolution) using interpolants or components such as:\n\n","In embodiments using super-sampling, the sample generator  may be configured to generate samples from the fragments output by the render pipeline  and to determine which samples are inside the rasterization edge. Sample positions may be defined by user-loadable tables to enable stochastic sample-positioning patterns.","Hardware accelerator  may be configured to write textured fragments from 3D primitives to frame buffer . The render pipeline  may send pixel tiles defining r, s, t and w to the texture address unit . The texture address unit  may use the r, s, t and w texture coordinates to compute texel addresses (e.g. addresses for a set of neighboring texels) and to determine interpolation coefficients for the texture filter . The texel addresses are used to access texture data (i.e. texels) from texture buffer . The texture buffer  may be interleaved to obtain as many neighboring texels as possible in each clock. The texture filter  may perform bilinear, trilinear or quadlinear interpolation. The pixel transfer unit  may also scale and bias and\/or lookup texels. The texture environment  may apply texels to samples produced by the sample generator . The texture environment  may also be used to perform geometric transformations on images (e.g., bilinear scale, rotate, flip) as well as to perform other image filtering operations on texture buffer image data (e.g., bicubic scale and convolutions).","In the illustrated embodiment, the pixel transfer MUX  controls the input to the pixel transfer unit . The pixel transfer unit  may selectively unpack pixel data received via north interface , select channels from either the frame buffer  or the texture buffer , or select data received from the texture filter  or sample filter .","The pixel transfer unit  may be used to perform scale, bias, and\/or color matrix operations, color lookup operations, histogram operations, accumulation operations, normalization operations, and\/or min\/max functions. Depending on the source of (and operations performed on) the processed data, the pixel transfer unit  may output the processed data to the texture buffer  (via the texture buffer MUX ), the frame buffer  (via the texture environment unit  and the fragment processor ), or to the host (via north interface ). For example, in one embodiment, when the pixel transfer unit  receives pixel data from the host via the pixel transfer MUX , the pixel transfer unit  may be used to perform a scale and bias or color matrix operation, followed by a color lookup or histogram operation, followed by a min\/max function. The pixel transfer unit  may then output data to either the texture buffer  or the frame buffer .","Fragment processor  may be used to perform standard fragment processing operations such as the OpenGL\u00ae fragment processing operations. For example, the fragment processor  may be configured to perform the following operations: fog, area pattern, scissor, alpha\/color test, ownership test (WID), stencil test, depth test, alpha blends or logic ops (ROP), plane masking, buffer selection, pick hit\/occlusion detection, and\/or auxiliary clipping in order to accelerate overlapping windows.","Texture Buffer ","Texture buffer  may include several SDRAMs. Texture buffer  may be configured to store texture maps, image processing buffers, and accumulation buffers for hardware accelerator . Texture buffer  may have many different capacities (e.g., depending on the type of SDRAM included in texture buffer ). In some embodiments, each pair of SDRAMs may be independently row and column addressable.","Frame Buffer ","Graphics system  may also include a frame buffer . In one embodiment, frame buffer  may include multiple memory devices such as 3D-RAM memory devices manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. Frame buffer  may be configured as a display pixel buffer, an offscreen pixel buffer, and\/or a super-sample buffer. Furthermore, in one embodiment, certain portions of frame buffer  may be used as a display pixel buffer, while other portions may be used as an offscreen pixel buffer and sample buffer.","Video Output Processor\u2014","A video output processor  may also be included within graphics system . Video output processor  may buffer and process pixels output from frame buffer . For example, video output processor  may be configured to read bursts of pixels from frame buffer . Video output processor  may also be configured to perform double buffer selection (dbsel) if the frame buffer  is double-buffered, overlay transparency (using transparency\/overlay unit ), plane group extraction, gamma correction, psuedocolor or color lookup or bypass, and\/or cursor generation. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the output processor  includes WID (Window ID) lookup tables (WLUTs)  and gamma and color map lookup tables (GLUTs, CLUTs) . In one embodiment, frame buffer  may include multiple 3DRAM64s  that include the transparency overlay  and all or some of the WLUTs . Video output processor  may also be configured to support two video output streams to two displays using the two independent video raster timing generators . For example, one raster (e.g., A) may drive a 1280\u00d71024 CRT while the other (e.g., B) may drive a NTSC or PAL device with encoded television video.","DAC  may operate as the final output stage of graphics system . The DAC  translates the digital pixel data received from GLUT\/CLUTs\/Cursor unit  into analog video signals that are then sent to a display device. In one embodiment, DAC  may be bypassed or omitted completely in order to output digital pixel data in lieu of analog video signals. This may be useful when a display device is based on a digital technology (e.g., an LCD-type display or a digital micro-mirror display).","DAC  may be a red-green-blue digital-to-analog converter configured to provide an analog video output to a display device such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor. In one embodiment, DAC  may be configured to provide a high resolution RGB analog video output at dot rates of 240 MHz. Similarly, encoder  may be configured to supply an encoded video signal to a display. For example, encoder  may provide encoded NTSC or PAL video to an S-Video or composite video television monitor or recording device.","In other embodiments, the video output processor  may output pixel data to other combinations of displays. For example, by outputting pixel data to two DACs  (instead of one DAC  and one encoder ), video output processor  may drive two CRTs. Alternately, by using two encoders , video output processor  may supply appropriate video input to two television monitors. Generally, many different combinations of display devices may be supported by supplying the proper output device and\/or converter for that display device.","Sample-to-Pixel Processing Flow","In one set of embodiments, hardware accelerator  may receive geometric parameters defining primitives such as triangles from media processor , and render the primitives in terms of samples. The samples may be stored in a sample storage area (also referred to as the sample buffer) of frame buffer . The samples are then read from the sample storage area of frame buffer  and filtered by sample filter  to generate pixels. The pixels are stored in a pixel storage area of frame buffer . The pixel storage area may be double-buffered. Video output processor  reads the pixels from the pixel storage area of frame buffer  and generates a video stream from the pixels. The video stream may be provided to one or more display devices (e.g. monitors, projectors, head-mounted displays, and so forth) through DAC  and\/or video encoder .","The samples are computed at positions in a two-dimensional sample space (also referred to as rendering space). The sample space may be partitioned into an array of bins (also referred to herein as fragments). The storage of samples in the sample storage area of frame buffer  may be organized according to bins as illustrated in FIG. . Each bin may contain one or more samples. The number of samples per bin may be a programmable parameter.","System for Storage of a Sample to Multiple Memory Locations\u2014",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00086","num":"00086"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","810","820","840"]},"In some embodiments, the input , may receive 3-D graphics data corresponding to a polygon from media processor .

In other embodiments, the parameter values of neighboring sample positions within the polygon may have absolute differences less than a pre-defined metric or a maximum value. In still other embodiments, the user may specify a pre-defined metric or a maximum value. In some embodiments, the differences may be percentage differences, and the maximum value may be a percentage value. In some embodiments, absolute differences between parameter values of the vertexes of the polygon may be evaluated and compared with the pre-defined metric or the maximum value to determine if the test condition may be satisfied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00102","num":"00102"},"figref":"FIG. 9","i":"d ","b":["900","975","980","985","930","935","940","990","930","940","990","995","980"]},"The efficiency of the various methods discussed may vary with the selection of a storage mode N, and may be influenced by the number of individual memories connected to a common bus and the number of samples per pixel specified.","Although the embodiments above have been described in considerable detail, other versions are possible.
