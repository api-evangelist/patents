{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application relates generally to the field of computer technology, and in a specific example embodiment, a web-based collaborative gateway.","Systems for monitoring and\/or controlling security devices have become increasingly popular in recent years. Such systems are used to communicate with security devices such as lights, thermostats, or security systems.","Some conventional systems for controlling and monitoring security devices allow a user to access a server from a remote location using a device such as a desktop computer. For example, a user can use a desktop computer located in a remote location to connect with the server. The user can then send commands to the server to control various security devices. For example, the user can turn lights on or off. In another example, the user accesses a video feed stored at the server that receives a video stream from a camera at a monitored location.","Such conventional systems for controlling and\/or monitoring security devices have at least the following disadvantages and limitations. The connection between the user's remote computer and the server may not be secured. A user could establish a secure connection, but the cost and complexity involved in establishing such a connection are high. Such systems are also complex for users to implement and maintain. For example, the server may be difficult to install and configure. Programming such systems can also be cumbersome and require custom configurations when adding supplemental security devices or services. Last, it is difficult for the user to access the server using different types of remote devices. For instance, conventional systems only allow a user to access the offsite server using, for example, a secured desktop computer located in the user's workplace.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.","In various embodiments, a method and a system for monitoring and controlling devices connected to gateways are described. In an example embodiment, the system has a gateway, a web server, and a client device. The gateway is coupled to a security device. The web server has a management application configured to communicate with the gateway. The management application has a service manager module to enable additional services from the gateway and the security device. The client device communicates with the gateway identified by the web server. The gateway aggregates monitoring data from the security device and from other security devices respectively coupled to other gateways correlated with the gateway. The client device receives the aggregated monitoring data, controls the security device coupled to the respective gateway from a web-based user interface at the client device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","112","100","102","106","110","116","118","120","132"]},"For purposes of the present embodiment, the terms \u201csites\u201d and \u201cpremises\u201d refer to any location to be monitored, whether residential, commercial, public, or secured. Further, the term \u201ca\u201d is generally used in the present disclosure to mean one or more. Still further, the terms \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201coperatively coupled\u201d mean connected in such a way that data may be exchanged. It is understood that \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201coperatively coupled\u201d do not require a direct connection, a wired connection, or even a permanent connection. It is sufficient for purposes of the present embodiment that the connection(s) be established for the sole purpose of exchanging information.","The client devices ,  are connected to the computer network . The client devices ,  can include, but are not limited to, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile computing device, a mobile smart phone device, and so forth. A network interface means is provided to enable the client devices ,  to send and receive data to and from the computer network . The client device  may include a web browser  that may be in communication with the web server  via the computer network . In another example, the client device  includes a programmatic client, such as a client application  configured to communicate with the web server  via the computer network . The web browser  or the client application  may be used to display some or all of the information and monitoring data provided by gateways , , , and .","The computer network  can include a local area network (LAN) where Gigabit Ethernet switches are used to switch data. In another example, the computer network  includes a wide area network, such as the Internet. In general, computer network  may be a public network or private network, a single network or a combination of several networks. In most embodiments, computer network  may be, but is not required to be, an IP-based network. In some embodiments it may be desirable for all or a portion of network  to include publicly available networks, such as the Internet, to avoid the need for installing, purchasing, or leasing additional infrastructure.","The web server  may also connect to the computer network  both to receive and transmit data. The web server  may also be referred to as a web-based host. The web server  is connected to the computer network  by a means of a network interface. The network interface can take the form of a network interface card (not shown) installed within the web server  to enable data to sent and received to and from the computer network  by the web server .","In one embodiment, the web server  identifies one or more gateway(s) for the client devices ,  to communicate with, so as to monitor and\/or control the security devices connected to the corresponding gateway(s).","In another embodiment, the web server  may provide server-side functionality, via the computer network , to the client devices , . The client devices ,  may enable users that utilize the network system  and more specifically, the web server , to view monitoring data (e.g. audio\/video feed) from security devices connected to gateways , , , and  over the computer network . These transactions may include transmitting, receiving (communicating) and processing data to, from, and regarding monitoring data and users of the network system . The data may include, but are not limited to audio, video, picture, metadata, camera configuration data, client device configuration data, and network data monitoring data. The web server  can provide other functions including storing monitoring data to an internal or external disk storage device (not shown), playing back recorded monitoring data.","In one embodiment, the web server  may include a directory of gateways and the location of corresponding connected security devices. The web server  is described in more detail below with respect to , B, and C. As such, the web server  may correlate the gateway  at site A to the gateway  at site B. In one embodiment, the correlation may be generated pursuant to predefined settings or configuration based on user profile, organization topology, hierarchy, bandwidth and other factors. For example, a user at client device  may be a manager responsible for stores located on the West coast. If both sites A and B are on the West coast, the web server correlates gateway  to gateway . As such, based on the user profile and the organization topology, the user can access only gateway  to obtain monitoring data from sites A and B. In other words, the user does not have to communicate directly with several gateways to monitor all security devices attached to the corresponding gateways. In another embodiment, the web server  may correlate gateway  with other gateways. In yet another embodiment, the other gateways may be correlated with other gateways. For example, information from other gateways correlated with the gateway  which is correlated with gateway  may be communicated with the user at the client device  or .","Generally, gateways , , , and  include a processor-based device that operate to monitor conditions at a target site or premise, to analyze monitoring data, to detect alarm conditions at the target site or premise, to capture information relating to such alarm conditions, and to send such monitoring information to client devices ,  and\/or the web server .","Gateways , , and  are located at the same site A. In one embodiment, gateways , ,  are capable of balancing their respective load. Furthermore, gateways , ,  may provide a redundant backup of each other. Gateways , ,  are connected to a local area network LAN . In another embodiment, gateways , ,  communicate with one another via a peer-to-peer network.","Security devices (e.g. monitoring devices and controlling devices) , , and  are connected to the gateways , ,  via LAN . Monitoring devices include, for example, sensors. The gateways are not limited to connect to any specific type or model of sensors or monitoring devices. Any sensor may be used, depending on the desired type and level of protection. Examples include, without limitation, microphones, cameras, magnetic contact switches, audio sensors, infrared sensors, motion detectors, fire alarms, and carbon monoxide sensors. For illustration purposes, location site A in  includes a biometric device  (e.g. fingerprint reader), and an access control device  (e.g. door\/gate access sensor).","In addition, controlling devices may include devices that can be controlled such as a HVAC system  (e.g. heater\/air conditioning system including thermometer, smoke sensor, thermostat), a gate\/door lock, a camera positioning system (e.g. tilt, pan).","The HVAC system , the biometric devices , and the access control device  are located at site A and are connected to the gateway  via LAN .","The gateway  is located at another location site B away from location site A (e.g. different physical locations). An audio\/video device  (e.g. camera, microphone) and an RFID device  (e.g. card reader) are directly connected to gateway . The gateway  communicates with the computer network .","In another embodiment, gateways , , and  from site A communicate with the gateway  from site B. As such, client devices ,  can monitor data from audio\/video device  and RFID device  connected to the gateway  by communicating only with the gateway . Similarly, client devices ,  can monitor data from the HVAC , the biometric device , and the access control device  connected to gateway  by communicating only with the gateway .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2C"],"b":["200","200","202","206","208","210","228","212","202","112","200","102","106","110","208","200","200","208","200","210","208","228","200","228","212","200","206","208","210","200","200","200","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["200","200","212","214","216","212","104","108","200","214","212","214","212","216"]},"In another example, the gateway  also includes an access control API , an access control application module , and access control drivers . The access control API  provides an interface to the web browser  or the client application  of the client device to receive and send data from an access control device (e.g. a door access at a monitored site) connected to the gateway . The access control module  enables the client device to receive data (e.g. time and ID log of the door access at the monitored site) from the access control device via the access control API . In another embodiment, the access control module  enables the client device to send data to the access control device (e.g. open, close, lock door) to the access control device via the access control API . The access control drivers  include one or more drivers for different brand or manufacturer of access control devices.","One advantage of one of the embodiments of the gateway  is the ability to easily connect additional devices or third party devices. This is illustrated with respect to other API , other module , and other drivers . As such, the gateway  is not limited to any particular manufacturer of devices or brand of devices. The gateway  allows for easy expansion and plug-in features using additional APIs, corresponding modules, and corresponding device drivers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["228","200","228","200","104","108","102","106"]},"In one embodiment, the web-based monitoring application  includes a communication module  and a remote devices management module . The communication module  enables communication between the gateway  and the client devices , . The remote devices management module  enables the client devices ,  to monitor or control the monitoring or controlling devices connected to the gateway .","For example, the communication module  includes a user authentication module , a user access policy module , a web server authentication module , and a transport module .","The user authentication module  authenticates a user at the client device based on a user profile of the user. An example of user authentication may include verifying the username and password provided by the client device with a predefined user profile. The predefined user profile may be stored in the storage device  or at the web server .","The user access policy module  limits or grants the user at the client device access to the monitoring and\/or controlling devices connected to the gateway. For example, a user with limited privilege may have access to the monitoring data to a particular site (e.g. first floor only) or a specific monitoring device (e.g. HVAC only). On the other hand, a user with executive privilege may not only be able to view monitoring data and control security devices from more sites.","The web server authentication module  authenticates a communication between the gateway  and the web server . For example, the gateway transmits a unique token to the web server  for authentication prior to establishing the secured communication. Those of ordinary skills in the art will recognize that other means of authentication between the gateway and the web server  may be used.","The transport module  enables peer-to-peer communication between gateways. As such, a client device communicating with one gateway at a first location is also able to communicate with another gateway at a second location.","For example, the remote device management module  of the web-based monitoring application  includes an analytics module , an event aggregation module , an event-based control module , and a client-based control module .","The analytics module  analyzes audio\/video, and other detected changes from the monitoring devices and generates events based on the analysis. For example, the analytics module  is capable of determining how many people have entered or left an activity zone (e.g. a room, a hallway) in a video feed, the direction of the movement of individuals in a video feed, the temperature of individuals in a video feed, facial recognition of individual in a video feed, and so forth. Events are generated based on the analysis and predefined user-configured settings. A user at the client device is able to configure the conditions for generating an event from the web browser  of the client device  or the client application  of the client device .","The event aggregation module  aggregates events generated from the analytics module . For example, events generated based on the analysis and predefined\/user-configured settings are aggregated in a log stored in a storage device attached to the gateway, in a storage device attached to another gateway, in a storage device attached to the web server , or in a storage device connected to the client device.","The event-based control module  communicates a command to at least one controlling device connected to the corresponding gateway based on an event identified in event aggregation module  based on an event configuration. For example, an event comprises a temperature of a room reaching a predefined maximum temperature. The event-based control module  may communicate to the HVAC system to turn on the air conditioning system for the room if such event occurs.","The client-based control module  communicates a command to one or more controlling devices of the corresponding gateway based on a command initiated and communicated from the client device. For example, a user at the client device may initiate a command to pan a camera connected to the gateway. Such command would be communicated to the camera via the client-based control module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["110","110","302","310","302"]},"In one embodiment, the web-based gateway management application  includes a gateway directory manager , a user authentication module , and a gateway authentication module . The gateway directory manager  identifies a gateway associated with a user profile. For example, a user may only be able to access a particular gateway or a particular set of devices connected to a gateway. As such, a west coast manager of an organization may be able to access monitored sites only from west coast stores of the organization. In contrast, a user with higher privileges may be able to access more gateways and devices. As such, the CEO of an organization with stores throughout the U.S. may be able to view monitoring data from all the stores in the U.S.","In another embodiment, the gateway directory manager  includes a service manager module  to enable add-on services to the user at the client device. For example, the add-on services include, but are not limited to, remote storage, remote audio, two-way audio, dynamic backup, or reporting based on the user profile.","The user authentication module  authenticates the web server  with the user at the client device based on the user profile. For example, the web server  verifies the username and password of the user at the client device.","The gateway authentication module  authenticates the identified gateway. For example, the web server  receives a unique token from the identified gateway to authenticate the identified gateway prior to establishing secured communication between the web server and the gateway.","The storage device  may be used to store user profiles, tokens from gateways, a directory of gateways with corresponding devices, services from the gateways, a directory of gateways associated with a user profile, and a directory of connected security devices associated with a user profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","404","406"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["502","504","506","508"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["604","606","608","610"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["704","706","708","710"]},"In another embodiment, the gateway is interfaced with the client device with an application programming interface (API).
