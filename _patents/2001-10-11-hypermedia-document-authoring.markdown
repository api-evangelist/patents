title: Hypermedia document authoring
abstract: A hypermedia authoring system enables an author to generate a document using a goals outline and a presentation outline. The goals outline is generated by instantiating document prototypes. A display of the goals outline permits the author to select a prototype document from a directory of prototype documents and instantiate the selected prototype document that corresponds to a node of the goals outline. The instantiated document prototype is linked to cards in a card database. The presentation outline is displayed as Bento-boxes. Each Bento-box includes spacer objects which are defined spatially and temporally. The spacer objects may be linked to cards. The goals outline is related to the presentation outline based on commonly linked cards. The Bento-boxes may be linked to each other in a stack or hyperlinked to other Bento-boxes via anchors. A display of all the Bento-boxes of a hypermedia document shows a linkage path established by the hyperlinks between Bento-boxes/Bento-box stacks. If both the presentation outline and the goals outline are displayed, selecting a Bento-box or a node of the goals outline causes related nodes or Bento-boxes, respectively, to be highlighted. If a complete goals/presentation outline is selected, the highlighting shows a measure of completeness between the presentation outline and the goals outline. A navigation facility is also provided such as a kitchen, an office or a studio.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a Continuation of application Ser. No. 08\/938,973 filed Sep. 26, 1997.","1. Field of Invention","The present invention relates to a hypermedia authoring system.","2. Description of Related Art","Authoring systems are based on cognitive models for how writing takes place. For example, University of North Carolina's Writing Environment provides four workspaces called the network mode, the tree mode, the editor mode and the text mode. Smith, J. B., and Lansman, M., , TR 87-032, Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (June 1988). The Writing Environment is based on a cognitive model that reflects the need to organize resources before writing and to structure outlines according to both logical and presentational criteria.","Other authoring systems that provide a variety of similar features are summarized as follows: SEPIA is a hypermedia authoring system that has four workspaces: 1) content space, 2) rhetorical space, 3) planning space, and 4) argumentation space. Streitz, N., et al., \u201cSEPIA: A Cooperative Hypermedia Authoring Environment\u201d, In R. Rada (ed.), Groupware and Authoring, Academic Press, London 1996, pp. 241-264. Finally, CMIF provides: 1) a Hierarchy view to edit the hierarchy of a hypermedia document; and 2) a Channel view to specify synchronization among the components. Hardman, L., van Rossum, G., and Bulterman, D. C. A., \u201cStructured Multimedia Authoring\u201d, ACM Multimedia 93 Proceedings (August 1993), pp. 283-289.","However, none of the above authoring schemes support an explicit representation of relationships between the logical and presentational organizations of the document being authored. In addition, current techniques do not provide sufficient support for navigating through the information represented by the workspaces.","The invention provides a hypermedia authoring system that enables an author to generate a document using a goals outline and a presentation outline and provides a technique to relate the goals and the presentation outlines. The goals outline organizes the information content of the document contained in cards in a logical structure while the presentation outline is directed to a physical appearance of the document.","The goals outline is generated by instantiating document prototypes that contain slots which indicate a type of information that is to be included in the document prototype. Each of the slot types may be linked to the cards by links which may be mandatory, optional or user defined. A visual display of the goals outline permits the author to select a prototype document from a directory of prototype documents and instantiate the selected prototype document that corresponds to a node of the goals outline.","Once instantiated, the hypermedia authoring system provides a display that permits the author to link each of the slot types of an instantiated document prototype with cards in a card database. Cards may also be created from scratch by the author or imported from external sources and linked with the instantiated document prototype.","The hypermedia authoring system also provides a display for creating a presentation outline in the form of Bento-boxes. Each Bento-box includes a layout workspace in which spacer objects may be placed. Spatial and temporal parameters may also be specified corresponding to each spacer object. The spacer objects may be linked to cards in the card database and an indication of a link relationship with the goals outline is also provided. When a spacer object is linked to a card that is also linked to a node in the goals outline, the Bento-box indicates such a goals outline relationship. Thus, while constructing a presentation outline, the author is also informed of the portions of the goals outline that is addressed and vice versa.","The Bento-boxes may be linked to each other in a stack for a sequential slide presentation, for example. In addition, the Bento-boxes may be hyperlinked to other Bento-boxes where anchors for the hyperlink may be within any of the spacer objects. Thus, a display of all the Bento-boxes of a hypermedia document including the linkages among the Bento-boxes would show a linkage path established by the hyperlinks between Bento-boxes.","In a display of the presentation outline and the linkage paths, one of the Bento-boxes or a Bento-box stack may be selected to show specifically the links to and from the selected Bento-box. In addition, the presentation outline and the goals outline may be simultaneously displayed showing the relationship between the presentation outline and the goals outline.","For example, if both the presentation outline and the goals outline are displayed and a Bento-box is selected in the presentation outline, corresponding nodes in the goals outline are highlighted to indicate the link between the presentation outline and the goals outline based on the cards that are linked to both of the outlines. The highlighting of the selected Bento-boxes and the corresponding nodes of the goals outline may be color coded to indicate a measure of overlap in terms of the number of cards that are common between the selected Bento-box and the highlighted nodes of the goals outline. The selection of a node in the goals outline results in similar highlighting of related Bento-boxes.","If a complete presentation outline is selected, the highlighting shows a measure of coverage between the presentation outline and the goals outline. That is, by selecting either the complete presentation outline or the complete goals outline, an indication of coverage in terms of the number of cards linked to both the goals and the presentation outlines as compared to the number of cards that are linked only to each of the goals or presentation outlines.","The hypermedia authoring system also provides a navigation facility based on visual metaphors familiar to the author. For example, a kitchen metaphor may be used where card databases are maintained either in cabinets or the freezer compartment of a refrigerator and the cutting board corresponds to a display of the presentation outline. Similar metaphors may be constructed using other familiar scenes such as an office or a studio.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","110","102","104","102","104","106","108","112"]},"The cards in the card database  are information elements (called points) on which the document being authored is based. That is, the cards contain the actual hypermedia information such as video, sound or text that make up the document. The contents of the points may be appropriated from either external sources or created from scratch by the author.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","28","106","30","42","10","28","10","18","20","40","42","40","42","18","20","40","42","10","18","20","18","20","38","18","26","38","26"]},"Local anchors may also be placed in source cards such as shown by link  between cards  and . Local anchors may be used as both source and destination points such as link  between cards  and . All the links - among the cards - establish a relationship network. This relationship among the cards - is established in connection with the presentation outline  described later.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["202","202","1","2","1","204","204","206","214","202"]},"A type is associated with each of the nodes -. For example, description type is associated with nodes ,  and , while a narrative type is associated with node  and an argument type is associated with node . Each of these types indicates the information that is included in the particular portion of the goals outline. To assist the authoring process, templates or document prototypes are provided so that the author may easily \u201cfill in\u201d the required information corresponding to each of the types.","A hypermedia document may be authored in the hypermedia authoring system  by working with the goals outline or the presentation outline in any order or sequence. If the author prefers to first layout the logical structure of the document and then focus on the document's physical appearance, then the author completes the goals outline first and then the presentation outline. If the physical appearance of the document is to be addressed first, then the presentation outline may be completed before the goals outline. In fact, during the course of document authoring, a process of bouncing back and forth between the goals outline and the presentation outline may be most desirable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["202","106","302","304","306","308","304","306","308"]},"As an example, the goals outline  may be constructed as follows: The author selects from the description document prototype  and instantiates the selected prototypes to correspond to nodes ,  and  of the tree view .

For example, the instantiated description document prototype  corresponding to node  may be linked to card  via link  while the description document prototype  corresponding to node  may be linked to card  by link  and the narrative document prototype  corresponding to node  is linked to card  by link .

The controller  may also include a hypermedia engine to perform linking processes required to support the hypermedia authoring system . In the following discussion, the controller  is assumed to be separate from the processors - and performs tasks required to support the processors -. The hypermedia engine functions may be incorporated in any of the processors - as required.","The goals outline processor  processes the goals outline by displaying a goals outline display  on the display device  and generates the goals outline  based on user inputs received through the keyboard\/mouse , for example.  shows the goals outline display  that includes a tree view area , a card link area , and a document prototype legend area . The tree view area  displays the tree view  of the goals outline . Each of the nodes - are represented by square boxes that are connected to a respective icon such as icon  corresponding to node . Each of the icons , , ,  and  are coded, by color for example, based on the document prototype that is instantiated to correspond to the respective nodes -. For example, the icon  is colored blue as represented by the horizontal parallel lines; icon  is colored red as represented by the parallel vertical lines; and icon  is colored green as represented by the parallel slanted lines. As shown in the legend area , the blue color indicated in area  corresponds to a description document prototype; the green color indicated in area  corresponds to an argument prototype; and the red color indicated in area  corresponds to a narrative prototype.","The nodes of the goals outline  may be stored as node cards in the card database . The node cards include all the information associated with the corresponding nodes including the relationships with other goals outline nodes.","The author may instantiate a document prototype for any node - by simply selecting the node using the keyboard\/mouse  and selecting a document prototype via a prototype browser shown in  to be discussed later. After instantiation, the instantiated document prototype may be linked to cards in the card database via the card link area . For example,  shows that node  is selected as indicated by the dotted box . When selected, information regarding the instantiated document prototype is displayed in the card link area . There are four columns in the card link area  as follows: 1) card number ; 2) card name ; 3) slot type ; and 4) link type . Each of the entries - corresponds to a slot type  of the document prototype.","The slot types  of the description document prototype  corresponding to the selected node  are displayed in the card link area . As shown in , entry  indicates that the first card is labeled Evidence and corresponds to the slot type Background. As indicated by the link type \u201cM\u201d, the Background slot type is required to be linked to a card. Entry  indicates that a second card named Folder A is linked to the slot type Constraint and that this is an optional link as indicated by the link type \u201cO\u201d. Entry  indicates that the Nth card named Goals OL C is linked to a User slot type which is a User defined link type indicated by \u201cU\u201d.","The author uses the display shown in  to explicitly link each of the slot types of the instantiated document prototype to a specific card, thus connecting information content of a card to a specific goals outline element. By using the goals outline display , an author generates the goals outline  and connects each element in the goals outline  with the hypermedia information in a logical structure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["500","102","500","510","508","510","604","512","512","508"]},"The prototype display area  includes four columns: prototypes , slot name , link  and inherit . The slot names corresponding to the selected document prototype are listed under the slot name column . For example, for the recipe document prototype  the slot names are Introduction, Process, A\u2192B\u2192C . . . , and Historical. Corresponding to each of the slot names, the prototype display area  suggests a document prototype for further expanding the subject matter of the corresponding slot type in greater detail. For example, the Description document prototype is suggested for further expansion of the Introduction and Process slot names. The Argument document prototype is suggested for further expanding the A\u2192B\u2192C . . . slot name and the Narrative document prototype is suggested for further expanding the Historical slot name.","The link column  indicates the type of links to cards that corresponds to the slot names. For example, links to cards corresponding to Introduction and Process slot names are mandatory while links to cards corresponding to A\u2192B\u2192C . . . and Historical slot names are optional links.","The inherit column  indicates whether the link type for each slot name is inherited from a higher level document prototype. Because document prototypes may be recursively defined (i.e., a document prototype being defined by other document prototypes), the link types of higher level document prototypes may either be applied to the lower level document prototypes such as indicated by the symbol  corresponding to the Process slot name or be overwritten by the lower level document prototype as indicate by the symbol  corresponding to the Historical slot name. Thus, the browser display  provides the author complete flexibility in defining document prototypes and when used in conjunction with the goals outline display  as shown in , and each of the instantiated document prototypes may be linked to a card in the card database .","The presentation outline processor , as shown in , provides support for the author to generate a presentation outline  for the physical appearance of the document.  shows a layout workspace  where the author may generate a physical appearance of the document spatially as well as temporally by placing spacer objects in a spatial layout area  and spacer objects in a sound layout area . For example, the author may place visual spacer objects - and sound spacer objects ,  and  as shown in FIG. .","Each of the spacer objects may be time sequenced using a temporal view  of the layout workspace  as shown in FIG. . For example, image  may be temporally spaced by placing cut , cut  and cut  of the image  in the respective temporal positions. Similarly for the caption , video , sound  and Graphical User Interface (GUI) . In addition, the spacer objects may also be displayed in a logical format  as shown in FIG. .","The spacer objects - in the layout workspace  are linked to corresponding cards by using a Bento-box  (which may be a card) which include the layout workspace as shown in  card link area  shows the cards that are linked to corresponding spacer objects -. For example, the caption spacer object  is highlighted as indicated by the dotted box  and the corresponding card C is also highlighted as indicated by the dotted box . If a spacer object - is linked to more than one card, then all the cards linked to the selected spacer object are highlighted.","In addition to the card link area , the Bento-box  also includes a related goals outline area  that shows related goals outline nodes. The related goals outline nodes are goals outline nodes that are linked to cards which are also linked to spacer objects in the Bento-box . In addition, icons indicating the types of the related goals outline nodes are shown in the area . Thus, Goals OL E is a description type; Goals OL J is a narrative type; and Goals OL B is an argument type based on the legend shown in the legend area  of FIG. . The Bento-box  provides a method for linking the presentation outline to the cards in the card database  which indirectly also links the presentation outline  with the goals outline  as indicated by the related goals outline area .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 15"],"b":["830","840","850","830","1","840","2","850","3","830","840","850","830","840","850","1","902","2","904","3","906","902","906","902","904","906"]},"Bento-boxes  and Bento-box stacks may also be linked in other manners such as shown in FIGS. . In , Bento-box  is linked to Bento-box  sequentially as described earlier but also a spacer object in the Bento-box  may be hyperlinked to a Bento-box  which in turn is hyperlinked to Bento-box . Thus, when the Bento-box  is being presented and the portion hyperlinked to Bento-box  is encountered, the author or a reader of the authored document may select the hyperlink by using the keyboard\/mouse  to begin presentation of the contents of Bento-box . This process may continue from hyperlink to hyperlink to trace out a complete path established by the hyperlinks. Thus, as shown in the bottom of , Bento-box stacks ,  and  are hyperlinked to each other as indicated by the arrows.","Aside from the hyperlinks, Bento-boxes and Bento-box stacks may be linked as individual entities, as shown in FIG. . The Visualization processor  displays Bento-boxes , Bento-box stacks and the connecting links such as links and hyperlinks discussed above.  shows an example of a overview of all the Bento-boxes - in an authored document so that a comprehensive understanding may be obtained regarding the physical appearance of the document. Also, the overview shows unconnected Bento-boxes such as Bento-boxes  and .","When a single Bento-box  or a Bento-box stack is selected, a partial view of the document is provided as shown in FIG. . In particular,  shows the links to and from the Bento-box .","The visualization processor  also provides displays that show a relationship between the goals outline  and the presentation outline , as shown in .  shows a Bento-box link display  and a goals outline display . The Bento-box link display  indicates that Bento-box stack  is selected. Thus, all the links from other Bento-boxes to and from the Bento-box  are also shown.","When a Bento-box stack is selected such as Bento-box stack , the nodes of the goals outline that are related to the selected Bento-box stack  are highlighted based on a color code, for example. A legend  for such a code may also be displayed as in  relationship criteria may be defined by the author based on formulas such as a ratio of the number of cards assigned to the selected Bento-box stack or Bento-box divided by the total number of cards assigned to a single goals outline node. Thus, under this criteria and based on the legend , node  of the goals outline shown in  has a greater ratio than node .","If all the Bento-boxes of the authored document are selected, then the display corresponding to  shows a completeness measure where the number of cards linked to the Bento-boxes are compared to the number of cards linked to the goals outline. Thus, the author is provided an assessment of the progress of the authoring process and the comprehensiveness of the relationship between the goals outline and the presentation outline.

In addition, the soundtrack of the video clip may be also separated into a separate card and placed into the card database  together with the other created cards. During either goals outline generation or presentation outline generation, the author may link the new cards with a spacer object or a slot type corresponding to an instantiated document prototype.","If information to be imported into the terminal  are already structured as cards, then the resource appropriation processor simply imports the additional cards and stores the imported cards in the card database  so that the cards may be linked through either the goals outline  or the presentation outline .","The navigation processor  of the terminal  provides a navigation facility to assist the author with a familiar meta-level GUI such as a kitchen, an office or a studio, to navigate through the large amount of media data in relationship to the goals and presentation outlines  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["1500","1504","1506","1502","102","1508","1510","1512","1508","1514","1516","1518"]},"Similarly,  shows a display of an office  as the meta-level GUI.
