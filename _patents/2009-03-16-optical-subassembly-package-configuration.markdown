{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to an optical subassembly package configuration. More specifically, but without limitation, the present invention relates to built in test optical subassembly technology in fiber optic transceiver packages.","The United States Navy identified the need to incorporate optical built in test technology in avionics fiber optic links. Utilizing currently known methods, isolation accuracy is limited to 33.3% maximum. This poor accuracy is typically caused by ambiguity between the transmitter Weapons Replaceable Assembly (WRA), the receiver WRA, and the fiber optic cabling between the WRAs.","Thus, there is a need for laser power monitoring and laser reflectometry monitoring for isolating faults down to the fiber optic transmitter, receiver, and cable plant level.","The present invention is directed to an optical subassembly package configuration that meets the needs enumerated above and below.","The present invention is directed to an optical subassembly package configuration for monitoring a fiber. The configuration includes a container, an optical subassembly, an optical fiber, and a ferrule. The container has a face, and the optical subassembly is disposed within the container. The optical fiber communicates with the subassembly and extends out from the subassembly. The ferrule is attached to the face of the container, the fiber being monitored terminates inside the ferrule.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide an optical subassembly package configuration that enables laser power monitoring and cable plant reflectometry monitoring in a silicon optical bench built in test optical subassembly fiber optic transceiver module packaging configuration.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example below and in . As seen in , the optical subassembly package configuration  for monitoring a fiber  includes a container , an optical subassembly , an optical fiber , a nosetube , a ferrule  and lenses  for transferring light or signals in and out of the container . The container  has a face  (a face may be defined, but without limitation, as a bounding surface of a solid figure), and the optical subassembly  and the optical fiber  are disposed within the container . The nosetube , proximate to the container , extends from the face  of the container . The optical fiber  extends from the optical subassembly  to or toward the face  of the container . The optical fiber  communicates with the optical subassembly  such that a signal from the optical subassembly  passes through the optical fiber , through the nosetube  via the lenses  to the fiber  being monitored such that faults on the fiber  being monitored can be located. The ferrule  is attached to the face  of the container  via the nosetube , the fiber  being monitored extends from the ferrule , typically away from the nosetube  and the container .","In the description of the present invention, the invention will be discussed in an avionic or aircraft fiber link environment; however, this invention can be utilized for any type of need that requires use of a optical bench fiber optic transmitter or transceiver optical subassembly. The package configuration  may be used, but without limitations, in military operations, communications, and various other electronic uses. Additionally, the same techniques and\/or package configuration described here for laser diodes can be applied to surface emitting and edge emitting LEDs, as well as other types of lasers.","The optical subassembly package configuration  may include a connector . The ferrule  and part of the fiber  being monitored may be disposed within the connector . As shown in , the fiber  being monitored may extend from the ferrule  out from the connector . The connector  may be attachable to the nosetube .","A container  may be described as anything that can hold or include something within its volume. The container  may be manufactured from any material practicable, such as for example, without limitation, metal, plastic, ceramic, etc. As shown in , at least one lens  may be disposed in the container . In the preferred embodiment the lens  may be disposed at or near the face of the container  proximate to the optical fiber , near the nosetube , and\/or within the nosetube .  shows a lens  disposed within the nosetube , and a lens  disposed within the container  near the face  of the container . The lenses  are aligned such that light or signals can pass from the optical fiber , through the nosetube  to the fiber  being monitored.","An optical subassembly  may be described as an apparatus that can perform optical power monitoring, and\/or determine, isolate or identify faults in a fiber optic link, as well as other information regarding fibers. The preferred optical subassembly is a Built-In-Test (BIT) optical subassembly; however, any type of optical assembly may be utilized.","An optical fiber  may be defined, but without limitation as, a waveguide medium used to transmit information via light impulses rather than through the movement of electrons. The preferred optical fiber  is a multimode optical fiber transmitting in the about 800 to about 1600 nm range. The optical fiber  may be actively aligned to the lenses  and locked in place inside the container .","A ferrule  may be defined as, a component (usually a rigid tube) used to align and protect the stripped end of a fiber. The fiber  being monitored enters the connector  and may be bonded to the ferrule  and polished for splitting or connecting two fibers together. The ferrule  keeps the fiber  accurately aligned within the connector . Ferrules  can be made of glass, plastic, metal, ceramic material, or any material practicable. The ferrule  may be either fixed or detachable.","The nosetube  may be soldered, welded or brazed to the connector  which contains the ferrule . The ferrule  may be rigidly attached to the nosetube  in a manner that allows an external fiber optic connector to be attached and de-attached (mated and de-mated) from the container .","The package configuration  operates as a digital fiber optic transmitter whereby digital optical pulses are emitted from the fiber  being monitored. The built in test capability is enabled by the optical subassembly  within the package. Electronic circuitry drives the optical subassembly  light source, which is preferably a laser diode, contained within the package configuration . Electronic circuitry receives and processes photocurrent signals generated from a photodetector inside the optical subassembly . The photocurrent signals then pass through the optical fiber , through the nosetube  via the lenses , to the ferrule  then into and through the fiber  being monitored and then back to the optical subassembly  along the same path. The photodetector is excited by reflected light signals returned from the fiber  being monitored and by light emitted by the optical subassembly  light source. Thus, the package can operate in two modes; 1) as a digital optical transmitter with laser diode power monitoring, and 2) a fiber optic light source and detector combination that enables fiber optic link faults to be identified in situ without having to disconnect connectors or using external test equipment to troubleshoot the fiber optic link. When operating in the digital optical transmitter mode the transmitter is excited with digital electrical signal pulses which are converted to optical signal pulses inside the package. The laser power monitoring circuitry acts as a feedback loop to control the optical power emitted from the fiber  being monitored. When operating in the fiber optic fault link mode the optical subassembly  light source is biased at a predetermined voltage and excited with short electrical pulses which are converted to short optical pulses emitted from the fiber . The reflected optical pulse excites the optical subassembly  photodetector at a time period proportional to the distance where the reflection occurred. The time period information is processed by a microprocessor integrated circuit which calculates the actual distance of fiber optic failure.","When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements. The terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements.","Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to a certain preferred embodiments thereof, other embodiments are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred embodiment(s) contained herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims, and accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
