Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to a communication network, and more specifically to a free space optical communication network.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Due to the absence of fiber in many areas of the world, broadband media is being delivered via satellite, coaxial cable, and over copper phone lines using various forms of digital subscriber line. These systems provide limited and restricted services. Additionally, these are costly systems and require large amounts of time and resources to implement. The use of coaxial cable and phone lines require gaining access to property (both public and private) to lay the cable and lines. This in itself can be cost prohibitive. Often, laying these cables requires the cables to be installed under ground requiring roads to be dug up and heavy equipment to be utilized. In rural areas the equipment often is unavailable. Thus, establishing these previous networks is extremely time consuming, disruptive to the community and extremely costly.","These previous systems also introduce a large amount of latency in the signal transmission. Using a satellite-based asynchronous system involves having the phone line as a back channel through the public switched telephone network to switch between different media, data or information, if these options are available. This creates a very long loop delay. Similar latency problems exist for digital cable systems that attempt to provide each user with a restricted bandwidth with a switched head end.","The present invention advantageously addresses the needs above as well as other needs through a method and apparatus for communicating over free-space fiber links. The optical communication network includes a plurality of buildings, wherein each building houses at least one of a residence and a business; a plurality of free-space optical links, where each of the plurality of optical links is defined between two of the plurality of buildings and data is communicated across the plurality of optical links; each of the plurality of buildings includes a distribution system configured to receive the data communicated across at least one of the plurality of optical links and to distribute the data to an intended recipient within the building; the plurality of optical links are configured to form a network topology providing alternate communication paths for at least two of the plurality of buildings; and an external network is coupled with the optical communication network, wherein at least some of the data is communicated between the external network and the optical communication network.","Additionally, the present invention provides a method of communicating optical signals. The method includes the steps of: establishing a plurality free-space optical communication links between a plurality of buildings, wherein each of the plurality of buildings houses at least one of a business and a residence; providing at least one alternate communication path within the network through at least one of the plurality of free-space links; optically communicating data over the plurality of free-space links; receiving the data at a first building; and distributing at least a first portion of the data throughout the first building to at least one recipient, where the recipient is one of the business and the residence.","In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a communication network including building distribution systems. The building distribution system includes a first rooftop transceiver mounted on a building and configured to transmit and receive optical signals over free space; and a first passive optical deflector (POD) mounted on the building and optically aligned with both the first rooftop transceiver and a first customer premise equipment (CPE), wherein the first POD is configured to receive a first optical signal from the first rooftop transceiver and redirect substantially all of the first optical signal to the first CPE providing a first optical communication path between the first rooftop transceiver and the first CPE, and wherein the first POD is configured to receive a second optical signal from the first CPE and redirect substantially all of the second optical signal to additional equipment extending the first communication path between the first CPE and the additional equipment.","In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for communicating over free space links. The method includes the steps of generating a first optical communication signal and transmitting the first optical signal at least in part over free space along an exterior of a building; redirecting the first optical signal to be received by a first customer premise equipment (CPE); the first CPE receiving the first optical signal; the first CPE re-transmitting at least a portion of the first optical signal; redirecting for a first instance the first optical signal re-transmitted by the first CPE over free space along the exterior of the building; redirecting for a second instance the first optical signal re-transmitted by the first CPE to be received by a second CPE; and the second CPE receiving the first optical signal.","In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a system for optical communications. The system includes a distribution system including: a first premise equipment means for receiving and transmitting optical signals; a second premise equipment means for receiving and transmitting optical signals; an optical signal initiation means for transmitting a first optical signal across free space; a first redirecting means for receiving the first optical signal from the optical signal initiation means and for redirecting substantially all of the first optical signal to the first premise equipment means; a second redirecting means for receiving a second optical signal from the first premise equipment means and for redirecting substantially all of the second optical signal; and a third redirecting means for receiving the second optical signal from the second redirecting means and for redirecting substantially all of the second optical signal to the second premise equipment means.","A better understanding of the features and advantages of the present invention will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description of the invention and accompanying drawings which set forth an illustrative embodiment in which the principles of the invention are utilized.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding components throughout the several views of the drawings.","The following description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the invention. The scope of the invention should be determined with reference to the claims.","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for establishing free space optical communication. Due to the absence of fiber in many areas of the world, broadband media is being delivered via satellite, coaxial cable, and over copper phone lines using various forms of digital subscriber lines. The present free-space optics network solves many of the restrictions of previous networks. The present invention provides a digital network that is based on communicating over one or more free space channels or free space fibers. The inventive network offers communication of a broad range of digital media beginning with a single connection to an existing network, such as an optical fiber network and extending the reach of the fiber to both businesses and residents. The reach is extended by utilizing free space links, thus avoiding the need to install costly fiber optic lines, coaxial cables and phone lines. In one embodiment, the invention utilizes a multi-cast Internet Protocol based system that allows several types of media to be delivered to recipients (for example, to both homes and businesses) with various bandwidths and qualities of service customized to each recipient.","The free-space fiber network can be established using both residential and business buildings, for example in a metropolitan area.  depicts a simplified block diagram of one implementation of one embodiment of a free space network  of the present invention providing communication for both business and residential multi-tenant buildings  over free space fibers or links . As one example, the buildings are connected using ring  and spur  topologies of the free-space fiber network . A ring and spur network topology in which both residences and businesses share the free-space network  is one example of several optimal configurations. A ring network  having one or more rings connecting high speed business customers with one or more spurs  off the one or more ring networks connecting residential customers is one example of an efficient and economic network configuration. The ring and spur configuration provides redundancy to protect against link failure. In one embodiment, the network is configured as a mesh network providing link failure protection and alternate routing. The network  can couple with an external network  allowing communication of data into and out of the network .","In one embodiment, the network  operates all optically. Once data, information and\/or signals are received into the network, the data, information and\/or signals are converted to an optical signal, if they are not received as an optical signal. The optical signal is then communicated across the free-space fibers as optical beams directed from optical transmitters to optical receivers. Once at the residence or business, the optical signal is then converted to an electronic signal for use by the customer's equipment, such as a computer, a set top box (STB) or other devices.","In one embodiment, the media communicated over the network  includes both broadcast and on-demand data, including video, voice, data, audio, and substantially any other media that can be communicated, including media transmitted over an IP-based multi-cast network. The bandwidth savings achieved using a multi-cast network occurs, in part, when each user selects a different digital media source through a computer, (STB) or other network access device that directs or couples the media from a multi-cast controller or digital head end controller to the correct multi-cast address for one or more subscribers. The system can support both broadcast type media and on-demand material, such as stored digital movies on a server.","In one embodiment, each subscriber, whether business or residential, can be allocated a fixed amount of bandwidth independently and allowing each subscriber to use the shared backbone network aggregate available. For instance, using a free-space fiber optical link  in a backbone ring  that supports gigabit rates, the present network is capable of providing 100 or more channels of MPEG-2 video at 3 Mbps each stream and video on demand to another 100 or more users simultaneously. Additionally, a connection or point of presence (POP) to an external network , such as the Internet, can also be switched into the network and bundled with other services like voice over IP (VOIP) and other services and information available over the Internet. Another advantage of the present system is the low inherent latency through the free-space fiber optical links . For example, the present invention can provide a latency of less than 1 microsecond through each link allowing the subscriber to select different media from the head end control equipment at a very rapid switching rate. This low-latency feature makes switching channels happen at an acceptable delay to the end user. Previous satellite-based asynchronous systems involve having the phone line as a back channel through the public switched telephone network to accomplish a similar task. This creates a very long loop delay compared to what is possible with the present free-space fiber network. Similar latency problems exist for digital cable systems that attempt to provide each user with a restricted bandwidth with a switched head end.","Another advantage of the free-space fiber network  is that a new link can be established in hours versus months and potentially years with previous systems waiting for copper or optical fiber cable to be installed.","The present terrestrial-based free-space fiber network and method provide interactivity. For example, a user receiving a video on demand service can choose to rewind or fast forward the video as if it were running from a VCR over a truly interactive digital network. The free-space fiber network provides this interactive capability with only very minimal latency. Satellites are good for broadcast media but fail to deliver user interactivity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","150","160","161","162","120","156","160","161","162","158","158","166"]},"The optical transceiver can be mounted on a building, antenna or other structure. The transceiver  receives the data and generates an optical beam that is directed across one or more free space links , such that the data is communicated through the beam over the free space link to be received by one or more optical transceivers . Typically, the transceivers are mounted on a building . The mounting can be on the roof, a balcony, on an exterior wall or other position on the building to provide a line of sight free-space optical link  between two transceivers on different buildings. Once the data is received by a receiving transceivers , all, a subset or none of the data can be distributed throughout the building  to the appropriate customers in the building , or forwarded over additional free-space fiber links  to other transceivers on other buildings throughout the free-space network .","In one embodiment, a transceiver  on a building  couples with a router or other device (not shown) capable of determining if a portion of the data received by the transceiver is to be delivered to a customer housed within the building. If data is intended for a customer, the routing device forwards the portion of data to the customer. Typically the free-space network  is configured such that each building  includes a distribution system (described more fully below) to distribute data received by transceivers and to forward data from customers to the transceivers to be communicated across the network  to other buildings and\/or to external network(s) \u2013.","The network  is further configured to allow transceivers to receive data from the external networks \u2013 or other optical transceivers  on other buildings and can re-transmit the data across the free-space network  to other buildings or external networks. For example, still referring to , a first transceiver on a first building can receive a first set of data from an external network (e.g., the satellite network ). The transceiver can receive the data over a first free space link or through direct coupling to the switch . A second transceiver can generate an optical signal to communicate a second set of data over a second free space link to a third transceiver on a second building . The second set of data communicated to the third transceiver can include data received by the first transceiver and\/or data generated by one or more customers within the first building ","Some, none or all of the data received by the third transceiver can be distributed throughout the second building . A fourth transceiver on the second building can generate an optical signal to transmit a third set of data over a third free space link to a fifth transceiver on a third building . Again, the data transmitted by the fourth transceiver can include data received by the third transceiver and\/or new data generated by one or more customers within the second building . The data received by the fifth transceiver can be distributed throughout the third building . A sixth transceiver can communicate a fourth set of data to the first transceiver over a fourth free space link establishing a ring topology , where the data can include data received by the fifth transceiver or new data from one or more customers in the third building ","Additionally, the first transceiver can communicate data from the free space network  to the switch  over the first free space link or direct coupling to be distributed to one or more external networks \u2013.","In one embodiment, the switch  includes one or more free space optical transceiver for communicating with one or more transceivers  of the network . The router or switch  can be substantially any router or switch capable of routing data to and from the free space optical network , for example the switch can be implemented through a GbE switch, a Cisco 2900MXL switch, a Cisco Catalyst 2948G (from Cisco Systems, U.S., California), or substantially any other device capable of providing switching or routing of data. The switch  can further be configured to provide communication to and from the free-space network  and the external networks \u2013 in substantially any protocol.","In one embodiment, the network  includes a network controller or control center  located anywhere in the network. The control center provides any number of control functions. The control center can be configured to monitor and control some or all of the activation and deactivation of the distribution of data and\/or information to recipients. The control center  can couple with the network through direct coupling or through wireless links . In one embodiment, the control center is distributed through the network  to collect network data. The control center can monitor the free-space network  to determine if faults occur and issue alternate routing or actions to compensate for the fault. The control center  can further optimizes bandwidths by providing communication instructions for some signals. As an example, the control center may issue priorities for different media such that media with higher priories are given bandwidth over those of lower priority.","In one embodiment, the control center  monitors the network traffic and determines billing for network use and access. The control center can be utilized to manage customers, support services and aid in collecting money. A billing system within the control center can provide billing based on usage. The control center allows Internet and broadband content, service and application providers to sell, deploy and\/or distribute content, services or applications, track the content, services or applications deployed or used, and bill for the content, services and\/or applications based on actual or potential use, or other criteria. As such, the free-space network  allows content, service and application providers to profit on products and\/or information provided by the business infrastructure solutions of the network . The control center  can track and supplement interactions and transactions between content, service, application and network providers, as well as between providers and users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["120","122","120","170","124","175","124","122","166","172","172","174","172","174","175","122","174","174"],"i":["a ","a\u2013c"]},"In one embodiment, the internal wiring systems receive the data and routes the data through internal system hubs, switches or routers  to an intended customer . The building switch  is capable of communicating the data through substantially any type of internal system  including, Ethernet cable, coaxial cable, twisted wire pair, RC networks, fiber optics and substantially any other system. The building switch  includes network interfaces to couple with the one or more distribution systems , such as RJ45 interfaces, fiber optic transceivers, and substantially any other interface.","The customers  can additionally forward data over one or more internal systems  to be received by the building switch . The building switch forwards the data from the customer to one or more optical transceivers  to be transmitted over one or more of the free space links  distributing the data over the free space network  to other buildings and\/or to external networks.","Referring to , there is a simplified block diagram illustrating a building  that includes a multi-tenant unit (MTU) optical data distribution network  made in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The MTU optical network  may also be referred to as a multi-dwelling unit (MDU) optical network. The MTU network  couples with the free-space network  to receive data from the network  and distribute the data to customers within the building, and to communicate data from the customers to the free-space network . In the embodiment shown, the MTU optical network  includes a customer distribution unit (CDU)  (alternatively referred to as a subscriber distribution unit (SDU) ), one or more rooftop transceivers , one or more passive optical deflectors (PODs) , and customer premise equipment (CPE) .","The rooftop transceivers  preferably comprise optical transceivers mounted to the edge of the building rooftop , and couple with the CDU . The PODs  optically align with one or more rooftop transceivers  such that the rooftop transceivers  transmit and receive optical signals  to and from the PODs . The PODs further optically align with one or more CPEs . Typically, each POD aligns with one CPE . The PODs  receive the optical signals and direct or steer the optical signals to be received by the CPE , and receives optical signals from the CPEs and directs the optical signals to be received by the rooftop transceiver . The PODs  preferably direct substantially all of the optical signals to the CPE  or to the rooftop transceivers . By directing the optical signal, a POD  allows a building tenant to receive a high bandwidth optical signal without the need for wiring the building . In one embodiment, the PODs are mounted to the building windows , and redirect the optical signals through the building window  to be received by the CPE  and redirect the optical signals from the CPE to the rooftop transceiver.","In one embodiment, the MTU network  does not include rooftop transceivers, but includes alternate optical signal initiation means or sources. For example, the CDU  can couple directly to a CPE transceiver  that is the highest on the building . The CPE transceiver then initiates the optical communication signal to a POD , which in turn redirects the optical signal to one or more PODs and thus one or more other CPEs.","In one embodiment, the CDU  couples with the free-space communication network  providing communication of data and information to and from the MTU network . The term data is used to describe any communication across the MTU network  and communication across the free-space network , including both digital and analog signals carrying information, audio, services, instructions, applications, processes and substantially any other data that can be communicated.","In one embodiment, the CDU  couples with a free-space optical transceiver , such as a laser link head . The laser link head  provides communication with the free-space optical network . The laser link head  may operate as an electro-optical device converting between optical and electrical, or operate all optically. For example, the laser link head  may provide strictly optical communication where the link head receives optical communication signals  over a free-space link  from a second link head  located at some distance, for example, located atop a second building . The link head  then forwards an optical signal across a communication cable  to be distributed through the MTU network . In this scenario the communication cable  would comprise a fiber optic cable or the like. Additionally, the link head receives optical signals through the communication cable  and transmits an optical signal  across the free-space link .","In one embodiment, the link head  receives optical signal and converts the signal to an electrical signal. The link head then converts the electrical signal to an optical signal and forwarded the optical signal across the fiber optic cable  to the CDU .","Alternatively, the link head  can provide electro-optical communication where the link head  receives an optical signal  from the second link head , converts the optical signal to an electric signal and forwards the signal over a communication cable  to be distributed through the MTU network . In this scenario the communication cable  would comprise an electric transmission line or the like. Additionally, the link head receives electrical signals through the communication cable , converts the electrical signal to an optical signal and transmits the optical signal  across one or more free-space links .","In one embodiment, the MTU network  couples with the free-space network  from the rooftop through the optical transceiver link head  to the CDU . As such, the customers are able to communication both within the MTU network  and with the free-space network  (e.g., phone lines coupled throughout the world). Communication received from the free-space network  is sent to the CDU  where the CDU directs the signal to an appropriate rooftop transceiver . In one embodiment, the CDU  includes routing capabilities to determine which of the plurality of rooftop transceiver are to receive the signal. Alternatively, the CDU distributes or routes the signal to each rooftop transceiver and each rooftop transceiver forwards the signal to be received and processed by the appropriate destination CPE.","Once routing is determined, the CDU  sends the signal to one or more of the rooftop optical transceivers . The rooftop optical transceiver  forwards the signal to one or more PODs . The signal can be sent from the CDU to the rooftop transceiver  as an optical signal over a fiber optic cable or as an electrical signal through a transmission line where the rooftop transceiver converts the electrical signal into an optical signal.","The rooftop transceiver  generates an optical signal and transmits the optical signal  over free space, typically along the exterior of the building . The rooftop transceiver  directs the optical signal  to impinge on one or more PODs . The POD  redirects the optical signal to a customer, for example, through the customer's (or tenant's) premise window . The transmitted signal  from the rooftop transceiver  typically spans a sufficient distance to reach the first POD . By way of example, this range can be as far as 300 meters or more, limited only by the height of the building and the precision of the transmission source (e.g., a laser) of the rooftop transceiver . Typically, the optical signal  is generated through a laser (not shown). The beam divergence, wavelength, and signal power are configurable parameters for the MTU system .","The POD  receives the optical signal  and redirects the signal through the customer premise window , to be received by the CPE . Advantageously, the optical delivery system provided by the MTU optical network  of the present invention does not require installing or stringing electrical wires, fiber optic cable or fiber risers throughout the building to deliver data to the end user, e.g., the customer.","In one embodiment, the CDU  is positioned on the rooftop  of the building  and constructed to operate in all weather conditions. Alternatively, the CDU  may be co-located with other indoor network equipment. For example, the CDU  may be located within the building  near routing\/switching equipment. In the illustrated embodiment, the CDU  includes eight optical transceiver interfaces , but it should be well understood that any number of interfaces may be included. The interfaces  couple with the rooftop transceiver , and transmit and receive signals to and from the rooftop transceivers .","The CDU  may include an electrical data transceiver source or a passive optical network (PON) data transceiver source. For the PON scenario the rooftop transceivers  may be optically coupled to the optical transceiver interfaces  of the CDU . For example, the rooftop transceivers  may be fed by single or multi-mode fiber  from the CDU , which may operate at substantially any bit rate appropriate for the application. Similarly, the CDU  may be fed by single or multi-mode fiber  from the laser link head , again operating at various bit rates. In a scenario where the CDU  comprises an electrical data transceiver source, electrical signals from the layer 2\/3 device are converted to optical signals through the rooftop transceivers .","Referring to , there is illustrated a simplified block diagram of two PODs , each optically coupled with a CPE transceiver , respectively. Further, the first POD is optically aligned and coupled with a rooftop transceiver , and the second POD is optically aligned with the first POD and thus coupled with the rooftop transceiver  through optical communication paths , . In the embodiment shown in , the transmit and receive paths are distinct, however, a single, collinear path can be utilized for both the transmit and receive paths. The optical transmit and receive signals may utilize substantially any wavelength. By way of example, a single wavelength signal at 850 nm may be used for a signal  transmitted by the rooftop transceiver , and a single wavelength signal at 850 nm may be used for the signal  received by the rooftop transceiver . By way of another example, wavelengths in the range of 1330 nm may be used for the transmit signal  and wavelengths in the range of 1500 nm may be used for the receive signal . The power level of the transmit and receive signals are of sufficient power to propagate to the POD  or to the rooftop transceiver  such that the signal is accurately received. By way of example, signal power for the transmitter in the rooftop transceivers  may be 3 mW IEC class IIIA. Further, the dynamic range for the receiver in the rooftop transceivers  is sufficient to accurately receive the optical signals. For example, the dynamic range for the receiver of the rooftop transceiver may be \u221245 to \u221212 dBm. It should be well understood, however, that various other specifications may be used in accordance with the present invention. The transmitter and receiver of the CPE transceiver  can be similarly configured; however, alternate configurations may be employed, as would be apparent to one skilled in the art.","The POD  is constructed to optically redirect optical signals to and from the CPE transceiver . Typically, the redirection of the optical signals is achieved through reflection or deflection of the signals. The PODs  are configured to minimize attenuation of the redirected signals. Further, the PODs  are constructed to minimize or prevent water beading to avoid signal distortion and minimize or prevent dust and dirt particles from settling on the surfaces of the POD , which can adversely affect the optical signals. The body of the PODs  can be made from substantially any material capable of passing optical signals including glass, plastic and other such material. In one embodiment, the body of the PODs are made of an optically transparent material that is transparent for a narrow wavelength band. Alternatively, the PODs are constructed from substantially any optically transparent material. In one embodiment, the PODs  are made strictly of glass. Such PODs  are passive components rather than active. Therefore, the MTU optical network  of the present invention may be referred to as an MTU \u201csemi-PON\u201d.","The PODs  can have substantially any geometric shape allowing the optical signals to be redirected by the reflective elements ,  within the POD. For example, the POD can have a triangular, pyramid, hyperbolic or other shape that allows the optical signal to pass into the POD and be redirected by one or more reflective elements to be received by a CPE. The POD can also be configured to redirect the optical signal to impinge upon another POD to allow the other POD to direct the signal a CPE or yet another POD. For example, a first POD can redirect an optical signal horizontally to a second POD. For example, the second POD can be positioned on a corner of the building allowing the redirection of the signal to another side of the building and thus to other customers within the building. This can be utilized to reduce the number of rooftop transceivers needed to establish a plurality of communication paths.","Still referring to , each POD  includes one or more reflective elements . The reflective element  can be formed through air pockets (or air cavities), reflective mirrors, materials within the POD body for redirecting the optical signals, and the like. In one embodiment, the POD  includes one or more air pockets ,  that provide reflective surfaces , , , and  upon which optical signals reflect. In one embodiment the air pockets are generally \u201cV\u201d shaped. Typically, a first air pocket  is included for redirecting signals  transmitted from the rooftop transceiver  or other optical signal initiation source. The POD  can include a second air pocket  for redirecting a signal  from a CPE transceiver  to be received by the rooftop transceiver . Preferably, the divergence of the beam impinging on a reflective element ,  is limited such that the beam width does not exceed the width of the reflective element , . By way of example, the reflective index for the air pockets ,  within the POD glass may be one (1), and each of the air pockets ,  may be 4 cm wide. With a 4 cm wide reflective element , , the transmit and receive beam divergence is preferably less than 1.5 mRad such that the beam width at a range of  meters does not exceed the width of the air pockets ,  within the POD  (4 cm). In some embodiments, attenuation of beams passing through and being redirected by the POD  is approximately 3 dB. The width of the reflective elements ,  can be substantially any size. However, the width is preferably limited to avoid an excessively large POD.","In one embodiment, the POD is configured such that the first reflective element  is offset from the second reflective element . Thus, two independent optical communication paths  and  are provided. Typically, these optical communication paths  and  are substantially parallel and non-collinear. However, these communication paths do not have to be parallel. In one embodiment, the POD can include only a single reflective element such that the first and second communication paths are collinear. The offset of the two reflective elements  and  can be along a Y-axis, along an X-axis or some combination, for example, along the X and Y, X and Z, or X, Y and Z-axes.","In operation a first optical signal  transmitted by the rooftop transceiver  impinges on the first reflective surface  of the first reflective element . The first reflective element redirects the first optical signal  to be received by the first CPE transceiver . The first CPE transceiver transmits a second optical signal  to impinge on the second reflective surface  of the first reflective element , which in turn redirects the second optical signal  to impinge on the first reflective element of the second POD . In one embodiment, the first CPE transceiver re-transmits or reflects the first optical signal to produce the second optical signal. The second optical signal can also include data from the first optical signal and data added by the first CPE transceiver . Further, the second optical signal can include data from the first optical signal excluding data intended for the first CPE transceiver ","The first reflective element of the second POD redirects the second optical signal  to be received by the second CPE transceiver . The second CPE transceiver can transmit a third optical signal  to impinge on the first reflective element , which redirects the third optical signal to additional equipment, such as other PODs and CPEs if other PODs and CPEs exist in the communication paths.","The second POD is further configured to receive a fourth optical signal  from additional equipment (not shown) and to redirect the fourth optical signal to be received by the second CPE transceiver . The second CPE transceiver can additionally transmit a fifth optical signal  to impinge on the second surface of the second reflective element of the second POD . The fifth optical signal  can include all or part of the fourth optical signal, and may also include additional information provided by the second CPE transceiver . The second reflective element redirects the fifth optical signal  to impinge on the first reflective surface  of the second reflective element of the first POD , which in turn redirects the fifth optical signal to the first CPE transceiver . The first CPE transceiver can transmit a sixth optical signal  to impinge on the second reflective surface  of the second reflective element of the first POD , which in turn redirects the sixth optical signal  to be received by the rooftop transceiver .","The POD  is typically designed to deflect the signals 90 degrees from the angle of impact, but this is not required and can be substantially any angle for alignment with the CPE . The POD  is preferably designed to provide maximal water beading to prevent dirt particles from settling on the upper surface of the external body. The POD  is typically mounted to the surface area of the external building window . However, alternative mountings can be employed as would be apparent to one skilled in the art. As an optional feature, the POD  may be equipped with a safety mounting cable such that the POD  can be attached to a mounting point on or near the window.","Still referring to , the CPE transceivers may be used to receive the optical signals deflected from the PODs . In one embodiment, signals transmit from and receive by the CPE transceiver  (e.g., first and sixth optical signals , , respectively) are separate and distinct; however, the transmit and receive paths can be a single path where the signals are separated by the CPE transceiver. Transmit signals  from the rooftop transceiver  (or another CPE and POD) are deflected from the first available POD into the receive port RX of the CPE transceiver, for example, first CPE transceiver . If data carried by the optical signal  is addressed to the first CPE transceiver , then the first CPE transceiver processes the signal , allowing the customer access to the data. If the signal includes data that is not intended for the first CPE transceiver , then the first CPE transceiver , routes or re-transmits the optical signal, and thus the data, back to the first POD using transmit port TX producing the second optical signal . Attenuation introduced by the POD  is preferably compensated for by the first CPE transceiver at the transmit port TX. By way of example, the signal power for the CPE transmitters may be 3 mW class IIIA, and the dynamic range for the CPE receivers may be \u221245 to \u221212 dBm. In one embodiment, the POD and CPE equipment are co-located allowing the reduction of the size of the PODs and the transmit and receive apertures of the CPE equipment.","The CPE transceivers  may be either active or passive in accordance with the present invention. Active CPE transceivers  perform routing, while passive CPE transceivers  simply pass the traffic along to customer equipment. The following discussion focuses on a comparison of an active versus passive CPE transceiver .","Referring to , there is illustrated an active CPE transceiver \u2032 made in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The active CPE transceiver \u2032 includes a router . The active CPE transceiver \u2032 receives the first optical signal  from a rooftop transceiver of other CPE\/POD and processes the signal by looking at the packets or cells. The active CPE \u2032 determines whether or not the packets or cells are intended for its particular customer site to determine whether or not to pass along the packets. In one embodiment, the active CPE transceiver \u2032 is targeted at a specific protocol or group of protocols (e.g., IP, ATM, etc.).","If the active CPE transceiver \u2032 determines that the data is intended for its particular customer site, the router  directs a signal  containing the data to be forwarded to the customer equipment  (for example, a hub, a switch, a router, a computer, a server and other such equipment). If it is determined that the data is not intended for its particular customer site, the router  directs a signal , providing the second optical signal , back to the POD  to be forwarded to the next POD and CPE along the communication path  (see ). The optical signal  is re-transmitted by the CPE and impinges on the second surface  of the first reflective element  of the POD  and is redirected to the next POD (e.g., POD , see ) to be again redirected by the next POD into the next CPE transceiver, (e.g., second CPE transceiver ).","The CPE equipment  is further configured to allow communication of data within both the MTU distribution network  and the free-space network  (see ). The customer equipment  can generate a CPE transmit signal . The CPE transmit signal  is received by the active CPE transceiver \u2032. The active CPE transceiver \u2032 incorporates or multiplexes the CPE transmit signal  with signals received from other equipment (e.g., fifth optical signal ), if present, and forwards the sixth optical signal , including the CPE transmit signal , to be reflected by the second surface  of the second reflective element  of the POD  back to the rooftop transceiver  or to a next POD.","In one embodiment, a fifth optical signal  received from another CPE\/POD is forwarded to the router  to determine if the fifth signal includes data intended for the customer equipment . If the fifth signal  does include data for the CPE equipment, the router  routes the data to the customer equipment . If the fifth optical signal  does not include data for the CPE equipment, the router  redirects the fifth optical signal to be transmitted as the sixth optical signal  to impinge on the second reflective element  of the POD  to be redirected to the rooftop transceiver or equipment of the MTU network  (e.g., another POD\/CPE).","Providing active routing allows the customer to use equipment that runs at a slower speed than the MTU optical network , which can be advantageous in crowded buildings that would require very fast networks. This ability could be extended to throttling, which allows different customers to pay for different amounts of bandwidth, which would then be regulated by, for example, the CPE transceiver \u2032. The network service provider can provide in a separate component or box the routing and throttling functions. Another advantage of an active system is the ability to provide additional levels of security. For example, by utilizing the active routing, the system  is capable of determining which customers are entitled to receive specific data, establishing a layer of security that can be used for the establishment of Virtual Private networks between floors. Thus, an active system can provide for lower customer speeds and added network security.","Referring to , there is illustrated two passive CPE transceivers \u2033 and \u2033 made in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Unlike their active counterparts, the passive CPE transceivers \u2033 act on the physical layer leaving routing to customer equipment . Advantageously, a passive system allows the CPE transceiver \u2033 and customer equipment  to be used in a wider variety of applications. For example, transceivers can be configured in one of two modes: standard or endpoint. The lowest CPE transceiver in the building along an optical communication path is configured as an endpoint CPE \u2033, and the remainder of the CPE transceivers in the optical communication path are configured as standard transceivers \u2033.","A first optical signal  received at a standard CPE transceiver \u2033 is passed by the CPE transceiver \u2033 to the CPE equipment . In one embodiment, the CPE transceiver \u2033 forwards the signal to the standard CPE equipment  and re-transmits the signal without further processing. In one embodiment, the CPE equipment re-transmits the signal  to the CPE transceiver \u2033 without waiting for further processing. The CPE transceiver \u2033 in turn transmits the signal  to impinge on the first reflective element of the first POD . The reflective element reflects the signal  and directs the signal to impinge on the second POD . The first reflective element of the second POD reflects the signal  to additional equipment, for example, the endpoint CPE transceiver \u2033. The endpoint transceiver forwards the signal  to the CPE equipment , where the CPE equipment processes the signal and data. The endpoint CPE equipment does not re-transmit the signal because the CPE equipment is the endpoint.","When the endpoint CPE equipment transmits data to be communicated over the MTU network  and\/or free space network , the endpoint CPE equipment generates and sends an endpoint data signal  to the endpoint CPE transceiver \u2033. The endpoint CPE transceiver optically transmits the endpoint data signal to impinge on the second reflective element of the second POD . The second reflective element redirects the endpoint data signal  to be received by the rooftop transceiver  to impinge on a second reflective element of a first POD if present in the communication path.","The second reflective element of the first POD redirects the endpoint signal  to a standard CPE transceiver \u2033. In one embodiment, the standard CPE transceiver \u2033 includes a loop through . The loop through  simply receives the endpoint data signal  and re-transmits the signal to again impinge on the second reflective element of the first POD to be redirected to the next POD in the optical path or to the rooftop transceiver .","In one embodiment, the standard CPE transceiver \u2033 is additionally configured to route the endpoint data signal  to the customer equipment  to allow communication within the MTU network . The standard CPE transceiver \u2033 can additionally be configured to receive data from the CPE equipment and multiplex the data from the CPE equipment with the endpoint data signal  to be directed to the rooftop transceiver  or other POD and CPE equipment.","The network isolation that is provided by an active system is also possible utilizing the passive CPE transceiver \u2033 if the passive CPE transceiver \u2033 is used in concert with a third party router, for example, as part of the CPE equipment . This approach not only makes the system more flexible, but it would allow passive component manufacturers to focus on their area of expertise.","The following discussion focuses on the isolation of network and\/or customer failures or faults with respect to the CPE transceivers . The present invention is typically implemented to prevent a malfunction at one POD or customer site from taking down an entire optical path or the entire network. Examples of three classes of malfunction can include: (1) CPE transceiver removal\/misalignment; (2) CPE transceiver malfunction; and (3) CPE transceiver loss of power.","With respect to CPE transceiver removal or misalignment, some versions of the MTU optical network  include optical paths that rely on every node to serve as a relay. For this reason the removal or misalignment of a CPE transceiver  could potentially take down an optical path or potentially the network depending on network topology. Though little can be done to prevent deliberate customer removal of the CPE transceiver , this is highly unlikely. Additionally, because each POD along an optical path are aligned, the removal of one POD will not adversely affect the optical communication of the network  because the optical signal (e.g., transmit signal ) simply continues along the path to impinge on the next POD of the path. The second possibility is accidental misalignment caused by a small earthquake, someone bumping into the equipment, or similar occurrences. This is avoided by insuring that all CPE transceivers  are securely mounted with the building and potentially with the PODs through a window or wall of the building. In one embodiment, the network  is established with alignment margins of error, whereby CPE transceivers have large receiver ports allowing some misalignment from an optimum alignment while still maintaining optical communication. Additionally, in one embodiment, the surface of the reflective element  or  reflecting the signal to be received by the CPE (e.g., first surfaces  and  of the first and second reflective elements  and , respectively) is configured to provide an increased beam divergence, thereby increasing the area of alignment with the CPE .","Another possible threat to the network is a fault or malfunction in one of the CPE transceivers . In one embodiment, this is remedied by having the CPE transceiver  switch into a loop through mode. This would be dependant on the ability of the CPE transceiver to detect a fault or be notified of a fault. In one embodiment, the rooftop transceiver  is configured to aid in fault detection. If a CPE transceiver  experiences a fatal fault and is itself unaware of it, the rooftop transceiver  detects the loss of traffic. The rooftop transceiver employs fault detection means to recognize and adjust for faults. A variety of simple algorithms, as would be understood by one skilled in the art, can be employed for the means of detecting the faulty CPE transceiver(s) . The rooftop transceiver  can then instruct the faulty CPE transceiver to go into loop through mode.","A third threat to the network is a power fault or loss of power in a CPE transceiver . In one embodiment, this problem is remedied with an optical passive relay. Referring to , there are illustrated simplified block diagrams of an optical passive relay (or passive optical loop-through) made in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. This scheme uses a mirror pair  as a relay. Referring to , in one embodiment, the mirror pair  is held in a first position out of the transmit and receive CPE communication paths  and , for example, by an electromagnet , during normal operating conditions.","Referring to , during a loss of power to the CPE transceiver  the electromagnet  ceases to be magnetic and allows the mirror pair  to shift to a second position into the CPE communication paths , . In the second position, the mirror pair  serves as a beam relay to both the transmit and receive paths , , re-transmitting the transmit and receive beams  and , respectively, back to the POD . When power is restored to the CPE transceiver , the electromagnet  again becomes magnetic and attracts the mirror pair  removing the mirror pair from the communication paths. This mirror pair can also be employed as a loop through mode when the CPE transceiver is experiencing other errors or faults.","In addition to protecting against failure by loss of power, the optical passive relay  can also protect against failure of the transmit circuitry in the CPE transceiver , which is not done by an active relay system. Furthermore, the mirror pair  can be implemented using semi-transparent mirrors allowing the CPE transceiver  to continue receiving signals in loop through operation. In the case of a rooftop transceiver controlled error correction scheme, this allows the rooftop transceiver  to instruct the customer CPE transceiver  to re-attempt normal operation.","The MTU distribution network  as described above is configured to operate on the exterior of a building . However, the MTU network  operates equal well through open spaces within a building  where communication paths can be established. For example, the rooftop transceiver can be mounted within an elevator shaft as appose to the roof where the elevator does not interfere with the optical communication path. Additionally, the PODs  can also be mounted within the elevator shaft in optical alignment with the rooftop transceiver mounted in the elevator shaft. The PODs  continue to operate as described above redirecting the optical signals to and from the CPEs .","In one embodiment, a POD  can be optically aligned and coupled with a router (not shown) which routes the signal to CPEs . For example, one or more PODs  can be positioned per floor and signals redirected by the POD are processed by the router to determine if the signal is to be delivered to a CPE  on that floor. If the signal is to be delivered, the router routes the signal to the appropriate CPE. If not, the router re-transmits the optical signal to impinge on the POD  to be directed to the next POD along the optical path.","The MTU network  can also be incorporated within an atrium or other open space providing optical line of sight for establishing the optical communication paths between the rooftop transceivers and the PODs. As such, the phrase \u201cexterior of the building\u201d can be defined to include the structure of the build along an open space (e.g., along the building within an elevator shaft, and\/or along the build within an atrium) allowing free-space links to be established to allow communication to and from the CPEs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["310","312","314"]},"The local, distributed, free-space network  couples with the long haul\/submarine network  to communicate with the head end equipment . Thus, data can be communicated over long distances and still be distributed to customers through the free-space network(s) . The free-space networks  couple to the long haul network  through network points of presence (POP) . Additionally, the long haul network  can include a controller  that provides network control of data communicated across the long haul network . The controller  can additionally provide error and fault compensation for the long haul network. In one embodiment, each local free-space network  includes a controller . The local controller  provides control for the distribution of data across the local free-space network , and provides fault compensation. For example, the local controller can provide alternate routing of data across alternate communication paths within the local free space network or external networks coupled with the local free space network.","The following describes examples of optical networks for providing communication over free space links according to some embodiments of the present invention. In one example a network can include a four ring backbone high-speed operating at 1.25 Gbps. The backbone can utilize one or more MultiLink links (for example 1250\/1000 MultiLinks providing up to 1250 Mbps at distances on the order of 1000 meters) and MonoLinks (for example 1250\/300 MonoLinks). Spurs can be added off of one or more buildings or facilities using CompactLinks and spurs can be added to one or more buildings using MonoLinks (for example MonoLink 155\/xxx) (where xxx is substantially any length, for example 100 meters, 1000 meters, 2000 meters and other distances limited only by capability of the source of the optical signal, such as a laser, and receive capabilities) where each can be utilized to target a separate building.","In one embodiment, a network is configured with 20 links in various configurations. When a multi-tenant unit has more than three CompactLinks, it may be more cost effective to deploy a single MonoLink 155\/xxx and distribute the data through a switch. When multiple CompactLinks are used on the same building, a switch is not required because each CompackLink provides an output (for example each has an RJ45 output) that can be wired directly to the customer (e.g., CPE), whether it is a set top box, computer or other equipment.","In some embodiments that employ MonoLink spurs, a switch is utilized that includes an optical interface to an electrical interface for converting the optical signal to an electrical signal. The electrical signal can then be distributed throughout the building utilizing existing wiring (e.g., existing coax, or phone lines), preventing the need to route new cable to the customer's destination. In one embodiment, the electrical interface converts to a 10\/100 coax versus the RJ45 in order to utilize existing cable wiring in or on the buildings. In this case, the free space link heads are mounted to the roof, balcony or other areas of the building that provide stable mounting and line of sight optical coupling, and the data is distributed through switching. In some embodiment, the link heads receive optical signals over the free space links  and direct optical signals without electro-optical conversion to a building distribution system to distribute the data to the intended recipient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["510","512","514","510","516","512","514","516","124","520","522"]},"Data communicated across the spur  can be transmitted at rates of, for example, as high as 100 Mbps for fast Ethernet or as slow as a dial-up rate for internet only use. Typically, multiple channels are allocated to several users . For example, for cable TV subscribers, there can be approximately a 4 Mbps feed for each subscriber. By dividing the total available bandwidth for a MonoLink, each individual spur can serve as many as 26 subscribers. In one embodiment, data traffic for 38 subscribers can be achieved using ATM equipment or some other aggregation device. This provides an economical and scalable method to handle many users in the same building. The network spurs can be configured to operate at higher data rates above the 155 Mbps. In one embodiment, the spur  can be implemented to operate at a rate to support the backbone rate of 1.25 Gbps. This spur can be used as the new leg of a ring in the future. In one embodiment, MonoLinks 20\/xxx can be used to support five customers with a bi-directional rate of 4 Mbps each.","In some embodiments a CompactLink is used for the spur  connection, allowing the connection of one or more CAT-5 shielded pairs to an Ethernet capable device, such as an Ethernet capable set top box (STB) or computer, directly with no switch in between. As many as two subscribers can be provisioned 4 Mbps each on a single compact link assuming they are provided 4 Mbps each. If the data communication bandwidth is reduced to 3 Mbps and the data traffic is spilt between each user, the resulting data bandwidth is approximately 300 Kbps divided equally. In one embodiment, traffic shaping and bandwidth throttling is performed at the back-bone switch or router  as apposed to adding another router at a building  if only a single subscriber is using the spur. When more than one subscriber is provisioned on a spur, a hub, for example an Ethernet hub, can be used to distribute the signals. Any one of the described configurations can be implemented, each of which can be provisioned from the same switch or router in the back-bone to the same or different MTU buildings.","There are various methods that may be used to distribute data to customers  within a building . If the CompactLinks are to be used without a switch , an Ethernet output can be routed directly to the end user's equipment, for example using CAT-5 routed from the link head . Where possible, a CAT-5 connection from the CompactLink is used to convert the signal to allow the utilization of existing wiring, such as coaxial cables. If a switch is to be used with the CompactLinks, then the signal interface can be converted to coaxial cable interface built into the switch thereby utilizing the wiring that may be present on or with a structure.","When a MonoLink 155\/xxx is used in rings or spurs, an optical interface can be employed to convert optical signals to electrical signals, to allow routing using existing CAT-5 shielded cable, coaxial cable, or driven over phone lines. Referring back to , where possible building distribution systems  for distributing the data, such as media, to the customers or subscribers . Some phone wiring, such as phone wiring in Turkey and other countries, is not a shielded twisted pair but rather two single unshielded parallel wires. This existing wiring may work with a DSL distribution device such as an RC8000, but preferably coax, CAT-5 or other communication lines are utilized. When utilizing existing wiring for distribution, the existing wiring is typically able to drive 4 Mbps bi-directionally over the existing building wires to provide adequate distribution for some digital video applications. A switch or router  coupled with the backbone ring(s) can be configured to provide failure and redundancy switching. Switches or routers that connect with a spur can be configured to shape traffic and control the quality of service to MonoLinks for driving building distribution networks , which can include free-space coupling (see ), CAT-5, coaxial cable, phone lines and other coupling.","In one embodiment, the free-space network  is configured to include head end equipment  to couple with an external network  to receive data and distribute data (see ). For example, the head end equipment can be configured to receive and distribute 120 channels of digital video supplied by a professional direct-to-home (DTH) satellite service provider. In one embodiment, the present free-space communication network  includes one or more control centers  configured to provide network control. The control center(s) can additionally be configured to control distribution, verify authorization for customers to receive data, generate billing and monitor the network to optimize performance and adjust or compensate for errors or faults.","The present free-space network  is configured to have characteristics that provide optimal communication. In one embodiment, the network  has the following characteristics: laser link heads  have a communication distance from 0 to 3 Km, preferably 0 to 2 Km, for example having an average distance of 600 meters; the network has a high reliability and availability of data (for example, an up-time of at least 95%, preferably 98% and more preferably 99% up-time); digital video is available over the network, for example 120 channels at 3.5 Mb\/Channel; Internet data variable bandwidth is provided; the network  provides expansion to voice and video-on-demand; easy installaition, maintenance and management of network; demand based build-out model; flexible data rates and rate throttling for end users; maintain security of data (i.e., include firewalls); use existing building wires when possible and reliable; providing a scalable network, for example, capable of having a mix of business and residential customers (although not required) with flexibility to grow both the business and residential network; customers are provided adequate bandwidth, for example, a customer is provided a 5.0 Mb per customer of both video and IP; and business customers are provided with adequate bandwidth, for example, business customer is provided a 1\u20131000 Mb data per business customer (IP only).","In one embodiment, the network  management is configured such that: devices of the network  support Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) (e.g., devices provided by LightPointe, San Diego, Calif.; Cisco Systems, San Francisco, California; and others); In-Band remote monitoring and configuration; a control center  that can be located substantially anywhere in the network  or distributed across the network; and bandwidth throttling.","In providing the optical communication over the free-space links , the network  includes an optical transmission device, typically a laser. The laser is configured to provide: high bandwidth (e.g., 100 Mbps, 1.25 Gbps or greater); at variable ranges (e.g., 300 meters, 1000 meters, 2000 meters or more); bi-directional links; secure links (making tapping into the links difficult); and a low bit error rate, less than 10, preferably less than 10, and more preferably less than 10. The laser can be configured to provide an optical signal capable of transmission across the free-space link  without requiring a spectrum license. In one embodiment, the laser also provides transparent protocol delivery.","In one embodiment, the network  further includes switches  and\/or routers (see ). The switches and routers implemented provide accurate and reliable delivery of data. Preferably, these switches and routers are configured to provide: high bandwidth across ports; versatile module slots; easy to use management software; advanced security features; bandwidth aggregation; Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) support; and hot swap modules.","The topology of the free-space network  can be substantially any reliable topology, including ring(s), mesh, ring and spur, mesh and spur, and other such topologies. The ring topology is one advantageous and cost effective topology. In one embodiment, the network topology is configured to provide: bi-directional paths; single point of failure redundancy; shared bandwidth; be easily expandable; and be easily maintained.","The present free-space optical network  is capable of providing communication for substantially any type of communication entity, including residential, business and a mix of both residential and business.","In one embodiment, the free-space optical network provides: a 1.25 Gbps Bi-directional data rate; a 2000 meter range; high reliability; a transparent protocol; ST\/SC-compatibility; SNMP manageability; and spatial redundancy (e.g., four spaced transmit beams and\/or one large diameter transmit beam directed such that the optical beams impinge on a plurality of receive objectives).","Other components of the network may include, for example, one or more video networks devices such as a Pixstream VDS5000 (from Pixstream Incorporated of Waterloo, Canada).
