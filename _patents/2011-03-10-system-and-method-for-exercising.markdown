title: System and method for exercising
abstract: Embodiments relate to exercise systems, and more particularly to exercise cycles and systems for generating exercise programs simulating real-world terrain. In accordance with at least some aspects, a stationary exercise cycle includes an incline mechanism adjusting the vertical and/or lateral incline of the stationary exercise cycle. The incline mechanism may respond to control signals that change vertical incline to simulate an ascent or descent of a hill, or a lateral incline to simulate a turn. A communication system may provide exercise programs to the exercise cycle by operating in connection with third party providers of topographical, map, or other information. Such information can be used to automatically determine corresponding incline or resistance changes, as well as visual information for an exercise program.

No. 12\/413,330, filed on Mar. 27, 2009 and entitled \u201cEXERCISE SYSTEMS FOR SIMULATING REAL WORLD TERRAIN,\u201d now U.S. Pat. No. 8,251,874, issued on Aug. 22, 2012. This application also claims priority to, and the benefit of, U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/429,091, filed on Dec. 31, 2010, and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR EXERCISING.\u201d The foregoing applications are expressly incorporated herein by this reference in their entireties.","The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for exercising. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to exercise cycle systems and methods for selective adjustment to simulate movement along real world terrain.","While exercise equipment is being purchased in record quantities, it remains a challenge to motivate a consumer to use the exercise device on a consistent and ongoing basis. This lack of motivation often is a result of the repetitive nature of the exercises and exercise routines that a user can perform on a specific exercise device as well as the versatility of the exercise devices.","With respect to a typical stationary exercise cycle, for example, a user sits on a seat, holds onto a set of handles, and pedals with his or her feet. In order to provide variety during the exercise routine, the user can increase or decrease his or her pedaling rate at various times during the exercise routine. This can be done by increasing or decreasing the amount of effort the user uses to pedal or by increasing or decreasing the pedaling resistance provided by the exercise cycle. Additionally, many stationary exercise cycles are pre-programmed with one or more exercise routines that automatically adjust the pedaling resistance at various time intervals during the exercise routine. Adjusting the pedaling rate and\/or the pedaling resistance can allow a user to achieve a workout suitable for the user's fitness level and goals. Adjusting the pedaling rate and\/or the pedaling resistance is, however, often insufficient to maintain a user's motivation to consistently use the stationary exercise cycle.","Another factor that may contribute to the lack of motivation to use an exercise bicycle is the lack of visual or other type of stimulation provided to the user while using the exercise device. For instance, while a cyclist may go outdoors and choose between different routes of varied intensity and with constantly changing surroundings, users of exercise bicycles often become bored because their surroundings do not change during an exercise routine. Rather, their surroundings (e.g., the room in which the exercise bicycle is located) are generally the same each time the user exercises and throughout each exercise session. This boredom can discourage the user from regularly using the exercise cycle, or cause the user not to work as hard during the exercise session.","Devices that have been proposed to combat a lack of stimulation are found in United States Patent Publication No. 20070265138, which describes exercise devices, including exercise cycles, that are equipped with a display and speakers for providing visual and audio stimulation and motivation to the user of the device. For example, the display provides a graphical image indicating the changes that may be made by the exercise device, along with the total distance the user moves during the exercise. For instance, the display of a stationary exercise cycle may depict a series of hills that are related to the pedaling resistance of the exercise cycle. Additionally, a personal trainer's voice may be used during the program to alert the consumer to changes to resistance, or to otherwise encourage the consumer during the ride.","In addition, other exercise cycles or other devices include those in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,239, U.S. Pat. No. 6,997,852, U.S. Pat. No. 6,458,060, U.S. Pat. No. 7,060,006, and U.S. Pat.

The communication system  may include, for instance, a website or other component that can be used to provide information, such as exercise parameters and\/or motivational content for use by the exercise cycle .","In this embodiment, the stationary exercise cycle  may be in direct or indirect communication with a network  that is a communication network that enables various hardware and software modules and devices to communicate one with another. Network  may therefore be a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), wireless network, packetized network, real-time network, and the like. Network  facilitates communication of exercise cycle  with communication system . Communication system  assists with communication between a user on exercise cycle  and one or more third parties , as will be described in more detail hereinafter.","In the illustrated embodiment, connection between the exercise cycle  and network  can be made via a variety of communication line connections. For example, as depicted in , exercise cycle  is capable using a physical and\/or wireless communication with network . For instance, exercise cycle  may use a hardwired or other similar mechanism to connect directly into network . Alternatively, exercise cycle  may be equipped for wireless communication and can, by way of illustration, communicate with the network by using a wireless router . Various other types of ports or interfaces may be included within exercise cycle  to enable communication with network . For instance, an exercise cycle  may include one or more ports and interfaces to enable communication line connection through existing broadcast technology, including television broadcast over the airwaves, cable or cable modems, satellite, telephone lines, whether analog or digitally based, the Internet, DSL, G-Lite, wireless technology, infra-red (IR) technology, other high-speed data connections, or any other suitable transmission technology or medium. In still other embodiments, exercise cycle  optionally connects to one or more personal computers , , such as by using a hardwire or wireless connection, and the personal computers , may in turn connect to the network .

For example, personal computer or personal computer may be incorporated within exercise cycle . Similarly, the hardware and\/or software elements of the communication system  may be incorporated within the exercise cycle  and\/or within the personal computers , ","As used herein, a data provider that is \u201cexternal to\u201d or \u201cremote from\u201d communication system  refers to a data provider that is administered or maintained by a third party  that is different than the entity that administers or maintains communication system . Generally, examples of a third party  may include: (i) a live human being; or (ii) a database, such as a website, computer, optical media (e.g., compact disk or digital video disk), visual media, or magnetic media (e.g., videotape, readable disk), an electronic monitoring system, dynamic computer readable instructions, interactive and\/or dynamic software programs, computer readable instructions, one or more other databases, other media, hardware, and\/or software modules and components that is\/are located external to communication system . In some embodiments, a third party  may include MAPQUEST.COM, MAP.GOOGLE.COM, the GOOGLE EARTH database, the GTOPO 30 database, the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database, the MICROSOFT VIRTUAL EARTH database, or other data providers, or any combination of the foregoing. These third parties are examples of databases or other data providers that store and maintain data external to communication system .","Such data providers may store image data that can be displayed or can be formatted or manipulated to be displayed on a display device  of the exercise cycle . The term \u201cimage data\u201d includes and\/or is representative of: i) one or more static images; and\/or ii) one or more moving (e.g., video) images. For example, image data as used herein may include a plurality of sequential or other static images, a video, and\/or a single image of terrain to be traversed by a user, such as a mountain, route path, race course, or street.","Furthermore, the phrase \u201cdisplay programming,\u201d as used herein, includes raw image data and\/or image data that has been formatted or manipulated so that it can be synchronized with control signals and\/or displayed on a display device of an exercise device. Examples of such display programming that can be used to display images on display  include video programming, a set of sequential static images, other non-sequential static image, programming, and\/or a single image of terrain to be traversed, for example.","Generally, system  enables exercise programming with control signals to be transmitted from communication system , to the exercise cycle . As disclosed in U.S. patent Ser. No. 09\/349,608 entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Providing an Improved Exercise Device with Motivational Programming,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference, the programming may include motivational content and\/or one or more control signals that may be used to control the operating parameters of the exercise cycle . The control signals may be synchronized with the motivational content and designed to control one or more operating parameters of the exercise device, such as the resistance or, as described herein, the vertical or horizontal incline, and the like of an exercise program performed on exercise cycle .","As used herein, the term \u201cmotivational content\u201d is used to broadly refer to video or visual material either alone or in combination with audio material, including dialog, narration, sound effects, and\/or music. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, motivational content is at least partially stored by a third party  and includes images, whether still or moving, of real world environments, routes, locations, and the like.","Various terms are used herein to describe actual outdoor exercise experiences that can be simulated on exercise cycle . These terms include real world environments, places, routes, trails, paths, courses, hikes, locations, and the like. It will be appreciated that these terms are used to broadly refer to characteristics of actual places in the world, including the topography, appearance, and sounds associated with the real world places. Additionally, exercise system  is described as being able to simulate these real world places. Simulating these real world places refers to providing a user of an exercise device an experience that is similar to actually being in the real world places. In other words, system  is adapted to replicate on the exercise cycle  the topography, sights, and\/or sounds that a person would experience were the person to actually to walk, run, ride, or the like, through the actual real world location.","Generally, communication between exercise cycle  and communication system  and\/or a third party  may include transmission of both motivational content and control signals, whether or not such control signals are synchronized with the motivational content. Alternatively, the communication may include only the motivational content, other signals representative of measurable parameters of the exercise device (e.g. inclination, resistance, etc.) and\/or a user of the exercise device (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, etc.), and the like. For example, exercise cycle  may transmit one or more signals to communication system . The signal may include parameters such as the status of the exercise device, e.g., active status (i.e., on), deactivated status (i.e., off), standby status (i.e., waiting), and the like, and\/or parameters such as inclination or resistance. The signal may further include parameters regarding the user, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and the like. Alternatively, exercise cycle  may receive programming broadcast or otherwise transmitted by communication system . In embodiments in which the programming is broadcast, the broadcast may be such that any treadmill with the capabilities to receive the programming may access such, without the need to transmit one or more signals requesting the information. In other aspects, the exercise cycle  may receive programming directed specifically to the exercise cycle .","As mentioned above, the control signals control the operating parameters of exercise cycle , such as inclination, resistance, and the like. Such control may be achieved by communication system , or a combination of communication system  and a third party  interacting with exercise cycle  and\/or communication system . Generally, the present disclosure allows control of a device, such as an exercise cycle, without the need to interrupt other portions of the programming, such as real-time audio and\/or video.","Reference to various components of  will be made throughout this disclosure so as to illustrate various aspects in which embodiments of the present disclosure may operate to provide systems and methods contemplated herein. It should be appreciated that such reference is provided merely to illustrate one manner in which exemplary systems and methods may operate, and are not intended to be limiting of the present disclosure.","Attention is now directed to , which generally illustrate an exercise cycle  that can be used with system  of . Exercise cycle , in one embodiment, includes a support base  and a generally upright support structure  pivotally coupled thereto. Upright support structure , in this illustrative embodiment, includes two support members , , and may be referred to as a bicycle frame, although it need not look like, or act like, a bicycle frame of a road or mountain bicycle used in real-world cycling. Support member  of the illustrated embodiment includes a seat  upon which a user may sit when exercising on exercise cycle . Support member  includes a handlebar assembly  and a control panel .","In the illustrative embodiment, a drive assembly  is mounted on upright support structure . Drive assembly  includes a rotatable pedal assembly . Pedal assembly  includes a pair of cranks  that are rotatably mounted on support member . Attached to each crank  is a pedal , which a user can engage with his or her feet to rotate pedal assembly . As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, pedal assembly  can also be mounted or otherwise secured relative to support member  and\/or support base .","Drive assembly  also includes, in this embodiment, a resistance assembly , which can affect the force required from the user to rotate pedal assembly . Resistance assembly  includes a flywheel , a resistance mechanism  mounted on or relative to support member , and an electric motor  coupled to the crankshaft extending between cranks . Resistance mechanism  and electric motor  are optionally each adapted to selectively adjust the force required to rotate the pedal assembly . Thus, when a constant force is applied at pedal assembly , resistance mechanism  and\/or electric motor  may vary the rotational speed of flywheel . In this embodiment, resistance assembly  is coupled to pedal assembly  by an endless belt or chain  such that the rotational speed of pedal assembly  and flywheel  are related to one another.","Resistance mechanism  can comprise a frictional brake, a magnetic brake, eddy brake or other electromechanical brake, or any other suitable mechanism for controlling resistance to rotation of the pedal assembly  and\/or the rotational speed of flywheel . As discussed herein, the resistance mechanism  may be capable of providing a positive or negative resistance. For instance, when a positive resistance is provided, the user may be required to increase the force applied to pedal assembly  in order to rotate flywheel . In contrast, when a negative resistance is provided, the resistance mechanism  may actually provide a force that facilitates rotation of the pedal assembly . Thus, if a negative resistance is present, a positive force may be applied that tends to rotate pedal assembly  even in the absence of input from the user.","Mechanisms for applying positive and negative resistance may be combined, or may be separate. For instance, in , the exercise bicycle  may also include electric motor , or some other mechanism that can be used in supplying a positive or negative resistance. Electric motor  of  is attached at or near the pedal assembly , such as crankshaft extending between cranks . The electric motor  or other device may, for instance, be selectively actuated to apply a current that can act similar to a magnetic brake and provide a positive or negative resistance to the crankshaft, as desired. Where a positive resistance is applied\u2014either alone or in combination with the resistance mechanism \u2014the electric motor  can hinder rotation of the cranks  of the pedal assembly . Where a negative resistance is applied, the electric motor  can facilitate rotation of the cranks  and the pedal assembly . Furthermore, the resistance mechanism  and the electric motor  can also act simultaneously, even if they provide opposing forces. For instance, the electric motor  may be used to account for momentum in the flywheel. Thus, even if a user is simulating an uphill climb, momentum may build such that a negative resistance can be applied.","In some embodiments, the pedals  may include optional sensors . Sensors  can be used to detect the presence of a user on the equipment. By way of illustration, sensors  may include pressure sensors, proximity sensors, strain gauges, or other components that can determine when a user has his or her feet on the pedals . Sensors  can be coupled to the exercise cycle controller  and\/or the electric motor . For instance, if the sensors  detect that there is not a user on exercise bicycle  or that a user does not have his or her feet on the pedals , the exercise cycle controller  may selectively disable the electric motor  or other mechanism that applies a negative resistance. By disabling the electric motor , the exercise cycle controller  may prevent the application of a negative resistance that could otherwise cause the pedal assembly  to spin on its own. For instance, using a negative resistance on a downhill portion of a route, the pedal assembly  could build speed, and could potentially rotate on its own at a high rate of speed. When the user then wishes to climb back on the exercise cycle , or even to re-engage his or her feet with the pedals , the rotating pedal assembly  could make it difficult to do so. Accordingly, disabling the negative resistance can reduce the difficulty a user may have re-starting pedaling. Electric motor  may additionally or alternatively be disabled above a certain rotational speed of pedal assembly  to prevent pedals  from spinning out of control.","Resistance mechanism  and\/or electric motor  are optionally coupled to an exercise cycle controller , which may alone, or in concert with other components (e.g., a communication interface such as a network adapter or communication port) act as a simulation system as described hereafter as well as a means for obtaining real-world exercise route information, as described herein. Exercise cycle controller  controls the operation of resistance mechanism  and\/or electric motor , and thus the rotational speed of flywheel  in response to various user inputs or other control signals. Exercise cycle controller  can be incorporated within resistance assembly , control panel , or within an optional personal computer , ().","Because resistance assembly  is coupled to pedal assembly , the positive or negative resistance provided to flywheel  by resistance mechanism  and\/or electric motor  affects the resistance to the rotation of pedal assembly . In other words, when a large positive resistance is applied to flywheel  or crankshaft, a braking force is present and it is generally more difficult for a user to rotate pedal assembly . Conversely, when little or no positive resistance is applied to flywheel  or crankshaft, it is relatively easy for a user to rotate pedal assembly . Further still, when a negative resistance is applied to flywheel  or crankshaft, a user may be allowed to coast such that the pedal assembly  and\/or flywheel  rotate even in the absence of input by the user. By adjusting the amount and\/or type of resistance applied to flywheel , exercise cycle  can thus vary the speed at which a user can pedal and\/or the resistance experienced by the user as he or she pedals on exercise cycle . In this manner exercise cycle  is able to simulate the types of resistances, coasting, and pedaling speeds that a user may experience if riding a bicycle outdoors.","In addition to the ability to control and vary the speed and resistance of pedal assembly  and\/or flywheel , exercise cycle  also permits varying the vertical pitch of the exercise cycle  by selectively tilting upright support structure  relative to the floor or other surface upon which exercise cycle  rests. As depicted in  in phantom lines, upright support structure  can be oriented in a neutral position. In the neutral position, the illustrated exercise cycle  may include handle bar assembly  and seat  at generally the same vertical distance from the floor or other support surface, although such is illustrative only, and the handle bar assembly  and seat  may be at different heights, even in the neutral position.","In this embodiment, when upright support structure  is in the neutral position, a user sitting on seat  may feel that he or she is sitting on a bicycle that is on a generally level surface. Additionally, as illustrated in solid lines in , upright support structure  can be oriented in a forwardly tilted position such that the handle bar assembly  is vertically closer to the floor or other support structure relative to the seat , and relative to the position of handle bar assembly  in the neutral position. This is achieved by adjusting the vertical pitch of the upright support structure  relative to a floor or other support surface. Tilting upright support structure  forward as illustrated in  enables a user to simulate riding down a hill.","In one embodiment, such as that illustrated in , upright support structure  can also be oriented in a backwardly tilted position in which the handle bar assembly  is vertically further from the floor or other support structure when compared to the seat  or when compared to the position of the upright support structure  in the neutral position. Typical bicycle rides outside involve inclines and declines as well as flat surfaces, each of which can be accommodated and replicated by the tilting ability of upright support structure . Thus, exercise cycle  is able to more closely simulate a typical outdoor bicycle ride.","The forward and backward tilting of upright support structure  to adjust the vertical pitch of the support structure  can be accomplished through pivotally coupling upright support structure  to support base  as depicted in . As seen in , upright support structure  is connected to support base  by pivot . Pivot  allows upright support structure  to tilt forward and backward as described herein. Pivot  can include a pin that extends through a portion of support base  and through upright support structure . Pivot  can also include one or more stops to limit the tilting of upright support structure  within a desired range. Pivot  can, in some embodiments, include a ball joint allowing the upright support structure  to tilt forward or backward relative to the floor or other support surface, or even tilt from side-to-side as described herein.","While pivot  allows upright support structure  to tilt forward and backward, extension mechanism , or another linearly or otherwise extending assembly, controls the vertical pitch of upright support structure . In the illustrative embodiment, extension mechanism  is coupled between support base  and support member . More particularly, a first end  of extension mechanism  pivotally couples to support member  while a second end  of extension mechanism  pivotally couples to support base . Extension mechanism  raises or lowers support member  relative to support base , thereby determining the vertical pitch and tilt of upright support structure  relative to the floor or other support surface. Extension mechanism  can also be coupled between support base  and support member  or drive assembly .","As with resistance mechanism  and\/or electric motor , extension mechanism  is optionally coupled to exercise cycle controller . Exercise cycle controller  controls the operation of extension mechanism , and thus the tilt of upright support structure  in response to various user inputs or other control signals.","In one embodiment, upon contraction of extension mechanism , support member  is lowered, causing upright support structure  to tilt backward so that seat  is at a distance relative to the floor or other support position that is below the position of the seat  when at the neutral position. When extension mechanism  is selectively extended to an extended position, support member  is raised, causing upright support structure  to tilt forward so that seat  is vertically higher relative to the seat  when at the neutral position. Through the forward and backward tilting of upright support structure , as described above, exercise cycle  is able to more closely simulate for a user the experience of riding a bicycle on level ground as well as up and down hills.","Extension mechanism  is illustrated as being located at the rear of the exercise cycle , although this is exemplary only (see ). Furthermore, extension mechanism  may take any number of suitable forms. For instance, extension mechanism  may use a rotating or threaded drive shaft to adjust the length of extension mechanism , and thus the vertical pitch of upright support structure . In other embodiments, extension mechanism  may include a rod and piston assembly. For instance, a pneumatic or hydraulic actuator may be used to adjust the length of extension mechanism  and thus the vertical pitch of upright support structure . Extension mechanism  may also use any other suitable linear or other actuation mechanism that can adjust the pitch of upright support structure . Thus, extension mechanism  is one example of a means for varying a pitch of at least a portion of a bicycle frame relative to a support surface and responsive to obtained real-world exercise route information. Further, while extension member  is currently illustrated as being visible during operation or use of exercise cycle , such is merely for illustration purposes. In some embodiments, a shroud, casing, or other covering may enclose extension member . For instance, a flexible fanfold material may enclose extension member .","Attention is now directed back to system  of , and an exemplary manner in which system  can be used to simulate an outdoor exercise experience. More specifically, the following discussion will be directed toward how system  can be used by a user to: i) select a real world route, trail, path, or course; ii) exercise on an exercise cycle that simulates the terrain of the selected real world route, trail, path, or course; and\/or iii) view images of the real world route, trail, path, or course while exercising on the exercise device .","As shown in , exercise cycle  includes control panel  attached to handlebar assembly  and\/or upright support structure .  illustrate an exemplary control panel  in greater detail. In particular, control panel  can include one or more interface devices. Such interface devices may be either input devices or output devices. Input devices enable a user to input and vary the operating parameters of an exercise cycle. As examples of such input devices, control panel  includes one or more controllers for use on an exercise device, such as exercise cycle . Illustrative input devices include but are not limited to a start button , stop or pause button , incline controls , and resistance controls . Still other input devices may include element such as time controls, distance controls, program selection controls, heart rate controls, and the like. In addition to these input devices, control panel  further optionally includes a communication system connection interface , such as the iFit.com button illustrated in . Still other inputs or controllers may include a manual override control, a scaling control, or other input controls, each of which are also examples of input devices. It may be appreciated that each of the above-recited controllers or buttons may be embodied in a variety of different manners to perform their desired function. In addition, each controller, button, and the like may take the form of one or more switches, rheostats, potentiometers, touch sensitive controls, voice activated controllers, and the like. The input devices described herein are examples of structures capable of performing the function of interface means for gathering a first signal (such as a real time signal) from the user. One skilled in the art may identify various other configurations of interface means that are capable of performing the desired function.","In addition to the above-described input devices control panel  may include a variety of other input devices. For example, control panel  may include an integral mouse or a mouse jack for an external mouse. Control panel  may also include a keyboard or a keyboard jack for an external keyboard. Various other ports for use with other external components, or controls to implement integral controls, may also be included. In some embodiments, the control panel  includes a touch-sensitive video display  that may be used as an input device. Additionally, in an optional embodiment in which the exercise cycle  is connected to a personal computer (e.g., personal computer , of ), one or more of the input devices may be incorporated into the personal computer.","Referring back to , each input device can be adapted to allow a user operating exercise cycle  to more fully operate one or more operating parameters of exercise cycle . Furthermore, the input devices enable the user to access communication system  and\/or obtain maps, topographical information, pictures or videos of real world places, or other information via network , whether such information is from communication system , one or more third parties , or from one of a variety of other hardware and\/or software modules that are accessible via network . For example, the input devices may allow the user to access the Internet to find map data, topographical data, pictures, and\/or videos of real world locations, routes, paths, courses, location information, and the like. These additional input devices are further examples of structures capable of performing the function of interface means, communicating with the exercise mechanism, for gathering a first signal from the user.","In one embodiment, the iFit.com button  () acts as a selector and\/or an indicator of connectivity of exercise cycle  to communication system , and optionally one or more third parties , whether such connectivity is maintained directly with network  or in another direct or indirect manner. The iFit.com button  optionally includes an indicator light (not shown) that demonstrates when a connection has been established between exercise cycle  and communication system , such as when the iFit.com button  is depressed. Alternatively, a light emitting diode (LED) or other indicator positioned in close proximity to the iFit.com button  may be activated when the iFit.com button  is activated.","As discussed above, the connection achieved by activating iFit.com button  may be via a variety of communication line connections. For example, control panel  of  may include a wireless port (not shown) that enables exercise cycle  to wirelessly communicate with network , either by using wireless router , or optionally using one of computers , . Alternatively, control panel  may have a direct or indirect hard wire connection to network .","In one embodiment, by activating iFit.com button  or another suitable mechanism, a user of exercise cycle  connects to communication system , which may be or include a website. As discussed herein, such connection may be made through wireless router , directly through a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) by way of the described communication line connections for example, through a modem, through optional independent computers such as computers , , or by using other connections known to one skilled in the art in view of the disclosure herein. More specifically, by activating the iFit.com button  or other connection mechanism, a signal may be transmitted via network  to communication system  to establish a connection or transaction therebetween.","Once a connection is made between exercise cycle  and communication system , a user may access various programs, features, and the like of communication system . For example, once a connection is made, a user can access, select, create, and\/or download exercise programming for use with exercise cycle . As discussed herein, the exercise programming can include one or more signals that are able to adjust one or more operating parameters of exercise cycle  as well as visual and\/or audio programming. With an established connection to communication system , the user can also select other options, such as personal training, health information, competition, diagnostics, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 1","FIG. 6"]},"In the user interaction component of , selections may be made by a user. Such selections may be made directly at the control panel  of exercise cycle , although in other embodiments a user may access communication system  and make selections using personal computer or personal computer ","With a connection established between exercise cycle  and communication system , a user may access exercise programs or other features and options mentioned herein. After the user selects the desired option, such as by selecting an exercise program, communication system  can communicate the exercise program to exercise cycle  directly, via a personal computer, via a portable memory device, or in another suitable manner.","As illustrated in , a user may indicate that he or she would like to select an exercise program. As described herein, such selection may be in the form of a user input selecting a predefined exercise program, an input requesting to create a user defined exercise program, or an input requesting downloading of an exercise program. In response to the user input, the user may be prompted to select the type of exercise program which will be selected or created. In , for instance, the programming may include parameter based exercises or real-world terrain exercises, although other exercise types, such as heart-rate based exercises, may also be selected in some embodiments.","As illustrated in the embodiment of , regardless of whether the user selects parameter based exercise programs or real-world terrain exercise programs, the user may further be prompted to select between preprogrammed exercise programming and user defined exercise programming. When a user selects a preprogrammed exercise programming option, the user can view and select from among one or more available preprogrammed exercise programs that vary with respect to distance, incline, resistance, or other parameters, or in any combination of the foregoing. Such programs are generally defined and stored prior to the user initiating program selection, and can, through the data access portion of , be retrieved along with signals to control exercise parameters such as resistance and incline. In the case of real-world terrain exercise programs, additional data such as audio, visual, and other elements can be accessed and provided within the context of an exercise program. In addition to controls, audio, and visual elements, the accessed and provided exercise program may also include other elements. For instance, distance data may be included for display on a console of exercise cycle  to allow the user to determine how much distance has been covered and\/or remains in the exercise program.","In the case of parameter based exercise programs, users optionally are allowed to define parameter based exercise programming. For instance, a user may access a computing program via exercise cycle , personal computer , , communication system , or any combination of the foregoing. The computing program may allow users to define programs. For instance, the user may be allowed to define intervals of a specific time or distance, and select the particular resistance, incline or other setting that should automatically occur during use of the exercise program.","The exercise programming may also be adapted to simulate a real world environment, such as a trail, route, course, path, or the like, either in the form of predefined routes, or as user defined routes. By way of non-limiting example, the exercise programming may be adapted to simulate at least a portion of the Tour de France or a favorite mountain biking trail. More specifically, the control signals can be adapted to adjust the incline\/tilt and\/or resistance of an exercise cycle to replicate the hills, level surfaces, and the like, encountered on the particular route.","In addition to adjusting the physical operating parameters of exercise cycle , the exercise programming of real-world terrain exercise programs can include video and\/or audio programming that is related to the control signals. The display programming can be presented on visual display, while the audio programming can be presented by an audio output such as a speaker. A display and speaker are individually and collectively examples of programming presentation means for presenting at least a portion of exercise programming. In the example of the exercise programming simulating the Tour de France course, the display programming can include still images, video or other moving images of the course, or other visual images that include buildings, bridges, and roads that are seen along the course.","Display programming, such as maps, still images, or moving images, can be synchronized with control signals that adjust the operating parameters of an exercise cycle. Synchronizing the control signals and the display programming allows a user to view the real world environment at about the same time the user encounters operating parameters that simulate the viewed real world environment and terrain. For example, as a user cycles along a trail, the control signals may cause the exercise cycle to simulate the terrain (e.g., ascents, descents, bumps, etc.) that a cyclist would encounter as he or she rides along a mountain trail. As the user of the exercise cycle experiences the terrain of the trail, the user can also view images, whether still or moving, of the area which the control signals are simulating.","Similar to the display programming, the audio programming can include typical sounds heard by a cyclist traveling along the actual route corresponding to the real-world terrain exercise program. For instance, during a Tour de France route, the audio programming may include cheers of a crowd, cars, sirens, horns, and the like. For a mountain trail, the audio programming may include the sounds of wind rushing through trees and bushes, birds and other wildlife, and the like.","Audio programming may also provide information about the images presented in the display programming or the user's location along a route. For example, the audio programming may include information about landmarks or objects seen during the exercise routine or otherwise near the exercise route. The audio programming can be synchronized with the control signals and the display programming so that the sounds and\/or information provided by the audio programming is related to what the user is seeing on a visual and experiencing on the exercise cycle. For instance, if a user is simulating a ride through Central Park in New York City, as the user views images and experiences the terrain of Central Park, the user may also hear sounds typical of the area, such as children playing, dogs parking, and people talking. Additionally, or alternatively, the user may be provided with information in narrative form about Central Park, such as its size, history, landmarks, neighboring sites, or other interesting facts.","While the exercise programming has been described above in connection with various specific examples of locations where a bicycle ride can be simulated, it will be appreciated that the exercise programming may simulate other real world environments, such as other races, mountain rides, city tours, or any other course, route, path, and the like. Indeed, some programming may be predefined or otherwise available, while other programs may be defined by a user to correspond to any of an infinite number of routes. For instance, a manufacturer of the exercise cycle may include with the exercise cycle, or at a communication accessible thereto, a set of pre-programmed real-world exercise programs that simulate real-world terrain along real-world routes, along with corresponding visual and\/or audio programming. Further, as illustrated in , the user optionally may select a user defined exercise route as a programming option. Exercise cycle , a personal computer , , or a website or other communication system  may be configured to allow a user at the exercise cycle  or at a personal computer , to create exercise programming suitable to the desires of the user. When creating a user defined or unique exercise program, the user may have the option to select\u2014among other things\u2014a desired route, display programming, and\/or audio programming. The user may also have the option to select other exercise programming parameters, such as the exercise time or distance, whether certain types of terrain should or should not be simulated, number or type of turns, changes in the vertical or horizontal incline\/tilt of the cycle, and the like.","By way of example, a user accessing a website may be able to select a real world environment which he or she would like an exercise cycle to simulate. In selecting the real world environment, the user may select a starting point, an ending point, and a specific route between the two. Alternatively, the user may select a starting point and an ending point, and allow the website and\/or one or more third parties to select the route therebetween. In still other embodiments, the user may select a starting point and allow a website and\/or one or more third parties to select a route that proceeds from, and optionally returns to, the starting point for a selected time, distance, or the like. As noted above, the real world environment may be a famous or well known race course, tour route, trail, or the like, although a user may create an exercise program that simulates virtually any other real world environment, without regard to whether the location is famous or well known.","For instance, during good weather, a user of an exercise cycle such as those disclosed herein may also like to ride outdoors along a route the user has developed, such as along the roads in his or her neighborhood. During bad weather, however, the use may prefer to ride indoors on stationary exercise cycle . In such a case, the user may access a website using the exercise cycle and\/or a personal computer and create an exercise program that simulates his or her neighborhood route. More specifically, the exercise program can include controls signals that adjust the operating parameters of the exercise cycle to simulate the actual terrain (e.g., ascents, descents, and level surfaces) of the neighborhood route. Additionally, exercise programming can also provide display programming showing images of the neighborhood route. As with the preprogrammed exercise programs, the display programming can be synchronized with the control signals so that a user is able to view images of the real world environment associated with the actual terrain that is simulated on the exercise cycle.","In order to generate exercise programming as described above, a website or workout generator may access one or more types of data. Some types of data that may be used to generate the above described exercise programming include maps, topographical data, video or image data, audio data, and the like. Map data allows the user to create a route through a real world environment which will be simulated on the exercise cycle. The topographical data can be used to automatically and\/or dynamically generate or provide control signals that adjust one or more operating parameters of the exercise cycle to simulate the actual topography and terrain along the real world route. The video\/image data and the audio data can be used to provide the user with a visual representation of and\/or audio information relating to the real world route that is simulated on the exercise cycle. Still other information may also be accessed. For instance, a database may include information about the type of surfaces the real world route traverses. Based on the type of surfaces, control signals may be generated to simulate bumps or other structures. For instance, while a paved highway may have a surface generally free from rocks or bumps, a mountain trail may be far less smooth, such that bumps may be simulated. Such bumps may be random, pseudorandom, or otherwise generated. In other embodiments, speed bumps may be simulated. Similarly, if a road is shown to be under construction, bumps may also be expected and simulated.","The data used to generate the exercise programming may be stored at one or more locations. For example, a website or computing system may have a local database that can be accessed, or may communicate with one or more third parties  which store data. Third parties  may be websites and\/or databases that are accessible via a network . The following are a few examples of third parties  that can be accessed to retrieve information and data that can be used to generate the exercise programming described herein.","There are multiple route planning and mapping software applications and programs which can be used by a website, personal computer, or a user at an exercise cycle such as those described herein to develop a route that may be used for exercise programming in accordance with the present disclosure. Examples of such are MAPQUEST.COM, MAPS.GOOGLE.COM, and GOOGLE EARTH (available at earth.google.com). With these applications, a user is able to select a starting point and an ending point. The applications provide one or more different routes between the two points. Alternatively, the applications may be modified to allow for the creation of customized routes between the beginning and end points by, for example, selecting intermediate points between the beginning and ending points. Such databases may also store information about the type of roadway that can be used, for example, in determining whether the road is likely to have bumps or rocks.","Similarly, there are multiple databases that store topographical data for specific regions of the world. In addition, the U.S. Geological Survey maintains a database, the GTOPO 30 or Global Topography at 30 arc\/second database (available at edc.usgs.gov), which includes topographical data for the entire world. An exercise program generator can access one or more of these databases to retrieve information and data regarding the real world route that is to be simulated on an exercise cycle. With this data, the program generator can generate the control signals that control one or more of the operating parameters of the exercise cycle, such as the incline and\/or tilt of the cycle, to simulate the terrain of the real world route.","Databases that store still or moving images of real world locations can also be accessed by the program generator or another component working in connection therewith, so as to provide to the user of exercise cycle  a visual representation of the real world route that is simulated on exercise cycle . Examples of such databases include the GOOGLE EARTH, GOOGLE STREET VIEW (available at MAPS.GOOGLE.COM), and MICROSOFT VIRTUAL EARTH (available at www.microsoft.com\/virtualearth) databases. These databases provide a bird's eye view and\/or a street level view of a selected route or location.","With access to at least some of the data described above, a website, personal computer, or other exercise program generator is able to generate exercise programming that allows an exercise cycle such as those disclosed herein to simulate real world environments. In one embodiment, a user of exercise cycle  accesses a communication system  via a control panel . The communication system  may provide a user interface that allows the user to select a preprogrammed exercise route or create a user defined exercise route, either of which optionally are related to real-world terrain. In the case of creating a user defined exercise route, communication system  can allow the user to enter a starting point at a real world location, an ending point at a real world location, and\/or one or more intermediate real world locations that will define the exercise route.","With the supplied starting point, ending point, and\/or one or more intermediate points, communication system  communicates with one or more third parties  that provide map and topographical data relating to the selected route. The map and topographical data provided by the third parties  may include a map highlighting the selected route, total route distance, route directions, travel times for specific speeds, as well as forward, backward, and side-to-side elevation changes along the selected route.","Communication system  can also communicate with one or more other third parties  to retrieve other data relating to the selected route. Communication system  can, for example, communicate with the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database to retrieve images, video, or other content related to the selected route. Furthermore, communication system  can access other types of databases, such as audio databases, that provide audible information relating to the selected route.","Once communication system  has retrieved the desired information for the selected route, communication system  or another component can compile the gathered data and generate an exercise program. Communication system  may use the map, topographical, or other data to automatically and\/or dynamically generate a sequence of control signals that control one or more operating parameters of the exercise cycle . For instance, using a correlation algorithm, communication system  can synchronize topographical data with map data to correlate the distance and the grade or elevation change between two points on the selected route and generate a control signal that will cause exercise cycle  to simulate that terrain by adjusting the incline\/tilt and\/or resistance of the exercise cycle . For instance, a route can be made up of any number of discrete portions, which portions may be set based on predetermined or user-configurable criteria. For instance, an automatic setting may break-up a selected route in to quarter-mile, half-mile, or other increments to calculate the corresponding incline, resistance, and the like. Increments may be set based on additional or other factors as well, such as where a user makes a left or right hand turn, a location where a significant slope change is encountered, locations where the user encounters an intersection with a stop light, stop sign, or other signage, or based on other factors or any combination of the foregoing. Regardless of the particular manner in which the route is segmented, the correlation algorithm may compute the particular incline for a portion of a path. In one example, the correlation algorithm determines incline by determining the distance of a segment and the elevation change over a segment. The correlation algorithm may include setting the incline to a value corresponding to the elevation change divided by the distance. Accordingly, in one example, the communication system  can use the map data to determine that the distance between point A and point B is half a mile, or 2640 feet, and that the elevational change is about 320 feet. By dividing the elevational change by the distance, the topographical data may thus be used to determine that the segment between points A and B has a grade of about twelve percent. Using this information, communication system generates one or more control signals that will cause the exercise cycle to incline its upright support structure  () to approximately a twelve percent grade until the user has cycled for a half mile.","In a similar manner, communication system  can use the map data, the topographical data, and other reference points along the selected route to generate control signals that control the resistance applied to the flywheel  and\/or the pedal assembly  (). For instance, as simulation of an uphill climb begins, the resistance may increase. Similarly, as simulation of a downhill ride begins, the resistance may decrease and in some cases an optional positive force, or negative resistance, may be applied. In one example, the correlation algorithm determines the force applied by a resistance mechanism (e.g., resistance mechanism  and\/or electric motor  of ) by multiplying the incline by a constant force, and then subtracting a friction factor. In some cases, an approximate value for gravitational force may be used as the constant force.","While the generated positive or negative resistance may be constant along a segment of a route, it should also be appreciated in view of the disclosure herein that in order to more realistically simulate an actual ride, the resistance may vary based on other factors such as the speed at which the user is moving. By way of illustration, if a user starts from a stop, there is no momentum built up in the flywheel. As a result, the applied resistance may initially start at a higher value, and gradually decrease as the user begins moving. In some cases, a negative resistance mechanism (e.g., electric motor  of ) may be used to account for momentum in the flywheel. In such a case, a negative resistance may be applied while a user is moving. If, however, a user starts from a stop, the application of the negative resistance may be delayed and may gradually increase as momentum increases.","In addition to generating or accessing control signals, the communication system  can optionally generate and\/or accumulate display programming to accompany the control signals. As mentioned herein, the display programming can include still images or actual video or other moving images of the selected real world route, which communication system  retrieves (e.g., from one or more third parties ). For example, communication system  communicates with a third party , such as the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database via the GOOGLE MAPS application programming interface (API), to retrieve a series of images from of the selected real world route. When a series of images are used to provide a visual depiction of the selected route, the images can be streamed, cached or buffered so that upon delivery to the user of exercise cycle , the images provide an almost seamless, video-like depiction of the selected real world route, although the presentation need not be video-like for all embodiments and\/or locations.","As mentioned above, communication system  can synchronize the display programming with the control signals. In this manner, the control signals adjust the operating parameters of exercise cycle  at the same time the display programming depicts a change in the terrain of the real world route. For instance, at the same time the control signals begin to cause exercise cycle  to incline to simulate a hill on the real world terrain, the display programming shows one or more images of the hill of the real world terrain as if the user were actually beginning to ascend the hill.","Once remote communication system  has generated, accumulated, or otherwise accessed the control signals corresponding to the topographical\/map data and the display programming from the retrieved images of the real world route, remote communication system  can employ a synchronization algorithm to synchronize the control signals with the display programming. In one embodiment, the synchronization algorithm synchronizes images, video, audio or other display programming based on an approximate location where the programming is to occur. Thus, the synchronization algorithm may set display to begin once a certain distance along the real world route has been traversed. In other embodiments, there may be a continuous series of retrieved images along the full real world route, each of which may be displayed for a constant distance. In such a case, the synchronization algorithm may divide the total distance of the real world route by one less than the total number of images to be displayed. As a result, the constant distance over which each image is displayed may be computed. Similarly, a synchronizing control signals with display programming may also use information from the retrieved topographical or map data, such as distances between locations on the real world route, changes in elevation between locations on the real world route, directional changes along the real world route, and the like. For example, the synchronization algorithm may correlate a display signal with a particular image at a location where there is a change in the topographical data, such where a particular elevation change begins or ends.","In some embodiments, communication system  also provides audio programming that is synchronized with the control signals and the display programming. The audio programming can include sounds that may typically be heard along the real world route, such as cars, sirens, animals, people, and the like. The audio programming can also include in narrative form information about sites along the real world route, or motivational content from a personal trainer encouraging a user during a particularly difficult portion of a route. For example, if a user chose to have exercise cycle  simulate a route through Washington, D.C., and that route passes by sites such as the White House, the U.S. Capitol Building, the Lincoln Memorial, or the Washington Monument, the audio programming could provide information about each of these sites, such as might be heard during a tour of Washington, D.C. A synchronization algorithm, such as those described herein, may be used to synchronize the presentation of the audio programming with the display programming and the control signals.","Third parties or other databases or websites that include map or topographical data may also include information about historic landmarks, or other locations. For instance, MAPS.GOOGLE.COM may also show when a route passes by a particular landmark during a simulated ride through Washington, D.C. Using that information, the narration may dynamically retrieve or generate audio clips to identify the landmarks. Additionally, or alternatively, based on information about landmarks and locations identified by map or topographical information providers, other third parties may be consulted. For instance, if the map provider indicates that a route passes through a fairly obscure city such as Hattgenstein, Germany, communication system  may communicate with a third party such as WIKIPEDIA.ORG or another provider to obtain additional information about the city, its culture, traditions, and the like. Audio content related thereto can thus be dynamically generated, even for user-defined routes. A text-to-audio program may be used in one embodiment, such that audio can be generated on the fly and need not be pre-recorded for a specific location to be usable in connection with aspects of the present disclosure.","When an exercise program has been generated or retrieved, the control signals, visual, audio, or other information of the selected exercise programming can be sent over a network  to the exercise cycle . Regardless of the manner in which the control signals and other information is provided and\/or accessed, the exercise cycle  can use the control signals to control the operating parameters of the exercise cycle  and\/or provide video\/audio programming to a user. The exercise programming may include exercise routines that vary the resistance applied to flywheel  () and\/or the incline\/tilt of the exercise cycle  at various time or distance intervals during the routine. The visual, audio, or other programming can provide various types of information, including instruction, education, and entertainment.","Returning now to , an exemplary user console  is illustrated. User console  is exemplary of a user console usable in connection embodiments of exercise cycles disclosed herein. , for example, illustrates user console  having a variety of input and\/or output devices. As described previously, user console  includes a start control , stop or pause control , incline control , and resistance control . User console  also includes a set of output devices. In this particular embodiment, the output devices include a distance display , time display , speed display , and calorie display . The distance display  may provide for display of a distance traversed, a distance of a loaded or potential exercise program, or the like. Time display  may similarly provide for a duration of an exercise routine, an expected duration remaining, or the like. Speed display  may display a current speed or target speed for a user, while calorie display  may similarly display estimated calories expended during a current or loadable exercise routine.","User console  also includes, in this embodiment, an input device in the form of connection mechanism , which is in this particular embodiment an iFIT.com button. The iFIT.com button  may be used to, for instance, initiate or maintain communication with a remote system (e.g., application system  of ). As described herein, a user may utilize the iFIT.com button or other similar device to establish a connection and retrieve, select, generate, or otherwise access an exercise program. The exercise program may include control signals to automatically change operating parameters of the exercise cycle. In addition, according to some embodiments, the exercise program may include visual, audio, or other data that is optionally synchronized with the control signals.","In accordance with one embodiment, the visual, audio, or other data that is synchronized with control signals includes real-world terrain information. For instance, as shown in , user console  includes a display  capable of displaying visual data. In this particular embodiment, display  illustrates a map as may be provided by a third party such as MAPS.GOOGLE.COM. The illustrated map is sized to fit display  and, in this embodiment, includes a visual indication of a real-world route. The real-world route may follow real-world roads, paths, trails, and the like. The real-world route may also be synchronized with topographical information, such that elevation or other changes to the real world terrain are simulated through the use of corresponding control signals.","Map data may be displayed or used in accordance with any of the aspects disclosed herein. In , for instance, the map data is in the form of a road map. In contrast,  illustrates a similar map in the form of a satellite view. The satellite view in display  of  may correspond to actual still or moving images that correspond to the real-world terrain. The satellite view may also be merged with the map view of  so as to generate a hybrid view. Additionally, or alternatively, route information may overlay the satellite view.","Still other display information may be provided. , for instance, illustrates an exemplary street view image, such as that may be obtained from a third party such as the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database. The display  may display any or all of the images in , and may transition therebetween. For instance, in , an indicator may display real time a location of the user on the real-world route. Street view images may cycle through and correspond to locations of the location indicator. In some embodiments, street view or other similar images are primarily displayed, while map or satellite\/birds-eye views are displayed at request or intermittently.","Turning now to , another example of a stationary exercise cycle  operable in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure is shown. As discussed previously with respect to , an exercise cycle of the present disclosure may be moved so as to modify a vertical pitch of an upright support structure relative to a floor or other support surface. Such variation may allow a bicycle to give a user a feeling of going up or down a hill of a real world or other route.","In , an additional or alternative aspect is illustrated. In particular, in the illustrated embodiment, the stationary exercise cycle  permits the horizontal tilting of an upright support structure  relative to the floor or other surface upon which exercise cycle  rests. As depicted in , upright support structure  can be oriented in a neutral position. In the neutral position, handle bar assembly  has a generally horizontal configuration relative to a floor or other support structure on which the upright support structure  is supported. When upright support structure  is in the neutral position, a user sitting on seat  will feel that he or she is sitting on a bicycle that is on a level surface. Additionally, as illustrated in phantom lines in , upright support structure  can be oriented in a lateral, side tilted position such that handle bar assembly  is angled relative to the floor or other surface on which tilting upright support  is supported. Tilting upright support structure  to the side as illustrated in  enables a user to simulate making a right turn on a bicycle. Although a tilt to only one side is illustrated, it will be appreciated that a similar configuration may be obtained and the exercise cycle  may tilt an opposite direction as well. Thus, right and left turns can be replicated by the lateral tilting ability of upright support structure . Thus, exercise cycle  is able to more closely simulate a typical outdoor bicycle ride.","The left and right tilting of upright support structure  can be accomplished by pivotally coupling upright structure  to support base  as depicted in . As seen in , upright support structure  can be connected to support base  by pivot . Pivot  allows upright support structure  to tilt side-to-side as described herein. Pivot  can include a ball-and-socket connection. For instance, a generally spherical ball may be connected to support base , and a corresponding collar may ride on the ball so as to move side-to-side over the ball. Pivot  can also include one or more stops or guides to limit the tilting of upright support structure  within a desired range.","While pivot  allows upright support structure  to tilt side-to-side, extension mechanism , or another assembly, controls the tilting of upright support structure  and may be considered a means for varying a pitch of at least a portion of a bicycle frame relative to a support surface, and in response to obtained real-world exercise route information.","In the illustrative embodiment, extension mechanism  includes two linear extenders , coupled between support base  and support member . More particularly, a first end of each of linear extenders , can be pivotally coupled to support member  while a second end pivotally couples to support base . Linear extenders , can be controlled independently so as to tilt support member  to one side or the other, thereby determining the tilt of upright support structure . In particular, in the illustrated embodiment, linear extender and linear extender have different lengths. Due at least in part to the differing lengths, the upright support structure  can be caused to tilt to one side or the other. More particularly, in , in which a right turn is simulated, linear extender , which is on the exterior side of the simulated right turn, has a length that is greater than linear extender which is on the interior side of the simulated turn.","As will be appreciated in view of the disclosure herein, extension mechanism  may also be used to simulate a forward or rear incline as disclosed above. For instance, as the length of linear extenders , increase, the forward portion of exercise cycle  may raise, thereby causing the upright support structure  to pivot about pivot , and simulate ascending a hill. Similarly, by reducing the length of linear extenders , the forward portion of exercise cycle  may lower, thereby causing upright support structure  to pivot about pivot  and simulate descent down a hill. Accordingly, where linear extenders , have a same length, the exercise cycle of the illustrated embodiment may be placed in a neutral position with respect to a lateral tilt, and simultaneous and corresponding changes in length thereto can result in changes to vertical incline of exercise cycle . Moreover, as pivot  may include a ball joint, changes to vertical and lateral incline may occur simultaneously such that exercise cycle  may simulate a turn while ascending or descending a hill.","Exercise cycle  may be coupled to a communication system or other expertise programming system similar to that described herein with respect to exercise cycle  of . Thus, while exercise cycle  is not illustrated as including an integral use console, such is merely illustrative. For instance, an integral display or console may be included with exercise cycle , or exercise cycle  may be configured to use a removable display. In one embodiment, exercise cycle  may include a connection for a laptop or other computing device that can act as the user console, while providing automated and dynamic control of operating parameters of exercise cycle .","Turning now to , an exercise system  usable to automatically control an exercise cycle  is schematically illustrated. In this embodiment, a user may access a server-side interface  directly from exercise cycle  (e.g., using a control panel), from a personal computer , or from exercise cycle  via personal computer . Connection between server-side system  and exercise cycle  and\/or personal computer  can be achieve via a network as described herein. In this embodiment, server-side interface  may be a website, while a network for accessing the website is the Internet. Once a connection has been established with server-side interface  and the user has indicated that he\/she would like to create exercise programming, the user may define a remote, real world exercise route by entering a starting point, an ending point, and\/or one or more intermediate points. Such information may be entered and provided to an exercise program generator or , which may be integral with the server-side interface , or external thereto. With the remote, real world exercise route defined by the starting point, ending point, and\/or one or more intermediate points, exercise program generator , accesses one or more internal databases, third parties  (FIG. ), or other sources to retrieve data relating to one or more characteristics of the defined remote, real world exercise route. Exercise program generator or then uses the retrieved data to generate exercise programming for an exercise cycle, and provides the information to the server side interface , personal computer , and\/or exercise bicycle .","In one embodiment, exercise program generator or may access MAPQUEST.COM, MAPS.GOOGLE.COM, or GOOGLE EARTH to obtain map data, including distances, directions, and the like, relating to the defined remote, real world exercise route. Exercise program generator or may also access a database, such as the GTOPO 30 database, that stores topographical data relating to the defined remote, real world exercise route. Exercise program generator or can use the map data and topographical data retrieved from such third parties to generate control signals that will cause an exercise cycle to simulate the terrain of the remote, real world exercise route. In addition, exercise program generator or may access a database, such as the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database, to retrieve a plurality of sequential static images of the remote, real world exercise route.","With the control signals generated from the topographical data and the images of the remote, real world exercise route, exercise program generator or generates exercise programming for an exercise cycle as described above. Server side interface  may then retrieve the program and communicate the exercise programming to exercise cycle  as shown in . In some embodiments, server-side interface  communicates the exercise programming directly to exercise cycle , as shown in . For example, when exercise cycle  is adapted to communicate directly with a network, server-side interface  can send the exercise programming directly to exercise cycle  via the network.","In other embodiments, server-side interface  communicates the exercise programming to exercise cycle  via personal computer . For instance, when personal computer  is adapted to communicate with a network and exercise cycle , via a hardwire or wireless connection, server-side interface  can send the exercise programming to personal computer , which can in turn send the exercise programming to exercise cycle . Personal computer  can send the exercise programming to exercise cycle  through a variety of means. For example, personal computer  can communicate with exercise cycle  via a hardwired or wireless connection as described herein. Alternatively, personal computer  may be adapted to store the exercise programming on a portable memory device , which can be selectively associated with exercise cycle . By way of non-limiting example, personal computer  can be adapted to receive and store the exercise programming on a portable memory device, such as an SD card, a DataFlash card, a MultiMedia Card (MMC), CompactFlash card, a removable NAND-type flash memory (e.g. SmartMedia, Sony Memory Stick), a one-time-programmable memory cards (OTP), XD cards, USB compatible flash memory devices, and the like. The portable memory device can then be removed from personal computer  and inserted or otherwise associated with exercise cycle .","Once the exercise programming has been delivered to exercise cycle  via any suitable means, such as those described herein, exercise cycle  can run\/execute the exercise programming by processing the control signals, the display programming, and\/or the audio programming. As exercise cycle  runs the exercise programming, exercise cycle  simulates the remote, real world exercise route. In particular, the control signals of the exercise programming cause exercise cycle  to adjust one or more operating parameters, such as the vertical or lateral incline or tilt of exercise bicycle  or the resistance to a flywheel or pedal assembly thereof, to replicate the terrain of the remote, real world exercise route. In addition, exercise cycle  can display a plurality of sequential static images of the remote, real world exercise route. As noted herein, the generation of the exercise programming can include the synchronization of the control signals and the plurality of sequential static images. This synchronization allows the user to view the images of the remote, real world exercise route while exercise cycle  simulates the terrain of the remote, real world exercise route that is associated with those images. In other words, synchronizing the control signals and the plurality of sequential static images allows a user of exercise cycle  to experience the terrain, or an approximation, of the remote, real world exercise route while simultaneously viewing images of the portion of the remote, real world exercise route that is being simulated at that time.","Thus, in one embodiment, i) topographical data retrieved from a third party such as the GTOPO 30 databases, or from another internal or external source, is used to generate control signals that adjust operational parameters of exercise cycle  to simulate real world terrain; and ii) image data retrieved from the same or another third party, such as the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database or another internal or external source, is synchronized with the control signals and displayed on a visual output device. In this embodiment, the user can experience the topographical changes of the real world terrain as represented by the topographical data retrieved from the GTOPO 30 database, for example, while simultaneously viewing the corresponding images for the same terrain that have been retrieved from the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database, for example.","In general, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to exercise cycles that can have an adjustable incline in horizontal and\/or lateral directions and\/or to systems that can simulate real-world terrain in an automatic and\/or dynamic manner. For instance, an exercise cycle may have an adjustable incline mechanism for allowing the bike to have a forward incline simulating a descent down a hill, or a rear incline to simulate an ascent up a hill. Similar mechanisms may be employed to allow a side tilt to simulate a bike turning around a corner.","While exercise cycles generally have allowed changes in resistance to attempt to simulate the difficulty associated with an ascent, exercise cycles have generally failed to provide the realism of an actual ride. For instance, such bicycles can adjust resistance for an ascent, but merely release or reduce the resistance during other intervals, which may not correspond to a downhill portion of a ride in which a user may actually gain speed while not applying a manual force. Such resistance may be applied to a flywheel, pedal assembly, or other location on the exercise cycle.","Embodiments of the present disclosure allow a realistic experience in a number of ways. For instance, in addition to applying a resistance representative of an increase of difficulty associated with a climb up a hill, the exercise cycle may adjust its actual tilt to simulate the climb. Thus, a user not only feels an increased resistance, but also feels the actual gravitational effects of a change in vertical pitch. Similarly, for a downhill portion of an exercise program, the resistance may be reduced or eliminated, and in some embodiments may even have a negative resistance applied that tends to cause the flywheel and\/or pedals to rotate even in the absence of a user applying manual force. For instance, the negative resistance may be applied at the crankshaft of a pedal assembly, at the axis of the flywheel, at the outer rim of the flywheel, directly to the belt or chain, or in any other suitable location. Thus, as with a downhill descent in on real-world terrain, the user can coast and pick up speed. In such an embodiment, or even in the absence of a cycle applying a negative resistance, the cycle may be able to change pitch to provide the gravitational aspects associated with a true descent, as the front of the bike dives downward to simulate the descent.","To give an even more realistic view of the real-world terrain, some embodiments may include a visual and\/or audio output device that associates visual and\/or audio output with the control signals that cause changes in the operating parameters of the exercise cycle. Street, map, satellite, birds-eye, or other views may be used to give a realistic view of the actual portion of a real-world route that a user is simulating. Sounds, instructions, and other information may be included in audio information to further enhance the user's motivation to continue an exercise program.","Further, the disclosed systems provide virtual travel throughout the world, complete with actual changes in topography and terrain. In accordance with aspects herein, a user can load or even create an exercise program based on the landscape of virtually any location in the world. By inputting a location and details about a desired program, a program can automatically be created to dynamically control the exercise cycle while also providing a realistic simulation of the actual difficulty and length of the selected route."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
