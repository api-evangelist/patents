{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. The Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to exercise equipment. More specifically, the invention relates to methods, systems, and devices for selective adjustment of an exercise device to simulate movement along real world terrain.","2. The Relevant Technology","In an attempt to improve their health and physical conditioning, consumers are purchasing exercise devices in record quantities. One common challenge with exercise equipment is motivating the purchaser to use the device on a consistent and ongoing basis. This lack of motivation can be a result of the repetitive nature of the exercises and exercise routines that a user can perform on a specific exercise device as well as the versatility of the exercise devices.","With a typical stationary exercise cycle, for example, a user sits on a seat, holds onto one or more handles, and pedals with his or her feet. In order to provide variety during the exercise routine, the user can increase or decrease his or her pedaling rate at various times during the exercise routine. This can be done by increasing or decreasing the amount of effort the user uses to pedal or by increasing or decreasing the pedaling resistance provided by the exercise cycle. Additionally, many stationary exercise cycles are pre-programmed with one or more exercise routines that automatically adjust the pedaling resistance at various time intervals during the exercise routine. Adjusting the pedaling rate and\/or the pedaling resistance can allow a user to achieve a workout suitable for the user's fitness level and goals. Adjusting the pedaling rate and\/or the pedaling resistance, however, is often insufficient to maintain a user's motivation to consistently use the stationary exercise cycle.","Typical treadmills also allow a user to adjust various operating parameters to provide for improved workouts and variety during the workouts. As with the stationary exercise cycles, however, users are typically limited as to which treadmill operating parameters can be adjusted. For instance, treadmills usually provide for the adjustment of the speed and incline of the endless belt upon which the user ambulates. This allows a user to walk, jog, and\/or run on the treadmill. It also allows the user to ambulate on a level surface or on an inclined surface that generally replicates a hill. These adjustable operating parameters are, like those of the stationary exercise cycles, often insufficient to motivate a user to consistently use the treadmill on an ongoing basis.","Another factor that contributes to the lack of motivation to use exercise devices is the lack of visual or other type of stimulation provided to the user while using the exercise device. In other words, users of exercise devices often become bored because their surroundings do not change during an exercise routine. Rather, their surroundings (i.e., the room in which the exercise device is located) are generally the same each time the user exercises and throughout each exercise session. This boredom can discourage the user from regularly using the exercise device. Even when the user does use the exercise device, the boredom resulting from the lack of stimulation can cause the user to not work as hard during the exercise session, which can hamper the user's ability to achieve his or her fitness goals.","In order to combat this lack of stimulation, many exercise devices are equipped with a display for providing visual stimulation and motivation to the user of the device. For example, some displays depict a tract for indicating to a user how far the user has run or pedaled. Similarly, some displays depict hills that provide a visual representation of the resistance or inclination of the device. For instance, the display of a stationary exercise cycle may depict a series of hills that are related to the pedaling resistance of the exercise cycle. As the user \u201crides up the hill,\u201d the pedaling resistance will increase; the steeper the hill, the greater the pedaling resistance will be. Correspondingly, as the user \u201crides down the hill,\u201d the pedaling resistance will decrease. While these types of displays may provide some visual stimulation to the user, most users will quickly become bored with such displays, and the desired stimulatory benefits will not be realized. In contrast, when a person goes outside for a walk, run, or bicycle ride, the person's surroundings are constantly changing, which can provide sufficient stimulation to the person's mind to keep them motivated throughout the exercise routine.","The present invention relates to exercise equipment and systems, and particularly to methods, systems, and devices for selective adjustment of an exercise device to simulate movement along real world remote locations while displaying images\/videos of the remote locations. Simulation of a remote, real world locations and display of the related images provides a user of the exercise device with the greater interest and motivation to use the exercise device on a regular and ongoing basis. The simulation also allows the user to experience is a very real sense what it is like to traverse the remote location.","Thus, according to exemplary embodiments of the invention, an exercise system includes one or more exercise devices that communicate via a network with a communication system, such as a website. The communication system stores and\/or generates exercise programming for use on the exercise device. The exercise programming is able to control one or more operating parameters of the exercise device to simulate terrain found at a remote, real world location. The exercise programming can also include images\/videos of the remote, real world location. The control signals and the images\/videos can be synchronized so that a user of the exercise device is able to experience, via the changing operating parameters, the topographical characteristics of the remote, real world location as well as see images of the location.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the exercise system includes an exercise device that has a movable element for movement in performance of exercise by a user and at least one actuator for controlling one or more operating parameters of the exercise device. The exercise device is able to receive exercising programming that causes the exercise device to simulate one or more aspects of a remote, real world exercise route. The exercise programming can include one or more control signals representative of changes to be made to the one or more operating parameters to simulate the remote, real world exercise route. In some embodiments, the exercise programming includes display programming that display images of the remote, real world exercise route to the user. The control signals and the display programming can be synchronized with one another to enhance the simulated experience.","The exercise system also includes a remote communication system that uses data relating to the remote, real world exercise route to generate the exercise programming which will cause the exercise device to simulate the one or more aspects of the remote, real world exercise route. The data used to generate the exercise programming can include map data, topographical data, video or image data, or a combination thereof The data used to generate the exercise programming can be obtained from one or more databases, such as one or more websites. One database, for example, may store topographical data while another database stores image data. The remote communication system can be configured to access the data from one or more of the databases and synchronize the data to generate the exercise programming. The system also includes a network adapted to facilitate communication between the remote communication system and the databases as well as facilitating communication of the exercise programming from the remote communication system to the exercise device.","According to another embodiment, the exercise system includes an exercise device that has a movable element for movement in performance of exercise by a user. The exercise device can also have one or more operating parameters that are controlled by exercise programming. A remote communication system can be adapted to communicate with a user of the exercise device and generate the exercise programming that is communicated to the exercise device. The remote communication system enables the user to create user defined exercise programming by allowing the user to select a starting point and an ending point for the remote, real world exercise route. As above, the exercise programming can include one or more control signals representative of changes to be made to the one or more operating parameters to simulate topographical characteristics of the remote, real world exercise route, and display programming including images of the remote, real world exercise route. The exercise system can also include a network that communicates with the exercise device and the remote communication system to communicate the exercise programming from the remote communication system to the exercise device.","In one embodiment, the exercise device is a treadmill that has a base frame, a treadbase mounted on the base frame, and an endless belt trained around the treadbase to enable the user to ambulate thereon. The treadbase can be pivotally mounted on the base frame so that the treadbase can be selectively inclined or declined to simulate for the user the experience of ambulating up and down hills of a remote, real world exercise route. Similarly, the treadbase can be pivotally mounted on the base frame so that the treadbase can be selectively tilted from one side to the other side to simulate for the user the experience of ambulating on an uneven surface of a remote, real world exercise route.","In another embodiment, the exercise device is an exercise cycle. The exercise cycle includes a support base adapted to rest upon a support surface and an upright support structure mounted to the support base. The upright support structure includes a seat, a handle bar assembly, and a control panel. The exercise cycle also includes a pedal assembly that can be engaged and rotated by a user's feet. A resistance assembly provides resistance to the rotation of the pedal assembly and can be controlled by one or more control signals of the exercise programming. According to some embodiments, the upright support structure is pivotally mounted to the support base so that the upright support structure can be selectively tilted forward or backward to simulate for the user the experience of riding a bicycle up or down a hill.","These and other objects and features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter.","The present invention is directed to devices that include one or more motors or other electrically driven actuators used to control one or more operating parameters of the device. While the invention will be described in the context of either a motorized treadmill or a stationary exercise cycle, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to any particular type of exercise device. To the contrary, the present invention can be readily adapted to any motorized device or any other device that utilizes motors, solenoids, or any other electrically driven actuators to control any operating parameter of the device, such as speed, resistance, incline, time, temperature, or other similar operating parameters. The term \u201cdevice\u201d or \u201cdevices\u201d shall refer broadly to any type of apparatus that includes one or more stepper motors, solenoids, or other electrically driven actuators or controllers. Additionally, the term \u201cexercise devices\u201d shall refer broadly to any type of device that takes the form of an exercise machine, including, but not limited to, treadmills, exercise cycles, Nordic style ski exercise devices, rowers, steppers, hikers, climbers, and elliptical or striding exercise devices.","Depicted in  is a representation of one illustrative system, designated by reference numeral , which may incorporate the novel features of the present invention, including various novel devices, hardware and software modules, and the like. As shown, one or more exercise mechanisms , such as a treadmill and an exercise cycle are each in communication with a communication system  (e.g. a website) via a personal computer . The personal computers  communicate with a network  that is a communication network that enables various hardware and software modules and devices to communicate one with another. Network , therefore, may be a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), wireless network, packetized network, real-time network, and the like. Network  facilitates communication of treadmill and\/or exercise cycle with communication system . Communication system  assists with communication between a user on treadmill and\/or exercise cycle and one or more third parties , as will be described in more detail hereinafter.","In the illustrated embodiment, connection between the exercise mechanisms  and network  can be made via a variety of communication line connections. For example, as depicted in , treadmill is capable of wireless communication with network , either directly or via computer  and\/or wireless router . Various other types of ports or interfaces may be included within exercise mechanisms  to enable communication via one or more communication line connections. For instance, an exercise mechanism  may include one or more ports and interfaces to enable communication line connection through existing broadcast technology, including television broadcast over the airwaves, cable or cable modems, satellite, telephone lines, whether analog or digitally based, the Internet, DSL, G-Lite, wireless technology, infra-red (IR) technology, other high-speed data connections, or any other suitable transmission technology or medium. In the illustrated embodiment, exercise cycle is shown with a hardwire connection to personal computer , which has a hardwire connection with network . Thus, system  may allow for any type of connection between an exercise mechanism  and network , whether wired or wireless.","Although each exercise mechanism of system  is depicted as communicating via a personal computer  and network  with a single communication system  and two third parties , it may be appreciated by one skilled in the art that system  may be otherwise configured. For example, treadmill and exercise cycle may communicate via the same personal computer . Similarly, the exercise devices may communicate with multiple communications systems  and third parties  via multiple networks . Alternatively, one or more of the elements of system  may be eliminated or the functionality thereof incorporated within the structure and function of one or more of the other elements of system .","Similarly, although each of the elements of system  are shown separated one from another, it may be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the hardware and\/or software elements of the present invention may be incorporated within two or more elements. For example, personal computers  may be incorporated within treadmill and\/or exercise cycle . Similarly, the hardware and\/or software elements of the communication system  may be incorporated within treadmill and\/or exercise cycle ","As used herein, a database that is \u201cexternal to\u201d or \u201cremote from\u201d communication system  refers to a database that is administered or maintained by a third party  that is different than the entity that administers or maintains communication system . Generally, examples of a third party  may include: (i) a live human being; or (ii) a database, such as a website, computer, optical media (e.g., compact disk or digital video disk), visual media, or magnetic media (e.g., videotape, readable disk), an electronic monitoring system, dynamic computer readable instructions, interactive and\/or dynamic software programs, computer readable instructions, one or more other databases, other media, hardware, and\/or software modules and components that is\/are located external to communication system . In some embodiments, a third party  may include MAPQUEST.COM, MAP.GOOGLE.COM, the GOOGLE EARTH database, the GTOPO  database, the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database, the MICROSOFT VIRTUAL EARTH database, and the like. These third parties are examples of databases that store data external to communication system .","Such databases store image data that can be displayed or can be formatted or manipulated to be displayed on a display device  of an exercise device . The term \u201cimage data\u201d includes and\/or is representative of: i) one or more static images; and\/or ii) one or more moving (i.e., video) images. For example, image data as used herein may include a plurality of sequential static images, a video display, and\/or a single image of terrain to be traversed by a user, such as a mountain, race course, or street.","Furthermore, the phrase \u201cdisplay programming,\u201d as used herein, includes image data and\/or image data that has been formatted or manipulated so that it can be synchronized with control signals and\/or displayed on a display device of an exercise device. Examples of such display programming that can display images on display  include video programming, sequential static image programming, and\/or a single image of terrain to be traversed, for example.","The majority of the discussion of system  will focus on the use and interaction of treadmill with system . However, exercise cycle will also be described in connection with . While system  will be described primarily in connection with treadmill , it may be appreciated that a similar discussion may be had for exercise cycle , other types of exercise mechanisms, or multiple exercise mechanisms of the same or different type. Thus, as illustrated in , exercise cycle may be used in connection with system  along with most of the features described in connection with treadmill ","Generally, system  enables exercise programming with control signals to be transmitted from communication system , to a user at treadmill . As disclosed in U.S. patent Ser. No. 09\/349,608 entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Providing an Improved Exercise Device with Motivational Programming,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference, the programming may include motivational content and\/or one or more control signals that may be used to control the operating parameters of treadmill . The control signals may be synchronized with the motivational content and designed to control one or more operating parameters of the exercise device, such as the speed, incline, difficulty of exercise program, time, distance, and the like of an exercise program performed on treadmill ","As used herein, the term \u201cmotivational content\u201d is used to broadly refer to any video or visual material either alone or in combination with audio material, including dialog, narration, sound effects, and\/or music. In one embodiment of the present invention, the motivational content is stored by a third party  and includes images, whether still or moving, of real world environments, routes, locations, and the like.","Various terms are used herein to describe actual outdoor exercise experiences that can be simulated on treadmill , or another exercise device. These terms include real world environments, places, routes, trails, paths, courses, hikes, locations, and the like. It will be appreciated that these terms are used to broadly refer to characteristics of actual places in the world, including the topography, appearance, and sounds associated with the real world places. Additionally, exercise system  is described as being able to simulate these real world places. Simulating these real world places refers to providing a user of an exercise device an experience that is similar to actually being in the real world places. In other words, system  is adapted to replicate on an exercise device the topography, sights, and\/or sounds that a person would experience were the person to actually to walk, run, ride, or the like, through the actual real world location.","Generally, communication between treadmill and communication system  and\/or a third party  may include both the motivational content and the control signals, whether or not such control signals are synchronized with the motivational content. Alternatively, the communication may include only the motivational content, other signals representative of measurable parameters of the exercise device (e.g. speed, inclination, resistance, etc) and\/or a user of the exercise device (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, etc), and the like. For example, treadmill may transmit one or more signals to communication system . The signal may include parameters such as the status of the exercise device, e.g., active status (i.e., on), deactivated status (i.e., off), standby status (i.e., waiting), and the like, and\/or parameters such as speed, inclination, resistance. Additionally, the signal may include parameters regarding the user, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and the like. Alternatively, treadmill may receive programming \u201cbroadcast\u201d by communication system , such that any treadmill with the capabilities to receive the programming may access such, without the need to transmit one or more signals.","As mentioned above, the control signals control the operating parameters of treadmill , such as speed, inclination, resistance, and the like. Such control may be achieved by communication system , or a combination of communication system  and a third party  interacting with treadmill and\/or communication system . Generally, the present invention allows control of a device, such as an exercise device, without the need to interrupt the other portions of the programming, such as the real-time audio and\/or video.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 through 9","b":["12","10","12","22","24","26","24","28","30","32","28","30","32","22","26","24","32"],"i":["a ","a"]},"The treadbase  typically includes a pair of side rails ,  each having a front portion proximal to and a rear portion distal from upright support structure . A front pulley  () and a rear pulley  () are disposed between and supported by side rails , , while a continuous belt  extends between and around front and rear pulleys  and , respectively. Pulleys ,  and belt  may have various configurations and be fabricated from various materials, as known by one skilled in the art and commonly known within the exercise industry.","A deck , commonly fabricated from wood, typically supports the upper run of belt  and supports an exercising individual positioned upon belt . Although deck  is preferably of a cellulose material such as wood, various other types of material may be used so long as deck  is capable of supporting belt  and a user exercising thereupon.","As is common with electric treadmills, such as treadmill , front pulley  is mechanically coupled to an electric tread drive motor  (not shown) by way of a drive belt  (not shown). Motor  can incorporate an inertial flywheel that controls fluctuations in the rotational motion of a shaft of motor  during operation of treadmill . Motor  is optionally electrically coupled to a treadmill controller  (not shown) that controls the operation of motor , and thus the speed of belt , in response to various user inputs or other control signals. Treadmill controller  can be incorporated within treadbase , control panel , or within personal computer .","In addition to the ability to control and vary the speed of belt , treadmill also permits the degree of incline of treadbase  relative to the floor, or other surface upon which treadbase  rests, to be varied. As depicted in  in solid lines, treadbase  can be oriented in a neutral position. In the neutral position, treadbase  is substantially parallel to a support surface. Additionally, as illustrated in phantom lines in , treadbase  can be oriented in an inclined position such that the front portion of treadbase  is above the neutral position. This enables an exerciser to simulate walking or running up a hill.","In one embodiment, treadbase  can also be configured to decline into a declined position in which the front portion of treadbase  drops below the neutral position. Typical walks or runs outside, for example, involve inclines and declines as well as flat surfaces, each of which can be accommodated and replicated by treadbase . Thus, treadmill is able to more closely simulate typical outdoor terrain.","The inclination\/declination of treadbase  can be accomplished through the use of an incline mechanism , as depicted in , or another linearly extending assembly. Incline mechanism  raises or lowers one end of treadbase  relative to the other end. In the embodiment illustrated in , incline mechanism  is pivotally coupled to a cross bar  of treadbase  and a cross bar  of base frame .","More particularly, a first end  of incline mechanism  is pivotally coupled to cross bar  by way of a bracket  while a second end  of incline mechanism  is coupled to cross bar  by way of a bracket . Each of brackets ,  are generally U-shaped with a pin that can be secured between the two extending sides. The first and second ends ,  of incline mechanism  are each mounted on the pin of their respective bracket , . As incline mechanism  raises or lowers the end of treadbase , first and second ends ,  of incline mechanism  are able to pivot on the pins within brackets , . In this manner, first and second ends ,  of incline mechanism  are able to pivot about axes that are generally transverse to a longitudinal axis of treadbase . As will be discussed in greater detail below, brackets ,  can be pivotally coupled to cross bars ,  to allow treadbase  to tilt from side to side without damaging incline mechanism .","In one embodiment, upon contraction of incline mechanism , treadbase  moves to a declined position such that the front end of treadbase  is positioned below the neutral position. When incline mechanism  is selectively extended to an extended position, treadbase  is inclined such that the front end of treadbase  is positioned above the neutral position. Through the inclination\/declination of treadbase , as described above, treadmill is able to simulate for a user the experience of walking or running on level ground, up hills, and down hills.","In the illustrated embodiment, treadmill also permits treadbase  to be tilted from side to side in order to more closely replicate walking or running on outdoor terrain. As depicted in , treadbase  can be tilted such that one side of treadbase  is higher than the other. For instance,  illustrates treadbase  tilted so that side rail  is higher than side rail . Similarly,  illustrates treadbase  tilted so that side rail  is higher than side rail . The ability to tilt treadbase  to one side or another allows treadmill to more closely simulate outdoor terrain. In particular, when a person goes outside for a run or walk, the person often encounters both inclining and declining hills as well as surfaces that are not level from side to side, such as when walking or running across a hill. Thus, treadmill more closely replicates an outdoor walking or running experience by providing a surface that inclines, declines, and tilts to each side.","The tilting of treadbase  can be accomplished through the use of a tilt mechanism , as depicted in , or another linearly extending assembly. Tilt mechanism  is substantially similar to incline mechanism . Tilt mechanism  raises or lowers one side of treadbase  relative to the other side. In the embodiment illustrated in , tilt mechanism  is pivotally coupled to side rail  of treadbase  and base frame .","More particularly, a first end  of tilt mechanism  is pivotally coupled to side rail  by way of a bracket  while a second end  of tilt mechanism  is coupled to base frame  by way of a bracket . Each of brackets  and  are generally U-shaped with a pin that can be secured between the two extending sides. The first and second ends ,  of tilt mechanism  are each mounted on the pin of their respective bracket , . As tilt mechanism  raises or lowers the side of treadbase , first and second ends ,  of tilt mechanism  are able to pivot on the pins within brackets , . In this manner, first and second ends ,  of tilt mechanism  are able to pivot about axes that are generally parallel to a longitudinal axis of treadbase . As will be discussed below, brackets ,  can be pivotally coupled to side rail  and base frame  to allow one end of treadbase  to incline relative to the other without damaging tilt mechanism .","In one embodiment, upon contraction of tilt mechanism , side rail  is moved to a lower position than side rail . When tilt mechanism  is selectively extended to an extended position, side rail  is moved to a higher position than side rail . Through the tilting of treadbase , as described above, treadmill is able to more closely simulate for a user the experience of walking or running outdoors.","As noted above, brackets , , ,  can be pivotally coupled to their respective cross bars or frames. Pivotally coupling brackets , , ,  to their respective cross bars or frames prevents incline mechanism  and tilt mechanism  from being bent or otherwise damaged when treadbase  is inclined, declined, or tilted. For instance, the pivoting connection between brackets , , side rail , and base frame  allows treadbase  to incline or decline without bending, overextending, or otherwise damaging tilt mechanism . Similarly, the pivoting connection between brackets ,  and cross bars ,  allows treadbase  to tilt without bending, overextending, or otherwise damaging incline mechanism .","Brackets , , ,  can be pivotally coupled to their respective cross bars or frames with the use of a mechanical fastener, such as a bolt. The bottom cross portion of the generally U-shaped bracket can have a bolt extending therethrough and which is secured within the respective cross bar or frame of each bracket. The bolt connection can allow the bracket to rotate thereon. It will be appreciated, however, that one or more of brackets , , ,  can be connected to their respective cross bars or frames is a non-pivoting or non-rotating manner. For example, one or more of brackets , , ,  can be welded to their respective cross bars or frames.","With continuing attention to , attention is now also directed to , which illustrates a bracket assembly . Bracket assembly  facilitates the inclination, declination, and tilting of treadbase  relative to base frame . As best seen in , base frame  includes a cross member  that extends between the rear end of base from  and cross member . Cross member  is generally in line with incline mechanism . Treadbase  also includes a cross member  that extends between side rails  and . Cross member  is generally in line with tilt mechanism . As can be seen in the Figures, cross member  extends across and over cross member  such that cross members  and  are generally perpendicular to one another.","Bracket assembly  pivotally couples together treadbase  and base frame . In the illustrated embodiment, bracket assembly  comprises two generally U-shaped brackets , . Each of brackets ,  have two substantially parallel walls and a cross member that connects the walls, thereby forming a channel within each bracket , . The cross members of bracket ,  are coupled together such that the walls of bracket  extend in an opposite direction of the walls of bracket . As best seen in , brackets ,  are coupled together such that the channels formed by brackets ,  extend in generally perpendicular directions. In other words, brackets ,  are offset by about 90\u00b0. Brackets ,  can be coupled together by any suitable means, including welding, bolts, and the like.","Cross member  is pivotally coupled within the channel of bracket  with a pin . Pin  extends through the walls of bracket  and through a hole in cross member . Coupling cross member  to bracket  in this manner enables treadbase  to tilt relative to bracket assembly  about an axis that is substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of treadbase .","Bracket assembly  is coupled to base frame  is a similar manner as treadbase . Specifically, cross member  is pivotally coupled within the channel of bracket  with a pin . Pin  extends through the walls of bracket  and through a hole in cross member . Coupling cross member  to bracket  in this manner enables bracket assembly  and treadbase  to pivot relative to base frame  about an axis that is substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of treadbase . Pivoting of bracket assembly  and treadbase  in this manner allows treadbase  to be inclined or declined as described herein.","Attention is now directed to , which generally illustrate an exercise cycle that can be used with system . Exercise cycle , in one embodiment, includes a support base  and a generally upright support structure  pivotally coupled thereto. Upright support structure , in this illustrative embodiment, includes two support members , . Support member  includes a seat  upon which a user may sit when exercising on exercise cycle . Support member  includes a handlebar assembly  and a control panel .","In the illustrative embodiment, a drive assembly  is mounted on upright support structure . Drive assembly  includes a rotatable pedal assembly . Pedal assembly  includes a pair of cranks  that are rotatably mounted on support member . Attached to each crank  is a pedal , which a user can engage with their feet to rotate pedal assembly . As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, pedal assembly  can also be mounted on support member  or support base .","Drive assembly  also includes a resistance assembly  for providing resistance to the rotation of pedal assembly . Resistance assembly  includes a flywheel  and a braking mechanism  mounted on support member . Braking mechanism  is adapted to selectively adjust the rotational speed of flywheel . Resistance assembly  is coupled to pedal assembly  by an endless belt or chain  such that the rotational speed of pedal assembly  and flywheel  are related to one another.","Braking mechanism  can comprise a frictional brake, a magnetic brake, or any other suitable brake for controlling the rotational speed of flywheel . Braking mechanism  is optionally coupled to an exercise cycle controller  (not shown), which is similar to treadmill controller . Exercise cycle controller  controls the operation of braking mechanism , and thus the rotational speed of flywheel  in response to various user inputs or other control signals. Exercise cycle controller  can be incorporated within resistance assembly , control panel , or within personal computer .","Because resistance assembly  is coupled to pedal assembly , the braking provided to flywheel  by braking mechanism  affects the resistance to the rotation of pedal assembly . In other words, when a large braking force is applied to flywheel , it is harder for a user to rotate pedal assembly . Conversely, when little or no braking force is applied to flywheel , it is relatively easy for a user to rotate pedal assembly . By adjusting the amount of braking applied to flywheel , exercise cycle can thus vary speed at which a user can pedal and\/or the resistance experienced by the user as he or she pedals on exercise cycle . In this manner exercise cycle is able to simulate the types of resistances and pedaling speeds that a user may experience if riding a bicycle outdoors.","In addition to the ability to control and vary the speed and resistance of pedal assembly , exercise cycle also permits the tilting of upright support structure  relative to the floor, or other surface upon which exercise cycle rests, to be varied. As depicted in  in phantom lines, upright support structure  can be oriented in a neutral position. In the neutral position, handle bar assembly  and seat  are at generally the same vertical height. When upright support structure  is in the neutral position, a user sitting on seat  will feel that he or she is sitting on a bicycle that is on a level surface. Additionally, as illustrated in solid lines in , upright support structure  can be oriented in a forwardly tilted position such that the handle bar assembly  is vertically below the neutral position and seat . Tilting upright support structure  forward as illustrated in  enables a user to simulate riding down a hill.","In one embodiment, upright support structure  can also be oriented in a backwardly tilted position in which the handle bar assembly  is vertically above the neutral position and seat . Typical bicycle rides outside, for example, involve inclines and declines as well as flat surfaces, each of which can be accommodated and replicated by the tilting ability of upright support structure . Thus, exercise cycle is able to more closely simulate a typical outdoor bicycle ride.","The forward and backward tilting of upright support structure  can be accomplished through pivotally coupling upright support structure  to support base  as depicted in . As seen in the Figures, upright support structure  is connected to support base  by pivot . Pivot  allows upright support structure  to tilt forward and backward as described above. Pivot  can include a pin that extends through a portion of support base  and through upright support structure . Pivot  can also include one or more stops to limit the tilting of upright support structure  within a desired range.","While pivot  allows upright support structure  to tilt forward and backward, extension mechanism , or another linearly extending assembly, controls the tilting of upright support structure . In the illustrative embodiment, extension mechanism  is coupled between support base  and support member . More particularly, a first end  of extension mechanism  pivotally couples to support member  while a second end  of extension mechanism  pivotally couples to support base . Extension mechanism  raises or lowers support member  relative to support base , thereby determining the tilt of upright support structure . Extension mechanism  can also be coupled between support base  and support member  or drive assembly .","As with braking mechanism , extension mechanism  is optionally coupled to exercise cycle controller . Exercise cycle controller  controls the operation of extension mechanism , and thus the tilt of upright support structure  in response to various user inputs or other control signals.","In one embodiment, upon contraction of extension mechanism , support member  is lowered, causing upright support structure  to tilt backward so that seat  is below the neutral position. When extension mechanism  is selectively extended to an extended position, support member  is raised, causing upright support structure  to tilt forward so that seat  is above the neutral position. Through the forward and backward tilting of upright support structure , as described above, exercise cycle is able to more closely simulate for a user the experience of riding a bicycle on level ground as well as up and down hills.","Attention is now directed back to system  and how system  simulates an outdoor exercise experience. More specifically, the following discussion will be directed toward how system  enables a user to i) select a real world route, trail, path, or course, ii) exercise on an exercise device  that simulates the terrain of the selected real world route, trail, path, or course, and iii) view images of the real world route, trail, path, or course while exercising on the exercise device . While the following discussion will be directed toward using treadmill with system , it will be appreciated from the disclosure herein that other types of exercise devices, such as exercise cycle , can be used with system .","As shown in , treadmill includes control panel  attached to side members ,  of upright support structure . Control panel , in one embodiment, as shown in , includes one or more interface devices. Such interface devices may be either input devices or output devices. Input devices enable a user to input and vary the operating parameters of treadmill . As examples of such input devices, control panel  includes many typical controllers for use on an exercise device, such as a treadmill. A number of illustrative input devices include but are not limited to time controls , distance controls , speed controls , incline controls , a start button , a stop or pause button , and heart rate controls . In addition to these input devices, such as one or more controllers, control panel  further optionally includes an iFit.com button , a manual override button , and a scaling control , each of which are also examples of input devices. It may be appreciated that each of the above-recited controllers or buttons may be embodied in a variety of different manners to perform their commonly utilized function. In addition, each controller, button, and the like may take the form of one or more switches, rheostats, potentiometers, touch sensitive controls, voice activated controllers, and the like. The input devices described herein are examples of structures capable of performing the function of interface means for gathering a first signal (such as a real time signal) from the user. One skilled in the art may identify various other configurations of interface means that are capable of performing the desired function.","In addition to the above-described input devices control panel  may include a variety of other input devices. For example, control panel  may include an integrally formed mouse . Additionally, control panel  may include a keyboard jack  for an external keyboard  (), a touch-sensitive video display , and various other ports, jacks, or the like to receive various other external components. It will be appreciated that the external components, such as keyboard , may be integrally formed within control panel . Additionally, one or more of the input devices may be incorporated into personal computer  ().","Each input device is adapted to allow a user operating treadmill to more fully operate one or more operating parameters of treadmill . Furthermore, the input devices enable the user to access communication system  and\/or obtain maps, topographical information, pictures or videos of real world places, or other information via network , whether such information is from communication system , one or more third parties , or from one of a variety of other hardware and\/or software modules that are accessible via network . For example, the input devices may allow the user to access the Internet to find maps, topographical data, pictures, and\/or videos of real world locations, routes, paths, courses, and the like. These additional input devices are further examples of structures capable of performing the function of interface means, communicating with the exercise mechanism, for gathering a first signal from the user.","As shown in , the iFit.com button , in one embodiment, acts as both a selector and an indicator of connectivity of treadmill to communication system , and optionally one or more third parties , whether such connectivity is via computer , wireless router , or directly from treadmill . The iFit.com button  optionally includes an indicator light (not shown) that demonstrates when a connection has been established between treadmill and communication system , such as when the iFit.com button  is depressed. Alternatively, a light emitting diode (LED) positioned in close proximity to the iFit.com button  may be activated when the iFit.com button  is activated.","As discussed above, the connection achieved by activating iFit.com button  may be via a variety of communication line connections. For example, as shown, control panel  includes a wireless port  that enables treadmill to wirelessly communicate with network  (), either directly or via computer  and\/or wireless router . Alternatively, control panel  may have a hard wire connection to network , either directly or via computer .","In one embodiment, by activating iFit.com button , a user of treadmill , or other exercise device, connects to communication system , such as a website. Such connection may be via an independently located computer, such as computer , through a modem (not shown), wireless router , or directly through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) by way of the described communication line connections for example, or other connections known to one skilled in the art. More specifically, by activating the iFit.com button  a signal is transmitted via network  to communication system  to create a connection therebetween.","As illustrated in , once a connection is made between treadmill and communication system , a user may access various programs, features, and the like of communication system . For example, once a connection is made, a user can access, select, create, and\/or download exercise programming for use with treadmill . As discussed below, the exercise programming can include one or more signals that are able to adjust one or more operating parameters of treadmill as well as video and\/or audio programming. With an established connection to communication system , the user can also select other options, such as personal training, health information, competition, diagnostics, and the like, as shown in .","In another embodiment, a user may access communication system  using personal computer . With a connection established between personal computer  and communication system , a user may access the programs, features, and options mentioned above. After the user selects the desired option, such as selecting an exercise program, communication system  can communicate the exercise program to treadmill directly or via personal computer  or a portable memory device, such as a Secure Digital (SD) memory card.","In either embodiment, and as illustrated in , when a user indicates that he or she would like to select and download an exercise program, communication system  may prompt the user to select the type of exercise device upon which the exercise program will be used.  illustrates a functional block diagram of the process of selecting an exercise device to be used in connection with the exercise program. As seen in , the user may be given the option to select from among many different types of exercise devices, including treadmills, cycles, Nordic type skiers, climbers, hikers, steppers, ellipticals, and the like. After selecting the type of exercise device to be used, the user can then select the desired exercise program that is compatible with the selected exercise device.","The exercise programming can take any one of a number of forms. The exercise programming can include signals generated by communication system  and sent to treadmill . The signals may include exercise control signals, audio programming, and\/or display programming. The exercise controls signals can be configured to control\/adjust one or more operating parameters of treadmill , such as the exercise time, the incline and\/or tilt of treadbase , and\/or the speed of belt . The video and\/or audio programming can provide various types of information, including instruction, education, and entertainment.","As illustrated in the embodiment of , the user may select between preprogrammed exercise programming and user defined exercise programming. When a user selects the preprogrammed exercise programming option, the user can view and select from among one or more available preprogrammed exercise programs. The signals of the selected exercise programming can then be sent over network  to treadmill to control the operating parameters of treadmill and\/or provide video\/audio programming to the user. The exercise programming may include common exercise routines that vary the speed and incline of treadmill at various time intervals during the routine.","The exercise programming may also be adapted to simulate a real world environment, such as a trail, route, course, path, or the like. By way of non-limiting example, the exercise programming may be adapted to simulate the New York City Marathon. More specifically, the control signals can be adapted to adjust the incline and tilt of treadbase  to replicate the hills, level surfaces, and the like, encountered on the route of the race.","In addition to adjusting the physical operating parameters of treadmill , the exercise programming can include video and\/or audio programming that is related to the control signals. The display programming can be presented on video display , while the audio programming can be presented by audio output , such as a speaker. In the example of the exercise programming simulating the New York City Marathon course, the display programming can include still or moving images of the course, including buildings, bridges, and roads that are seen along the course.","The display programming can be synchronized with the control signals that adjust the operating parameters of treadmill . Synchronizing the control signals and the display programming allows a user to view the real world environment at the same time the user encounters operating parameters that simulate the viewed real world environment. For example, as a user runs on treadmill , the control signals may cause treadmill to simulate the terrain (i.e., hills, etc.) that a runner would encounter as he or she runs through Central Park. As the user of treadmill experiences the terrain of Central Park, the user can also view images, whether still or moving, of the area of Central Park which the control signals are simulating.","Similar to the display programming, the audio programming can include typical sounds heard by a runner in the race, including the cheers of the crowd, cars, sirens, horns, and the like. The audio programming may also provide information about the images presented in the display programming. For example, the audio programming may include information typically provided on tour of New York City. The audio programming can be synchronized with the control signals and the display programming so that the sounds and\/or information provided by the audio programming is related to what the user is seeing on video display  and experiencing on treadmill . For instance, as the user views images and experiences the terrain of Central Park, the user may also hear sounds typical of Central Park, such as children playing, dogs parking, and people talking. Additionally, or alternatively, the user may be provided with information in narrative form about Central Park, such as its size, history, or other interesting facts.","While the exercise programming has been described above in connection with the New Your City Marathon, it will be appreciated that the exercise programming may simulate other real world environments, such as other races, mountain hikes, city tours, or any other course, route, path, and the like.","Alternatively, as illustrated in , the user may select the user defined exercise programming option. Communication system  may be configured to allow a user at treadmill or personal computer  to create exercise programming suitable to the desires of the user. When creating a user defined or unique exercise program, the user may have the option to select, among other things, a desired route, display programming, and\/or audio programming. The user may also have the option to select other exercise programming parameters, such as the exercise time, changes in the speed of belt , changes in the incline and\/or tilt of treadbase , and the like.","By way of example, a user accessing communication system  may be able to select a real world environment which he or she would like treadmill to simulate. In selecting the real world environment, the user may select a starting point, and ending point, and a specific route between the two. Alternatively, the user may select a starting point and an ending point, and allow communication system  and\/or one or more of third parties  to select the route therebetween. In still other embodiments, the user may select a starting point and allow communication system  and\/or one or more of third parties  to select a route that proceeds from the starting point for a selected time, distance, or the like. As noted above, the real world environment may be a famous or well known race course, tour route, hike, or the like. Alternatively, a user may create an exercise program that simulates any other real world environment.","For instance, during good weather, a user of treadmill may also like to run outdoors along a route the user has developed, such as along the roads in his or her neighborhood. During bad weather, however, the use may prefer to run on treadmill . In such a case, the user may access communication system  and create an exercise program that simulates his or her neighborhood route. More specifically, the exercise program can include controls signals that adjust the operating parameters of treadmill to simulate the actual terrain (i.e., hills and level surfaces) of the neighborhood route. Additionally, exercise programming can also provide display programming showing images of the neighborhood route. As with the preprogrammed exercise programs, the display programming can be synchronized with the control signals so that a user is able to view images of the real world environment associated with the actual terrain that is simulated on treadmill ","In order to generate exercise programming as described above, communication system  may require access to one or more types of data. Some types of data that may be needed to generate the above described exercise programming include maps, topographical data, video or image data, audio data, and the like. The map data allows the user to create a route through a real world environment which will be simulated on treadmill . The topographical data can be used to generate control signals that adjust one or more operating parameters of treadmill to simulate the actual topography along the real world route. The video\/image data and the audio data can be used to provide the user with a visual representation of and\/or audio information relating to the real world route that is simulated on treadmill ","The data used to generate the exercise programming may be stored at communication system  or at one or more other locations. For example, communication system  may communicate with one or more third parties  which store data. Third parties  may be websites and\/or databases that are accessible via network . The following are a few examples of third parties  that can be accessed to retrieve information and data that can be used to generate the above described exercise programming.","There are multiple route planning and mapping software applications and programs which can be used by communication system  and\/or a user at treadmill to develop a route for exercise programming as described herein. Examples of such are MAPQUEST.COM, MAPS.GOOGLE.COM, and GOOGLE EARTH (available at earth.google.com). With these applications, a user is able to select a starting point and an ending point. The applications provide multiple different routes between the two points. Alternatively, the applications allow for the creation of customized routes between the beginning and end points by selecting intermediate points between the beginning and ending points.","Similarly, there are multiple databases that store topographical data for specific regions of the world. In addition, the U.S. Geological Survey maintains a database, the GTOPO  or Global Topography at  arc\/second database (available at edc.usgs.gov), which includes topographical data for the entire world. Communication system  can access one or more of these databases to retrieve information and data regarding the real world route that is to be simulated on treadmill . With this data, communication system  can generate the control signals that control one or more of the operating parameters of treadmill , such as the incline and\/or tilt of treadbase , to simulate the terrain of the real world route.","Databases that store still or moving images of real world locations can also be accessed by communication system  in order to provide to the user of treadmill a visual representation of the real world route that is simulated on treadmill . Examples of such databases include the GOOGLE EARTH, GOOGLE STREET VIEW (available at MAPS.GOOGLE.COM), and MICROSOFT VIRTUAL EARTH (available at www.microsoft.com\/virtualearth) databases. These databases provide a bird's eye view or a street level view of a selected route or location.","With access to at least some of the data described above, communication system  is able to generate exercise programming that allows treadmill to simulate real world environments. In one embodiment, a user of treadmill accesses communication system  via control panel . Communication system  provides a user interface that allows the user to select a preprogrammed exercise route or create a user defined exercise route. In the case of creating a user defined exercise route, communication system  allows the user to enter a starting point, an ending point, and\/or one or more intermediate points that will defined the exercise route.","With the supplied starting point, ending point, and\/or one or more intermediate points, communication system  communicates with one or more third parties  that provide map and topographical data relating to the selected route. The map and topographical data provided by the third parties  may include a map highlighting the selected route, total route distance, route directions, travel times for specific speeds, as well as forward, backward, and side-to-side elevation changes along the selected route.","Communication system  can also communicate with one or more other third parties  to retrieve other data relating to the selected route. Communication system  can, for example, communicate with the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database to retrieve images of the selected route. Furthermore, communication system  can access other types of databases, such as audio databases, that provide audible information relating to the selected route.","Once communication system  has retrieved the desired information for the selected route, communication system  compiles the gathered data and generates the exercise program. Communication system  uses the map and topographical data to generate a series of control signals that control one or more operating parameters of treadmill . In other words, using a correlation algorithm, communication system  can synchronize the topographical data with the map data to correlate the distance and the grade or elevation change between two points on the selected route and generate a control signal that will cause treadmill to simulate that terrain. For instance, communication system  can use the map data to determine that the distance between point A and point B is \u00bd mile, and can use the topographical data to determine that the area between points A and B has a grade of 12%. Using this information, communication system generates one or more control signals that will cause treadmill to incline treadbase  to a 12% grade until the user has walked for \u00bd mile. In a similar manner, communication system  can use the map data, the topographical data, and other reference points along the selected route to generate control signals that control the tilt of treadbase .","In addition to generating the control signals, communication system  can also generate display programming to accompany the control signals. As mentioned above, the display programming can include still or moving images of the selected real world route, which communication system  retrieves from one or more third parties . For example, communication system  communicates with a third party , such as the Google Street View database via the Google Maps API (application programming interface), to retrieve a series of images from of the selected real world route. When a series of images are used to provide a visual depiction of the selected rout, the images can be cached or buffered so that upon delivery to the user of treadmill , the images provide an almost seamless, video-like depiction of the selected real world route.","As mentioned above, communication system  can synchronize the display programming with the control signals. In this manner, the control signals will adjust the operating parameters of treadmill at the same time the display programming depicts a change in the terrain of the real world route. For instance, at the same time the control signals begin to cause treadbase  to incline to simulate a hill on the real world route, the display programming shows one or more images of the hill on the real world route as if the user were actually beginning to ascend the hill.","Once remote communication system  has generated the control signals from the topographical\/map data and the display programming from the retrieved images of the real world route, remote communication system  can employ a correlation algorithm to synchronize the control signals with the display programming. In one embodiment, the correlation algorithm uses data about the series of retrieved images, such as the number of images along the real world route, the real world distances between the images, and the like. Similarly, the correlation algorithm also uses information from the retrieved topographical\/map data, such as distances between locations on the real world route, changes in elevation between locations on the real world route, directional changes along the real world route, and the like. Using this data, the correlation algorithm synchronizes the control signals and the display programming. For example, the correlation algorithm may coordinate the first control signal with the display of the first image of the remote real world route. The correlation algorithm may correlate a subsequent image with a change in the map data, such as when the map data indicates a change in a certain distance from the previous real world location. The correlation algorithm may also correlate subsequent images with a change in the topographical data, such as an elevation change from the previous real world location.","In some embodiments, communication system  also provides audio programming that is synchronized with the control signals and the display programming. The audio programming can include sounds that may typically be heard along the real world route, such as cars, sirens, animals, people, and the like. The audio programming can also include in narrative form information about sites along the real world route. For example, if a user chose to have treadmill simulate a route through Washington D.C. which passed by sites such as the White House, the U.S. Capital building, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Washington Monument, the audio programming could provide information about each of these sites, such as might be heard during a tour of Washington D.C. A correlation algorithm, such as the one described above, may be used to coordinate the presentation of the audio programming with the display programming and the control signals.","As shown in the flow diagram of , in one exemplary embodiment, a user may access remote communication system  directly from treadmill (using control panel ), from personal computer , or from treadmill via personal computer . Connection between remote communication system  and treadmill and\/or personal computer  can be achieve via network , as described herein. Network  and remote communication system  in this embodiment are the Internet and a website, respectively. Once a connection has been established with remote communication system  and the user has indicated that he\/she would like to create exercise programming, the user may define a remote, real world exercise route by entering a starting point, an ending point, and\/or one or more intermediate points. With the remote, real world exercise route defined by the starting point, ending point, and\/or one or more intermediate points, remote communication system  accesses one or more third parties  to retrieve data relating to one or more characteristics of the defined remote, real world exercise route. Remote communication system  then uses the retrieved data to generate exercise programming for treadmill ","In one embodiment, remote communication system  may access MAPQUEST.COM to obtain map data, including distances, directions, and the like, relating to the defined remote, real world exercise route. Remote communication system  may also access a database, such as the GTOPO  database, that stores topographical data relating to the defined remote, real world exercise route. Remote communication system  can use the map data and topographical data retrieved from these third parties  to generate control signals that will cause treadmill to simulate the terrain of the remote, real world exercise route. In addition, remote communication system  may access a database, such as the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database, to retrieve a plurality of sequential static images of the remote, real world exercise route.","With the control signals generated from the topographical data and the images of the remote, real world exercise route, remote communication system  generates exercise programming for treadmill as described above. Remote communication system  then communicates the exercise programming to treadmill as shown in . In some embodiments, remote communication system  can communicate the exercise programming directly to treadmill , as shown in . For example, when treadmill  is adapted to communicate directly with network , remote communication system  can send the exercise programming  directly to treadmill via network .","In other embodiments, remote communication system  communicates the exercise programming to treadmill via personal computer . For instance, when personal computer  is adapted to communicate with network  and treadmill , via a hardwire or wireless connection, remote communication system  can send the exercise programming to personal computer , which can in turn send the exercise programming to treadmill . Personal computer  can send the exercise programming to treadmill through a variety of means. For example, personal computer  can communicate with treadmill via a hardwire or wireless connection as described herein. Alternatively, personal computer  may be adapted to store the exercise programming on a portable memory device, which can be selectively associated with treadmill . By way of non-limiting example, personal computer  can be adapted to receive and store the exercise programming on a portable memory device, such as an SD card, a DataFlash card, a MultiMedia Card (MMC), CompactFlash card, a removable NAND-type flash memory (e.g. SmartMedia, Sony Memory Stick), a one-time-programmable memory cards (OTP), XD cards, and the like. The portable memory device can then be removed from personal computer  and inserted or otherwise associated with treadmill ","Once the exercise programming has been delivered to treadmill via any suitable means, such as those described herein, treadmill can run\/execute the exercise programming by processing the control signals, the display programming, and\/or the audio programming. As treadmill runs the exercise programming, treadmill simulates the remote, real world exercise route. In particular, the control signals of the exercise programming cause treadmill to adjust one or more operating parameters, such as the incline or tilt of treadbase , to replicate the terrain of the remote, real world exercise route. In addition, treadmill  a displays, via display , the plurality of sequential static images of the remote, real world exercise route. As noted herein, the generation of the exercise programming includes the synchronization of the control signals and the plurality of sequential static images. This synchronization allows the user to view the images of the remote, real world exercise route while treadmill simulates the terrain of the remote, real world exercise route that is associated with those images. In other words, synchronizing the control signals and the plurality of sequential static images allows a user of treadmill to experience the terrain of the remote, real world exercise route while simultaneously viewing images of the portion of the remote, real world exercise route that is being simulated at that time.","Thus, in one embodiment, i) topographical data retrieved from a third party , such as the GTOPO  databases, is used to generate control signals that adjust operational parameters of treadmill to simulate real world terrain; and ii) image data retrieved from another third party , such as the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database, is synchronized with the control signals and displayed on video output device . In this embodiment, the user can experience the topographical changes of the real world terrain as represented by the topographical data retrieved from the GTOPO  database, for example, while simultaneously viewing the corresponding images for the same terrain that have been retrieved from the GOOGLE STREET VIEW database, for example.","As noted above, treadmill can monitor the actual operating parameters of treadmill , such as the incline and tilt of treadbase  and the speed of belt . The actual operating parameters of treadmill and the exercise programming can be correlated so that the control signals, display programming, and audio programming are updated or changed at the appropriate times. For instance, the exercise programming may include control signals that incline treadbase  to a 5% grade for \u00bc mile and then decline treadbase to a 2% grade for 1 mile. The speed of belt  will affect the amount of time that each of the controls signals is active. If belt  were moving at 5 miles per hour (mph), for example, the user would traverse the \u00bc mile segment in 3 minute and the 1 mile segment in 12 minutes. If belt  were moving at 2.5 mph, however, it would take the user 6 minutes to traverse the \u00bc mile segment and 24 minutes to traverse the 1 mile segment. Thus, correlating or synchronizing the actual operating parameters of treadmill with the exercise programming allows treadmill to be controlled in such a way as to realistically simulate the real world environment. The correlation or synchronization of the exercise programming and the actual operating parameters can be performed by treadmill controller , control panel , personal computer , communication system , or a combination thereof.","As mentioned above, control panel  may include manual override button . Manual override button  enables a user to override a control signal generated by communication system , personal computer , or treadmill . For example, if the exercise program accessed through communication system  is too difficult for the user, the user may activate manual override button , thereby interrupting or decreasing the difficultly level of the program delivered to treadmill by communication system . Furthermore, in the event that the exercise program is too easy, the user may increase the difficulty level of the exercise device. Consequently, manual override button  provides the user with a safety switch during operation of treadmill . In an alternate configuration of treadmill , the functionality of manual override button  is activated upon manual activation of one of the other input devices, such as but not limited to, time controls , distance controls , speed controls , incline controls , stop\/pause button , and the like.","Similar to the operation of manual override button , scaling control  enables a user to vary the operating parameters of treadmill during an exercise program run by treadmill . A user may activate scaling control  and vary the intensity of an exercise program. The scaling control , therefore, enables a user to select a value representative of the proportional change to be made to the control signal received by the communicating mechanism of treadmill from communication system . For example, if an exercise program requires a maximum speed of 6 mph with a maximum incline of 15 degrees for a period of 30 minutes, an individual may activate scaling control  to require only 66% intensity of the exercise program; stated otherwise, reduce the intensity by one third. Therefore, the exercise program is varied to a maximum speed of 4 mph, with a maximum incline of 10 degrees, for a period of 20 minutes. Optionally, scaling control  may enable the user to set maximum values for each operating parameter of treadmill . In another configuration, scaling control  may enable the user to scale only one operating parameter of treadmill while leaving other parameters unchanged. Hence, the user may vary the exercise program to their particular abilities, while obtaining the beneficial effects of exercising.","In addition to the output devices described above, the present invention may include various other output devices to provide information and data to the user of treadmill . In one embodiment of treadmill , control panel  includes one or more operating parameter displays. The one or more operating parameter displays give a visual display of some of the more important exercise device operating parameters, such as, but not limited to, speed, incline, distance traveled, calories used, elevation climbed, wheel resistance, and the like. The one or more operating parameter displays may use a numerical display, a graphical display, combinations thereof, or such other displays known to one skilled in that art. For example, the operating parameter display may be incorporated within video output device .","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the exercise device is capable of being controlled by signals from the communication system and\/or physical controls integrated onto the exercise device. The physically integrated controls and the controls from the communication system may be passed through a buffer that controls the exercise device. In this way, in the event that connectivity to the communication system is lost, a user of the exercise device would still be capable of controlling the exercise device.","As used in this specification and the appended claims, the phrases \u201ccommunicating with,\u201d and \u201cin communication with\u201d and similar phrases shall mean any type of applicable communication known to one skilled in the art in light of the disclosure herein, such as electrical communication, optical communication, physical communication, magnetic communication, software communication, hardware communication, data communication, and the like.","An exercise system according to one embodiment of the present invention is configured to simulate a real world exercise route.
