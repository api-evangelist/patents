{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/119,207, filed Dec. 2, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This application also claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to French Patent Application No. FR 0857939, filed Nov. 24, 2008, the contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates to a composition for making up the skin, for example the face, or the lips, comprising at least one polyalkene-based supramolecular polymer. The disclosure also relates to a method for making up the skin and\/or lips comprising the application of such a composition.","When consumers use a product for the complexion, such as a foundation, they want this product to exhibit, after application, good hold on the skin and for example, they do not want it to transfer onto clothes.","It is known to a person skilled in the art to use polymers in order to obtain these properties of lengthy hold during the day. These polymers have very different chemical natures and are generally carried either in a fatty phase or an aqueous phase. Mention may be made, as examples of silicone resins, polyacrylates and latexes. While these polymers may indeed contribute hold properties, such as transfer-free properties, these properties may be accompanied by discomfort, for example during the application of the product (difficult spreading, stickiness) and\/or during the day (tightness, mask effect).","In the field of lipsticks, good hold of the composition is also a requirement of consumers. It is generally obtained by using \u201cfilm-forming\u201d polymers, so as to limit color transfer. The production of polymer films on the lips can, however, be a source of discomfort, for instance due to the tightening effects which the film-forming polymer exerts on the labial mucous membrane.","Furthermore, makeup compositions for the lips are frequently glossy or exhibit a glossy effect. This glossiness, which makes it possible to enhance the lips, is generally obtained by the formation of glossy oils and\/or of particles possessing glints. However, the use of glossy oils may generate stickiness, this sticky nature resulting in these compositions leaving traces on substrates, such as glasses or coffee cups, and thus transferring.","The need thus remains to have available polymers capable of being employed in making up the complexion which make it possible to simultaneously obtain good hold properties while retaining a certain comfort on use.","The need also remains to have available polymers capable of being employed in making up the lips which make it possible to simultaneously obtain a deposited layer which is comfortable, glossy and free from transfer.","One aim of the present disclosure is to provide such polymers.","Accordingly, one aspect of the disclosure is a method for making up the skin and\/or lips, wherein a cosmetic makeup composition comprising, in a cosmetically acceptable medium, at least one polyalkene-based supramolecular polymer is applied to the skin and\/or lips.","Another aspect of the disclosure is a cosmetic composition for making up the skin and\/or lips, comprising, in a cosmetically acceptable medium, at least one polyalkene-based supramolecular polymer and at least one coloring material.","\u201cSupramolecular\u201d polymers are known generally in cosmetics.","The cosmetic compositions according to the disclosure thus comprise at least one polyalkene-based supramolecular polymer.","As used herein, polyalkene-based supramolecular polymer is understood to mean a polymer resulting from the reaction, for example from the condensation, of at least one polyalkene polymer, functionalized by at least one reactive group, with at least one joining group, functionalized by at least one reactive group capable of reacting with the reactive group or groups of the at least one functionalized polyalkene polymer, the at least one joining group being capable of forming at least three H (hydrogen) bonds, for example at least four H bonds. In at least one embodiment the at least one joining group is capable of forming at least four H bonds.","The supramolecular polymer according to the disclosure is capable of forming a supramolecular polymer chain or network by (self)assembling of the said polymer according to the disclosure with at least one other identical or different polymer, each \u201cassembling\u201d involving at least one pair of identical or different matched joining groups carried by each of the polymers according to the disclosure.","As used herein, the term joining group is understood to mean any group which comprises groups which donate or accept H bonds and which is capable of establishing at least three H bonds, such as at least four H bonds, with an identical or different partner joining group. These joining groups can be lateral to the polymer backbone (in a side branch) and\/or carried by the ends of the polymer backbone and\/or carried in the chain forming the polymer backbone. They can be distributed in a random or controlled fashion.","For example, the at least one functionalized polyalkene polymer capable of forming all or part of the polymer backbone of the supramolecular polymer according to the disclosure is of formula HX\u2014P\u2014X\u2032H, wherein:\n\n","Poly(ethylene\/butylene)s are copolymers of 1-butene and ethylene. They can be represented schematically by the sequence of following units:\n\n[\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014] and [\u2014CHCH(CH\u2014CH)\u2014].\n","The polybutadienes can be poly(1,4-butadiene)s or poly(1,2-butadiene)s, which can respectively be represented schematically by the sequences of following units:\n\n[\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014CH\u2014] (poly(1,4-butadiene)s)\n\n[\u2014CH\u2014CH(CH\u2550CH)\u2014] (poly(1,2-butadiene)s).\n","For example, the polybutadienes can be poly(1,2-butadiene)s.","The polyisoprenes can be represented schematically by the sequences of following units:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0024"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"30.06mm","wi":"41.57mm","file":"US09561390-20170207-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"It is possible to also use a mixture of above units, in order to form copolymers.","For example, the at least one functionalized polyalkene polymer exhibits a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of greater than or equal to 1,000, for example ranging from 1,000 to 5,000, or ranging from 1,500 to 3,500.","The at least one functionalized polyalkene polymer can be completely hydrogenated, in order to avoid risks of crosslinking.","The supramolecular polymers can additionally comprise, in their structure, other units resulting from other monomers. Mention may be made, for example, as comonomers, of styrene or epoxy. In at least one embodiment, they do not comprise other units resulting from other monomers and are thus composed solely of polyalkene polymers (100%) to form the polymer backbone.","The at least one polyalkene polymer is functionalized by at least one reactive group, for example functionalized by at least two reactive groups. The functionalization may take place at the end of chains. The reference is then to telechelic polymers. The at least one functionalization group, or reactive group, can be attached to the polyalkene polymer via linkers, such as linear or branched C-Calkylene groups, or directly by a single bond. Mention may be made, for example, as reactive group, of the OH, NH, NHR, SH or NCO functional groups.","Mention may be made, for example, among functionalized polyalkene polymers, of polydienes, such as hydrogenated polydienes comprising hydroxyl functional groups, for example comprising hydroxyl ends, and polyolefins comprising hydroxyl ends.","Polydienes comprising hydroxyl ends are defined, for example, in FR 2 782 723. They can be chosen from homopolymers and copolymers of butadiene, isoprene and 1,3-pentadiene. In at least one embodiment, they have a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of less than 7,000, for example ranging from 1,000 to 5,000, and exhibit a functionality of hydroxyl ends ranging from 1.8 to 3, for example about 2. Mention may be made, for example, of the hydroxylated polybutadienes sold by Elf Atochem under the POLY BD R-45HT and POLY BD R-20 LM trade names, which may be used hydrogenated, for example, and the dihydroxylated hydrogenated poly(1,2-butadiene)s, such as GI3000 (Mn=3100), GI2000 (Mn=2100) and GI1000 (Mn=1500), sold by Nisso.","Mention may also be made, for example, among polyolefins comprising hydroxyl ends, of polyolefins, which are homopolymers or copolymers, comprising \u03b1,\u03c9-hydroxyl ends, such as polyisobutylenes comprising \u03b1,\u03c9-hydroxyl ends, and copolymers of formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0033"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"9.14mm","wi":"40.98mm","file":"US09561390-20170207-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"The supramolecular polymers according to the disclosure also have, in their structure, at least one residue of at least one joining group capable of forming at least 3H bonds, for example at least 4H bonds, the at least one joining group being initially functionalized by at least one reactive group.","The at least one reactive group can be attached to the at least one joining group via at least one linker, such as at least one linear or branched C-Calkylene group, or directly by a single bond.","The at least one reactive group has to be capable of reacting with at least one reactive group carried by the at least one functionalized polyalkene of the at least one functionalized polyalkene polymer.

The surface-treated pigments may also have undergone at least one surface treatment, for example more than one surface treatment. The surface-treated pigments can be prepared according to surface treatment techniques well known to a person skilled in the art or found as such commercially. For example, the surface-treated pigments can be covered with an organic layer. The organic agent with which the pigments are treated can, for example, be deposited on the pigments by evaporation of solvent, chemical reaction between the molecules of the surface agent or creation of a covalent bond between the surface agent and the pigments. The surface treatment can thus be carried out, for example, by chemical reaction of a surface agent with the surface of the pigments and creation of a covalent bond between the surface agent and the pigments or fillers. This method is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,578,266. In at least one embodiment, use is made of an organic agent covalently bonded to the pigments. The at least one agent for the surface treatment is present in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 50% by weight relative to the total weight of the surface-treated pigments, such as from 0.5 to 30% by weight or from 1 to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the surface-treated pigments.
