For example, a stroke\/raster video format has been commonly used to render a video image on a display system, such as those finding wide applications in the field of sonar and radar display systems found in both commercial and military applications. Recent improvements to display systems have commonly utilized a format different than the stroke\/raster format such as that of a Red, Green, Blue (RGB) video format with the signals thereof transfer by way of a serial interface conforming to Electronic Industries Association (EIA) standards.","In certain environments, it is desired that the same video data be used to render a visual image on display systems having different video formats. For example, a first display system generates a stroke\/raster video, whereas a second display system uses and generates a Red, Green, Blue (RGB) video. The RGB format includes a signal called \u201csync-on-green\u201d (SOG) which is the green portion of the RGB video format and also contains the timing signals known as the \u201csync\u201d signal. In this example, both the first and second display systems perform the same function. timing signals known as the \u201csync\u201d signal. In this example, both the first and second display systems perform the same function. If one wishes to display data from both the first and second display systems on a remote monitor that uses RGB video, then a converter is required to convert the stroke\/raster video from the first display system into RGB video. Accordingly, it is desired that a video converter board be provided for converting stroke\/raster video data format into a Red, Green, Blue (RGB) video.","It is a primary objective of the present invention to provide a video converter board for converting stroke\/raster video data into RGB video so as to accommodate the usage of a remote monitor that uses RGB video.","It is a further objective of the present invention to provide for a video converter board for converting stroke\/raster video formatted data into a RGB format for its utilization with a serial interface conforming to a RS-343A standard.","This invention is directed to a video converter board for converting stroke\/raster video data into RGB video responsive to a control signal sync-on-green (SOG) so that the data making up a video image may be utilized by a display subsystem having a communication channel comprising a serial interface conforming to EIA standards.","The video converter board comprises an analog\/digital front-end circuitry, video memory, memory control circuitry, synchronization control circuitry, and a digital-to-analog converter output circuitry. The analog\/digital front-end circuitry receives and samples X deflection, Y deflection, and Video input data transmitted in a stroke\/raster video format. The analog\/digital front-end circuitry converts each of the received signals into a corresponding digital quantity. The memory is comprised of a plurality of banks for storing each digital quantity, and the memory control circuitry sequentially selects each of the plurality of memory banks. The synchronization control circuitry has a first routine for generating the sync-on-green (SOG) signal and a second routine for generating the memory addresses for reading and blanking the selected memory. The digital\/analog converter output circuitry receives, in response to the synchronization control circuitry, the formatted RGB video data, as well as the SOG signal, and interlaces and outputs the SOG signal, along with the RGB video data, in a manner conforming to the requirements of the RS-343A interface.","Referring to the drawings wherein the same reference number indicates the same element throughout, there is shown in  a block diagram, wherein the video converter board  of the present invention is interposed between a first subsystem  and a second system  and allows the first display system  to transfer signals to the second display system  which may be a remote monitor or flat panel.

More particularly, the video converter board  reformats the information carried by the raster\/stroke transmission scheme into a RGB video data format responsive to a sync-on-green signal. Specifically, the video converter board  reformats its received information and provides output data in the RGB video data format so that it may be received and presented by the display system  requiring a serial interface on signal path  conforming to an Electronic Industry Association (EIA) standard, such as, a serial interface formatted in accordance with RS-A standard. To our understanding, the RS-A is the only standard that supports RGB video, but it is contemplated that the present invention will be applicable to other standards if such exist that support RGB video. In general, the display system  generates stroke\/raster video only. The video converter board  converts the stroke\/raster video into RGB so that the display subsystem  that uses RGB video will accept and display the video information generated by the display system . In one of its embodiments, the video converter board  generates monochrome video only i.e., the video converter boar  generates green video on a black background, wherein Red and Blue colors are not used. However, the video converter board  provides the functions to satisfy the requirements of the RGB format, sometimes referred to as SOG video.

The memory banks J, K, and L, are responsive to the synchronization control circuit D and of elements C, D, and for read and blank addressing shown in FIG. (C). The element D, shown in FIG. (A), (memory control sequencer) controls the selection of the memory banks J, K and L, shown in FIG. (B), whereas elements C and D, shown in FIG.

(C), and a second routine (to be described with reference to ) for generating the memory addresses for reading and blanking the selected memory bank J, K, or L, shown in FIG. (B), using elements C and D, shown in FIG. (C). More particularly, elements A and B control the generation of the SOG signals and elements C and D control the memory addresses for reading and blanking. The synchronization control circuitry  generates the memory addresses to be read from the memory banks J, K, and L, shown in FIG. (B), on signal path  and the command for generating the blank data on the memory data bus on signal path , both of which paths are further shown in FIGS.

(B) which respectively, in turn, respond by supplying corresponding signals , , and , respectively carried three separate buses which, in turn, are routed to elements J, K, and L. Each of the elements, J, K, and L provides output signals which is representative of read data on signal path  representative of video data which, in turn, is routed to the D\/A output circuitry  shown on FIG. (C).","The first and second routines for respectively generating the timing for sync-on-green (SOG) and generating the memory addresses for reading and blanking are interrelated and are primarily implemented by means of PAL devices. The PAL devices shown in the block diagram of  are Programmable Array Logic devices known in the art. These devices are designed using software and then programmed to provide logic circuits and state machines. The present invention utilizes these devices to generate the logic, timing, forming of addresses and control signals, and to perform certain features thereof.","For example, the video converter board (VCB)  generates a resolution of 1280 pixels by 1024 lines on the monitor . To keep consistent with the display system  that generates the stroke\/raster video, the present invention does not use 256 pixels on each line, but rather generates a \u201csquare\u201d image resolution of 1024 by 1024. Therefore to generate 1024 locations across the screen of the monitor  and 1024 locations down the screen of the monitor , the present invention uses a 10-bit horizontal address and a 10-bit vertical address (2=1024). Elements D and E generate the 20-bit address (10-bits for horizontal and 10-bits for vertical) for write data addressing. For reading and blanking, elements C and D generate these addresses. Since reading and blanking require the entire memory array J, K and L to be accessed, the present invention simply uses the PAL devices as counters that count from 0 to 1023 (total of 1024 addresses) for both horizontal and vertical addressing. Thus, the second routine for controlling the memory addressing and blanking is to simply design a counter to count at 80 MHz.","In operation, as the counters count, elements A and B monitor the counting. Element A is used for horizontal purposes and element B is used for the vertical purposes. As the data is being delivered to the monitor , at the end of each line there is a sync signal used to tell the monitor circuit to go back to the beginning of the next line. This signal is referred to as the horizontal sync signal  and is shown in FIG. (A).","FIG. (A) illustrates signal  as having a typical duration of 18 ms (55.5 kHz) and comprised of a horizontal (horiz) sync portion , a front porch portion , a back porch portion , and a portion  that carries DATA.","When the horizontal counter reaches 1023, the horizontal sync signal  is generated by element A. The front porch timing comprised of portion  is the amount of time it takes the phosphorus gun, such as that found in monitor  for the CRT thereof to shut off, the sync time comprised of portion  is the amount of time it takes the gun to travel back to the beginning of the next line, and the back porch timing comprised of portion  is the time it takes for the gun to come back on. The usage of these portions is standard for RGB operation.","At the end of producing 1024 lines, element B detects that the counter has counted to 1023 and generates the timing for the vertical sync pulse  shown in FIG. (B) having a typical duration of 18.8 ms (53.3(Hz)). Again, this signal is comprised of a front porch  and a back porch  portions. However, signal  includes a vert sync portion  instead of horiz sync portion . This signal  is typically quite longer than that of the horizontal pulses because the gun has to travel from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen. These signals  and  also give reason to the name \u201csync-on-green\u201d. The data  and the sync pulses of signals  and  all travel on the green signal, thus there is only one output of the VCB  delivered by D\/A output circuitry , shown in FIG. (C).","The D\/A output circuitry  provides for the generation of the SOG signal and the transmission of video data in its RGB format and generates these quantities onto the signal path  which requires an operation conforming to the requirements of a serial interface, e.g., RS-343A standard. The display system  includes a RGB monitor, (CRT) that should be continuously refreshed to allow its colored phosphorus to hold the glow thereof in a continuous manner. The refresh cycles provided by the video converter board  may be further described with reference to FIG. .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00041","num":"00041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["24","24","24","98","100","102","2","24","24","24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e4262","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"7pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{}," FUNCTION","ELEMENTS",{},"MEMORY BANKS"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{}," A (WRITE DATA)","24A","24D","24J"]},{"entry":[{},"A (BLANK DATA)","24O","24I","24L"]},{"entry":[{},"A (READ DATA)","24N","24K","24K"]},{"entry":[{},"B (BLANK DATA)","24N","24H","24K"]},{"entry":[{},"B (WRITE DATA)","24C","24F","24L"]},{"entry":[{},"B (READ DATA)","24M","24J","24J"]},{"entry":[{},"C (BLANK DATA)","24M","24G","24J"]},{"entry":[{},"C (WRITE DATA)","24B","24E","24K"]},{"entry":[{},"C (READ DATA)","24O","24L","24L"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"During one complete refresh cycle, that is, during refresh cycles ,  or , each quantity sampled by the A\/D converter is stored in a given memory bank J, K, or L and the information taken therefrom is placed on signal path .
