{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/851,133 filed on May 24, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,492,946.","This invention relates generally to technologies that enable the digitization of a data. This invention relates more particularly to technologies for digitally capturing data from handwritten data entry into printed forms, at the point of interaction.","The most commonly used platform for mutual collection of data is completion of a form. (The term \u201cform,\u201d as used herein, refers generally to a document (electronic or paper based) that is organized into a plurality of fields for data related to the plurality of fields. The data may include, for example, a signature, or a link to other data).","It is desirable in many environments to digitize information entered into forms and provide this data to other computer systems. One example is a service person attending at a residence to process an order for a swimming pool. The services person generally fills out one or more forms containing fields for data related to service ordering, ordering of equipment and supplies, calculation of payment, scheduling of personnel, processing of deposits by credit card, ordering of follow up services calls and so on. This data is desirable from the perspective of the pool installation company's scheduling system, accounting system and so on. Other examples including medical consent forms, medical treatment order forms, parking tickets and so on.","Numerous prior art solutions exist that fully digitized forms and make them available on a wide variety of devices, including for example hand held devices. There are a number of disadvantages to these prior art technologies. First, the adoption of the digitized forms requires behavioral change in users changing the way the work, often radically. With numerous key users bases this behavioral change has presented a very significant barrier to the adoption of these digital technologies. Second, these technologies have been generally costly to adopt, particularly when considering the training required for the user base to adapt to the change in their workflow. Third, and perhaps most importantly, with most applications of the prior art technologies completion of forms based on digital input is generally significantly slower than filling out forms manually. This results in yet another important barrier to adoption.","Other prior art technologies are directed to digital data capture after the manual form has been completed by the user. These technologies generally required the scanning and processing of the forms using OCR technology. This solution, however, is costly in that significant resources are expended in data entry and data correction, even with improved technology. Significant costs and time delays are also incurred in the physical collection, transportation, handling, sorting and storing these paper based documents. Also, it is often desirable or required to obtain feedback on the accuracy of the digitized form data from the user who originally completed the form. This is often necessary, for example, in medical applications of the technology. Even if the time that has elapsed between the completion of the form and the feedback request is relatively short, recollection may be imperfect or the further burden on busy staff that is presented by the feedback request may be undesirable. Further the cots imposed on the system for verifying and re-entering data are significant.","What is needed therefore is a technology that is based on digital capture of data linked to manual handwritten completion of a form by a user, in real time while the form is completed.","Technologies directed at this manual\/digital form of electronic form data capture are known.","For example, A.T. Cross Company markets a CROSSPAD\u2122 35, a portable digital notepad that digitizes and records pen movements using radio transmission. The CROSSPAD transmits the recorded pen movements to a personal computer for processing and analysis. Similar technologies have been developed by Pegaus, whose PCNoteTaker uses a similar technology to turn movements of the pen into a digital X-Y steam.","Technologies are also known that facilitate the electronic capture of data while a paper based form is being completed in addressing specific problems that arise during operation. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,482 issued to WorkOnce Wireless Corporation provides a \u201cMethod and System for Form Recognition and Digitized Image Processing\u201d which discloses a solution for achieving alignment between a digital ink image of handwritten information on a form with an image of the underlying form.","What is needed, however, is an integrated solution that enables the capture and real time character recognition to electronic data from a traditional form at the point of data capture and that processes the data using a pre-defined electronic workflow. There is also a need for a solution that enables data verification as part of a single transaction simultaneous with the completion of the paper based form, to create an intelligent learning system.","The present invention provides an integrated solution for completing paper forms while capturing and processing the data therefrom in real time. An electronic clipboard is provided that enables real data capture, conversion and correction of resultant digital form data at the point of entry. The digital form data is transferred on a secure basis for processing over a wireless connection. Alternatively, the digital form data is stored on the electronic clipboard and transferred to a computer later, for example, by means of synching utility.","A forms manager is associated with the electronic clipboard which enables the creation of an electronic form or smart form version of the paper form. The smart form includes a plurality of rules for digital processing the smart form, including for example the handling of associated credit card or debit card transactions.","In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the electronic clipboard is linked for two-way processing with the computer (a desktop in one implementation, a server computer in another). Loaded on the computer (or on linked computers) is programming operable to extract the data contained in the forms, including the traffic information about where appropriate pieces of data should be sent. The server software of the present invention has the ability to process the forms, and forward the information to the appropriate software through a suite of interfaces for further processing. Traffic rules can be used to establish two way communications, so that for example, credit card transactions, or other interactions involving verification of data collected, can be undertaken. The server software will track transactions, process financial transactions and confirm the completion of these activities in real time through communicating with the device.","In another aspect of the present invention, a related business model is provided based on charges for transactions, with an enhanced transaction charge for those interactions requiring two way confirmation. To this end, an accounting\/billing utility and reporting utility are built into the software.","The present invention therefore defines an end-to-end digital workflow that coincides with the handwritten completion of the paper form. The solution therefore offers the advantages of paper forms (such as ease of completion and availability of a reliable audit trail) in combination with the advantages of a fully digital, integrated workflow.","The solution reduces the costs associated with forms processing by eliminating steps required to realize electronic data acquisition from paper based forms and allows interactive 2-way communications when used in a mobile environment.","One aspect of the present invention is the electronic clipboard () of the present invention, illustrated in . The electronic clipboard is provided using known hardware and software components. One aspect of the present invention is that the electronic clipboard () is designed and configured, in a manner that is known, such that its hardware, software and\/or memory capabilities can be readily upgraded where required or desired for particular implementations of the invention (for example if biometric security is required then a fingerprint scanner can be easily added, the same for GPS or photo input).","The electronic clipboard () includes a microprocessor (not shown) and memory (also not shown), as well as a number of other utilities typical of electronic clipboard devices, provided in a manner that is known.","The representative embodiment of the electronic clipboard () of the present invention includes:\n\n","It is also desirable that the electronic clipboard () include means for positive position verification so that the clipboard application () can determine which field in the electronic form corresponding to the paper form () a particular entry on the paper form () made with the pen () relates. By way of illustration, the electronic clipboard () of the present invention utilizes the position verification described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,482.","Also, the representative embodiment of the electronic clipboard () of the present invention also includes or can be fitted to include:\n\n","In one aspect thereof, the clipboard application includes an ASIC based handwriting character recognition engine that provides fast, near real-time algorithm processing on the electronic clipboard ().","The data captured and converted by the electronic clipboard () is either stored in the local memory in the clipboard, or preferably is transmitted by means of a secure wireless connection (provided in a manner that is known) to the server () of the present invention. The data transmitted from the electronic clipboard () is securely encrypted so that it can be safely and securely sent over the Internet, and can only be un-encrypted by the server application with the appropriate encryption key and\/or authentication data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","26","32","26","33","26","34","10","34"]},"As shown in , the configuration of the server (), including the traffic server () and the communications rules embedded in the electronic form are designed to operate in a redundant system environment, in a manner that is known. This means that should there be a problem, with gathering, collecting and processing data at one location, the other remote location can be utilized.","The Application Server () is also linked to a forms manager () consisting of a management application suite that enables the design of forms supported by the solution of the present invention.","The forms manager () provides a series of known user interfaces for defining the workflow, in accordance with the present invention. This workflow includes the definition of an electronic form or smart form corresponding to a particular paper form (), as well as the rules (field by field) for processing the same.","The forms manager () creates the electronic form based on a plurality of \u201csmart fields\u201d defined by two principal components. (1) Properties and (2) Preferences. Properties define field formatting and validation requirements, while Preferences define workflow in relation to the Traffic Server () described below.","Upon creation of a smart form, the user must define the field Properties by operation of the forms manager (), including the following:\n\n","The derivative of these defined Properties is a smart form definition profile that is used by the electronic clipboard () for defining data capture field values, character recognition and data formatting rules, while the Application Server () uses this information to define the data management schema and storage requirements.","The integration of the properties field into the smart form, severely constrains the variations in data input and the possible outputs, allowing speedy, real time verification of characters. This has the benefit of improved accuracy, reduced response times and lower processing power requirements.","The Preferences relate specifically to pre-defined traffic \u2018objects\u2019 that are created using the Application Programming Interface or API Library () linked to the traffic management server (). Data that is required to be passed on to third party corporate databases, commerce gateways or to third party CRM\/ERP\/Accounting applications must be pre-defined for location, method and format for the data exchange. The Preferences interface allows the Form designer to select the appropriate values needed to process the data via the traffic management server (). Each such traffic object is generally comprised of three components: an API; a Field Definition and Remote Data Verification, defined in a manner that is known.","Since each smart form generally includes multiple fields, for each of which there may be a separated destination that the data contained in that field is to be processed to, there is no limit to the number of traffic objects that can be used in a single smart form. The API defines the remote system that will be processing the smart form, the Field Definition is the field that is expected by the remote system (i.e.: Customer ID, Address, etc. . . . ). It is generally required that there be a field defined on the smart form that corresponds to the field definition on the traffic object. Finally, the Remote Data Verification determines whether or not the remote system will pass back a value in real-time to the electronic clipboard () or a confirmation notice to the Billing\/Accounting server or simply a handshake confirmation that the data was received successfully (i.e.: Confirmed or Failed).","The following represents an example of the forms manager () in operation. A Sales Order form is created for a pharmaceutical company. The sales rep has completed a sales call and fills out the form which includes requirements for restocking of existing inventory and free samples of a new product. When the order is completed and forwarded for processing, there are traffic server objects that are used to process the data. The first is an SAP API which will take the entire order (except the Free Samples line items) and pass the data to the company accounting and inventory system. The second API will pass the client information and sales summary information to the SalesForce.com API which is used by the sales team to track calls and closing ratio's, and finally the sample order information will be passed to an ORACLE API which is used by the Product Marketing group to track samples so they can follow up on their market research.","The present invention also contemplates a desktop application () loaded on the desktop computer (). As illustrated in , the desktop application () provides features corresponding generally to those of the Application Service Provider (), hut typically in a \u201cLITE\u201d implementation thereof. The desktop application is used to manage the clipboard application (), and includes a utility corresponding to the forms manager () described above.","As best illustrated in , the traffic management server is linked to the Application Service Provider () and enables smart routing functions (as mentioned above) and in particular connects the Application Service Provider () to other networks and systems using several gateway functions such as commerce transactions using Merchant VISA\/MasterCard, data exchange using SOAP\/XML, a JAVA based Application Programmers Interface (APT), an application library API which provides a specific set of standards for particular legacy systems such as PeopleSoft, SAP, SAS, Siebel, Oracle, etc. . . . , and finally, a set of ODBC Translators allowing data to be routed directly into corporate databases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["46","40","46","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"10","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":["Create an electronic form using the forms manager () (whether the web based tool provided by the Application Service Provider () or the PC \u2018Lite\u2019 version of the application provided by the desktop application ()).

Data can be sent (when a field is completed, and based on the smart rules) for verification and processing through the Application Server () and the traffic management server (). Confirmation of the transaction can then be sent back to the electronic clipboard () and displayed on the LCD display ().","Specific fields can be designated for drawings or secure signatures where appropriate, in a manner that is known. Field based encryption rules can be adopted based on specific applications and mandated requirements. Specific parameters for field based encryption, including for example the specific encryption technology and\/or standard to be used, can be selected and incorporated into an electronic form based on operation of the Properties. For example, by this method, a user may select from a range of available encryption technologies, such as synchronous or asynchronous encryption technologies from a variety of vendors such as RSA\u2122, ENTRUST\u2122, or others. The field level encryption may occur on the electronic clipboard (), the server () or both, by operation of the Properties.","As mentioned earlier, the electronic clipboard () includes a number of unique technology features which enhance the value of the process.

The business model of the present invention represents significant saving to an enterprise adopting the mobile paper solution of the present invention. The following illustrates the saving realized in accordance with the invention:\n\n","Based on this there is a significant savings in material handling and other costs which is the basis for business model of the present invention. By basing the charge to the client on a per transaction basis, the focus of the mobile paper solution of the present invention becomes providing a \u201cReturn on Investment\u201d rather than device cost.","WorkOnce will base its agreement with clients on the following four charges:\n\n","In another implementation of the present invention, the server application of the present invention (described in association with the Application Server ()) is licensed for installation at customer sites, when there is a logical benefit to self management. This will be particularly appropriate where the collection of data is fully integrated into the main databases of the company, where there is significant two way interaction as the form is completed, or where security requires minimal access to data externally. In this case, there will be a component of each of the four charges maintained in the license model, but the enterprise cost will rise and the cost per transaction will be reduced.","Other implementations of the present invention are possible:","(a) Individual users who will purchase the electronic clipboards () and a light version of the software of the present invention, and use in either a standalone or wireless opportunity.","(b) OEM organizations who wish to license the clipboard application () and the forms manager () and the Server\/Traffic solutions software described above (perhaps with certain hardware components).
