{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Various collaboration tools have become a new standard for communication and collaboration over the internet. Examples are social networks such as the FACEBOOK website and services of Facebook, Inc., the TWITTER website and services of Twitter, Inc., and GOOGLE WAVE of Google, Inc. Other examples are non-social networks such as the collaboration services available with the ACROBAT\u00ae product of Adobe, Inc. These products and services offer capabilities that have the potential to be very useful for business purposes. However, these tools include an important drawback in that information communicated through such communication and collaboration services is disclosed and can be at risk to be compromised. The potential for exposing organizational confidential information is too great of a risk for organizations to utilize such products and services for organizational communication and collaboration. Further, information shared via such products and services is subject to privacy and usage agreements of these products and services. The terms of the privacy and usage agreements are subject to change. Although such products and services offer certain security features, the risks involved in using these products and services are too great. To mitigate potential exposures, organizations do not allow for the use of these communication and collaboration services over the Internet.","In an example embodiment, an organization, such as a company, plans to share data among their employees via a social network or other communication or collaboration service. As used herein, \u201ccollaboration service\u201d commonly refers to both communication and collaboration services that are offered as at least one of a product and service via a network, such as the Internet. Such collaboration services include products and services offered by organizations such as Facebook, Inc. through the FACEBOOK website and services, Twitter, Inc. via the TWITTER website and services, Google, Inc. via the GOOGLE WAVE services and products, Adobe, Inc. via the ACROBAT product and services, and others organizations, products, and services. Some of these collaboration services are accessible through a web browser, while others are accessible through specific applications. A generalization that can be made about each of these collaboration services is that they each include at least one of a client-side Application Programming Interface (API), a client-side defined specification, or a client-side application plug-in for use in communicating with these collaboration services accessible via the Internet. The API, client-side defined specification, or a client-side application plug-in of the collaboration services specify how various data types are to be sent to and received from the collaboration service, and may further specify other data processing functions. In some embodiments, where the client-side application for accessing the collaboration service is a web browser, the client-side API may be standard web protocols that are leveraged by web browser plug-ins. In the example embodiment of the organization that plans to share data among their employees via a collaboration service, the API, defined specification, or application plug-in for communicating with these collaboration services is leveraged.","In this example embodiment, the collaboration service is leveraged by augmenting the functionality of a computer application within the organization to allow the computer application to receive organization-confidential information for posting or sharing via a collaboration service and to receive and view the posted or shared organization-confidential information while protecting the confidential nature of the information. In such embodiments, the organization-confidential information is transmitted to and received from the collaboration service without the information being compromised during transit, while stored by the collaboration service, or when retrieved by users who are not members of the organization or are otherwise not authorized to view the information. The computer application receiving the organization-confidential information is augmented, such as with an application plug-in or modification of the computer application, to capture data to be sent to the collaboration service prior the data being sent. The captured data will usually include addressing data, such as headers and metadata, and a data payload including the organization-confidential information. The data payload is copied from the captured data and sent to an encryption service. The encryption service is typically a process that executes on a server within a networked computing environment of the organization. The encryption service is typically not accessible outside of the organization's network computing environment. The encryption service operates to receive data to encrypt from a requestor, encrypts the data according to an encryption key that only the encryption service has possession of, and returns the data to the requestor in an encrypted form. Thus, the data payload after being copied and sent to the encryption service is received back in an encrypted form. The data payload of the captured data is then replaced with the data payload in the encrypted form. The captured data is then returned to the computer application for transmission to the collaboration service.","When the information is sent the collaboration service, the data may be sent via HTTP, HTTPS, or other protocol as required or as otherwise specified by the collaboration service. Regardless of the protocol used in sending the data including the encrypted data payload to the collaboration service, the organization-confidential information is secure as the data payload is encrypted using a key possessed only by the encryption service of the organization. When the data is received by the collaboration service, the collaboration service typically stores the data in manner in which the data may be retrieved by other users of the collaboration service. When another user retrieves data including the organization-confidential information from the collaboration service, the organization-confidential data is still secure, as the collaboration service does not possess the encryption key. However, when the user is a member of the organization and has access to the encryption service, that user may be able to view the organization-confidential information. For example, if that user has the appropriate application augmented with functionality, such as through a computer application plug-in or adaptation of the computer application to decrypt the data. For example, the computer application plug-in or adapted computer application may capture data received from the collaboration service prior to the received data being displayed and determine if the received data includes a data payload encrypted by the encryption service. If the data payload in the data received from the collaboration service is encrypted by the encryption service, the encrypted data payload is copied and sent to the encryption service to be decrypted. The data payload is received back after being decrypted. The encrypted data payload of the received data is then replaced with the decrypted data payload and the data is then forwarded on in the processing order of the computer application. The computer application is then able to provide the user with a view of the organization-confidential data.","These and other embodiments are described in detail below with reference to the figures. In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the inventive subject matter may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice them, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the inventive subject matter.

Thus, the exemplary process flow is applicable to software, firmware, and hardware implementations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","104","114","106","112","106","112","106","112","100","108","109","100","110"]},"The client computing devices ,  are connected to a network including connectivity to an organization network  and the Internet . The collaboration service is connected to the Internet . Thus, the client computing devices ,  are able to communicate with the collaboration service  via the Internet . In some embodiments, the collaboration service  may instead be connected to another network, such as the organization network  or other network to which the client computing devices ,  are also connected.","In some embodiments, the client computing devices ,  may be personal computers, netbook computers, handheld computing devices, smart phones, or other computing devices.","The encryption service  is typically a service that executes on a server computer connected to the organization network . The encryption service  is operable to receive clear text from a requesting collaboration application , , encrypt the clear text according to the key  to generate cipher text, and return the cipher text to the requesting collaboration application , . The encryption service  is also operable to receive cipher text from a requesting collaboration application , , decrypt the clear text according to the key  to generate clear text, and return the clear text to the requesting collaboration application , . In some embodiments, the encryption service  requires a user ,  of the requesting collaboration application ,  to be authenticated within the organization network  or to provide authentication credentials to the encryption service . Absent authentication, the encryption service  in such embodiments will not perform the requested encryption or decryption. In some embodiments when the encryption service  requires user authentication through provision of credentials, the encryption service  may be accessible via the Internet .","The encryption key  in some embodiments is a symmetric encryption key. The strength of the encryption key is dependent upon the particular embodiment and a degree of security desired by an organization implementing the system . An asymmetric encryption key may be used in other embodiments.","In some embodiments, based on the identity of particular authenticated users, different encryption keys may be utilized. In such embodiments, different levels of security can be implemented to allow different levels of employees or other users to view only organization-confidential information posted to the collaboration service  they are authorized to view.","The collaboration applications ,  may take several forms. One form is a web browser and a web browser plug-in that determines if the source of inbound data is the collaboration service . In such embodiments, the plug-in is tailored to the specific collaboration service . In some embodiments, there may be multiple plug-ins, each plug-in tailored according to the specifications for communication with a particular collaboration service . For example, one plug-in may be tailored to the FACEBOOK collaboration service and another plug-in tailored to the LINKEDIN collaboration service.","In other embodiments, the collaboration applications ,  may be a rich Internet application including user interfaces displayable within another application, such as a web browser, or as standalone applications. The rich Internet applications may be encoded in a language executable within a runtime environment on the client computing devices , . The language may be JAVA executable within the JAVA runtime environment from Sun Microsystems, Inc., FLEX or ACTION SCRIPT executable within the FLASH runtime environment from Adobe Systems, Inc., a language executable within the SILVERLIGHT runtime environment from Microsoft, Inc., or other runtime environment. In other embodiments, the collaboration applications ,  may be standalone client applications executable on the particular client computing device ,  upon which it may be deployed.","The collaboration applications ,  are operable to receive input from users for posting to the collaboration service  and to retrieve and display information from the collaboration service . In some embodiments, the collaboration applications ,  include additional functionality and capabilities, such as providing access to an enterprise resource planning (ERP) application, such as an application available from SAP AG of Waldorf, Germany. In some embodiments where the collaboration applications ,  include ERP application functionality, the collaboration applications ,  when presenting ERP application data provide tools to designate displayed data for posting to the collaboration service . Some such embodiments may further include the ability to generate reports or other documents within an ERP application from the collaboration applications ,  for the specific purpose of posting to the collaboration service . Additional ERP application functionality may be included in the collaboration applications ,  depending on the needs for the specific embodiment.","In use, collaboration application  executing on the client computing device  receives clear text input A including organization-confidential information from a user . The user  provides the clear text input A through a user interface of the collaboration application , such as the user interface illustrated and described with regard to . The collaboration application  in some embodiments treats all received input as organization-confidential information. In other embodiments, the user  designates the input as organization-confidential information through selection of a user interface control.","Following receipt of the clear text input A from the user , the collaboration application  receives additional input from the user  including a command to post the clear text input A to the collaboration service . Following receipt of the command to post the clear text input A to the collaboration service , the collaboration application  prepares the clear text input A for posting to the collaboration service .","In some embodiments, the collaboration application  as part of preparing the clear text input A for posting will send the clear text input B to the encryption service  to be encrypted using the encryption key . The encryption service  through the encryption process generates and returns a cipher text C to the collaboration application . The cipher text C is the clear text input A received from the user , only in an encrypted form. The collaboration application  then transmits the cipher text D to the collaboration service .","In other embodiments of the collaboration application  that include an application plug-in, following receipt of the command to post the clear text input A to the collaboration service , the collaboration application  prepares the clear text input A for posting to the collaboration service . Either during the preparation of the clear text input A or immediately prior to transmission of the clear text input A to the collaboration service , the application plug-in interrupts the collaboration application  and captures the data prepared by the collaboration application  for transmission to the collaboration service. The application plug-in then copies a data payload from captured data. The copied data payload includes the clear text input A received from the user . The application plug-in then sends copied data payload including the clear text input B to the encryption service . The encryption service encrypts data payload including the clear text input B to generate a cipher text form of the data payload. The cipher text C form of the data payload is then sent back to the application plug-in. The application plug-in then replaces the data payload of the captured data with the cipher text C form of the data payload. Control of processing is then returned to the collaboration application  to allow processing of the data for posting to the collaboration application  to continue. The collaboration application  then transmits the cipher text D to the collaboration service .","The collaboration service  is now in possession of the organization-confidential information initial input as clear text A by the user . However, the information is encrypted and therefore has not been compromised. The collaboration service  will process the data as any other data it receives as the collaboration service  only cares that received data in the proper format and is communicated properly. If someone were to view the data, regardless of the type of data (text, image, etc.), it would be unintelligible due to the encryption.","Subsequently, another user  requests the organization-confidential information from the collaboration service . The request for the organization-confidential information may be an explicit request or a request for recent posting to the collaboration service in a feed of the user . In either case, the collaboration service  responds by sending the cipher text E of the organization-confidential information to the collaboration application  of the user .","In some embodiments, the collaboration application  evaluates data received from the collaboration service . The evaluation of the data includes determining if the source of the received data is the collaboration service and if the received data includes an encrypted data payload. If the source is the collaboration service and an encrypted data payload is included, the collaboration application  copies the encrypted data payload and sends the copy to the encryption service  as cipher text F. The encryption service  decrypts the cipher text F using the encryption key  and returns clear text G. The clear text G is the data payload in a decrypted form. Thus, the collaboration application  following receipt of the clear text G replaces the data payload of the data received from the collaboration service  with the clear text G. The collaboration application  then continues to process and eventual present a view of the data received from the collaboration service , including a view of the organization-confidential information.","In other embodiments of the collaboration application  that include an application plug-in, the application plug-in interrupts the collaboration application  upon receipt of data for presentation. The application plug-in captures data received by the application and determines if the data was received from the collaboration service  and if the data includes an encrypted data payload. When the data was received from the collaboration service  and includes an encrypted data payload, the application plug-in sends a copy of the encrypted data payload as cipher text F to the encryption service  to be decrypted. The encryption service  decrypts the cipher text F using the encryption key  and returns clear text G. The clear text G is the data payload in a decrypted form. The application plug-in then replaces the encrypted data payload (cipher text E) within the received data with a decrypted data payload received from the encryption service . The application plug-in then returns the received data, including the decrypted data payload, to the collaboration application . The collaboration application then continues to process and eventual present a view of the data received from the collaboration service , including a view of the organization-confidential information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","202","200","204","206","200","208","208"]},"In some embodiments of the method , the data payload is received  as a data chunk created by an application performing the method  according to a transfer protocol of the collaboration service. For example, the data payload may be received in a data packet. In other embodiments, prior to transmission of data for posting to the collaboration service, the size of the data may be evaluated in view of data size limit specifications of the collaboration service. The data chunk size may be set based on a functionality of a collaboration service being utilized. For example, some functionalities, when utilized, may aim to provide near-real-time collaboration, such as sharing data at the granularity of keystrokes on a keyboard. The data chunks in such embodiments will be quite small in comparison to the data chunks involved with sharing an image or video. In yet other embodiments, the size of the data chunks is set according to a data transfer protocol specified by the particular collaboration service utilized. If the size of the data to be posted exceeds a size limit, the data may be broken into data chunks according to the requirements of the collaboration service.
