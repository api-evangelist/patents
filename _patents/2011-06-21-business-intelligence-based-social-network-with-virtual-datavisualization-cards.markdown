title: Business intelligence based social network with virtual data-visualization cards
abstract: A method for sharing business intelligence information includes creating a plurality of data visualization cards from business intelligence data in response to create requests from a plurality of user accounts. Each data visualization card is associated with the user account that requested its creation. Data visualization cards are also associated with user accounts that did not request their creation in response to collect requests from those user accounts. A social network is created amongst the user accounts using the data visualization cards such that user accounts associated with data visualization cards created from common business intelligence data are linked. A first data visualization card that was created in response to a create request from a first user account may then be provided to a second user account in response to determining that the first user account and the second user account are linked in the social network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to social network systems and more particularly to using business intelligence information to build a social network through the creation and collection of virtual data visualization cards.","2. Related Art","More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as, for example, the Internet. Consumers routinely purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions may take place directly between a conventional or on-line merchant or retailer and the consumer, and payment is typically made by entering user information such as user financial information (e.g., credit card information.) Transactions may also take place with the aid of an on-line or mobile payment service provider such as, for example, PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Such payment service providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties involved. Purchasing with the assistance of a payment service provider from the convenience of virtually anywhere using a mobile device is one main reason why on-line and mobile purchases are growing very quickly.","Payment service providers are just one example of many businesses that generate business intelligence information, which may be viewed, in one way, as information generated from the operations of a business that may be analyzed to determine how that business is performing. Conventional business intelligence systems such as, for example, those provided by Microstrategy, Essbase, and a variety of other business intelligence system providers known in the art, collect business intelligence data generated by businesses and allow those businesses to use that data to analyze business performance.","However, while such conventional business intelligence systems allow a user to analyze specific business intelligence data, they provide no systems to distribute the vast amount of business intelligence information contained in the system. Without such a system, much of the business intelligence information included in conventional business intelligence systems may never be utilized by many of the users of the business intelligence system.","Thus, there is a need for an improved business intelligence information distribution system.","According to one embodiment, a method for distributing business intelligence information includes creating a plurality of data visualization cards from business intelligence data and associating those data visualization cards with user accounts. Users may create or collect data \u201cvisualization cards\u201d in their users accounts that include business intelligence data that they are interested in. A social network is then created amongst the user accounts using the data visualization cards such that user accounts associated with data visualization cards created from common business intelligence data are linked.","As a result, a data visualization card that was created in response to a create request from a first user account may then be provided to a second user account in response to determining that the first user account and the second user account are linked in the social network. Thus, business intelligence information is distributed to a plurality of users using a social network that links the users based on the information that they are interested in (e.g., the data visualization cards they've created or collected).","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.","In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a system and method for distributing business intelligence information. A social network system is built based on business intelligence information that is viewed and collected by users of the system through data visualization cards. The users create and collect the data visualization cards, which are created using business intelligence data, and the business intelligence data is used to link users in the social network system by linking users that create and collect cards that use common business intelligence data. Once the users have been linked using the data visualization cards, the system may use those links to suggest data visualization cards to users who did not create them and have not collected them. For example, a first user may be linked to plurality of other users based on the first user being associated with data visualization cards that use business intelligence data which is also used by data visualization cards created or collected by the other users. In such an example, data visualization cards (which the first user has not created or collected) may be suggested to the first user in response to determining that the other users have created or collected those data visualization cards or determining that those data visualization cards were created using business intelligence data that is used in a plurality of data visualization cards the first users has created or collected. Thus, business intelligence information is distributed through the social network system to users that would otherwise not receive and\/or use that business intelligence information.","Referring now to , a method  for distributing business intelligence information is illustrated. The method  may be performed with a business, across businesses, and\/or in a variety of other situations known in the art. For example, one or more businesses may generate business intelligence information (e.g., in the form of business intelligence data) in the course of the operation of the business. The business intelligence data may include data about business sales, customers, products, and\/or a variety of other business intelligence data known in the art. Specific examples of business intelligence data may include the distribution of new customer signups by business unit and by region over a weekly period for the last quarter, the percentage of new customer accounts that went on to actually purchase at least one product, the volume of sales in the current quarter versus the same quarter last year, the average number and size of purchases for the average customer, the average number of times a customer visits a site or a store, and\/or a variety of other business intelligence data known in the art. That business intelligence data may be collected and stored in one or more databases. The business intelligence system of the present disclosure may collect and store the business intelligence data, or may be coupled to other systems and\/or databases used to collect and store the business intelligence data. In an embodiment, the business intelligence system may access conventional business intelligence systems and\/or databases to retrieve and store the business intelligence data in the business intelligence system. A plurality of users are connected to the business intelligence system through a network via user devices. Each of the plurality of users includes a user account in the business intelligence system that allows that user to access and use the business intelligence system according to the method .","Referring now to , , , and , the method  begins at block  where a plurality of data visualization cards are created in response to create requests. illustrates a user  that sends a create request to the business intelligence system (e.g., over a network using a user account on a user device) that causes the business intelligence system to access a database  and create a data visualization card . For example, the user  may use a user device  that includes a user device display , illustrated in and , and that is connected to the business intelligence system through a network. The user  may be presented with a business intelligence database screen  on the user device display that includes a plurality of published data sets , , , , , and , illustrated in . In an embodiment, each of the plurality of published data sets include business intelligence data that was generated by the business or businesses associated with the business intelligence system. The plurality of published data sets may have been collected and stored in a database by the business intelligence system, retrieved from a database created by other business intelligence systems (e.g., over a network), and\/or acquired using a variety of other techniques known in the art. In an embodiment, the published data sets may have been uploaded to the business intelligence system by one of the users of the business intelligence system. For example, data reports (e.g., spreadsheets and\/or other data holding structure known in the art) may be published to software by one or more business intelligence data providers (e.g., Microstrategy, Inc.\u2014http:\/\/www.microstrategy.com\/; Cognos Inc., http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/software\/data\/cognos\/; and\/or a variety of other business intelligence providers known in the art). The business intelligence system may periodically speak with that software to retrieve the data reports and\/or update previously retrieved data reports. The data from the retrieved database reports may then be transferred to the business intelligence system to be made available for users to create data visualization cards, as discussed in further detail below.","In the illustrated embodiment, each published data set may include a database name under a data set name section , an owner name (e.g., the creator of the published data set) under an owner name section , a last modification date under a last modification date section , an associated metric under an associated metric section , an attribute (e.g., the date range included in the data set) under an attributes section , one or more associated data visualization cards (e.g., data visualization cards that have been created using that data set, discussed below) under a data visualization card list section , and a button under a create data visualization card button section ","The user  may select the button in the create data visualization card button section of a particular published data set in order to create a data visualization card from that published data set. In response to selecting a button in the create data visualization card button section of a particular published data set, the business intelligence system presents the user  with a data visualization card creation screen  on the user device display of the user device , illustrated in . The data visualization card creation screen  includes a plurality of data visualization card creation tools such as, for example, a graphic type tool , a metric selection tool , a graphing type tool , and attribute selection tool . The data visualization card creation screen  also includes a publish button . While a plurality of data visualization card creation tools are illustrated and described, they are meant to be merely exemplary, and one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of other data visualization card creation tools may be provided to create data visualization cards from data sets that will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","The user  may create the data visualization card  using the data visualization card creation tools, illustrated in . In response to the user  using the data visualization card creation tools, a create request is sent from the user device  through the network to the business intelligence system that causes the business intelligence system to retrieve business intelligence data from a database (e.g., business intelligence data included in the published data set selected using the button in the create data visualization card button section of that published data set, as described above with reference to the business intelligence database screen  of ) and use that business intelligence data to create the data visualization card  according to the create request. When the data visualization card  has been created to the satisfaction of the user , the user  may select the publish button  to publish the data visualization card  to the business intelligence system such that other users may view the data visualization card .","For example, the user  may use the graphic type tool to select a graphic type for the data visualization card . A graphic type may include a line graph graphic type, a bar chart graphic type, a pictograph graphic type, a pie chart graphic type, a cosmograph graphic type, an organizational chart graphic type, a flow chart graphic type, a histogram graphic type, a scatterplot graphic type, a box plot graphic type, a map graphic type, and\/or a variety of other graphic types know in the art. The user  may also use the metric selection tool to select a metric or other measure that helps quantitatively assess the business intelligence data in the published data set that the user  is interested in. The user  may also use the graphing type tool to select a metric type to include in the data visualization card . The user  may also use the attribute selection tool to select an metric attribute to include in the data visualization card.","In response to the selections made by the user  using the data visualization card creation tools, one or more create requests are sent to the business intelligence system that cause the business intelligence system to retrieve business intelligence data from a database and use that business intelligence data to create the data visualization card . For example, , illustrates the data visualization card  that has been created by the user  selecting a bar chart graphic type, a customer acquisition metric, an account metric type, and with region and guest attributes. In an embodiment, the types of business intelligence data used to create the data visualization card may be referred to as the business intelligence data parameters of that data visualization card, and those business intelligence data parameters are associated with the data visualization card such that any updates to the business intelligence data in a database may be retrieved and displayed on the data visualization card using the business intelligence data parameters. Thus, data visualization cards are dynamic in that, once created by defining the business intelligence data parameters, the data visualization card is operable to display the most recent business intelligence data that is associated with those business intelligence data parameters. As such, data visualization cards can be defined as a graphical representation of a defined set of information represented on a virtual collectable card that may be shared, but may also include any set of instructions, stored on a non-transitory, computer-readable medium, that when executed by a processor, cause the processor to retrieve a defined set of information, transform that defined set of information into a graphical representation of that information, and provide that graphical representation on a virtual card that may be shared amongst users.","In another embodiment, a data visualization card is a collectable and tradable virtual object that contains content that includes information provided from the business intelligence system and from users (e.g., user provided insights and\/or comments on the information). Functionally, a data visualization card may be thought of as akin to subscribing to a newspaper. By collecting a data visualization card, a user is subscribing to an information feed that includes data from both the business intelligence systems and from the actions of other users associated, both directly and indirectly, with that data visualization card. The foundation of the data visualization card is a data visualization whereby a set of numeric data is visually represented in any manner that one would want to visually represent data in order to convey a visual story about that data. In addition to the visualization, a data visualization card will display one or more pieces of metadata such as, for example, the user that created the data visualization card, the time of creation of the data visualization card, definitions of the data being displayed by the data visualization card, the most recent time the data in the data visualization card was refreshed, and\/or a variety of other metadata known in the art. Finally, a data visualization card may also contain references to other information (comments, insights, other suggested data visualization cards) of value to anyone interested in the data being portrayed in that data visualization card.","Referring now to , , and , the method  proceeds to block  where data visualization cards are associated with users that created them. In response to the user  creating the data visualization card , the business intelligence system will associated the user account of that user  with the data visualization card  in a database. Furthermore, the user  may create any number of data visualization cards, using a variety of different business intelligence data, in substantially the same manner as described above for the data visualization card , and those data visualization cards will be associated with their user account. illustrates the user  having created the data visualization card  and data visualization cards  and  using, for example, the data visualization card creation tools on the data visualization card creation screen , described above. Having created the plurality of data visualization cards , , and , the user  may be presented with a user account screen  including a data visualization card collection  that includes the data visualization cards , , and  that are associated with the user account of the user , as illustrated in . Furthermore, each of those data visualization cards , , and  may be published to the business intelligence system as discussed above such that they are available to other users.","Furthermore, any user in the business intelligence system may use their user account to create data visualization cards, and those data visualization cards will then be associated with their user accounts substantially as described above. Thus, each user in the business intelligence system may be presented with a user account screen (similar to the user account screen  of ) having a data visualization card collection that allows then to view the data visualization cards that they have created, and each data visualization card may be published in the business intelligence system such that users that did not create them can view them. Thus, users in the business intelligence system are distributed business intelligence information through the data visualization cards they create, and business intelligence information may be dynamically updated as the business intelligence data, upon which their data visualization cards are based, is updated.","Referring now to , , and , the method  then proceeds to block  where data visualization cards are associated with users in response to collect requests, and a social network is created using the data visualization cards. As discussed above, data visualization cards are published in the business intelligence system such that users that did not create those data visualization cards can view them. Users may view published data visualization cards and decide that they are interested in the business intelligence information being displayed on that data visualization card. In such a situation, the user may send a collect request to the business intelligence system that causes the business intelligence system to associate that data visualization card with the user account of the user. illustrates a plurality of users , , , and  that have sent a collect request to the business intelligence system such that the data visualization cards  and  (created by the user ) are associated with their user accounts, and a plurality of users , , and  that have sent a collect request to the business intelligence system such that the data visualization card  (created by the user ) is associated with their user accounts.","In an embodiment, each user may be presented with a user account screen (similar to the user account screen  of ) having a data visualization card collection that allows them to view the data visualization cards that they have created and the data visualization cards they have collected. In an embodiment, user created data visualization cards may be separated or labeled different from user collected data visualization cards. Thus, users in the business intelligence system are distributed business intelligence information through the data visualization cards they create and data visualization cards they collect (but that were created by other users), and business intelligence information may be dynamically updated as the business intelligence data, upon which their data visualization cards are based, is updated.","A social network  is then created using the data visualization cards. The social network  includes a business intelligence system including or having access to a database , a plurality of data visualization cards , , , and , and a plurality of users , , , and . The data visualization card  is coupled to the business intelligence system and is sent business intelligence data from the business intelligence database  by the business intelligence system . The data visualization card  is coupled to the business intelligence system and is sent business intelligence data from the business intelligence database  by the business intelligence system . The data visualization card  is coupled to the business intelligence system and is sent business intelligence data from the business intelligence database  by the business intelligence system . The data visualization card  is coupled to the business intelligence system and is sent business intelligence data from the business intelligence database  by the business intelligence system ","The users  include user accounts that are associated with the data visualization card , while a user of the users  includes a user account that is also associated with the data visualization card  and a user of the users  includes a user account that is also associated with the data visualization card . The users  include user accounts that are associated with the data visualization card , while a user of the users  includes a user account that is also associated with the data visualization card . The users  include user accounts that are associated with the data visualization card , while a user of the users  includes a user account that is also associated with the data visualization card . The users  include user accounts that are associated with the data visualization card .","As discussed above, each of the users , , , and  is provided business intelligence information through the data visualization card that are associated with their user accounts. As also discussed above, the data visualization cards include business intelligence data parameters that define what business intelligence data from the database is used to provide the data visualization card. The social network  is created by linking the users based on those users having user accounts that are associated with common data visualization cards, data visualization cards that include common business intelligence data parameters, and\/or the users being provided common business intelligence data (i.e., through the data visualization cards.) For example, the users  may be linked together in the social network  through the association of their user accounts with the data visualization card , the users  and user may be linked together in the social network  through the association of their user accounts with the data visualization card , the users  and user may be linked together in the social network  through the association of their user accounts with the data visualization card , and the users , the user , and the user may be linked together in the social network  through the association of their user accounts with the data visualization card .","Referring now to , , and , the method  then proceeds to block  where user information inputs are associated with data visualization cards. In an embodiment, a user may provide a user information input for any data visualization card. In an embodiment users may provide user information inputs for data visualization cards, and those user information inputs may be associated with the user account of that user (e.g., due to the user creating that data visualization card, due to the user collecting that data visualization card, etc.). For example, in response to the selection of a data visualization card that is associated with the user account of a user, that user may be provided a user account screen , illustrated in , that allows the user to view or provide user information inputs associated with the selected data visualization card. The user account screen  includes a selected data visualization card , a latest card information section , a card feed section , a card Question & Answer section , and a Top Topics section .","The selected data visualization card  includes a collections meter that may indicate the number of user accounts the data visualization card  is associated with, a view meter that may indicate the number of times the data visualization card  has been viewed, a rating meter that may indicate the collective rating of the usefulness of the data visualization card  by the users, a comments section that may include a plurality of comments on the data visualization card  by the users, and an annotation that may include a selection of one or more data points on the data visualization card and a comment associated with that data point. User information inputs that may be provided by users include the users collecting the data visualization card  such that the collections meter is modified, the users viewing the data visualization card  such that the view meter is modified, the users rating the data visualization card  such that the rating meter is modified, the users adding a comment to the comment section , the users adding an annotation (e.g., the annotation ) to the data visualization card , and\/or a variety of other user information inputs know in the art. Any user information inputs provided for a data visualization card may be associated with that data visualization card and\/or the user account of the user that provided that user information input. Furthermore, user information inputs associated with data visualization cards will then be distributed to any users who have user accounts associated with those data visualization cards (e.g., by including the user information inputs in the data visualization card provided to the user accounts.)","In an embodiment, the user information inputs for a given data visualization card may be provided in a variety of ways to users who have user accounts associated with that data visualization card. For example, the latest card information section  may be provided by retrieving any current user information inputs (e.g., user information inputs associated with the data visualization card within a threshold time) and categorizing those current user information inputs. In the illustrated embodiment, the latest card information section  includes an indication that there are 10 new data visualization cards being suggested to the user (discussed in further detail below), 5 new links (e.g., users may provide user information inputs that include links to information about the business intelligence data being displayed in the data visualization card) associated with the users collected data visualization cards, and 6 new comments associated with the users collected data visualization cards. In another example, the card feed section  may be provided by retrieving user information inputs for the users collected data visualization cards. In the illustrated embodiment, the card feed section  includes a list of comments posted by other users on the users collected data visualization cards. In another example, the card Question & Answer section  may be provided by retrieving user information inputs for the users collected data visualization cards. In the illustrated embodiment, the card Question & Answer section  includes questions posted by other users on the users collected data visualization cards. In an embodiment, the Top Topics section  may provide topics selected in response to the business intelligence system determining that they include information in common with the users collected data visualization cards.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":["b ","b ","a ","a","a "],"b":["416","428","420","430","428","422","432","430","424","434","432","428","426"]},"Furthermore the business intelligence system may use the social network to discover user information inputs created by users such as, for example, user commentaries, documents uploaded to the business intelligence system by the users, links to wiki web pages, forum discussions, blogs, etc. The business intelligence system may then provide the discovered user information inputs to other users based on the links in the social network. Through collective action by the users with the data visualization cards (e.g., providing user information inputs), a value is created and defined for the business intelligence information available to the business intelligence system. The continued creation, collection, and input to data visualization cards increases the value of those cards in the business intelligence system.","Referring now to , , and , the method  proceeds to block  where data visualization cards are suggested to users based on social network links. In one embodiment, the business intelligence system provides or suggests a first data visualization card (created or collected by a one or more first users having first user accounts) to a second user account of a second user due to the association of the second user account with at least one of the first user accounts based on the association of the at least one of the first user accounts and the second user account with data visualization cards that include common business intelligence data parameters or that use common business intelligence data. illustrates a user  that has a user account associated with data visualization cards  and .

In other words, because a common data visualization card (the data visualization card ) was associated with both the users accounts of users , , , and  and the user , the data visualization card  is provided or suggested to the user  due to the user account of the user being associated with the user accounts of the users , , , and  through the data visualization cards.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 6","i":["b ","a","b","c","a","b","c ","a","b","c "],"b":["604","308","206","302","304","202","604","606","606","606","606","606","606","606","606","606","606","308","606","608"]},"In an embodiment, users may share data visualization cards with other users. For example, a first user may choose to share a data visualization card with a second user, and that data visualization card may then be provided to the second users in the data visualization card suggestions  of the user account of the second user. The second user may then collect that shared data visualization card.","Thus, a system and method have been described that distributes business intelligence information to a plurality of users through the use of data visualization cards that may be created and collected by users. A social network is created based on the business intelligence information created and collected by the users, and used to suggest other business intelligence information that may be of interest to the users. Users may provide user information inputs to the data visualization cards and have those user information inputs distributed to the users that are collecting those data visualization cards in order to supplement the business intelligence information that is provided using business intelligence data generated during business operation with business intelligence information provided by the users themselves.","Referring now to , an embodiment of a networked system  used in the system described above is illustrated. The networked system  includes a plurality of user devices , a business intelligence system , and a business intelligence database  in communication over a network .
