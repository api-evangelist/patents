All these species can infest humans.","The biological cycle of the parasite is autoheteroxenous: it takes place entirely in the same host, which is successively the definitive host (carrying adult parasites) and the intermediate host (carrying infesting larvae) (BOIREAU et al., 2002). The passing of the infesting larvae from host to another is necessary in order for a new cycle to be carried out. This passage occurs through the ingestion of raw or barely cooked meat contaminated with the larvae. During digestion, the latter are released, and penetrate the intestinal epithelium, where they will mature into sexual adult (Ad) worms. The fertilized females subsequently expel newborn L1 larvae (L1NN) which reach the striated muscles via the lymphatic circulation and the blood stream. These L1NN larvae penetrate the muscle cells (infesting development stage L1M: L1 muscle larva), of which they bring about the dedifferentiation into feeder cells surrounded by a protective collagen capsule which is thick in the case of encapsulated trichinae, very thin in the case of \u201cnonencapsulated\u201d trichinae.","Although trichinellosis is asymptomatic in animals, human infestation is reflected, during the initial intestinal phase, by diarrhea associated with nausea, vomiting and violent abdominal pain, while the symptoms associated with the muscle invasion phase are characterized by the combination of fever, facial edema and myalgia (CAPO & DESPOMMIER, 1996). Ocular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiac and neurological attacks can also add to this clinical picture of trichinellosis, the progression of which can be lethal. The chronic nature of the infestation, marked by persistent muscle pain in patients, is associated with the survival of the parasite in the feeder cell.","The specific treatment of human trichinellosis with anthelminthics is all the more effective if the diagnosis of the infestation is made early so as to allow action against all the parasitic stages and especially before the formation of the protective collagen capsule around the L1M larvae (FOURESTIE et al., 1988).","The epidemiological data have demonstrated a geographical distribution of the parasite in all parts of the world, associated with a method of transmission involving many species of the wild-type fauna which also maintain a domestic infestation cycle mainly represented by the pigs (DUPOUY-CAMET, 2000).","Epidemics of human trichinellosis, an emerging or reemerging zoonosis, constitute a real public health problem throughout the world owing to dietary habits and hygiene controls that are not always effective (MURRELL & POZIO, 2000). These epidemics essentially involve pig and wild boar meat and also horse meat (BOIREAU et al., 2000).","The prevention of human contamination therefore involves cooking meat right through and improving rearing conditions and\/or conditions for controlling animal trichinellosis (pigs, horses, wild boar and other wild animal species sensitive to ) (BOIREAU et al., 2002).","The screening techniques for trichinellosis can be divided into two categories: 1) direct detection of the L1M larvae, by trichinoscopy (microscopic observation of a meat fragment), or after artificial digestion of muscle samples, and 2) indirect detection by various immunological methods, for detecting antibodies directed against the antigens.","Each of the developmental stages of the parasite: adult (Ad), newborn larva (L1NN) and muscle larva (L1M) has a corresponding specific antigen profile.","It is antigen preparations derived from L1M-stage larvae which are currently used for immunodiagnosis. This is because the antigen fractions of the two early stages Ad and L1NN are difficult to purify, and it had not been possible to identify immunodominant antigens associated with one and\/or the other of these two stages up until now.","Either preparations of total soluble antigen, obtained by lysis of the larvae, centrifugation of the lysate and recovery of the supernatant, or, more commonly, excretion\/secretion antigens (E\/S antigens) are principally used.","The excretion-secretion antigens are produced when L1M larvae are placed under survival conditions in a culture medium; they originate from a particular organ, called the stichosome, which comprises about fifty discoid cells, the stichocytes. The stichocytes contain granules, the content of which is evacuated by a canaliculus into the lumen of the parasite's esophagus. This content, which is very highly antigenic, constitutes a part of the excretion-secretion antigens. These antigens form a complex mixture of proteins, containing in particular a group of glycoproteins (called TSL1 antigens) bearing a specific carbohydrate molecule, known only in and present in all the species of this parasite, beta-tyvelose.","The preparations of excretion-secretion antigens which are currently used as a reference in terms of immunodiagnosis of trichinellosis are obtained from culture medium of L1M larvae. After culture for 18 to 20 hours, the medium is recovered by filtration and then concentrated (GAMBLE et al., 1983; GAMBLE et al., 1988).","The principal drawback of the preparations of total soluble antigen is their lack of specificity. Antigen cross reactions with other parasitoses are commonly observed. The excretion-secretion antigens make it possible to obtain a better specificity. However, in both cases, it is difficult to produce standardized batches of antigen in large amounts.","The saccharide structure containing beta-tyvelose, which represents an immunodominant epitope of E\/S antigen preparations (REASON et al., 1994; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,541,075 and 5,707,817), has been synthesized chemically, and its use for the immunodiagnosis of has been proposed.","This reagent has good specificity, but its sensitivity appears to be lower than that of E\/S antigen preparations. In addition, the chemical synthesis of this structure remains expensive and laborious to carry out.","Another problem encountered in the context of the serological diagnosis of is the existence of a \u201cblind window\u201d of detection corresponding to the early stages of infestation, which is reflected by false-negative results. In addition, in horses, gradual disappearance of the antibodies has been observed 25 weeks after infestation.","The inventors have undertaken to identify immunodominant antigens associated with the early stages of infestation and which can be used for the serological diagnosis of trichinellosis, in order to provide means for obtaining early, specific and sensitive detection of infestations, both in humans and in animals. With this aim, they have investigated whether there existed, among the products of the genes expressed by at the L1NN stage and\/or at the Ad stage, proteins which would possess the desired antigenic properties.","In this context, they have discovered that a protein which is part of the proteins expressed specifically at the L1NN stage in this organism, constitutes an immunodominant antigen, allowing early detection of the humoral response directed against , and that it is also conserved between various species of ","This protein will hereinafter be referred to as NBL1. The complete cDNA sequence encoding this protein and also the polypeptide sequence which is deduced therefrom are respectively accessible on Genbank under numbers AF331160 and AAK16520 (also known as Swissprot Q9BJL7); these sequences are annotated as \u201cserine protease SS2, specific for newborn larvae\u201d. These sequences are also respectively reproduced in the attached sequence listing under numbers SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2. A partial cDNA sequence encoding this protein and also the polypeptide sequence which is deduced therefrom are respectively accessible on Genbank under numbers AY491941 and AAR36900 (also known as Swissprot Q6RUJ3).","The inventors have also shown that the immunoreactivity associated with the humoral response directed against NBL1 is located in the C-terminal part of this protein, and have identified an immunodominant epitope responsible for this reactivity.","Furthermore, the inventors have identified, using a cDNA library of mixed early Ad+L1NN stages of , a new gene, hereinafter referred to as 411.","The sequence of this gene is represented in the attached sequence listing under the number SEQ ID NO: 3, and that of its translation product under the number SEQ ID NO: 4. This product of translation of this gene is related (78.7% identity) to an E\/S antigen, known as Tp21-3 protein, identified in (AAF79206; NAGANO et al., 2001), and also to the product of translation of the hypothetical ORF 17.20 of (AAB48489), with which it exhibits 86.6% identity.","The 411 gene translation product also makes it possible to detect, at an early stage, the humoral response directed against various species of ","In addition, each of the NBL1 and 411 antigens has made it possible, in the assays carried out, to detect animals infested with which were not detected with the other antigen, nor with the E\/S antigen, at least during the period D15-D30 post-infestation (pi).","The combination of the NBL1 antigen (or of an immunodominant epitope thereof) with the 411 antigen therefore makes it possible to improve the sensitivity of the diagnosis, in particular at the early stages of infestation (15 to 20 days after infestation).","Consequently, a subject of the present invention is the use of an antigenic polypeptide recognized by anti-antibodies as a reagent for detecting anti-antibodies in a biological sample, characterized in that said polypeptide is chosen from:","a) a polypeptide comprising an immunodominant epitope of the NBL1 antigen, which epitope is defined by the sequence PSSGSRPTYP (SEQ ID NO: 5);","b) a polypeptide, also referred to hereinafter as 411 antigen, comprising amino acids 25-175 of the sequence SEQ ID NO: 4 (which represent the mature form of the 411 protein), or comprising a sequence having at least 80%, and by order of increasing preference, at least 85%, 90% or 95% identity with the sequence of amino acids 25-175 of the sequence SEQ ID NO: 4.","A subject of the present invention is more particularlv a method for detecting the presence of anti-antibodies in a biological sample, which method is characterized in that it comprises:\n\n","Generally, said biological sample is a serum sample.

The detection of conformational epitopes using this ELISA assay combined with the detection of linear epitopes with Western blotting demonstrate, moreover, the immunodominant nature of the 411 protein.","The recombinant THX-411 protein allows a particularly early detection of antibodies directed against (from the 20th day pi onward for the animals highly infested with 20 000 L1M). The seroconversion is accompanied by a profile of humoral responses having high titers and maintained for up to 60 days pi. The seroconversion of the animals infested with a moderate and low load of the parasite was detected later, at the 30th day pi and 60th day pi, respectively. The earliest seroconversion detected by the E\/S Ag ELISA is at the 25th day pi.","Two out of five of the -infested animals which were diagnosed with both the E\/S Ag ELISA and the THX-411 ELISA saw their window of serological detection get smaller with the THX-411 ELISA, with a gain of 5 to 10 days in terms of earliness. The sensitivity of the THX-411 ELISA was demonstrated with the effective screening of 5\/9 conventional pigs during this animal experiment, i.e. 3\/3 pigs infested with 20 000 L1M, 1\/3 pigs infested with 1000 L1M and 1\/3 pigs infested with only 200 L1M of . The detections were associated with the muscle parasite load in these animals, which varied on average from 3 larvae per gram (LpG) for the pigs experimentally infested with 200 L1M, to 43 LpG for the pigs infested with 1000 L1M, and 538 LpG for the pigs infested with 20 000 L1M.","The humoral responses induced by and were themselves also detected with the THX-411 ELISA (10\/12 animals infested with 20 000 L1M), demonstrating the genetic and antigenic conservation of 411 in the genus and, consequently, its absolute advantage for the broad-spectrum diagnosis of trichinelloses. The earliness of the diagnosis was confirmed from the 20th day pi onward. The seroconversion window was reduced by 5 to 20 days with the 411 ELISA, and, like the infestation with the 50% to 100% of the animals which were diagnosed with both the E\/S Ag ELISA and the THX-411 ELISA saw their serological detection window get smaller with the THX-411 ELISA. The analysis of the infestation with the species demonstrated an increased sensitivity of the THX-411 ELISA, which diagnosed 6\/9 animals (against 5\/9 animals with the E\/S Ag ELISA), although the muscle parasite load was on average only 7\u00d710, at 0.1 LpG only. Furthermore, similar humoral response profiles were obtained for the animals infested with and , although the intensity of the infestation generated by the latter species was significantly lower, suggesting that the 511 protein of is very highly immunogenic in nature and could be used for the detection of this species resistant to freezing.","The specificity of the THX-411 ELISA was evaluated using sera taken from 150 animals before experimental infestation and up to 10 days pi. This specificity is greater than 99% (results not shown).","The NBL1 and 411 antigens constitute immunodominant antigens which are conserved within the genus. The ELISA assays using these antigens (NBL1 C-terminal part; N5EM11 peptide epitope of NBL1; 411 antigen) have a greater than 99% specificity with respect to , and allow the early diagnosis (15-60 days after infestation) of porcine trichinelloses produced by the four species of identified in Europe.","The ELISA assay using the purified recombinant THX-NBL1 (Cterm) protein, containing the immunodominant epitope of NBL1 located in the C-terminal part of the protein, is -specific, and sensitive, and allows the diagnosis of porcine trichinelloses from 5 to 45 days earlier than with the E\/S Ag ELISA. Furthermore, this assay made it possible to obtain a reduced serological detection window compared with the E\/S Ag ELISA in 100% of the animals which were diagnosed both with the E\/S Ag ELISA and with the THX-NBL1 (Cterm),","The ELISA assay using the purified recombinant THX-411 protein reproduces the kinetics of the humoral responses detected with the E\/S Ag ELISA, with a sensitivity that is currently slightly lower (17\/36 animals diagnosed). However, the sensitivity of this new ELISA made it possible to diagnose one pig not diagnosed by screening with the E\/S Ag ELISA. The THX-411 ELISA can make it possible to diagnose porcine trichinelloses from 5 to 20 days earlier than with the E\/S Ag ELISA. Furthermore, 50% to 100% of the animals which were diagnosed both with the E\/S Ag ELISA and the THX-411 ELISA saw their serological detection window get smaller with the THX-411 ELISA.","All these results show that the NBL1 and 411 antigens can be used, as an alternative to the E\/S antigen, or as a supplement thereto, for the early serological diagnosis of trichinelloses. In addition, the combination of these two new antigens makes it possible to enhance the sensitivity of the ELISA, by virtue of the diagnosis of an additional animal.","The combination of NBL1 (Cterm) with immunodominant peptide of N5EM11 type, and 411 makes it possible to enhance the sensitivity of diagnosis (24\/36 animals detected).","The additive effect of NBL1 with 411 is reflected by the gain in detection of one animal, induced with 411, and also by the earlier detection of one animal, induced with 411. The triple combination (NBL1, 411, N5EM11) stabilizes the ELISA assay over time through the simultaneous codetection of antibodies by 2 or 3 antigens, without, however, any additional gain in terms of number of animals.","On the other hand, the early diagnosis, <30 days pi, was obtained by virtue of the two antigens NBL1 and 411.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["MURRELL et al., The systematics of the genus with a key to species, Vet Parasitol, 93, 293-307, (2000).","GASSER et al., Nonisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of sequence variability in ribosomal DNA expansion segments within the genus (Nematoda: Adenophorea), Electrophoresis, 25, 3357-3364, (2004).","BOIREAU et al., Risques parasitaires li\u00e9s aux aliments d'origine animale [Parasitic risks linked to feeds of animal origin], French laboratory review, 71-89, (2002).","CAPO & DESPOMMIER, Clinical aspects of infection with spp, Clin Microbiol Rev, 9, 47-54, (1996).
