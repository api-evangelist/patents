techniques.","Many different types of printing have been invented, a large number of which are presently in use. The known forms of print have a variety of methods for marking the print media with a relevant marking media. Commonly used forms of printing include offset printing, laser printing and copying devices, dot matrix type impact printers, thermal paper printers, film recorders, thermal wax printers, dye sublimation printers and ink jet printers both of the drop on demand and continuous flow type. Each type of printer has its own advantages and problems when considering cost, speed, quality, reliability, simplicity of construction and operation etc.","In recent years, the field of ink jet printing, wherein each individual pixel of ink is derived from one or more ink nozzles has become increasingly popular primarily due to its inexpensive and versatile nature.","Many different techniques on ink jet printing have been invented. For a survey of the field, reference is made to an article by J Moore, \u201cNon-Impact Printing: Introduction and Historical Perspective\u201d, Output Hard Copy Devices, Editors R Dubeck and S Sherr, pages 207-220 (1988).","Ink Jet printers themselves come in many different types. The utilization of a continuous stream of ink in ink jet printing appears to date back to at least 1929 wherein U.S. Pat. No. 1,941,001 by Hansell discloses a simple form of continuous stream electrostatic ink jet printing.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,596,275 by Sweet also discloses a process of a continuous ink jet printing including the step wherein the inkjet stream is modulated by a high frequency electro-static field so as to cause drop separation. This technique is still utilized by several manufacturers including Elmjet and Scitex (see also U.S. Pat. No. 3,373,437 by Sweet et al).","Piezoelectric inkjet printers are also one form of commonly utilized inkjet printing device. Piezoelectric systems are disclosed by Kyser et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,946,398 (1970) which utilizes a diaphragm mode of operation, by Zolten in U.S. Pat. No. 3,683,212 (1970) which discloses a squeeze mode of operation of a piezoelectric crystal, Stemme in U.S. Pat. No. 3,747,120 (1972) discloses a bend mode of piezoelectric operation, Howkins in U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,601 discloses a piezoelectric push mode actuation of the ink jet stream and Fischbeck in U.S. Pat. No. 4,584,590 which discloses a shear mode type of piezoelectric transducer element.","Recently, thermal inkjet printing has become an extremely popular form of inkjet printing. The inkjet printing techniques include those disclosed by Endo et al in GB 2007162 (1979) and Vaught et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4,490,728. Both the aforementioned references disclosed ink jet printing techniques that rely upon the activation of an electrothermal actuator which results in the creation of a bubble in a constricted space, such as a nozzle, which thereby causes the ejection of ink from an aperture connected to the confined space onto a relevant print media. Printing devices utilizing the electro-thermal actuator are manufactured by manufacturers such as Canon and Hewlett Packard.","As can be seen from the foregoing, many different types of printing technologies are available. Ideally, a printing technology should have a number of desirable attributes. These include inexpensive construction and operation, high speed operation, safe and continuous long term operation etc. Each technology may have its own advantages and disadvantages in the areas of cost, speed, quality, reliability, power usage, simplicity of construction operation, durability and consumables.","In the construction of any inkjet printing system, there are a considerable number of important factors which must be traded off against one another especially as large scale printheads are constructed, especially those of a pagewidth type. A number of these factors are outlined in the following paragraphs.","Firstly, inkjet printheads are normally constructed utilizing micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) techniques. As such, they tend to rely upon standard integrated circuit construction\/fabrication techniques of depositing planar layers on a silicon wafer and etching certain portions of the planar layers. Within silicon circuit fabrication technology, certain techniques are better known than others. For example, the techniques associated with the creation of CMOS circuits are likely to be more readily used than those associated with the creation of exotic circuits including ferroelectrics, galium arsenide etc. Hence, it is desirable, in any MEMS constructions, to utilize well proven semi-conductor fabrication techniques which do not require any \u201cexotic\u201d processes or materials. Of course, a certain degree of trade off will be undertaken in that if the advantages of using the exotic material far out weighs its disadvantages then it may become desirable to utilize the material anyway. However, if it is possible to achieve the same, or similar, properties using more common materials, the problems of exotic materials can be avoided.","With a large array of ink ejection nozzles, it is desirable to provide for a highly automated form of manufacturing which results in an inexpensive production of multiple printhead devices.","Preferably, the device constructed utilizes a low amount of energy in the ejection of ink. The utilization of a low amount of energy is particularly important when a large pagewidth full color printhead is constructed having a large array of individual print ejection mechanism with each ejection mechanisms, in the worst case, being fired in a rapid sequence.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an ink ejection nozzle arrangement suitable for incorporation into an inkjet printhead arrangement for the ejection of ink on demand from a nozzle chamber in an efficient and reliable manner.","According to a first aspect, the present invention provides an ink jet printhead comprising:","a plurality of nozzles;","a bubble forming chamber corresponding to each of the nozzles respectively, the bubble forming chambers adapted to contain a bubble forming liquid; and,","at least one heater element disposed in each of the bubble forming chambers respectively, the heater elements configured for thermal contact with the bubble forming liquid; such that,","heating the heater element to a temperature above the boiling point of the bubble forming liquid forms a gas bubble that causes the ejection of a drop of an ejectable liquid through the nozzle corresponding to that heater element; wherein,","the bubble forming chamber is at least partially formed by an amorphous ceramic material.","Amorphous ceramic material provides the bubble forming chamber with high strength. The non-crystalline structure avoids any points of weakness due to crystalline defects. These defects can act as stress concentration areas and are prone to failure.","According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a printer system which incorporates a printhead, the printhead comprising:","a plurality of nozzles;","a bubble forming chamber corresponding to each of the nozzles respectively, the bubble forming chambers adapted to contain a bubble forming liquid; and,","at least one heater element disposed in each of the bubble forming chambers respectively, the heater elements configured for thermal contact with the bubble forming liquid; such that,","heating the heater element to a temperature above the boiling point of the bubble forming liquid forms a gas bubble that causes the ejection of a drop of an ejectable liquid through the nozzle corresponding to that heater element; wherein,","the bubble forming chamber is at least partially formed by an amorphous ceramic material.","According to a third aspect, the present invention provides a method of ejecting drops of an ejectable liquid from a printhead, the printhead comprising a plurality of nozzles;","a chamber corresponding to each of the nozzles respectively, the chambers adapted to contain an ejectable liquid; and,","at least one droplet ejection actuator associated with each of the chambers respectively, wherein,","the chamber is at least partially formed by an amorphous ceramic material;","the method comprising the steps of:","placing the ejectable liquid into contact with the drop ejection actuator; and actuating the droplet ejection actuator such that a droplet of an ejectable liquid is ejected through the corresponding nozzle.","Preferably, the amorphous ceramic material is silicon nitride. In another form, the amorphous ceramic material is silicon dioxide. In yet another embodiment, the amorphous ceramic material is silicon oxynitride.","Preferably, the thermal actuator units are interconnected at a first end to a substrate and at a second end to a rigid strut member. The rigid strut member can, in turn, be interconnected to the arm having one end attached to the paddle vane. The thermal actuator units can operate upon conductive heating along a conductive trace and the conductive heating can include the generation of a substantial portion of the heat in the area adjacent the first end. The conductive heating trace can include a thinned cross-section adjacent the first end. The heating layers of the thermal actuator units can comprise substantially either a copper nickel alloy or titanium nitride. The paddle can be constructed from a similar conductive material to portions of the thermal actuator units however it is conductively insulated therefrom.","Preferably, the thermal actuator units are constructed from multiple layers utilizing a single mask to etch the multiple layers.","The nozzle chamber can include an actuator access port in a second surface of the chamber. The access port can comprise a slot in a corner of the chamber and the actuator is able to move in an arc through the slot. The actuator can include an end portion that mates substantially with a wall of the chamber at substantially right angles to the paddle vane. The paddle vane can include a depressed portion substantially opposite the fluid ejection port.","In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a thermal actuator including a series of lever arms attached at one end to a substrate, the thermal actuator being operational as a result of conductive heating of a conductive trace, the conductive trace including a thinned cross-section substantially adjacent the attachment to the substrate.","Bubble Forming Heater Element Actuator","With reference to , the unit cell  of a printhead according to an embodiment of the invention comprises a nozzle plate  with nozzles  therein, the nozzles having nozzle rims , and apertures  extending through the nozzle plate. The nozzle plate  is plasma etched from a silicon nitride structure which is deposited, by way of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), over a sacrificial material which is subsequently etched.","The printhead also includes, with respect to each nozzle , side walls  on which the nozzle plate is supported, a chamber  defined by the walls and the nozzle plate , a multi-layer substrate  and an inlet passage  extending through the multi-layer substrate to the far side (not shown) of the substrate. A looped, elongate heater element  is suspended within the chamber , so that the element is in the form of a suspended beam. The printhead as shown is a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) structure, which is formed by a lithographic process which is described in more detail below.","When the printhead is in use, ink  from a reservoir (not shown) enters the chamber  via the inlet passage , so that the chamber fills to the level as shown in . Thereafter, the heater element  is heated for somewhat less than 1 microsecond, so that the heating is in the form of a thermal pulse. It will be appreciated that the heater element  is in thermal contact with the ink  in the chamber  so that when the element is heated, this causes the generation of vapor bubbles  in the ink. Accordingly, the ink  constitutes a bubble forming liquid.  shows the formation of a bubble  approximately 1 microsecond after generation of the thermal pulse, that is, when the bubble has just nucleated on the heater elements . It will be appreciated that, as the heat is applied in the form of a pulse, all the energy necessary to generate the bubble  is to be supplied within that short time.","When the element  is heated as described above, the bubble  forms along the length of the element, this bubble appearing, in the cross-sectional view of , as four bubble portions, one for each of the element portions shown in cross section.","The bubble , once generated, causes an increase in pressure within the chamber , which in turn causes the ejection of a drop  of the ink  through the nozzle . The rim  assists in directing the drop  as it is ejected, so as to minimize the chance of drop misdirection.","The reason that there is only one nozzle  and chamber  per inlet passage  is so that the pressure wave generated within the chamber, on heating of the element  and forming of a bubble , does not affect adjacent chambers and their corresponding nozzles. The pressure wave generated within the chamber creates significant stresses in the chamber wall. Forming the chamber from an amorphous ceramic such as silicon nitride, silicon dioxide (glass) or silicon oxynitride, gives the chamber walls high strength while avoiding the use of material with a crystal structure. Crystalline defects can act as stress concentration points and therefore potential areas of weakness and ultimately failure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["1","12","11","3","12","11","12"]},"The increase in pressure within the chamber  not only pushes ink  out through the nozzle , but also pushes some ink back through the inlet passage . However, the inlet passage  is approximately 200 to 300 microns in length, and is only approximately 16 microns in diameter. Hence there is a substantial viscous drag. As a result, the predominant effect of the pressure rise in the chamber  is to force ink out through the nozzle  as an ejected drop , rather than back through the inlet passage .","Turning now to , the printhead is shown at a still further successive stage of operation, in which the ink drop  that is being ejected is shown during its \u201cnecking phase\u201d before the drop breaks off. At this stage, the bubble  has already reached its maximum size and has then begun to collapse towards the point of collapse , as reflected in more detail in .","The collapsing of the bubble  towards the point of collapse  causes some ink  to be drawn from within the nozzle  (from the sides  of the drop), and some to be drawn from the inlet passage , towards the point of collapse. Most of the ink  drawn in this manner is drawn from the nozzle , forming an annular neck  at the base of the drop  prior to its breaking off.","The drop  requires a certain amount of momentum to overcome surface tension forces, in order to break off. As ink  is drawn from the nozzle  by the collapse of the bubble , the diameter of the neck  reduces thereby reducing the amount of total surface tension holding the drop, so that the momentum of the drop as it is ejected out of the nozzle is sufficient to allow the drop to break off.","When the drop  breaks off, cavitation forces are caused as reflected by the arrows , as the bubble  collapses to the point of collapse . It will be noted that there are no-solid surfaces in the vicinity of the point of collapse  on which the cavitation can have an effect.","Features and Advantages of Further Embodiments",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 to 29","FIGS. 6 to 29"],"b":"1"},"Referring to , the unit cell  shown has the chamber , ink supply passage  and the nozzle rim  positioned mid way along the length of the unit cell . As best seen in , the drive circuitry  is partially on one side of the chamber  with the remainder on the opposing side of the chamber. The drive circuitry  controls the operation of the heater  through vias in the integrated circuit metallisation layers of the interconnect . The interconnect  has a raised metal layer on its top surface. Passivation layer  is formed in top of the interconnect  but leaves areas of the raised metal layer exposed. Electrodes  of the heater  contact the exposed metal areas to supply power to the element .","Alternatively, the drive circuitry  for one unit cell is not on opposing sides of the heater element that it controls. All the drive circuitry  for the heater  of one unit cell is in a single, undivided area that is offset from the heater. That is, the drive circuitry  is partially overlaid by one of the electrodes  of the heater  that it is controlling, and partially overlaid by one or more of the heater electrodes  from adjacent unit cells. In this situation, the center of the drive circuitry  is less than 200 microns from the center of the associate nozzle aperture . In most Memjet printheads of this type, the offset is less than 100 microns and in many cases less than 50 microns, preferably less than 30 microns.","Configuring the nozzle components so that there is significant overlap between the electrodes and the drive circuitry provides a compact design with high nozzle density (nozzles per unit area of the nozzle plate ). This also improves the efficiency of the printhead by shortening the length of the conductors from the circuitry to the electrodes. The shorter conductors have less resistance and therefore dissipate less energy.","The high degree of overlap between the electrodes  and the drive circuitry  also allows more vias between the heater material and the CMOS metalization layers of the interconnect . As best shown in , the passivation layer  has an array of vias to establish an electrical connection with the heater . More vias lowers the resistance between the heater electrodes  and the interconnect layer  which reduces power losses. However, the passivation layer  and electrodes  may also be provided without vias in order to simplify the fabrication process.","In , the unit cell  is the same as that of  apart from the heater element . The heater element  has a bubble nucleation section  with a smaller cross section than the remainder of the element. The bubble nucleation section  has a greater resistance and heats to a temperature above the boiling point of the ink before the remainder of the element . The gas bubble nucleates at this region and subsequently grows to surround the rest of the element . By controlling the bubble nucleation and growth, the trajectory of the ejected drop is more predictable.","The heater element  is configured to accommodate thermal expansion in a specific manner. As heater elements expand, they will deform to relieve the strain. Elements such as that shown in  will bow out of the plane of lamination because its thickness is the thinnest cross sectional dimension and therefore has the least bending resistance. Repeated bending of the element can lead to the formation of cracks, especially at sharp corners, which can ultimately lead to failure. The heater element  shown in  is configured so that the thermal expansion is relieved by rotation of the bubble nucleation section , and slightly splaying the sections leading to the electrodes , in preference to bowing out of the plane of lamination. The geometry of the element is such that miniscule bending within the plane of lamination is sufficient to relieve the strain of thermal expansion, and such bending occurs in preference to bowing. This gives the heater element greater longevity and reliability by minimizing bend regions, which are prone to oxidation and cracking.","Referring to , the heater element  used in this unit cell  has a serpentine or \u2018double omega\u2019 shape. This configuration keeps the gas bubble centered on the axis of the nozzle. A single omega is a simple geometric shape which is beneficial from a fabrication perspective. However the gap  between the ends of the heater element means that the heating of the ink in the chamber is slightly asymmetrical. As a result, the gas bubble is slightly skewed to the side opposite the gap . This can in turn affect the trajectory of the ejected drop. The double omega shape provides the heater element with the gap  to compensate for the gap  so that the symmetry and position of the bubble within the chamber is better controlled and the ejected drop trajectory is more reliable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"10"},"The omega shape directs current flow around the axis of the nozzle aperture . This gives good bubble alignment with the aperture for better ejection of drops while ensuring that the bubble collapse point is not on the heater element . As discussed above, this avoids problems caused by cavitation.","Referring to , another embodiment of the unit cell  is shown together with several stages of the etching and deposition fabrication process. In this embodiment, the heater element  is suspended from opposing sides of the chamber. This allows it to be symmetrical about two planes that intersect along the axis of the nozzle aperture . This configuration provides a drop trajectory along the axis of the nozzle aperture  while avoiding the cavitation problems discussed above.  show other variations of this type of heater element .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["1","5","10","7","7","14","15","15","7","10","31","31","32","5","10"]},"The unit cell  shown in  also has a relatively large chamber  which again reduces the surface area of the electrodes in contact with the vias leading to the interconnect layer . However, the larger chamber  allows several heater elements  offset from the nozzle aperture . The arrangement shown uses two heater elements ; one on either side of the chamber . Other designs use three or more elements in the chamber. Gas bubbles nucleate from opposing sides of the nozzle aperture and converge to form a single bubble. The bubble formed is symmetrical about at least one plane extending along the nozzle axis. This enhances the control of the symmetry and position of the bubble within the chamber  and therefore the ejected drop trajectory is more reliable.","Fabrication Process","In the interests of brevity, the fabrication stages have been shown for the unit cell of  only (see ). It will be appreciated that the other unit cells will use the same fabrication stages with different masking.","Referring to , there is shown the starting point for fabrication of the thermal inkjet nozzle shown in . CMOS processing of a silicon wafer provides a silicon substrate  having drive circuitry , and an interlayer dielectric (\u201cinterconnect\u201d) . The interconnect  comprises four metal layers, which together form a seal ring for the inlet passage  to be etched through the interconnect. The top metal layer , which forms an upper portion of the seal ring, can be seen in . The metal seal ring prevents ink moisture from seeping into the interconnect  when the inlet passage  is filled with ink.","A passivation layer  is deposited onto the top metal layer  by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). After deposition of the passivation layer , it is etched to define a circular recess, which forms parts of the inlet passage . At the same as etching the recess, a plurality of vias  are also etched, which allow electrical connection through the passivation layer  to the top metal layer . The etch pattern is defined by a layer of patterned photoresist (not shown), which is removed by Oashing after the etch.","Referring to , in the next fabrication sequence, a layer of photoresist is spun onto the passivation later . The photoresist is exposed and developed to define a circular opening. With the patterned photoresist  in place, the dielectric interconnect  is etched as far as the silicon substrate  using a suitable oxide-etching gas chemistry (e.g. O\/CF). Etching through the silicon substrate is continued down to about 20 microns to define a front ink hole , using a suitable silicon-etching gas chemistry (e.g. \u2018Bosch etch\u2019). The same photoresist mask  can be used for both etching steps.  shows the unit cell after etching the front ink hole  and removal of the photoresist .","Referring to , in the next stage of fabrication, the front ink hole  is plugged with photoresist to provide a front plug . At the same time, a layer of photoresist is deposited over the passivation layer . This layer of photoresist is exposed and developed to define a first sacrificial scaffold  over the front plug , and scaffolding tracks  around the perimeter of the unit cell. The first sacrificial scaffold  is used for subsequent deposition of heater material  thereon and is therefore formed with a planar upper surface to avoid any buckling in the heater element (see heater element  in ). The first sacrificial scaffold  is UV cured and hardbaked to prevent reflow of the photoresist during subsequent high-temperature deposition onto its upper surface.","Importantly, the first sacrificial scaffold  has sloped side faces . These sloped side faces  are formed by adjusting the focusing in the exposure tool (e.g. stepper) when exposing the photoresist. The sloped side faces  advantageously allow heater material  to be deposited substantially evenly over the first sacrificial scaffold .","Referring to , the next stage of fabrication deposits the heater material  over the first sacrificial scaffold , the passivation layer  and the perimeter scaffolding tracks . The heater material  is typically comprised of TiAlN. The heater element  may be formed from a monolayer of the heater material . However, the heater element  may alternatively comprise the heater material sandwiched between upper and lower passivation films, such as tantalum, tantalum nitride or silicon nitride films. Passivation films covering the heater element  minimize corrosion and improve heater longevity.","Referring to , the heater material  is subsequently etched down to the first sacrificial scaffold  to define the heater element . At the same time, contact electrodes  are defined on either side of the heater element . The electrodes  are in contact with the top metal layer  and so provide electrical connection between the CMOS and the heater element . The sloped side faces of the first sacrificial scaffold  ensure good electrical connection between the heater element  and the electrodes , since the heater material is deposited with sufficient thickness around the scaffold . Any thin areas of heater material (due to insufficient side face deposition) would increase resistivity and affect heater performance.","Adjacent unit cells are electrically insulated from each other by virtue of grooves etched around the perimeter of each unit cell. The grooves are etched at the same time as defining the heater element .","Referring to , in the subsequent step a second sacrificial scaffold  of photoresist is deposited over the heater material. The second sacrificial scaffold  is exposed and developed to define sidewalls for the cylindrical nozzle chamber and perimeter sidewalls for each unit cell. The second sacrificial scaffold  is also UV cured and hardbaked to prevent any reflow of the photoresist during subsequent high-temperature deposition of the silicon nitride roof material.","Referring to , silicon nitride is deposited onto the second sacrificial scaffold  by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. The silicon nitride forms a roof  over each unit cell, which is the nozzle plate  for a row of nozzles. Chamber sidewalls  and unit cell sidewalls  are also formed by deposition of silicon nitride.","Referring to , the nozzle rim  is etched partially through the roof , by placing a suitably patterned photoresist mask over the roof, etching for a controlled period of time and removing the photoresist by ashing.","Referring to , the nozzle aperture  is etched through the roof  down to the second sacrificial scaffold . Again, the etch is performed by placing a suitably patterned photoresist mask over the roof, etching down to the scaffold  and removing the photoresist mask.","With the nozzle structure now fully formed on a frontside of the silicon substrate , an ink supply channel  is etched from the backside of the substrate , which meets with the front plug .","Referring to , after formation of the ink supply channel , the first and second sacrificial scaffolds of photoresist, together with the front plug  are ashed off using an Oplasma. Accordingly, fluid connection is made from the ink supply channel  through to the nozzle aperture .","It should be noted that a portion of photoresist, on either side of the nozzle chamber sidewalls , remains encapsulated by the roof , the unit cell sidewalls  and the chamber sidewalls . This portion of photoresist is sealed from the Oashing plasma and, therefore, remains intact after fabrication of the printhead. This encapsulated photoresist advantageously provides additional robustness for the printhead by supporting the nozzle plate . Hence, the printhead has a robust nozzle plate spanning continuously over rows of nozzles, and being supported by solid blocks of hardened photoresist, in addition to support walls.","The invention has been described above with reference to printheads using thermal bend actuators and bubble forming heater elements. However, it is potentially suited to a wide range of printing system including: color and monochrome office printers, short run digital printers, high speed digital printers, offset press supplemental printers, low cost scanning printers high speed pagewidth printers, notebook computers with inbuilt pagewidth printers, portable color and monochrome printers, color and monochrome copiers, color and monochrome facsimile machines, combined printer, facsimile and copying machines, label printers, large format plotters, photograph copiers, printers for digital photographic \u201cminilabs\u201d, video printers, PHOTO CD (PHOTO CD is a registered trade mark of the Eastman Kodak Company) printers, portable printers for PDAs, wallpaper printers, indoor sign printers, billboard printers, fabric printers, camera printers and fault tolerant commercial printer arrays.","It will be appreciated by ordinary workers in this field that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. In conventional thermal inkjet printheads, this leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per printhead, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth printheads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty-five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems.","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the printhead is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the printhead is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest printhead designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The printheads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the printhead by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The printhead is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Tables of Drop-on-Demand Ink Jets","Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.","The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of ink jet types.","Actuator mechanism (18 types)","Basic operation mode (7 types)","Auxiliary mechanism (8 types)","Actuator amplification or modification method (17 types)","Actuator motion (19 types)","Nozzle refill method (4 types)","Method of restricting back-flow through inlet (10 types)","Nozzle clearing method (9 types)","Nozzle plate construction (9 types)","Drop ejection direction (5 types)","Ink type (7 types)","The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 above which matches the docket numbers in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty-five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet printheads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.","Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases, print technology may be listed more than once in a table, where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.","Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include: Home printers, Office network printers, Short run digital printers, Commercial print systems, Fabric printers, Pocket printers, Internet WWW printers, Video printers, Medical imaging, Wide format printers, Notebook PC printers, Fax machines, Industrial printing systems, Photocopiers, Photographic minilabs etc.","The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0137"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"315pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ACTUATOR MECHANISM (APPLIED ONLY TO SELECTED INK DROPS)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Description","Advantages","Disadvantages","Examples"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Thermal","An electrothermal","Large force","High power","Canon Bubblejet"]},{"entry":["bubble","heater heats the ink to","generated","Ink carrier","1979 Endo et al GB"]},{"entry":[{},"above boiling point,","Simple","limited to water","patent 2,007,162"]},{"entry":[{},"transferring significant","construction","Low efficiency","Xerox heater-in-"]},{"entry":[{},"heat to the aqueous","No moving parts","High","pit 1990 Hawkins et"]},{"entry":[{},"ink.
