Each migration was made on the backs of new technologies and new inventions. While the move into the Information Age rests on a base of ever-increasing amounts of processing capacity and available bandwidth, the widespread assimilation of more and more information first moved on layers of analog inventions and technologies\u2014hearing and seeing from far away (telegraph, telephone, radio and television). Today, the Information Age is moving on wired and wireless digital technologies\u2014being able to process what we see, hear, and know (computing). However, whether analog or digital, wired or wireless, deep down, it must be pointed out that the information revolution is not about technology working with data but about people working with knowledge; and people's minds can only make use of as much knowledge as their brains can absorb.","The history of inventions in telegraphy and telephony is a path and process of continually improving the manner and method of transmitting \u201cdialog\u201d\u2014first human-to-human and then computer-to-computer. \u201cDialog\u201d is the discourse or exchange of information between people and\/or computers. First there were the mechanical devices like megaphones, followed later by electronic devices to amplify sound and transmit pictures. Then telegraph and telephone \u201clines\u201d were strung to transmit \u201cdispatches\u201d (dots and dashes) and \u201ccalls\u201d (varying amplitudes on an electric current) encoded and decoded with microphones and speakers and more recently with \u201cmodems\u201d on either end of the line connection. With the introduction of less expensive microprocessors into telephone exchanges (carriers can cut their capital investment by 50% and the costs of running their network by 30%), the direction of this development path has changed, and the type of problems encountered on this new digital path are fundamentally different from those previously encountered.","Dialog to Digital Dialog","The obstacles to upgrade dialog to digital dialog, however, are moored not only in the vast depths of communications technology and the limitations of existing infrastructure, but also in our imperfect understanding of ourselves and our impulse to communicate. Because it's not natural, to engage in digital dialog must be made to seem natural.","Certainly it is the superior performance and economy of digital technologies that underlie the massive migration to digitally-processed information, digital tools, and digital devices. People have long valued processed information.","Digital computing enables us to do traditional things in a new way: word processors have replaced typewriters, spreadsheets have replaced ledger sheets, databases have replaced filing cabinets, and the computer screen has replaced the wooden desktop. However, it takes a deep understanding of the past and current state of telecommunications, the technologies involved, the forces at work, and the issues which must be addressed during this digital migration before it is possible to integrate onto a single platform the convenience and reach of telephony to the exponential increase of digital information. It is precisely because digital technologies and information can be interconnected in an almost limitless number of ways that the way forward depends on locking in to a common process, locking in to a universal method of matching people to content, and locking in to a single platform on which digital dialog is processed.","The stakes are high. Indications abound that digital dialog\u2014the kind of communication that exists where phones and the Internet converge\u2014will continue to reorganize the way people do ordinary things. As the two worlds converge, the \u201cinfosphere\u201d\u2014the world of connected information\u2014expands. The part of the infosphere which is reachable by phone, personal digital device (PDA), or personal computer (PC) represents a potentially rich source of digital dialog. In this \u201ctelesphere\u201d (the successor to telegraphy and telephony) is the opportunity to communicate differently (inform, sell, promote, update), shop differently, study differently, work differently, bank differently, or just browse differently. While telecommunications firms have enabled us to reach the Internet from anywhere\u2014from home, from the office, at school, or on the move\u2014for many things and for many reasons, we use less time, less energy, and less money if we could use the phone system and the Internet to handle digital dialog.","On the whole, digital dialog is synchronous\u2014you say something then somebody else says something\u2014but asynchronous dialog in the form of voice messaging, faxing, and text messaging has significantly increased traffic. Email is the biggest form of two-way asynchronous dialog used on a mass scale. The trouble is that, in using it, users are exposed to undifferentiated junk communication\u2014the inbox is too full. The Web is asynchronous, and its use as a carrier of information is growing. The transfer of information is triggered by a visit, a click, or beginning an online session. Choices are saved so information can be personalized and delivered in the form of interesting views (information you can see) and messages (information you can read or hear).","With the three forms of communication and the many modes of dialog converging onto a common digitally-based packet-switched platform\u2014and the capability of capturing more kinds of dialog\u2014a need has emerged for a more efficient way to sort, deliver, manage, and store the traffic entering the system.","The opportunity to make improvements in telephony comes because of the migration to a digital platform. Like analog signals, digital signals are a representational notation. In other words, signals in the circuit are analogous to signals outside the circuit which act on a transferring membrane (in the case of digital signals, the digital circuit can be made to be analogous). Unlike analog signals, which are analogous to the forces impressed on it, a digital signal\u2014like all digitized data\u2014is a defined state, meaning that it can be assigned any meaning making it available for processing in ways only limited by the imagination, the capacities of the system, and the programming tools to process it.","A new method for handling digitally-based traffic is needed in the digital world because the content isn't transmitted as patterns in the frequency of the circuit like they are in the analog world. In the digital world, information in the circuit is packaged and described, making it possible to manipulate not only the content but the context before it is decoded and delivered to the receiver. The response from a digital dialog system can be significantly enriched and enhanced.","However, the migration to digital comes with as much complexity as opportunity. Digital dialog is a spectacularly complex feat\u2014the equivalent of inserting a rudimentary brain between the eyes\/ears and the mouth\u2014where solutions must be found for the full range of digital complexity:\n\n","It is because digital dialog is a multi-level, multi-platform, multi-media exchange of information that a full-service, turnkey digital dialog management system is the hairball of complexities that it is. At the moment, digital life is a bit uncivilized. The phone system lacks an underlying process to allow it to be used for calls and non-calls alike. Because people want access to increasing amounts of processed information, the phone system should and can respond\u2014people shouldn't feel like nomads, stranded in a digital world.","To understand the place the disclosed systems and methods occupies in the evolution of telecommunications, a brief background is helpful.","The evolution of dialog to digital dialog is rather well known, but migrating from one communication platform to the next proceeded on inventions fashioned from emerging technologies. Michael Faraday's electromagnet split person-to-person speech and sight\u2014which was until then processed by our one brain\u2014into two paths of development (telegraphy and telephony) were developed to carry messages and sound, and television was later developed to carry images. It wasn't until the development of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee that sound and images would be joined again (but without a \u201cbrain\u201d to connect them). So in the beginning, sound was directly perceived: sound\u2014using air vibrations.","At a distance, sound can only be \u201cheard\u201d indirectly (tele+phone, or sound) using wires (or \u201clines\u201d) and electricity. The \u201csound\u201d was carried in and by:\n\n","Working from Faraday's invention, Samuel F. B. Morse developed the electromagnetic telegraph and his system of dots and dashes in 1832. This system was improved upon by Alexander Graham Bell with his invention of the telephone, patented in 1876, and improved yet again in 2007 by the substance of the present disclosure.","Information has always been a part of our world but, until recently, it has been tied too tightly to the material world to process it externally. Over time, however, nature has developed a biological process of seeing and talking to process information. The ears, brain, and voice circuit has been created biologically to process objective notions (what's \u201cout there\u201d) into a \u201cprojection\u201d (a reflection of our internal state outwardly expressed) or into feedback and response.","Before Morse, messages and information were conveyed visually, using \u201csemaphore\u201d systems of flags or lights. The government offered a prize of $30,000 for a workable proposal to link the Atlantic coast by \u201ctelegraph\u201d, never anticipating electricity's role. Princeton's Joseph Henry had, in 1831, rang a bell at a distance by opening and closing an electric circuit, suggesting the idea of an electric telegraph. It took twelve years, but Morse persevered until the government was won over with his \u201castonishing invention\u201d.","During his work on the telegraph, Morse needed political help to obtain support from Congress as much as he required technical and financial assistance. By sharing ownership of sixteen shares in a future telegraph system with a congressman (four shares), technician (two shares), and professor of science\u2014Joseph Henry's prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2014(one share), Morse (nine shares) forged an alliance that would allow him eventually to succeed in claiming the $30,000 government prize.","What makes these technologies valuable is that they solve a problem that is important to other people by nudging then-existing resources into one bucket. In other words, in these worlds, monopoly works. Morse secured his monopoly by enlisting the support of politicians and government in a way impossible to do just 40 years later when Alexander Graham Bell was granted a patent-monopoly for his \u201charmonic telegraph\u201d. Once the government had strung lines everywhere for the telegraph, Alexander Graham Bell out-maneuvered Western Union, Thomas Edison, and Joshua Grey to put his \u201charmonic\u201d or \u201ctalking\u201d telegraphs at either end of a telegraph line. He survived 800 challenges to his 14 Mar. 1876 patent primarily because his well-to-do and well-connected father-in-law-cum-investor hated the Western Union monopoly and set out with Bell to establish their own.","The 29-year-old Bell already held two patents financed by his father-in-law: one for a method of multiple telegraphy, and another for two ways to produce the intermittent current necessary to carry telegraphic signals (by actually making and breaking contact or by alternately increasing and diminishing the intensity of the current without actually breaking the circuit). Knowing how to modulate the current in a closed circuit, it was a relatively small step to modulate the frequency instead; and when he succeeded, Bell abandoned his efforts to improve code-based telegraphy and pushed ahead to use electricity to carry voice dialog and, in the process, turned telegraphy into telephony.","Following the divorce of sound and image processing technologies in 1876, the convergence of voice and image onto a single platform wouldn't be made possible until 1991, when Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web (WWW) and it was released by CERN, an event many consider to be the most important development to date in the Internet world. The Web was originally developed to provide a distributed hypermedia system to provide easy access to any form of information anywhere in the world, and it has revolutionized modern communications and even our way of life (according to many).","The impact the Internet has made on telephony\u2014and will continue to make in interactive communications\u2014is so great that a whole new type of communications is emerging. The world of telephony is becoming the telesphere, a single place where calls and non-calls can be resolved. The implications of migrating from natural to analog to digital devices and abstract representations or \u201cdigital\u201d information is what enables the transmission of calls and non-calls. It is the exponential explosion of information that is driving up non-call traffic.","It is likely that trade and commerce are the primary forces that separate information from its material or objective side, creating a world solely of information. In computer processing, Moore's Law, a formula put forward by Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel, has driven the computer industry for over 20 years: every 18 months, processing power doubles and costs drop in half. This technological\/commercial maxim has led businesses to \u201cgo digital\u201d, and there is no reversing this trend.","The use of web pages in business has its own drivers. In its simple form, business uses web pages to store and transport information because moving information over the Internet is, by the Internet's very design, the least expensive way to move information across the desktops in an office or across the world. The reason this is so is based on the well-known principles of Information Theory which explain the huge increase in information flows as being the natural consequence of globalization, or the tendency of increasing production to be located further and further away from ultimate customers. The so-called Knowledge Formula, developed by Boeing in the late 1940's to explain how it doubled its production of aircraft wings for the war until it reached 35,000 per year, is 2\u00d7 volume leads to \u2153rd the costs, and vice versa. Because most of what constitutes business is merely information (set-up, capitalization of equipment and activities, information about products for sales and marketing uses, and payment itself) in different forms, and because globalization requires commerce to move information to customers at the lowest possible costs, businesses are simply forced into adopting the Internet as a medium for communication (websites, email, and e-commerce).","Web pages are expected to carry the bulk of information in the Information Age. For every $5 spent in production in 1880, only $1 was spent handling information (mostly for sales and marketing materials). In 1984, the ratio of spending in production to information was 1:1; in 1997, it was 1:2; and in 2005 it was 1:5.","With the development of digital computers, increases in bandwidth and processing speed have been used by software developers\u2014using program instructions and data\u2014to deliver useful applications to home and office, increasing convenience and efficiencies.","This growth in the infosphere is outpacing the growth of telephony. Non-calls are bypassing the phone system because there is no place in the telephone system to route, display, playback, manage, and store even a portion of available (connected) information pouring into the infosphere.","So, as we produce and consume ever more information, the communications platform supporting this transfer of content must be upgraded to meet demand. At first, language and the graphic arts were employed to process this freed information. Artwork led to advertising which (crossing the digital divide) led to brochureware and then to websites. Even in the digital age, the production and use of paper has skyrocketed. Gradually, however, technology is taking over the amplification, distribution, and processing of information. Notions once processed directly by biological components are now processed indirectly by technological components instead. This trend from paper to paperless is being carried out in the marketplace, workplaces, and classrooms around the world. In addition to capturing written information, the Internet is also the platform for interactive \u201cchat\u201d and social networks\u2014what the dotcom industry calls Web 2.0.","It's not just the Internet that is benefiting from the surge in non-call traffic. The phone system is capturing some of that non-call dialog as well. Phone companies directly capture fax, paging, and texting and indirectly capture email and web traffic by providing \u201cbackbone\u201d capacity for dotcom customers.","Today, even as the phone system and the Internet are converging, perhaps the biggest source of non-call traffic is just beginning to enter the marketplace: personalized information. Computer, software, and dotcom companies all have a stake in the rush for personalized information. Some are putting out phone-like devices; one is starting its own phone network. Phone companies are pushing back too. They're adding new phone services: voice messaging, Internet calling, caller-ID, call-blocking, conferencing, call forwarding, text-to-voice, picture-taking, photo-swapping, downloading (music), group alerts, global positioning (GPS), and map services.","While all of the above computer, Internet, and telephone services have greatly added to the ability to communicate, only the most electronically literate persons can utilize their power. For many people, the electronic options are overwhelming and add a complexity to life that is at the least stressful, and at sometimes destabilizing. Therefore, it would be highly desirable if an apparatus and method were available that allowed the average person to make sense of all of this technology and utilize its full power. If this method and apparatus also reduced stress levels and even enhanced the individual's security, it would be an important advance in the art.","In one embodiment of an improvement to telephony, herein known as \u201cDevice Independent Unified Contact System\u201d, a solution to the problem of communicating to \u201cthe many\u201d is made by enabling telecommunications service providers to: accept digital dialog as well as conventional dialog, enable augmented phone service to be added to conventional phone services, handle non-calls in addition to calls, and turn content into content-of-interest.","One embodiment the improvement to telephony provides modules, switches, and components that uses phone numbers as online addresses which can be accessed by any device connected to the Internet; by using the * and # keys (or other keys and\/or key combinations) on the phone keypad to access locations within the phone system and activate specific behaviors and functions; using three real-world metaphors-made-into-user-interfaces placed on top of a specially-modified phone-and-Internet browser as navigational and organizational tools form matching incoming notions to outgoing feedback stored within the phone system.","Through these modules, switches, and components, secure, private, protected, protectable; device-independent; and phone and Internet accessible, convergent \u201cspaces\u201d (or virtual environments) within the phone system are provided, which allow users to receive, send, manage, and store non-calls, digital information, and personalized content not currently handled in the telephony system.","A system and procedure to match notions is employed that enter a branded telecommunications network with appropriate feedback by: converting numbers as proxies for people and things into phone-accessible addresses. The system converts incoming notions into digital instructions carried to a point in the system where the instructions are processed. All content entering the system or having content outside the system is tagged and indexed by system agents by inserting header registers into each of the data strands of instructions and content. Header registers are populated with pointers to the content. The instructions and pointers are transported as parameters and values to locations within the system where \u201crules\u201d are applied. Notions are matched to feedback using the instructions, rules, pointers, and indexes, and values in the header registers are converted back to pointers to feedback content. Pointers linked to content (now content-of-interest) are assembled into views and messages and finally delivered to a location within the network for immediate display or playback, for delivery to a device connected to the network, for further processing, and\/or to be organized and\/or stored and\/or transferred to other addresses within the network.","The system foresees and accelerates the growth of the \u201cinfosphere\u201d within the telephony system, a virtual world held together by user-connected information. In one embodiment of a method of connecting users and information, the method includes moving in and out of a \u201cdialog space\u201d within the non-call network where all types of synchronous, asynchronous, and intermittent dialog can take place. The method further includes using notions and feedback during a session connection to move around in and manipulate the dialog space. The method further includes amplifying content not only by increasing or targeting the number and type of addressees or recipients but by \u201ccontextualizing\u201d the content. Additionally, the method includes adjusting the context of the dialog space by embedding content into various customizable and linked environments.","The system derives many benefits from the use of an address-matching method to resolve non-calls in the telephone systems, including but not limited to that the system:\n\n","In one embodiment, a method of communicating non-call messages over a telephone network includes receiving a coded signal at a switch in said telephone network, said coded signal comprising a plurality of individual code signals, said plurality of individual code signals including a plurality of alphanumeric signals, each said alphanumeric signal corresponding to an alphanumeric symbol associated with a selected telephone number.

In other words, the system looks for a coded signal (* or # key) in a number entered by a user and in response opens a predetermined digital circuit.","An additional feature includes that the coded signal is followed by a non-call information signal and said connecting directs said non-call information signal to said predetermined digital circuit.","In one embodiment, a non-call processing system configured to handle non-calls originating from a voice telephone network includes a signal analysis module within the voice telephone network configured to identify a non-call in the voice telephone network, based on the occurrence of an indicator and based on the identification, and route the non-call to a distribution circuit.

Alternatively, the content-of-interest is stored in a user's activity matrix to be delivered later.","In one embodiment, a method for resolving non-calls includes marking and routing non-calls into a telesphere to be resolved using a first module, wherein the non-calls are determined by the occurrence of an indicator consisting of a group including: a * key on the phone keypad, a # key on the phone keypad, and a www.[number] in an Internet browser. The method further includes pre-linking content in the Internet to a plurality of digital voice and visual interfaces by indexing pointers to each location associated with the content using a second module. The method further includes converting incoming clicks, interactive voice functions (IVF), and keypad sequences into notions using a third module. Additionally, the method includes assembling tokens using a fourth module, the assembling using data analytics. The method also includes inserting the tokens into a plurality of notion header registers using the fourth module, wherein each notion has a notion header register and each of the tokens is inserted into a corresponding notion.

Embodiments are discussed in the Detailed Description, and advantages offered by various embodiments of the systems and methods may be further understood by examining the Detailed Description and Drawings.","True digital dialog is an interactive process that is as effective and emotionally satisfying as having a conversation. Like its real world counterpart, \u201cdialog\u201d (from dia+logos, or the meaning that exists between two), digital dialog must be built from an accessible place in the middle: a \u201cteleplace\u201d. The improvement in telephony is not about what people can do with a phone or on the Internet\u2014e.g., stream video and audio, make long-distance calls, email, share files, get news, messages, etc.\u2014it is a way to put a centerpoint in the phone system to connect better with our children, our employees and bosses, our market, our teachers, our friends, and would-be customers. This centerpoint, this telesite, is a convenient place to have digital content-of-interest (COI) delivered anytime day or night. Based on voice and data IP, a telespace links broadcast and interactive media into a single low-cost COI media where people and companies who have information they want to distribute can also collect information or feedback, in other words, a digital dialog.","Digital dialog is designed to combine the best features of the telephone (the king of synchronous dialog) and the Internet (the king of asynchronous dialog) at a time when both voice and data are handled and processed by the same digital protocol. This TCP\/IP (packet-switching protocol) also handles intermittent communication, the third form of digital dialog: dialog that is triggered by an event (alarms, notices, warnings, reminders, expirations, instructions, help, etc.). As traditional circuit-based protocols are being replaced by packet-based protocols, formerly disparate modes of \u201cdialog\u201d like texting, emailing, photo capture and exchange, Internet calling (Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP), walkie-talkie exchanges, etc., can now be accommodated on the same telecommunications platform.","This is possible because, in a digital world, information is reduced to a state in which logical operations can be performed on it. This state is called the binary state and often referred to as yes\/no, 0\/1, base-2, on\/off. Communication in a digital world, then, is dialog reduced to a binary state. Because of this transformation, information becomes computable. The advantages of reducing dialog to a digital form are many: not just the efficiencies and speed at which digital dialog can be delivered, but being computable means that digital dialog can be processed. The dialog can be diverted into a digital \u201cbrain\u201d to assemble the appropriate feedback and deliver it through the appropriate channels to the appropriate digital dialog layers.","Making dialog computable makes it possible for the phone system to capture a whole new form of dialog because, while we think of dialog as talking with others, true digital dialog makes the phone system a platform on which we can talk to ourselves (which we do constantly) about ourselves; it is a platform for all internal and external communications\u2014what we like and what we need to know. In short, true digital dialog is interesting. Moreover, digital dialog makes it possible to talk to \u201cthings\u201d.","With a nudge, however, phone companies can tilt the playing field and tip practically all non-call information into the phone system. By hosting people's telephone numbers as online addresses\u2014supplying users with their own place online\u2014phone companies can become the digital ears, digital eyes, digital brain, and digital voice for anyone with a phone number and has heard of the Internet.","With that nudge, normal dialog can finally become true digital dialog.","In one embodiment, the system uses software and existing communications technologies to turn today's phone system into a new phone \u201cnetwork\u201d that sends and delivers \u201cnon-calls\u201d or personalized communication of either voice, video, or data. Research shows that human beings\u2014male and female\u2014think most about relationships. Relationships are maintained mostly by personalized communication; that is, information that is pertinent to the one being addressed in the hopes of receiving pertinent information (or \u201cfeedback\u201d) in return. The measure of personalized information is \u201cinterest\u201d; in other words, the ability of the information being communicated to focus and maintain our attention. In general, more interesting information is also more valuable information. Monetizing this value, however, has proved to be elusive. There is no general method or process to communicate personalized information. Personalized information comes with more interaction. What prevents broadcast, cable, and satellite companies from global dominance in content delivery is their respective platform's in-built lack of interactivity (or long latency if interactivity can be achieved). Unlike broadcast, cable, and satellite companies, phone companies are the undisputed kings of interactivity measured by the total amount of information flowing in its channels. Consider this: In a 2003 Berkeley Study, \u201cInformation flows through electronic channels\u2014telephone, radio, TV, and the Internet\u2014contained almost 18 exabytes of new information in 2002, three and a half times more than is recorded in storage media. Ninety-eight percent of this total is the information sent and received in telephone calls\u2014including both voice and data on both fixed lines and wireless\u201d (source: UC Berkeley's School of Information Management and Systems, \u201cHow Much Information? 2003\u201d, Executive Summary, page 3). Any attempt to capture information flows and be the world's largest information exchange must include the phone companies.","Until now, the communications industry has been divided into two camps: channel providers and content providers. Over the years, the buildup of communications technologies have by necessity been focused on the channel or medium of communication, on maximizing the reach or penetration of the medium, and in maximizing the message-carrying capacity and efficiency of the channel or medium (calling, signaling, semaphores, telegraphy, and today's broadcast and telephony technologies). Monetizing communications channels is generally achieved through utility charges augmented by \u201cbundling\u201d various channels of communication into a single payment plan. In contrast, content providers survive through subscription and\/or advertising.","The barriers to truly personalized communication were many and formidable. There was no single point of contact for users; however, in one embodiment of the system and method, phone numbers are used as proxies for the owner of each phone number. The amount of interactivity provided was poor; however, in one embodiment of the system and method, one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many messaging options are provided. There was no convergence of various mediums of communication; however, in one embodiment of the system and method, using one common phone-centric network for all communication (fixed line and wireless, broadcast, Internet, and text) convergence can be achieved. The ability of the user to access the system was limited; however, in one embodiment of the system and method, a method of using ordinary phone, PDA, and PC devices to access one's own and others' online addresses is provided. Furthermore, the ability to use any device was limited; however, in one embodiment of the system and method, any communication device may be used to access the system: phone, PDA, computer, etc.","Furthermore, there was too much complexity in the details of many systems, including the legal and political implications of using phone numbers as IP addresses and being able to deal with the most regulated industry on earth, as well as being able to handle all personalized information flows. Also, previous systems lacked dynamic complexity; however, one embodiment of the system and method includes the ability to receive, organize, manage, store, and retrieve content-of-interest and handle opt-in, opt-out, and no-opt information exchanges. Additionally, previous systems lacked essential complexity; however, in one embodiment, the system and method provides necessary flexibility, security, and privacy in broadcasting and\/or receiving personalizable messages.","The biggest barrier to personalizing information flows is the simple fact that few people (estimated at less than 2% of the people who can reach the Internet) have their own address online. Without their own online address, people must enter the Internet from a common portal\u2014typically, a search site like Google\u2014and \u201cgo to\u201d the sites and information interesting to them. It is much more efficient that information is personalized and then delivered to an address. The process and method of personalizing information flows begins with providing people with an easy-to-remember-and-use online address. Telephone numbers are described by governments to be the property of the person represented by their number (known in the industry as \u201csingle number portability\u201d). By being hyper-focused on other uses of phone numbers, phone companies can transform themselves from simply being carriers of information flows into being hosts of information flows. This means that, in theory, a phone company is more valuable because of hosting phone numbers rather than in connecting them.","The communications traffic in and out of these phone-numbers-used-as-online-addresses as \u201cnon-calls\u201d distinguishes them from the traditional \u201ccalls\u201d handled by phone companies. Non-calls are requests for content-of-interest (COI) in all of its forms: content-of-POTENTIAL-interest, CRUCIAL-content-of-interest, WORK-content-of-interest, and ED[ucational]-content-of-interest. Non-calls use the existing phone system to collect and deliver personalized communications.","I. System Overview","In one embodiment, the Device Independent Unified Contact System (shown in ) includes a plurality of input devices, home computer , laptop , smart phone , cell phone , telephone  (either VoIP or traditional PSTN), television with set-top box or other enhanced television system , and other devices . Other devices  may include any device that functions on a bi-directional transmission network or may include devices that receive communications over one type of network and send transmissions over another type of network (for example, satellite TV).","These input devices communicate with switching cloud . Switching cloud  includes a myriad of networks including, but not limited to, all conventional telephone systems, all cell phone systems, other wireless systems, the Internet, and any other communication switching network in the world. Logistically, in many cases, communications may travel from the device through multiple networks before reaching pNumber Service Provider . In many cases, communications may utilize the Internet at some point. For example, in the case of wireless phone networks, the pNumber Service Provider  may be accessed through the wireless phone network of the carrier and then through the Internet. Alternatively, the pNumber Service Provider  may be part of the wireless provider's core network, or may be connected via dedicated private networks (T1, VPN, etc.). The precise access route from the input device through the switching cloud  to the pNumber Service Provider is not vital to the function of the Device Independent Unified Contact System . In one embodiment, the pNumber Service Provider  may host the services on servers accessible via the Internet.","The switching cloud  filters out all the communications associated with pNumbers including telephone, email, and web communications, and directs them to pNumber distribution circuit . More information on filtering will be provided in the following sections; however, the filtering can be done by existing hardware architecture. In the context of PSTN, filtering is provided based on the usage of the * or # either preceding or following the dialing of a number. Existing switches can recognize the usage of this character and route the call to a separate server or other data hosting device. In the context of networks that operate on HTTP or a similar protocol, all messages associated with pNumbers will be sorted according to the address indicated. The distribution circuit  preferably includes a message repeater circuit  which directs the pNumber communications to the appropriate one of the storage nodes  within the pNumber Service Provider . Each of the nodes  is capable of providing many products that develop the one-point-of-contact concept. Some of these are illustrated at node , and include pAlert, the governmental warning system; pHome, which organizes the home-oriented messages; pWork, which organizes the work related messages; pRetail which organizes shopping; pTravel, which organizes travel-related messages; pEducation, which organizes education related messages; and many others. A pButler system  provides a variety of interface capabilities, permitting messages to be delivered by voice, web, email, or any other future communication method.","In addition to the inputs provided by the user, a variety of content and commerce providers may provide input to the pNumber Service Provider . Content servers ,  and other content sources  provide information to various pNumbers. Content servers ,  and other content sources  may include a variety of information sources including, but not limited to, content available over the worldwide web, such as news, music, video, entertainment, e-commerce offers; content available from governmental agencies (in the case of PAlert), etc. Since content need not come exclusively from a single transmission medium","As show in , in another embodiment, system  includes a switching network  that includes all conventional telephone systems, all cell phone systems, other wireless systems, the Internet, and any other communication switching network in the world. There are a myriad of inputs to this network, including personal computers , laptop computers , smart cell phones , conventional cell phones , telephones , and many other communication devices . The system  also includes governmental communication systems including one or more Federal emergency communication systems A, B, with ellipses  that there can be many of these systems. There also may be other governmental emergency networks indicated at A, B, and the ellipses . These may include one or more state emergency communication systems, as well as many other communication systems of governmental agencies, foreign governments, quasi-governmental agencies, etc.","The emergency system provides a single contact point for each person in an emergency. The expanded system addresses a much larger problem than the need for an easily accessed and easily remembered emergency contact point. Most of us are overwhelmed by the number of websites, passwords, phone numbers, etc. that are required to simply keep up with banks, schools, credit cards, loans, shopping, email, social web sites, business, etc. Life would be much easier if there was a single, easily remembered, contact point for all information we need to operate effectively. The expanded Sage Connex communication system provides such a one-point-of-contact system.","Referring to the , one embodiment of the expanded system  is illustrated. System  includes a switching network  that includes all conventional telephone systems, all cell phone systems, other wireless systems, the Internet, and any other communication switching network in the world. There are a myriad of inputs to this network, including personal computers , laptop computers , smart cell phones , conventional cell phones , telephones , and many other communication devices . The system  also includes governmental communication systems including one or more Federal emergency communication systems A, B, with ellipses  that there can be many of these systems. There also may be other governmental emergency networks indicated at A, B, and the ellipses . These may include one or more state emergency communication systems, as well as many other communication systems of governmental agencies, foreign governments, quasi-governmental agencies, etc.","Various types of exemplary communication protocols are illustrated at  for the smart cell phone . These can include pNumbers, conventional telephone numbers, conventional web addresses, GPS location data, and other types of communications. The other inputs , , , , and , similarly can have a variety of different types of inputs to the switching cloud . It should be noted that, while it is evident that the pNumber system easily converts telephone numbers to unique, personal nodes on which telephone messages can be stored, it is also true that the pNumber system can also provide unique, personalized email and Internet addresses. That is because current email and Internet standards require that domain names be limited to the ASCII letters a through z (case insensitive), the digits 0 through 9, and the hyphen. See IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) RFC 1034. Thus, with appropriate governmental and IETF cooperation, a PNumber can also direct all emergency emails and web communications to a unique, personalized, and easily remembered email account or web site which will also provide the governmental alerts. Thus, the PNumber communication mode represents PNumber telephone communications, PNumber email communications, PNumber web communications, and any other communication protocol that can be converted to pNumbers.","The switching system  filters out all of the communications  associated with pNumbers, including telephone, email, and web communications, and directs them to PNumber distribution circuit . The distribution circuit preferably includes a message repeater circuit  which directs the PNumber communications to the appropriate one of the storage nodes  within the telephone system . Each of the nodes  is capable of providing many products that develop the one-point-of-contact concept. Some of these are illustrated at node  and include pAlert, the governmental warning system; pHome, which organizes the home-oriented messages; pWork, which organizes the work related messages; pRetail which organizes shopping; pTravel, which organizes travel-related messages; pEducation, which organizes education related messages; and many others. A PButler system  provides a variety of interface capabilities, permitting messages to be delivered by voice, web, email, or any other future communication method.","Similarly, as indicated by ellipses , there preferably are other local PNumber distribution circuits located in other local PNumber service providers , which may be local branches of the same telephone company that owns local PNumber service provider , or other telephone companies. As indicated by ellipses , there may also be other types of PNumber distribution circuits , such as distribution circuits in satellites, which may be owned by the same company that owns PNumber service provider , or may be other companies, such as a cell phone company.","An aspect of the system  is the hosting of phone numbers as online addresses. These web addresses can be set up swiftly and in mass, and then customized by each individual. A related key aspect is that each electronic node  is controlled by the individual to whom it communicates, with appropriate governmental regulation to be sure alerts have priority.","The Sage Connex system permits companies offering phone services, including traditional phone companies, VoIP, and wireless providers to become web site hosts and automatically generate a personal home page with an array of services that simplify the individual's life.","Another aspect of the system  is that it permits detailed geographic specificity for alerts. Unlike the Internet, geographic specificity is inherent in the organization of phone numbers since the phone numbers are distributed in an organized manner by telephone companies. The alert for a hurricane can be sent to only the persons likely to be affected, with the persons who are notified changed instantly as the hurricane veers in a new direction. With appropriate guidance by warning systems, even the erratic path of a tornado can be plotted and warnings directed to persons projected to be within a window, for example a five-minute window, of the tornado's arrival. Similarly, alerts for explosions, wrecks with toxic chemicals, and alerts for other potential disasters can be localized. While this inherent geographic specificity has been disrupted recently by cell phones which are mobile, the specificity can be reinserted using GPS locators that are already in the most advanced cell phones. The GPS locators also have other uses. For example, all cell phones approaching a road closure could be alerted.","Another important aspect of the system is that the personal web site for each telephone number can be accessed from any convenient electronic terminal, including conventional telephones, cell phones, and browsers. Since each node is local, connections and communications are fast and not subject to the potential issues in long distance communications. Since each contact point is individual, there is no potential for collapse due to overuse. The PButler interface allows the contact point to be communicated with by voice, written, or by a visual display.","Various terms useful in understanding the pWorld system include:\n\n","A. Data Protocols","There are several layers of rules, protocols, modules, and components for supplying users with their own place online and giving them digital ears, digital eyes, a digital brain and a digital voice. The system includes:\n\n","1. Phone Services to Augmented Phone Services","The telesphere is a new augmented phone services layer that enables individuals, groups, and businesses to utilize phone-based digital services easily and productively. Installing it gives users automated access to the Infosphere on a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) basis using a \u201csite-fabrication\u201d process to help users personalize and customize their websites and access an unlimited library of phone, data, and webpage add-ons from which they can design their personal and work life online.","The total system specification encompasses a virtual service above the ISP layer and \u201ccomplex hosting\u201d below.","A new augmented phone service must integrate the phone system and the Internet. To use the vernacular, the augmented phone service must support \u201cwebtone\u201d as well as \u201cdialtone\u201d. The protocols and modules support both the world of interactivity and the world of connectivity. In one embodiment, \u201ccomplex hosting\u201d is used in a distributed Internet service array (DISA).","Complex hosting is the handling of phone and web-based traffic with the equipment and infrastructure needed to set up, host, and operate a digital dialog network. Complex hosting is the infrastructure behind \u201cwebtone\u201d components:\n\n","The DISA network design details how the DISA model is applied to a phone company's standard hosting configuration. The DISA architecture defines five layers containing the components that deliver digital dialog functionality, with a non-call network appliance server supplying the \u201cdigital dialog\u201d layer in Layer 4:\n\n","Using mass production techniques embedded in a digital dialog network appliance server, an augmented phone services layer churns out \u201ctelesites\u201d on demand, an industrial-strength manufacturing process which can be duplicated in any major telephone services area by registering large volumes of telephone numbers as domain names. These telesites put web services on the phone bill, and complex hosting integrates online address registrations and personal portal hosting with provisioning, billing, and collections.","Furthermore, complex hosting must be able to manage the new phone network across multiple ISPs on both dialup and broadband services regardless of whether the ISP is on a landline, cellular, cable, or satellite network.","B. Calls and Non-Calls","Phone companies currently handle call traffic (voice or image dialog, paging, texting and fax). To handle non-call traffic, however, all incoming content\u2014information and digital dialog\u2014must be reduced to tokens, notions, and feedback so that they can be processed in the augmented phone services layer in the network.","A non-call is a digital dialog. At every click and point in the telesphere matrix, a \u201cdialog\u201d can be started and maintained using chat, email, messaging, faxback, bulletin boards, blogs, or tele-assistance. These digital dialogs can be one-to-one (assignments, for example), one-to-many (soliciting bids or broadcasting), or many-to-one (an auction) and are facilitated by the digital dialog user interfaces designed to manage the exchange of personalized information.","Currently, calls are handled by phone companies and non-calls are handled by dotcom companies. Both calls and non-calls are interactive processes that involve the exchange of information and the transmission of content; but in order to handle non-calls, a circuit of notions and feedback must be created on which digital dialog tokens can be processed.","Processing the tokens entering the system is the non-call equivalent of \u201cresolving\u201d the call. Semantic computing techniques are used to match incoming notions with appropriate feedback (trade secret); but how the telesphere is set up, the mechanisms within the DISA layer needed to move tokens through the system, and the description of the process itself constitute a system of resolving non-calls using token-based computing.","The non-calls themselves are phone addressable information that previously passed over the phone system. The key to capturing this digital dialog traffic is the ability to divert non-call traffic to a \u201cdatapoint\u201d, a place in the augmented phone services layer where the digital dialog can be processed and delivered. The broad specifications of this datapoint are:\n\n","C. Resolving Non-Calls","In one embodiment, a token-based process of resolving non-calls is used. The process is made up of five intercomplementary sets of modules\/procedures implemented in a module system:\n\n","It is the resolution of non-calls which allows the system to handle the migration from dialog to digital dialog by enabling the phone system to handle both calls and non-calls. A process of computing on digital addresses mimics the natural tendencies of our minds to associate perceptions with experience in order to formulate responses and behavior. In the telesphere, however, a \u201cdigital mind\u201d (a set of rules and procedures operating within the connectivity of the phone system) resolves notions and tendencies with information delivery and feedback. The processes that govern our natural behavior and response to impulses from the environment are mirrored by digital \u201csense organs\u201d and a \u201cdigital brain\u201d to automatically and instantaneously associate and link information using the nearly universal phone system.","The five intercomplementary sets of modules are a foundation on which \u201cimprovements in telephony\u201d can be made (upgrading telephony to handle non-calls). In order for the phone system to accept and resolve non-calls, a select set of inputs, outputs, and processes must be arranged along a complex logic line based on rules and connectivity called the \u201cnon-call local loop circuit\u201d. Non-calls are resolved by a process of attaching incoming notions to tokens which are \u201cpushed\u201d along this virtual circuit to a programming point where the tokens are either \u201cdelivered\u201d to a call center interface as a message to digital \u201cears\u201d and \u201ceyes\u201d (an addressable or personal point in the telesphere) or as content-of-interest to ISP-hosted digital \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cvisual\u201d interfaces (characterized as personal, work, or learning dialog). Each incoming notion \u201ccharges\u201d (or \u201cweights\u201d) a token established at the beginning of a session to receive and carry it. A transaction ticket is created and the token is further charged or weighted by mapping in any relevant tendencies. The non-call local loop circuit facilitates a synchronous, asynchronous, or intermittent digital dialog (a two-way flow of information once a connection has been established) by \u201cbalancing\u201d the \u201ccharges\u201d (or \u201cweights\u201d) of the notions with the opposite charges of the feedback. (Another way to visualize this process is to think of notions unbalancing the system and feedback balancing it again.) The real source of the incoming notions originates in the mental structure of the user's mind which is matched to an internal structure in the phone system by an activity addressing scheme common to both. When a non-call is originated and a connection is established, the charged or weighted notions are resolved only by opposite charges or weights: content-of-interest stored in the internal structure of the telesphere that flows as feedback into the digital dialog exchange. This continuous flow of inputs and outputs collected and generated by the assembly point processes constitutes any and all forms of digital dialog traffic flowing in a virtual circuit connecting addressors and addressees (senders and receivers). The inputs, outputs, and processes of the instant digital dialog mechanism flow over a conceptual \u201cconnection\u201d between sender and receiver. This connection is made when a set of datapoints within the system, the activity address matrix, and the user interfaces are contiguously linked in a digital dialog session:\n\n","1. Inputs","The five intercomplementary sets of modules provide for the capturing of notions to be processed into feedback. The following occurrences can be transformed into feedback:\n\n","2. Outputs","The five intercomplementary sets of modules provide a means for delivering content-of-interest to a programming point that directs the content-of-interest to either a call center or ISP host including content such as:\n\n","3. Processes","The five intercomplementary sets of modules provide components enabled at stepped points in the system to process incoming notions until each one is resolved, for instance:\n\n","4. [Data] Points","The five intercomplementary sets of modules establish and maintain a connection by passing non-call tokens through various linked \u201cpoints\u201d in the system, for instance:\n\n","5. Activity Address Matrix","The five intercomplementary sets of modules use an activity address matrix to link user's internal mental structure to the physical addresses of content-of-interest located at addressors' or addressees' digital devices, the host server, and a server in the Internet or on a removable device. It is the activity addressing scheme that enables the system to associate and link anything that exists in the external environment to anything that is similar in characteristics, properties, or traits to personal, work, and learning activities that already exists in our mental environment. This activity address matrix is located between users and the content-of-interest stored in matrix folders\u2014like a middleman between clicks and content\u2014enabling users to see and hear interesting views and messages or have links to content in other folders. The activity address matrix is the same for local phone, PDA or PC device, the host network server, remote network server, or a removable storage device anywhere in the session circuit.","All content-of-interest in the form of data strands (brandstrands and digital strands) to images, views, messages, and links (pointers to other folders) is stored in a folder labeled with a matrix address number which contains:\n\n","6. Operating System","The five intercomplementary sets of modules use an operating system that acts as both a traffic cop and assistant, assembling information and delivering it to the digital interfaces for display on PDAs or PCs or playback by piping it through the telephone for users who call in. The assembly process activates the switches that deliver (or stop) the right views and messages from displaying or playing. This high-volume high-speed assembly process depends on the following:\n\n","7. Interfaces","The five intercomplementary sets of modules use specifically-designed user interfaces to anticipate and handle the normal issues of reaching addressable and personal points in the telesphere:\n\n","Digital dialog is repeated sessions using the interfaces to create virtual environments which are built up by the interaction of click spaces and activity spaces. Behind the interfaces, a click space containing logical addresses travels along the non-call local loop circuit activating processes resulting in feedback. Any one click space can be distributed over many activity spaces (one-to-many). In other words, click spaces can be distributed over many addresses in the activity matrix. Conversely, activity spaces (storing pointers to content-of-interest at physical addresses) are many-to-one. One activity space can be distributed over many click spaces. The interfaces directly control the clicks, click points, and click spaces, instructing the system to prepare content-of-interest for immediate delivery to an addressable or personal point, or storing the content-of-potential-interest if a notion is replaced by a tendency and the user left instructions (solicited delivery) or did not request delivery (unsolicited posting).","The user interfaces are essentially metaphors for receiving, displaying, organizing, and storing digital content-of-interest and matching users to content stored in databases. They activate and control a process for delivering content-of-interest to online addresses and to an activity address matrix that links Internet addresses with content-of-interest and matches this content with what users want to see, hear, and know.","D. pBrain","pBrain is a virtual processor (or \u201cbrain\u201d) located within the phone system that processes incoming notions so that the proper feedback can be provided by pWorld servers. Notions are indications by the user of a desired action, and feedback is the result that fulfills the notion. pBrain allows for the interactivity, filtering, and function of the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0276"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["320","355","305","310","350","345"]},"In the context of producers\/suppliers , sources , barcodes , seats , and part numbers  can all be assigned a web address based on the number or other indicia associated with them.

At a certain point, some products become retired products  if sales or interest in these products has waned.","In the context of buyers , presentations  concerning products are received by buyers . Buyers  either make first time orders  or repeat orders . In some cases, there may be insufficient demand  for a particular product. Product orders , some portion of which are realized over web pages , is the result of the buyer process. In order to make information more accessible to buyers, receipt numbers, ticket numbers, and the user's personal address (pHome) may be created as web pages.","The theory behind these web pages is that the pBrain virtual processor may process the information stored, received, and exchanged by these web pages in order to make the commerce system and advertising as efficient as possible.","Referring to , in one embodiment pBrain  includes a number of components. pBrain  may be designed to be a distributed processing system or a processing system with a single location. Network Interfaces  allow pBrain  to interface with a variety of networks using a variety of protocols including, but not limited to, SIP (session initiation protocol), RTP (realtime transport protocol), and HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol). Since pBrain may interface with voice telephone networks (including PSTN), wireless telephone networks (CDMA, GSM), the Internet, etc., multiple network interfaces may be needed. Processing Cores  and memory  perform the processing needed to resolve notions into feedback as determined by operating system  and applications . Since during high traffic times processing power may be at a premium, pBrain  may also include an optional processing accelerator .","In , one embodiment of pBrain  and a simplified view of an IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) Architecture is shown. User access level  shows various access networks including IP network  and PSTN . Additional access networks are possible including, but not limited to, cable television networks, wireless telephone networks, WI-FI (WLAN), Bluetooth, GPRS, etc. Since PSTN  is an analog phone line, in order to enter a digital environment, the signal is converted to IP. The Media Control Gateway\/Media Gateway  serves to convert the TDM signal of the PSTN to IP protocol and direct the packets accordingly.","In the control level , the CSCF (Call Session Control Function)  processes SIP requests (session initiation protocol) and routes calls to application servers. It is at this point where calls include an indictor for accessing pServers (such as the * or #). The HSS  (Home Subscriber Server) is the central database for subscriber data. This subscriber data is provided for the routing of calls. MRF (media resource function)  enables advanced media capabilities such as audio and video IVR functions, teleconferencing with ad-hoc and group calls, fax reception and forwarding, and the streaming of content.","Service layer  is where the functionality and the pHome, pWork, pEducation, etc., sites reside. p*Servers  serve as hosts for the variety of pHome, pWork, etc., sites. The App Server\/pBrain  and  provide for the functionality of the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0284"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["710","720","720","730","720","730","740","740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0285"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["850","810","820","830","840","850","810","830"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0286"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["910","960","920","930","960","960","960","940","910","960"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0287"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1010","1015","1015","1020","1030","1040","1050","1060","1070","1060","1070"]},"By recording some level of non-personal information in Global Activity Matrix  about the content, matches for future users will be improved. Examples of such information may be related to collaborative filtering, location filtering, preference filtering, profile filtering, etc.","II. PSTN and Phone Company Integration","The pWorld system interacts and provides value for traditional phone companies in many ways.","Internet\u2014A huge additional revenue stream for the phone companies will be Internet registration fees of pHome, pWork, pEd, etc., sites that are based on the user phone number. Since augmented phone and data services will be channeled through the phone companies, the phone companies will get to \u201cmass register\u201d domains (phone numbers) to provide the \u201cdigital homes\u201d for people. There will be flat monthly fees, registration fees, and additional service and bandwidth fees. All of these provide additional revenue for the phone companies.","Applications\u2014These are run via the application servers in the IMS. The application servers then interface to the pWorld network, providing augmented and new services. The application servers have direct access to existing digital services that are provided by the phone companies (voice mail, call records, greetings, etc). As such, these can be seamlessly integrated into new applications provided on the pWorld platform. Now that \u201ccalls\u201d can now be diverted to the \u201cnon-call\u201d network, custom greetings, messages, and special options can be presented to callers on an individually tailorable basis. Access to applications, services, and data are classified as \u201cpublic\u201d, \u201cpersonal\u201d, or \u201cprivate\u201d, where personal information can be shared on a controlled basis, information deemed public is accessible by anyone, and if it's private, that information or service is available only to the pWorld\/pHome owner.","Billing\u2014As applications are run and content is moved (P2P, Pay-per-download, free downloads, etc.), service and bandwidth charges are accrued. These charges are then reflected on the monthly phone bills of the pWorld users. Currently, the phone companies are only performing \u201coffline charging\u201d where billing occurs only at the end of the month. pWorld could now enable \u201conline charging\u201d, dynamic, or real time billing and services that were previously not possible, thus providing additional revenue streams. This will work for both pre- and post-paid paradigms. In the prepaid content, pay-as-you-go billing may be used, where a user's account balance is queried and it is required that the user have sufficient finds available, either directly or indirectly, through credit, account-linking, fill-up, etc. The IMS supports all these options.","Security\u2014The IMS provides rudimentary security against spoofing and provides basic privacy, but doesn't go far enough. Additional authentication measures are necessary if the user tries to access any content or applications that have not been deemed public. Authentication measures will be available such as PIN, password, digital certificates, and securID. Since most phones contain multiple sensors (audio, video, GPS, accelerometers, keyboards, touch-screens, etc.), input from these sources can be used to provide additional authentication measures such as facial, voice, and gesture recognition. Additionally, the pButler can be configured to provide challenge-response authentication (asking for responses only the true user would know the answers to). Some features and functions may only be available at certain authentication \u201clevels\u201d.","Non-call interface\u2014\u201cnon-calls\u201d are distinguished by a \u201c*\u201d or \u201c#\u201d key in the phone number. These are calls coming in via the PSTN, not the IP networks. As seen in: http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/webservices\/library\/ws-soaipmultisub1\/, the PSTN gateway of the IMS is routed to the CSCF (in the control IMS control plane) which handles SIP registration of the end points and processes SIP signal messaging of the appropriate application server in the service layer. The \u201c*\u201d and \u201c#\u201d key are encoded in the SIP stream (from the PSTN gateway) and decoded and routed via the CSCF. The IMS control layer consists of potentially many components working together, but in presently provided examples, combined operation is clumped together as a single operator.","Non-call servicing\u2014Assuming the caller is not accessing over the IP interface (via computer, smartphone, etc.), but using the phone company interface, the call stream (which has been converted from analog to VoIP via the PSTN gateway) is tagged with various pieces of information using fields in the header registers. These headers are constructed in the pWorld application server and provide a place for additional information to be attached to a digital dialog. Initially, the header information may be sparse, containing only date\/time, a dialog identifier, phone number of caller, and perhaps some identifying information associated with the caller (gleaned from database lookups about the phone number). There might also be coordinate (GPS) information also available. If the caller is unknown or has no special significance, the pButler will respond with a default greeting. This greeting may contain options for the caller which have been pre-arranged by the pHome Owner. These might include \u201cleave a message\u201d, \u201chear my auction items\u201d, \u201clisten to my new piece of music\u201d, \u201chear my latest tweets\u201d, etc. Responses then are collected by the pButler, and the appropriate action is activated. The transaction is then logged (for the pHome Owner), and any special billing operations are performed (say, if the Owner charged for listening to their music).","If the caller is identified as the pHome Owner (by the phone they are calling from\u2014weak authentication), additional options could be made available by the pButler, including an option to strongly authenticate, which could allow even more available features. These options and features would have been set up via a web interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0177","num":"0297"},"figref":"FIG. 32","b":["3205","3210","3215","3220","3225","3235","3245","3250","3225","3255","3260"]},"If the call is known to the pHome Owner, then a friend greeting is issued and options are offered in step . In some cases, the greeting and options may be extensively customized to the visitor. In step , a response is gathered and then the corresponding action is taken in step  according to the rules of pButler. In decision step , it is determined whether additional actions are required; and in step , options are reissued. If no additional actions are required, in step , the dialog is terminated and cleanup operations are performed. In step , the call is logged and terminated.","These services and options augment the phone companies' abilities and make the phone network more attractive to users, especially since their phones and Internet now have common interfaces.","III. pALERT","Access to the pWorld servers is via a special tier of pAlert servers. These servers act as \u201cfirewalls\u201d to eliminate unauthorized access. Access to the pAlert servers may be via dedicated lines, general Internet, etc. Access control can be performed by IP filtering, passwords, X509 certificates, biometrics, and other well-recognized security features.","Once access to the pAlert servers has been established, several pieces of data need to be specified to create an alert. This includes the type and nature of the alert (and may be implicitly defined by the type of access credentials), the geographical area (geofencing) for which the alert is valid (this may also be implicitly defined by access credentials), and any other special demographic data that may be used to more closely refine the target audience of the alert. There are two basic types of alerts: non-optional and optional (opt-in or opt-out).","Once the type\/nature and geographic region has been defined, then a general (usually terse) message must be specified. Additional media elements (audio, text, video) may also be made available by the issuer of the alert and targeted to specific geographic areas so that users within specific areas may be provided with additional resources\/information.","This information may be entered\/uploaded manually, or provided by an API (application programming interface) to the pAlert servers.","Once the alert information has been entered, depending on the type of alert, additional authentication\/authorization measures may be required before the alert is actually issued to the pWorld servers (especially true of non-opt-out alerts).","Once the alert has been validated and constructed, the pWorld servers are notified; and, if the alert is optional, then user-preferences are checked to see if users have chosen to \u201copt-out\u201d of the alert; if so, then no further action is taken for that user. If, however, the alert is of a non-opt-out nature, or the user(s) have chosen to accept the alert (opt-in), then those users within the geographic area are notified via their contact preferences\/mechanisms (phone, PDA, pager, etc.). For non opt-out alerts, if cross-company agreements are in place and geolocation information is available (via their cellphone or PDA), then alerts may also be sent to users that are found to be in the geographic areas specified by the alert.","Billing information is maintained by the pAlert and pWorld servers so that the alerting entities are properly billed. If the service is \u201copt-in\u201d, then the user may also be charged a fee (to show up on their phone bill).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0187","num":"0307"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["460","470","450","470","450","440","410","420","430"]},"pAlert Types and Natures","As mentioned previously, different types of pAlerts may be of an opt-in, opt-out, or no opt-out nature. Examples of no op-out pAlerts could include emergency notifications for local disasters, criminal activity, or specialized government (local and federal) messages.","Local disasters might involve weather-related phenomenon such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and severe storms. Other examples include warnings about fires, floods, earthquakes, chemical spills, industrial accidents, bio-toxin releases, terrorist activity, and food\/water supply contamination. Criminal activity warnings might include \u201camber alerts\u201d, prison escapees, gang activity, robberies, home invasions, and the like. Specialized government messages might include information that is currently mailed (jury duty, court dates, renewal notices, etc.) but is more efficiently and less costly to handle electronically. As newspapers are failing across the country, new methods need to be created for public notices; these might also be handled via pAlerts. From the federal level, critical announcements can be distributed quickly.","Opt-in pAlerts are those which the pWorld user has specifically requested. These might include stock market prices, ticket availability for events, coupons from favorite stores, invitations to special events, notifications of \u201ctrigger\u201d activity (an item in a classified ad or auction appears, cruise line price falls below a specific threshold, a friend twitters on a specific topic, auto dealers selling cars 3-for-one, etc.).","General Classes of pAlerts\n\n","To allow control over solicited and unsolicited pAlerts, it is assumed that each general class has a plethora of subclasses, allowing the user to \u201cdrill down\u201d to whatever level-of-detail they desire about pAlerts. The user then can search or specify more or less interest in particular alerts. For example, at the highest level, the user might opt-out of all unsolicited alerts. However, they may choose to \u201cdrill-down\u201d and only allow pAlerts from a select group of local grocery stores or restaurants.","pAlert Feedback","One of the unique things about pAlert is the ability to provide feedback to the pAlert provider about whether or not the users have received the notification (or did it simply go-to \u201cvoice mail\u201d). Feedback can be gathered from the user about the pAlert and returned to the pAlert provider. This feedback may take several forms: free-form text, a poll response, or even multimedia elements that the users upload, providing status or additional information about the situation they are in.","A.

Filtering Information\u2014Content to Content-of-Interest","The purpose of making a non-call is to satisfy a notion. Notions are not satisfied (or \u201cresolved\u201d) by content but by \u201ccontent-of-interest\u201d, a particular form of content that receivers have paid for and senders have paid to have delivered.","People are hungry for more and more information. What they are looking for is content-of-interest. This ongoing pursuit of content-of-interest is the force behind the growth of bookstores, libraries, schools and universities, newspapers, magazines, trade shows, much of sports and entertainment pursuits, weather, news, traffic, and educational TV, email, Internet searches, downloading and online chat, hobbies, do-it-yourself projects, phone calls, mobile phones, and text messaging.","The urge to know, share, and exchange content-of-interest is filling up the infosphere where digital devices, processors, and routers help keep us connected to the information we increasingly depend on in order to live, work, and learn. The described system is a way to accelerate the acquisition of content-of-interest. It is an inexpensive and practical way to maximize and manage information flows.","Content-of-interest (COI) is digital content which has been specifically requested or solicited and\/or pre-delivered as \u201cdefault\u201d information that data analytics software has determined likely to be of interest to an augmented phone service subscriber. COI is the inventory provided by addressees and addressors which is processed by the system into appropriate multimedia feedback (what people want to see, hear, and know).","For any system\/method to turn content into content-of-interest, three broad requirements must be met. The entire system and its processes are:\n\n","Following these broad specifications, the systems and methods generate and deliver content-of-interest in the augmented phone services layer of the telesphere, an area above the ISP layer that offers an automated self-designed portal for hosting, message addressing, and delivery which can be linked by the customer's telephone number, reached by mobile and landline telephones, paid by fee, monthly subscription, annual registration, and delivery charges while relying on alliance partners for billing, infrastructure, and customer acquisition.","V. Profiling\/Tendencies","Tendencies are actions, choices, or preferences that a user makes most often. They might be what blogs are read daily, sites visited, most-often called friends, pizza most often ordered, or the type or genre of music listened to. The idea behind understanding tendencies is to be better able to serve individual users with action, activities, and\/or content that is desired by the user. The BIG IDEA is to be constantly presenting the user with interesting and useful content (\u201ccontent of interest\u201d) so that their experience of the pWorld environment is dynamic, vibrant, and pleasantly surprising (fun).","Tendencies or preferences are gathered in a number of ways. When the users sign-up for a pHome, they are given the option of running through a series of surveys to help the system \u201cbetter understand\u201d the kinds of likes and dislikes the person has. If there are a number of people at a pHome (i.e., family members), each person would have different sets of tendencies. Information about tendencies is also inferred by the choices the individuals make. If a person orders pizza without onions, we might infer they don't like onions. Ordering clothes with certain colors yields other preferences. If the clothing sizes of a person is known, then offers that don't include those sizes can be dismissed (unless they are actively searched for, as in the case of gifts). Actions or operations that are repeated often then are dynamically arranged so that most-often performed\/requested outcomes are presented in highly accessible fashions or used as \u201cdefault\u201d values. Data from public sources is also used to better understand the users. This could include census data, data from county and state records, and Internet searches.","The tendencies of individuals over time yield a \u201cdigital persona\u201d that can also be used to predict what they may like or dislike based on similar tendencies of others. Grouping or classifying tendencies is important to be able to bound predictions to limit over-generalization. A number of machine-learning technologies exist for classifying, including Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Bayesian classifiers. Privacy of personal information is very important. Individual preferences are kept encoded and usable only to pWorld proprietary algorithms. This information is also kept on machines that are not directly accessible by the Internet. Information is also never sold to outside sources. If an outside agency desires to reach a particular demographic, the content is accepted by pWorld\/pHome and made available to users only if their preferences indicate potential interest. If the user responds to an offer, marketing success can be directly tracked, and the customer relationships can be monitored for potential abuse. Of course, users can always alert pWorld support to undesired market advances, which helps maintain high quality relationships with providers (since their access to pHome customers can be terminated).","In all cases of the above-described embodiments, the results of any of the transformations of data described may be realized by outputting the results by transforming any physical or electronic medium available into another state or thing.
