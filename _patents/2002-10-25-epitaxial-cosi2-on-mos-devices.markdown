title: Epitaxial CoSi2 on MOS devices
abstract: An SiNor SiONliner is formed on a MOS device. Cobalt is then deposited and reacts to form an epitaxial CoSilayer underneath the liner. The CoSilayer may be formed through a solid phase epitaxy or reactive deposition epitaxy salicide process. In addition to high quality epitaxial CoSilayers, the liner formed during the invention can protect device portions during etching processes used to form device contacts. The liner can act as an etch stop layer to prevent excessive removal of the shallow trench isolation, and protect against excessive loss of the CoSilayer.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with United States Government assistance through the U.S. Department of Energy, Grant No. DEFG02-ER-45439. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The field of the invention is semiconductor MOS devices. The invention particularly concerns deep sub-micron devices.","Cobalt silicide (CoSi) has been widely utilized in MOS devices for electrical contacts and interconnect material. CoSireduces device parasitic electrical resistance, and therefore enhances drive-current and performance of the devices. As device scaling extends into the deep sub-micron regime, shallow source\/drain junctions are important to prevent junction \u201cpunch-through\u201d and reduce the effect of drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL).","One method for fabricating a CoSilayer involves using polycrystalline CoSifilm through conventional solid phase epitaxial growth. One problem associated with this technique is that the resultant non-uniform silicide-silicon interface could cause abnormal junction leakage current, especially in deep sub-micron devices equipped with shallow junctions. Specifically, the non-uniform interface between polycrystalline CoSiand Si creates localized weak-spots. The localized weak spots can form the origin of junction leakage. Current leakage can be especially severe if the depth of the junction is shallow, e.g., as in deep sub-micron devices.","Oxide-mediated epitaxial growth and related techniques have been proposed to enhance the formation of epitaxial CoSi. These techniques make use of an oxide or titanium mediated layer to enhance the growth of epitaxial CoSi. In these processes, excessive loss of CoSiduring contact etching processes could result in high contact resistance and degrade the device performance and reliability.","Once a CoSilayer has been formed, a common, known practice to form borderless and self-aligned contacts is to form an additional layer of low-temperature PECVD silicon nitride, which functions as the etch-stop layer during contact etching. This layer preserves the junction and contact integrity by inhibiting both shallow-trench-isolation (STI) oxide gouging and excessive loss of silicide during contact-etching. A drawback associated with any additional layer, though, is the addition of a step in the device manufacturing process, which increases manufacturing costs. There is also a likelihood of device damage as a result of PID (plasma induced damage) damage during the PECVD deposition process. Also, the presence of the additional layer of silicon nitride reduces the spacing between the adjacent polysilicon electrodes, and therefore poses difficulty for subsequent inter-layer-dielectric (ILD) formation.","The present invention is directed to the formation of epitaxial CoSilayers on silicon MOS devices. In the invention, an SiNor SiONliner is formed on the MOS device. Cobalt is then deposited and reacts to form epitaxial CoSilayers underneath the liner. The cobalt silicide may be formed through a solid phase epitaxy or reactive deposition epitaxy salicide process. The liner can act as an etch stop layer.","The inventors concluded that a method to form high quality epitaxial CoSiwas needed. The invention generally concerns novel methods for formation of epitaxial CoSilayers on MOS devices. Methods of the invention may be used to accomplish the formation of borderless and self-aligned contacts. Borderless contacts are defined as contacts with zero or negative overlay at the border of active source\/drain junctions and field-edge isolations. Self-aligned contacts are defined as contacts that are formed between two neighboring polysilicon gate electrodes, and with zero or negative overlay at the border of active source\/drain junctions and spacer-isolation. Methods of the invention prevent excessive shallow trench isolation oxide gouging and silicide loss during the formation of borderless and self-aligned contacts. The use of borderless and self-aligned contacts with the invention offers the advantage of further reduction in the device's dimension. The invention will now be illustrated with respect to preferred processes for formation of a MOS FET.","Turning now to , a FET  may form a portion of a larger MOS device and is shown in various stages illustrating a CoSifabrication process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The FET  includes a Si substrate , a gate oxide layer  separating a gate  from the substrate , oxide spacers  and source\/drain junctions  formed in the Si substrate . Also provided in the substrate  adjacent the source\/drain junctions  are shallow trench isolations (STI)  which provide electrical isolation for the FET  from neighboring devices (not shown).","Referring to , the preferred method begins with annealing in nitrogen-containing gas or N-based plasma using any of known thermal or plasma-enhanced (PE) nitridation processes such as, for example, remote-plasma method, high-density plasma (HDP), inductive-couple plasma (ICP), microwave plasma, electron cyclotron resonance plasma (ECR), and RF or DC magnetron induced plasma. In particularly preferred embodiments, the DC magnetron induced plasma process is used. During this process, the surface of the MOS device is heated, e.g., to a temperature of 850\u00b0 C., to enhance interaction of the nitrogen plasma with the MOS surface.","The preferred plasma-nitridation process is conducted under conditions and for a time sufficient to form a thin layer of liner , as shown in FIG. . The liner  can be either SiNor SiON(If x=1, then y may range from 0.01-1.33), depending on the substrate and the gas mixture used for generating the plasma. In the preferred embodiment, the liner  is approximately 15 \u212b, but can range from about 5 \u212b to 300 \u212b. The nitrogen mixture gas source for plasma nitridation can be, for example, any of N\/O\/Ar, N\/Ar, NH\/Ar, or N\/Ar.","Turning to , and employing either a solid phase epitaxy (SPE) or reactive deposition epitaxy (RDE) salicide process, a Co deposition is conducted subsequent to formation of the liner . From 10 \u212b to 1000 \u212b of CoSiare formed. With solid phase epitaxy, the deposition of Co is followed by a post-annealing, e.g., to a temperature of approximately 700\u00b0 C., to diffuse the Co through the liner  and enhance the interaction between Co and Si substrate  and form an epitaxial CoSilayer  underneath the liner . In the preferred embodiment, the thickness of the epitaxial CoSilayer  is approximately 300 \u212b. However, the thickness can be anywhere from about 10 \u212b to 1000 \u212b.","By providing the liner  on the surface of the FET  prior to the salicide process, the epitaxial CoSilayer  is formed with a smooth silicide\/silicon (CoSi\/Si) interface, thereby minimizing junction leakage. The liner  is displaced during the formation of the CoSilayer  but remains intact and acts as a protective layer for the CoSilayer. A contact may then be formed upon the liner . The methods for forming the contact may vary. A typical preferred process assumed to be part of a process for forming a circuit interconnect pattern in a multiple device integration will now be discussed.","Turning now to , after the epitaxial CoSilayer  has been formed, the entire surface of the FET  is covered with an interlevel dielectric (ILD) layer . Then, an etching process is performed to selectively remove the ILD layer at the source\/drain junction  region and the gate . Liner  protects the underneath CoSilayer  and STI oxide  during the removal of ILD layer , as illustrated in FIG. . Subsequently, etching is performed until the liner  is removed to the extent necessary to reach the CoSilayer , but short of gouging into the STI  and CoSilayer  (best shown in FIG. ). Electrical contacts , preferably either borderless contacts (BC) or self-aligned contacts (SAC), are formed in the area opened by the etching processes (best shown in ) through the deposition of a metallic layer or other suitable conductive material. Multilayer and multimaterial contacts may be formed. Any conventional contact formation process may be used. The liner  functions as an etch stop layer to prevent gouging of the STI  during the ILD etching process, thereby preserving field-edge junction integrity and minimizing junction leakage current.  shows the structure after contacts  have been formed.","Turning now to , a certain amount of \u201cover-etching\u201d is necessary when forming electrical contacts  on the example FET  due to its topology. There exists a height difference of \u201cA\u201d between a surface  of the gate  and a surface  of the source\/drain junction . As a result, the ILD layer  over the surface  of the gate  is removed prior to the removal of the ILD layer over the source\/drain junction  region during a plasma etching process. The presence of liner  prevents the epitaxial CoSilayer  formed on the gate  from being excessively over-etched while the ILD layer is being etched over the source\/drain junction  region. Thus, the liner  acts as an etch stop layer.","From the foregoing description, it should be understood that an improved method for forming an epitaxial CoSilayer on a MOS has been shown and described which has many desirable attributes and advantages. A liner is utilized in this invention to enhance formation of the epitaxial CoSilayer. The liner also assists in reducing junction leakage during contact formation by preventing excessive removal of the STI, and protects against excessive loss of the CoSilayer.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims.","Various features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00009","num":"00009"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-3","sub":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00010","num":"00010"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-6","FIGS. 1-3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00011","num":"00011"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
