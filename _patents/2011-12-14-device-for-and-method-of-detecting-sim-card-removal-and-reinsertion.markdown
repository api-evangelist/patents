title: Device for and method of detecting SIM card removal and reinsertion
abstract: A device for and method of determining if a SIM card was removed and reinserted into a device by initially inserting the SIM card into the device, checking for the presence of the SIM card, if the SIM card is present then returning to the second step, if the SIM card is not present then reporting that the SIM card has been removed from the user-definable electronic device, checking for the presence of the SIM card, if the SIM card is not present then returning to the fifth step, and if the SIM card is present then reporting that the SIM card has been reinserted into the device, and returning to the second step.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates, in general, to information security and, in particular, to intrusion detection.","A subscriber identity\/identification module, which is commonly referred to as a SIM card, is a removable electronic component that stores information that identifies an authorized user of an electronic device (e.g., computer, mobile phone, etc.). Methods exist for identifying when an unauthorized user attempts to use someone else's electronic device using the unauthorized user's SIM card. For example, if a an electronic device associated to an original SIM card is stolen and a different SIM card is inserted into the device and the device is activated then information from the different SIM card would be sent to the company that associates the device to the original SIM card. However, there is a need to detect misuse of a valid SIM card with an electronic device for which the SIM card was intended to be used. The present invention is such a device and method.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,369,851, entitled \u201cCOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK CAPABLE OF DETERMINING SIM CARD CHANGES IN ELECTRONIC DEVICES,\u201d discloses a device for detecting and acting on a change in information stored on a SIM card (i.e., determine updates to firmware, software, configuration necessitated by the change in the SIM card and selectively communicates it to the electronic device). U.S. Pat. No. 7,369,851 is hereby incorporated by reference into the specification of the present invention.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,689,251, entitled \u201cAPPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING USE OF A SIM CARD OF A MOBILE TERMINAL,\u201d discloses a device for and method of that employs fraud technology to compare data related to the SIM card received from a network to information read from the SIM card in a terminal as part of a terminal initialization process and generating a signal to either enable or disable a SIM card function. U.S. Pat. No. 7,689,251 is hereby incorporated by reference into the specification of the present invention.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,747,997, entitled \u201cFIRMWARE UPDATE IN ELECTRONIC DEVICES EMPLOYING SIM CARD FOR SAVING METADATA INFORMATION,\u201d discloses a device for and method of saving metadata related to firmware\/software updates in a SIM card. U.S. Pat. No. 7,747,997 is hereby incorporated by reference into the specification of the present invention.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,840,234, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICE CAPABLE OF RESUMING OPERATING FUNCTION OF TEMPORARILY DISABLED SIM CARD,\u201d discloses a method of resuming operation of a temporarily disabled SIM card. U.S. Pat. No. 7,840,234 is hereby incorporated by reference into the specification of the present invention.","It is an object of the present invention to detect removal from and re-insertion into an electronic device of a subscriber identity module (SIM) card.","The present invention is a device for and method of detecting removal from and re-insertion into a user-definable electronic device of a subscriber identity module (SIM) card.","The device includes a user-definable electronic device with a connector for receiving a SIM card.","The device also includes a first function block in the user-definable electronic device for determining when a SIM card is initially inserted into the user-definable electronic device.","The device also includes a second function block in the user-definable electronic device for determining when the SIM card has been removed from the user-definable electronic device.","The device also includes a third function block in the user-definable electronic device for determining when the SIM card has been reinserted into the user-definable electronic device.","The first step of the method is initially inserting a SIM card into a user-definable electronic device.","The second step of the method is checking for the presence of the SIM card in the user-definable electronic device.","The third step of the method is if the SIM card is present in the user-definable electronic device then returning to the second step.","The fourth step of the method is if the SIM card is not present in the user-definable electronic device then reporting via the user-definable electronic device to a user of the user-definable electronic device that the SIM card has been removed from the user-definable electronic device.","The fifth step of the method is checking for the presence of the SIM card in the user-definable electronic device.","The sixth step of the method is if the SIM card is not present in the user-definable electronic device then returning to the fifth step.","The seventh step of the method is if the SIM card is present in the user-definable electronic device and then reporting via the user-definable electronic device to a user of the user-definable electronic device that the SIM card has been re-inserted into the user-definable electronic device, and returning to the second step.","The present invention is a device for and method of determining when a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card has been removed from a user-definable electronic device (e.g., a computer, a mobile phone, etc.) and re-inserted into the user-definable electronic device. Prior art methods exist for determining and reporting when a SIM card not associated with an electronic device has been used in the electronic device, because that might indicate that some illegal activity has taken place (e.g., a thief steals a mobile phone, cannot operate it with the SIM card associated with the mobile phone, and uses his own SIM card to operate the mobile phone). However, no illegal activity is suspected when a SIM card associated with an electronic device is removed and re-inserted into an electronic device. However, illegal activity can occur in this situation. For example, if a user leaves an electronic device with his SIM card inserted therein unattended on a desk in a library while he searches for a book, there should be no reason for his SIM card to have been removed from the electronic device and reinserted therein while he was searching for the book. If the SIM card was so removed and reinserted then the SIM card and\/or the electronic device may have been tampered with (e.g., data removed from the SIM card and\/or electronic device or malicious software inserted into the SIM card and\/or electronic device). The present invention detects the removal and re-insertion of a SIM card associated with an electronic device and reports such removal and re-insertion to the user so that the user may determine whether malicious activity has taken place (e.g., someone other than the owner of the SIM card or another authorized person removed and re-inserted the SIM card) and take any necessary corrective action (e.g., check for stolen data or malicious software). Without such a device and method, a user would not be alerted than an unknown person had tampered with the user's SIM card and\/or electronic device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"1"},"The device  includes a user-definable electronic device , having a connector  for receiving a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card , and having a graphical user interface (GUI) .
