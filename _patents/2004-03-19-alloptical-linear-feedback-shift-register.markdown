title: All-optical linear feedback shift register
abstract: An all-optical linear feedback circuit for use, for example, as a maximal length pseudo random bit sequence generator includes an all-optical logic circuit that is capable of generating 2âˆ’1 bit maximal length pseudo random bit sequences on an optical channel at high data rates e.g. 80 Gbit/s. In the pseudo random bit sequence generator of the present invention, intensity-dependent phase modulation of at least one included semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) is implemented. The maximum data rate is limited by the fast gain recovery time of the carriers in the SOA. An optical logic gate of the pseudo random bit sequence generator of the present invention may be constructed using various nonlinear elements that provide ultra-fast intensity-dependent phase modulation.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to linear feedback circuits and, more specifically, to an all-optical linear feedback circuit.","The use of linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) is well known in integrated circuit technology. LFSRs may be used in a number of applications. For example, a LFSR may be used to implement a clock divider circuit. A clock divider circuit is used to divide a master clock signal to obtain a different frequency clock signal. A LFSR (n bit width) may also be used as both a test data generation circuit and a test result generation circuit. A LFSR serving as a test data generation circuit typically includes a simple register circuit including serial-connected n D-type flip-flops and a feedback circuit for generating an exclusive-OR (XOR) signal of outputs of predetermined flip-flops and supplying the signal to an input terminal of a first one of the serially-connected flip-flops.","LFSR circuits as described above are further implemented for data encryption. More specifically, data encryption techniques are used to increase the security in data exchange and transfer over a shared transmission channel. In its simplest form, data encryption uses a \u201ckey\u201d based on a particular algorithm to change the sequence of a package of data that contains a piece of confidential information (\u201cplaintext\u201d) so that the data is enciphered or \u201cscrambled\u201d into an form that appears to have no correlation with the embedded confidential information (\u201cciphertext\u201d). An unauthorized user, who does not have the knowledge of either the encryption method (e.g., the encryption algorithm) or the key formed based on the encryption method, cannot easily in the scrambled data by using a \u201ckey\u201d that is constructed based on the encryption method. Therefore, even if the unauthorized user obtains the scrambled data, the knowledge of both of the encryption method and the particular key is needed to decrypt the confidential information embedded therein.","One well-known encryption technique using LFSRs is the generation of maximal length pseudo random bit sequences (PRBS). Currently, however, PRBS generation and other similar known encryption systems and techniques are at most capable of encryption and decryption at rates of substantially 1 GBit\/sec. Furthermore, current PRBS generating systems implementing LFSRs have large form factors and include relatively expensive components. However, as information exchange and transfer rates of communication systems increase, so does the need for encryption systems that are capable of encryption at compatible rates. In addition, with available component space in communication systems decreasing, there is also a need for encryption systems of smaller sizes and of decreased cost.","The present invention solves the deficiencies of the prior art by providing an all-optical linear feedback circuit that is capable of generating 2\u22121 bit maximal length PRBS sequences at high data rates implementing an optical semiconductor amplifier.","In one embodiment of the present invention an all-optical linear feedback circuit includes a first optical logic circuit, a second optical logic circuit and a delay circuit. The first optical logic circuit includes at least a first input for receiving a first clocking signal for determining the data-rate of the all-optical linear feedback circuit, a second input for receiving a trigger signal, a third input for receiving a feedback signal, at least two optical paths and an output coupler for providing a Boolean logic output of a combination of the signals propagating in the at least two optical paths. At least one of the optical paths of the first optical logic circuit includes a nonlinear element for imparting an intensity-dependent phase modulation on a combined signal propagating therein, where a first portion of the first clocking signal and the trigger signal are combined and propagate along a first one of the at least two optical paths, and a second portion of the first clocking signal and the feedback signal are combined and propagate along a second one of the at least two optical paths.","The delay circuit of the all-optical linear feedback circuit of the present invention also includes at least two optical paths, where at least one of the at least two optical paths includes an optical delay element. The output of the first optical logic circuit is split and propagates along each of the at least two optical paths of the delay circuit and experiences a delay in the optical path of the delay circuit having the delay element.","The second optical logic circuit includes at least a first input for receiving a second clocking signal, a second input for receiving a signal from a first optical path of the at least two optical paths of the delay circuit, a third input for receiving a delayed signal from a second optical path of the at least two optical paths of the delay circuit, the second optical path including the delay element, at least two optical paths, and an output coupler for providing a Boolean logic output of a combination of the signals propagating in the at least two optical paths of the second logic circuit. Each of the optical paths of the second optical logic circuit includes at least one nonlinear element for imparting an intensity-dependent phase modulation on a combined signal propagating therein, where a first portion of the second clocking signal and the signal from the second input are combined and propagate along a first one of the at least two optical paths of the second logic circuit, and a second portion of the clocking signal and the signal from the third input are combined and propagate along a second one of the at least two optical paths of the second logic circuit. The output of the second logic circuit functions as the feedback signal received by the first logic circuit.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.","Although various embodiments of the present invention are being depicted herein with respect to an all-optical linear feedback circuit used for generating a maximal length pseudo random bit sequence (PRBS), the specific embodiments of the present invention should not be treated as limiting the scope of the invention. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art informed by the teachings of the present invention that an all-optical linear feedback circuit in accordance with the present invention may be applied in substantially any application that a conventional linear feedback circuit may be applied. For example, an all-optical linear feedback circuit of the present invention may be implemented as a clock divider circuit, a test data generation circuit and a test result generation circuit.","2\u22121 bit maximal length pseudo random bit sequence (PRBS) generation is typically accomplished using N shift registers and an EXOR (exclusive-OR) operation. This is true for all cases of N that allow the maximal length PRBS generation using only two taps and one EXOR operation. An EXOR operation is performed on taps of a shift-register, the values of which are different for different values of N. For example, for N=31, an EXOR operation of the 3bit (or the 28bit) and the 31bit of the shift register is performed to achieve maximal length PRBS generation. Typically, the outcome of the EXOR operation is fed back to the very first bit of the shift register.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","120","120","130","140","150","160","110","110","150"],"sub":["1","31 "]},"In the representative logic circuit  of , the clock signal  functions as a first of two inputs to the XNOR logic gate . A bit from the fast optical clock  is switched into the shift-registers  when the output of the OR logic gate  is a logical high (e.g., a logic one), the clock signal determining the data-rate of the output of the logic circuit . The second input to the XNOR logic gate  is provided by an output of the OR logic gate . The output of the XNOR logic gate  is communicated to the first shift register . For the logic circuit  representative of a PRBS generator of the present invention having 31 shift registers, an EXOR logic operation of the 3bit (or the 28bit) and the 31bit of the shift registers  is performed by the XOR logic gate . More specifically, the 3bit (or the 28bit) and the 31bit of the shift registers  are the taps of the PRBS generator of . The outcome of the XOR logic gate  is then communicated as a first of two inputs (feedback signal) to the OR logic gate . The second input to the OR logic gate  is provided by the trigger signal . In a PRBS generator of the present invention, a trigger bit is needed to initiate the proper working of the circuit. As previously mentioned above, the output of the OR logic gate  acts as a second input to the XNOR logic gate . Although the logic circuit  of  is depicted as being initiated by a trigger signal , in accordance with the concepts of the present invention, other known methods or techniques may be implemented to initiate a logic circuit in accordance with the present invention. For example, a logic circuit in accordance with the present invention may be initiated using, for example, the clock signal .","Although in the logic circuit  of , the Boolean logic function is described with respect to a PRBS generator having 31 shift registers (N=31), a single EXOR operation and two taps, in alternate embodiments of the present invention a logic circuit for PRBS generation in accordance with the present invention may be modified to operate for PRBS generation implementing various values of N, multiple EXOR operations and more than two taps, as long as the correct bits (taps), specific to the value of N, are used for included EXOR logic operations as described above.","More specifically, an N-bit LFSR may be in one of 2\u22121 internal states. This means that it is capable of generating a 2\u22121-bit-long pseudo-random sequence before repeating. (A 2\u22121 bit-long sequence is generated and not a 2bit-long sequence because a shift register filled with zeros will cause the LFSR to output a never-ending stream of zeros and this is not particularly useful.) Only LFSRs with certain tap sequences will cycle through all 2\u22121 internal states; these are the maximal-length LFSRs. For a given N-bit shift register, the taps chosen determine the PRBS pattern. If the proper taps are not chosen, the pattern will repeat too early. A properly chosen tap sequence yields a maximal length PRBS sequence.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","220","225","230","270","275","292","240","250","260","210","214","212","218","216","240","244","242","248","246","280","285","290","200","200"]},"In addition, although in the PRBS generator  of  the first optical logic gate is depicted as an XNOR logic gate , in alternate embodiments of the present invention, an optical AND gate and an optical OR gate may be used in place of the XNOR gate. More specifically, because in a PRBS generator of the present invention a condition never exists wherein the trigger signal and the feedback inputs to an XNOR logic gate are both a logical high (logic 1) or both a logical low (logic 0) except at initiation, the Boolean logic table for the XNOR gate of the present invention is identical to that of an AND gate. As such the XNOR gate of the present invention may be replaced by an AND gate, wherein the feedback signal and the trigger signal are the inputs to the OR gate and the output of the OR gate and the clock signal are the inputs to the AND gate.","In the all-optical PRBS generator  of , light from the first optical clock  at a first wavelength, illustratively \u03bb, carries an optical clock (a constant stream of \u20181\u2019 bits) at a high data-rate, e.g. 80-Gbit\/s, that is intensity modulated in a return-to-zero (RZ) format. The clock signal from the first optical clock  is communicated as a first of three inputs to the XNOR gate . The other inputs to the XNOR gate  include an output from the XOR gate  (feedback signal) and a trigger bit from the trigger generator . A single trigger bit is essential to start the PRBS generation, as it acts to switch one of the input clock bits to the output of the XNOR gate  (i.e., seed the shift registers). The clock signal from the first optical clock  is communicated to both the first SOA  in the first arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer and the second SOA  in the second arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XNOR gate . The trigger bit from the trigger generator , however, is only directed to the first SOA  in the first arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XNOR gate . The trigger bit is configured to have a second wavelength, illustratively \u03bb. The output from the XOR gate , acting as a third input to the XNOR gate , is only directed to the second SOA  in the second arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XNOR gate .","To explain the operation of the optical XNOR gate  and the optical XOR gate  of the present invention, the function of the SOAs , ,  and  (or any other nonlinear element capable of imparting an intensity-dependent phase modulation) must first be described. The material gain spectrum of an SOA is homogenously broadened. This means that carrier density changes in the amplifier will affect all of the input signals, so it is possible for a strong signal at one wavelength to affect the gain of a weak signal at another wavelength. This non-linear mechanism is called cross gain modulation (XGM). In one XGM scenario, a weak pulsed probe signal and a strong pulsed pump signal, with a small wavelength offset, are injected into an SOA. XGM in the amplifier will impose the pump modulation on the probe. This means that the amplifier is acting as a wavelength converter. The refractive index of an SOA active region is not constant but is dependent on the carrier density and the material gain. This implies that the phase and gain of an optical wave propagating through the amplifier are coupled via gain saturation.","If more than one signal is injected into an SOA, there will be cross-phase modulation (XPM) between the signals. In XPM, the local index change caused by the intensity of one pulse induces a phase modulation in a second co-propagating pulse. However, because XPM only causes phase changes, the SOA must be placed in an interferometric configuration (such as a Mach Zehnder) to convert phase changes in the signals to intensity changes using constructive or destructive interference at the output junction of the interferometer. The patterns of interference may be chosen to produce almost any desired output function, given two input pulses.","Keeping in mind the properties of an SOA (or any other nonlinear element capable of imparting an intensity-dependent phase modulation) described above and referring back to , the operation of an optical XNOR gate and an optical XOR gate in accordance with the present invention will be described. Optical signals (a series of logical ones) from the first optical clock  are communicated as inputs to both arms ,  of the optical XNOR gate  and as such, to the first and second SOAs ,  of the XNOR gate . A signal from the trigger generator  is communicated to the first arm  of the optical XNOR gate  and as such, to the first SOA  of the XNOR gate . A feedback signal from the XOR gate  is communicated to the second arm  of the optical XNOR gate  and as such, to the second SOA  of the XNOR gate . If a signal from the trigger generator  comprises a logical high (happens only once to initiate PRBS generator ), the clock signal in the first SOA  experiences a phase shift relative to a combination of the signal intensities of the clock and the trigger signals and the biasing current of the first SOA . In this embodiment of an all-optical maximal length PRBS generator , the second SOA  has substantially the same bias as the first SOA . As such, if an optical signal from optical XOR gate  (the feedback signal) comprises a logical high, the clock signal in the second SOA  experiences a phase shift equal to the phase shift experienced in the first SOA . This is never the case, however, because the signal from the trigger generator  is only a logical high during initiation of the PRBS generator , at which time the feedback signal from the XOR gate  is a logical low. Similarly, if a signal from the trigger generator  comprises a logical low and the feedback signal from the XOR gate  comprises a logical low, the clock signal in the first SOA  experiences a phase shift equal to the phase shift experienced in the second SOA . What is important to note is that in the PRBS generator  of , because the SOAs ,  have substantially the same bias, if the signal from the trigger generator  and the feedback signal from the XOR gate  are the same, the clock signal in the first SOA  experiences a phase shift equal to the phase shift experienced in the second SOA . If however, a signal from the trigger generator  and a feedback signal from the XOR gate  are different (i.e., one comprises a logical high and the other comprises a logical low), the clock signal in one of the SOAs experiences a different phase shift (i.e., a 180 degree phase shift difference) than the phase shift experienced in the other SOA.","In the XNOR gate , the shifted optical signals are coupled and output from the XNOR gate  by placing the output waveguides of the first arm  of the XNOR gate  and the second arm  of the XNOR gate  in close proximity such that the optical signals in the output waveguide of the first arm  and the output waveguide of the second arm  optically interfere (i.e., essentially forming an output coupler). As depicted in , in the PRBS generator , the output waveguide of the second arm  is utilized as the output for the XNOR gate . More specifically, the output waveguide of the first arm  and the output waveguide of the second arm  are configured and constructed such that when an optical signal from the trigger generator  and a feedback signal from the XOR gate , acting as inputs to the XNOR gate , comprise the same logic (i.e., both are a logical low), the clock signal in the first arm  of the XNOR gate  and the clock signal in the second arm  of the XNOR gate , having been phase shifted by the same amount, constructively interfere in the output waveguide of the first arm  and destructively interfere in the output waveguide of the second arm . As such, the output of the XNOR gate  from the output waveguide of the second arm  comprises a logical low.","Referring back to , the Boolean logic for a PRBS generator in accordance with the present invention was depicted as performing a logic OR operation on a trigger signal and a feedback signal from an XOR gate and performing an XNOR operation on the result of the OR operation and a clock signal. However, in the PRBS generator  of , the OR operation is implicit. More specifically, because a trigger signal and a feedback signal from the XOR gate are never both a logical high and because the output of the XNOR gate  is configured such that if a trigger signal and a feedback signal are the same, the output of the XNOR gate  is a logical low, and if a trigger signal and a feedback signal are different, the output of the XNOR gate  is a logical high, the OR logic table is satisfied. That is, in the PRBS generator  of , the only time a trigger signal and a feedback signal are the same is when they both comprise a logical low. In an OR logic truth table, when both inputs are low, the output is low. Similarly, in the PRBS generator  of  the only time a trigger signal and a feedback signal are different is when one comprises a logical low and the other comprises a logical high. In an OR logic truth table, when at least one of the inputs comprises a logical high, the output is high. As such, the OR function of the present invention is satisfied.","Furthermore and referring back to , the Boolean logic for a PRBS generator in accordance with the present invention was depicted as performing an XNOR operation on the result of the OR operation and a clock signal. In the PRBS generator  of , the clock signal from the first clock  is always a logical high. As such, the XNOR logic table is limited to the cases when one of two inputs (i.e., the clock signal) is always a logical high (e.g., a logic one). Having an output configuration as described above and because the signal from the clock  is always a logical high (logic 1), the optical XNOR gate  of the all-optical PRBS generator  of  complies with the conventional Boolean logic of an XNOR gate as depicted in Table (1) below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"XNOR Boolean Logic"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Input A","Input B","Output"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0","1","0"]},{"entry":["1","1","1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In Table 1 above, Input A depicts an OR operation of a trigger signal and a feedback signal from the XOR gate  and Input B depicts the always logical high clock signal from the first clock . In accordance with the XNOR Logic depicted in Table 1, in the XNOR gate  of the all-optical PRBS generator  of , if a signal from the trigger bit generator  and a feedback signal from the optical XOR gate  are the same (i.e., can only be both logical lows) and the clock signal is a logical high, which is always the case, a logical low is output on the output waveguide of the second arm  of the XNOR gate  (destructive interference). In contrast, if a signal from the trigger bit generator  and a signal from the optical XOR gate  are not the same, which results in an OR logic logical high and the clock signal is a logical high, which is always the case, a logical high is output on the output waveguide of the second arm  of the XNOR gate  (constructive interference).","Although in the all-optical maximal length PRBS generator  of , the output of the XNOR gate  was depicted as coming from the output waveguide of the second arm  of the XNOR gate , in alternate embodiments of the present invention, the output of the XNOR gate  may be taken from the output waveguide of either the first arm  or the second arm .","More specifically, in the all-optical PRBS generator  of  the waveguides comprising the first arm  and the second arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XNOR gate  are placed in close proximity such that the optical signals in the first waveguide and the second waveguide optically interfere in the output waveguides of the first arm  and the second arm . As such, the output waveguides of the first arm  and the second arm  essentially form a coupler. By manipulating the length and the distance between the output waveguides of the first arm  and the second arm , a desired output may be manipulated to be output from either arm. For example, in the all-optical PRBS generator  of , the output waveguides of the first arm  and the second arm  of the XNOR gate  may instead be configured and constructed such that when a signal from the trigger bit generator  and a feedback signal from the optical XOR gate  are the same (i.e., can only be both logical lows) and the clock signal is a logical high, which is always the case, a logical low is output on the output waveguide of the first arm  of the XNOR gate  (destructive interference) instead of on the output waveguide of the second arm . In such an embodiment, if a signal from the trigger bit generator  and a feedback signal from the optical XOR gate  are not the same and the clock signal is a logical high, which is always the case, a logical high is output on the output waveguide of the first arm  of the XNOR gate  (constructive interference) instead of on the output waveguide of the second arm .","Referring back to , the output of the XNOR gate  is communicated to the first optical filter , which filters any remaining trigger signal (and any remaining signal from the second clock, described below), illustratively wavelength \u03bb, from the output of the XNOR gate . The output of the first optical filter  is then split by the optical splitter . A portion of the output of the first optical filter  split by the optical splitter  functions as an output for the all-optical PRBS generator  of . The remaining signal is split and directed along the two separate optical paths ,  of the delay circuit . Although in , the output of the filter  is illustrated as being split by an optical splitter , in alternate embodiments of the present invention, optical couplers and other optical splitting devices, such as Y-branch couplers or multi-mode interferometers, may be implemented in place of the optical splitter  of  for splitting the output of the first optical splitter .","In the delay circuit , a specific bit delay (depending upon N) is added to one of the optical paths , . For example, in  where N=31, a 28-bit delay (or a 3-bit delay) is added to the second optical path  by the first delay element . It should be noted that for other tap sequences and numbers of EXOR gates in alternate embodiments of PRBS generators and linear feedback circuits of the present invention, an appropriate delay may also be added on the first arm  of the delay circuit. The output of each of the optical paths ,  of the delay circuit function as a first and second input of three inputs to the XOR gate . The third input to the XOR gate  is a second clock input from the second optical clock . The second optical clock is illustratively an RZ laser having a second wavelength, illustratively \u03bb. Note that in the embodiment of , the second optical clock  comprises the same wavelength, \u03bb, as the trigger signal and as such, both signals, the trigger signal and the clock signal, may be filtered using the first optical filter . In alternate embodiments of the present invention where a trigger signal and a second clock signal comprises different wavelengths, a first optical filter may be configured to filter both optical signals or alternatively, an additional optical filter may be implemented to filter the signal from the second clock so that any remaining feedback signal does not interfere with inputs to the delay circuit.","Referring back to , the second optical clock  may be modulated at the same data-rate as the first optical clock  and may be modulated on substantially any wavelength not equal to the wavelength of the first optical clock , or alternatively, may be a continuous signal. Although the all-optical maximal length PRBS generator  of  comprises a second optical clock , in alternate embodiments of all-optical maximal length PRBS generators of the present invention only a single first optical clock may be necessary if the nonlinear elements used for imparting an intensity-dependent phase modulation are capable of substantially complete constructive or destructive interference. More specifically, the second clock of the all-optical maximal length PRBS generators of the present invention is implemented to provide regeneration of the optical signal in the PRBS generator to provide acceptable extinction ratios for the PRBS generator and to provide re-timing of the signals output from the XNOR gate  if the signals have been degraded within the XNOR gate . Such a second optical clock may not be needed if the nonlinear elements implemented in the optical logic gates of the present invention provide minimal loss on signals propagating therein.","Referring back to , the clock signal from the second optical clock  is communicated to both the first SOA  in the first arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer and the second SOA  in the second arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XOR gate . The output of the first optical path  of the delay circuit , however, is only directed to the first SOA  in the first arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XOR gate . The output of the second optical path  of the delay circuit  is directed to the second SOA  in the second arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XOR gate .","The EXOR operation of the XOR gate  is performed using the two SOAs  and  in the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XOR gate  in substantially the same manner as described above for the XNOR gate  except that in the XOR gate , the output of the XOR gate  is taken from the output waveguide of the first arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XOR gate . That is, the waveguides comprising the first arm  and the second arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XOR gate  are, as described above for the XNOR gate , placed in close proximity such that the optical signals in the first waveguide and the second waveguide optically interfere in the output waveguide of the first arm  and the second arm . However, the signal in the second arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XOR gate  is, in this embodiment, discarded, but may be used in alternate embodiments of the present invention for monitoring or troubleshooting an all-optical linear feedback circuit of the present invention.","Although in the all-optical maximal length PRBS generator  of , the output of the XOR gate  was depicted as coming from the output waveguide of the first arm  of the XOR gate , in alternate embodiments of the present invention, the output of the XOR gate  may be taken from the output waveguide of either the first arm  or the second arm .","More specifically, in the all-optical PRBS generator  of , the waveguides comprising the first arm  and the second arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XOR gate  are placed in close proximity such that the optical signals optically interfere in the output waveguides of the first arm  and the second arm .

For example, if the output couplers of the XNOR gate  and the XOR gate  are substantially the same, if the output of the XNOR gate  is taken from the output waveguide of the second arm  of the XNOR gate , then the output of the XOR gate  must be taken from the first arm  of the XOR gate , and vice-versa.","Referring back to , the signal taken from the output waveguide of the first arm  of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer of the XOR gate  of the all-optical PRBS generator  of  complies with the conventional Boolean logic of an XOR gate as depicted in Table (2) below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"XOR Boolean Logic"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Input A","Input B","Output"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0","0","0"]},{"entry":["0","1","1"]},{"entry":["1","0","1"]},{"entry":["1","1","0"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In Table 2 above, Input A depicts a signal from the first arm  of the delay circuit  and Input B depicts a signal from the second arm  of the delay circuit  or vice-versa.","Referring back to , the output of the XOR gate  is communicated as a feedback signal to one of the inputs of the XNOR gate  as described above. The second delay element  of the PRBS generator  of  is used to precisely control the length of the feedback path, such that the output of the XOR gate  reach the input of the XNOR gate  after a time interval of exactly N bits (i.e., 31 bits for the example of ).","Light at the first optical clock wavelength, \u03bb, from the output of the XOR gate  is filtered out using the second optical filter  so that the first optical clock signal does not interfere with the operation of the XNOR gate  via the feedback path. As earlier described, light at the wavelength of the trigger signal and light at the wavelength of the second clock, \u03bb, may be filtered out using the first optical filter  so that any remaining trigger and any remaining signal from the second clock  do not interfere with the operation of the XOR gate .","In an alternate embodiment of an all-optical linear feedback circuit in accordance with the present invention, optical filters, such as the first optical filter  and the second optical filter  of the maximal length PRBS generator of , are not needed in the circuit because of the design of the circuit, and more specifically, the direction of propagation of the trigger signal and the clock signals. For example,  depicts a high level block diagram of an alternate embodiment of an all-optical linear feedback circuit of the present invention functioning as a maximal-length PRBS generator in accordance with the present invention. The maximal-length PRBS generator  of  comprises substantially the same components as the maximal-length PRBS generator  of  with the exception that the maximal-length PRBS generator  of  does not necessarily include optical filters.","The all-optical maximal length PRBS generator  of  comprises an optical XNOR gate , an optical splitter , an optical delay circuit  comprising two separate optical paths  and , one of the optical paths including a first delay element , an optical XOR gate  and a second delay element . The optical XNOR gate  of  comprises a first Mach-Zehnder Interferometer having a first semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)  in a first arm  and a second SOA  in a second arm . Similarly, the optical XOR gate  of  comprises a second Mach-Zehnder Interferometer having a first SOA  in a first arm  and a second SOA  in a second arm .  further illustrates a first optical clock (illustratively an RZ laser) , a second optical clock  and a trigger generator . In accordance with the present invention, the delay elements of the present invention may be substantially any components or devices that provide a delay to an optical signal, such as an optical phase shifter. Even further, the delay elements of the present invention may be variable delay elements implemented to change the optical path length of the PRBS generator  of  to, for example, adapt the PRBS generator for operation using various values of N (i.e., the total number of registers in conventional PRBS generator circuits). Furthermore, although the PRBS generator  of  is illustratively depicted as comprising SOAs, any nonlinear element, such as quantum dots, capable of imparting an intensity-dependent phase modulation on a combined signal propagating therein may replace the SOAs of the present invention.","The operation and function of the PRBS generator  of  is substantially the same as the PRBS generator  of , however because the trigger signal from the Trigger Generator  of the PRBS generator  is counter-propagated, the trigger signal and the signal from the first clock  will not interfere. Similarly, because a signal from the first clock  is counter-propagated with respect to a signal from the second clock , the clock signals do not interfere, and as such, the two clock signals may actually be taken from the same clock source.

More specifically, the speed of an all-optical linear feedback circuit and as such an all-optical maximal length PRBS generator in accordance with the present invention is greatly dependent upon the choice of materials used to create it and the structure of the circuit. For example, the SOAs and the waveguides of an all-optical linear feedback circuit in accordance with the present invention may be comprised of silica, indium phosphide, or various polymers to name a few. Such materials respond very quickly to incident pulses and components comprised from such materials may be integrated according to known integrations techniques.","The SOAs implemented within embodiments of the present invention respond very quickly to incident pulses, and may therefore respond to any sequence of pulses spaced closely together. Furthermore, waveguide technology allows all-optical linear feedback circuits of the present invention to be realized as very small devices in which the pulses do not have to travel far (and therefore risk distortion and attenuation).","Furthermore, more complex Boolean circuits for PRBS generation, or for the optical generation of keys for encryption based on linear feedback shift registers, may be easily constructed in accordance with the present invention. For example, with the choice of suitable delays, such as the second delay element  and the first delay element  of the PRBS generator  of , multiple EXOR operations may be performed using at least two SOAs for each operation. In PRBS generators of such embodiments of the present invention, the output from each EXOR gate may also be used as inputs to other XOR gates. This may be accomplished using a cascade of SOAs.","In an alternate embodiment of an all-optical linear feedback circuit in accordance with the present invention, only a single nonlinear element capable of imparting an intensity-dependent phase modulation is needed in the first optical logic circuit because of the design of the circuit, and more specifically, because of where the trigger signal is input into the PRBS generator.
