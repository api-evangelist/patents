title: Automated means to remove air from venous blood during CPB
abstract: Venous reservoirs are interposed between the patient and the arterial pump and serve to remove air bubbles and provide compliance that accommodates variations in the volume of blood circulating in the extracorporeal circuit during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The invention is a reservoir that incorporates automated means to remove air bubbles from the venous line prior to the blood entering the arterial blood pump. In another form, the reservoir includes means that handles foam prior to the blood entering the blood pump. In yet another form, the invention is means that improve air removal in a soft shell venous reservoir. These features are applicable to CPB circuits using gravity drainage or vacuum assisted venous drainage.

No. 6,773,426 issued Aug. 10, 2004, application PCT\/US99\/19477 filed Aug. 30, 1999 (now published as WO012155A1: An Improved Soft Shell Venous Reservoir), and U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/141,960 filed Aug. 28, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,337,049, the disclosures of these applications and patents being incorporated herein by reference thereto.","This invention was in part made with government support under SBIR Grant #R44HL-55034 awarded by the National Institute Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. As such the government may have certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention is a blood reservoir with at least one pliable wall having at least three innovative features. First, the compliant reservoir is sealed within a rigid housing allowing control of the \u201catmospheric\u201d pressure surrounding the bag, and therefore the pressure at which the bag would collapse. This first invention enables vacuum augmented venous drainage (VAVD) with a collapsible soft-shell reservoir (i.e. venous bag) and is particularly useful for cardiopulmonary bypass. Second, the invention incorporates means that improve gas bubble removal from blood transiting the collapsible reservoir. Third, a reservoir with all ports extending from its top is disclosed, an innovation that provides easy loading\/unloading of the reservoir in\/out of its holder and simplifies sealing the reservoir in a chamber thereby allowing the aforementioned VAVD.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Blood is routinely pumped outside the body during dialysis, cardiopulmonary bypass, and long-term cardiac and\/or respiratory support (e.g. extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ECMO). In general, blood flows from the venous side of the patient to a venous reservoir that is usually maintained at atmospheric pressure. Blood flow from the patient to the reservoir is a function of the resistance of the fluid conduit between patient and reservoir, and the pressure difference between patient and reservoir. When the reservoir is maintained at atmospheric pressure, that pressure difference is the height difference between patient and reservoir; the resulting flow is referred to as gravity drainage. Venous drainage by gravity alone provides inadequate return during procedures such as minimally invasive cardiac surgery and bypass via femoral cannulation. Usually it is the resistance of the venous cannula that limits the flow rate. Vacuum augmented venous drainage (VAVD) is a technique that overcomes flow limitations by applying suction to the hard shell reservoir thereby increasing the pressure difference between the venous cannulation site and venous reservoir. VAVD allows for a decrease in the inner diameter of the venous line, thereby reducing prime volume and enabling the use of a smaller cannula, which translates to an easier insertion, a better surgical view and a smaller surgical incision. This method precludes the use of the safer soft-shell closed venous reservoir (venous bag) unless a more expensive and complicated two-pump system is used (see McKusker K, Hoffman D, Maldarelli W, Toplitz S, and Sisto D. High-flow femoro-femoral bypass utilizing small cannulae and a centrifugal pump on the venous side, see Perfusion 1992; 7:295\u2013300.","Clinically, a venous bag is used because it provides significant safety features. If the bag empties, it collapses, thereby preventing gross air from being pumped to the patient. It usually has no air-blood interface, and it requires no antifoam agents that can embolize into the blood. A recent study by Schonberger et al (Schonberger J P A M, Everts P A M, and Hoffmann J J. \u201cSystemic blood activation with open and closed venous reservoirs. Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 1995; Vol. 59, pages 1549\u201355) comparing the hard shell to the bag reservoir found significantly lower blood activation, shed blood loss, crystalloid infusion, and hemolysis, and less donor blood infusion with the bag reservoir. Schonberger's group recommended against routine use of an open (hard shell) venous reservoir system. Currently, a slight negative pressure applied to the venous line (to facilitate blood drainage) using a single pump is possible with less desirable hard shell venous reservoirs. It is impossible to apply negative pressure to current soft-shell reservoirs, but it is possible with the present invention.","In an open, hard shell reservoir, air escapes by floating to the top of the reservoir. In a bag reservoir, air floats to the top but must be actively eliminated. This can be done manually with a syringe, or more frequently with a roller pump operating slowly so as to continuously pump fluid to the cardiotomy reservoir. With either method, a sudden large volume of air can overwhelm the air removal system and cause disastrous consequences, especially without a vigilant perfusionist. With one preferred embodiment of the present invention, air would be eliminated automatically without a roller pump or intervention by the perfusionist, and priming of the extracorporeal circuit would be facilitated through faster air removal utilizing either a floating ball valve or a hydrophobic membrane. Currently there are devices used in the CPB circuit that incorporate hydrophobic membranes that remove air yet do not allow blood to cross (e.g. Model # AutoVent-SV, Pall Corp Glen Cove N.Y.). Studies with filters used in these applications have shown that the membranes clear air from water almost indefinitely (many days), even if high suction is applied, without reducing gas transfer rate over time. However, when the membrane is exposed to blood, especially when high suction is applied, a film forms on the membrane over time, causing a significant increase in resistance to gas flow. The present invention incorporates designs and means to reduce this problem and extend the life of the membrane when used with blood. Likewise, U.S. Pat. No. 3,849,071 shows a floating ball within a blood filter that supposed to open a purge port when air enters and close when the blood level rises. However, as described, it is a physical impossibility for the ball to \u201cfall\u201d and open the purge port because, as shown, the weight of the floating ball is insufficient to overcome the force holding the ball against the purge port. With the present invention, the relative weight of the ball, the internal diameter of the purge port, and the suction applied to the purge port are designed to assure that the ball will drop to open the purge port in response to air level in the venous reservoir.","With prior art soft-shell reservoirs (SSR) air may be trapped at the top of the liquid by the collapsed walls of the reservoir, see and . U.S. Pat. No. 4,622,032 illustrates a soft shell reservoir having an inlet tube extending from the bottom half way into the reservoir. This arrangement helps bubbles move up to the top of the extended tubes but the bubbles can still be trapped above said tubes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,526 illustrates the prior art soft-shell reservoir having its gas removal tubes (i.e.  and  of ) extending from the top less 40% of the height of its blood chamber into the reservoir. All other prior art SSR have air removal tubes that are shorter with many having vent tubes that do not extend into the SSR at all (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,349). As and illustrate, a tube extending from the top and into the SSR prevents complete collapse of the pliable walls of the bag thereby forming a pathway for air to move upward. The prior SSR air removal tubes extend less than 40% of the height of the blood chamber and therefore air still may be trapped below said tubes.","A soft shell venous reservoir sold by Medtronic Model # Maxima 1386 shows a soft shell reservoir with an inline tube extending, along one side of the bag, to the gas purge port at a 45\u00b0 incline. This design has a rigid fluid path between blood inlet and gas purge port. However, this design is not as conducive to air removal as a vertical fluid path would be. In addition, the tube extending between inlet tube and purge port had an ID of \u215d\u2033, or only 25% greater diameter than the inlet tube. Thus, the velocity of the liquid in the column slows to only 64% of the inlet velocity. In another aspect of the present invention, a vertical path is provided from the blood inlet at the bottom of the bag to the gas purge port at the top of the bag, such path limiting the aforementioned problem of trapped air. The vertical path also has a large enough diameter that slows the velocity of the liquid to 25% or less of the inlet velocity. A lower blood velocity is more conducive to bubble removal.","State of the art soft shell venous reservoirs with a screen are designed such that a large portion of the screen contacts the internal walls of the bag, thereby increasing the resistance to blood flow across the screen, and rendering that portion of the screen ineffective, at least partially. This contact between the screen and the walls of the bag increases as the volume in the reservoir decreases. One aspect of the present invention reduces that problem by preventing the external walls of the venous reservoir from contacting the screen.","The indication of blood level in present soft shell venous reservoir is very inaccurate and low level, or air-in-the-reservoir, alarms are not reliable because many are designed for hard shell reservoirs. The present invention provides effective means to alarm at low blood levels and in the soft shell venous reservoir.","Currently, at the end of the bypass procedure, the patient is weaned off the heart lung machine by reducing the bypass flow. This is achieved by partially clamping the venous line and decreasing the speed of the arterial pump. Once off bypass, the blood left in the venous reservoir is gradually pumped back to the venous side of the patient. Another aspect of the invention allows the user to adjust the positive pressure applied to the blood within the venous reservoir. By being able to increase the pressure of the venous reservoir, the user can effectively reduce venous drainage or perfuse the blood back to the patient. This is not possible with current venous reservoir bags and may be dangerous with hard shell reservoirs (i.e., air may be pushed to the patient).","The inventor has also previously described an inline bladder (The Better-Bladder\u2122, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,039,078), a device with a thin walled, sausage shaped bladder sealed inside a clear, rigid housing. Since the bladder is made from a single piece of tubing, the blood path is smooth with no flow discontinuities. The bladder portion is sealed within the housing that has an access port to the housing space outside the bladder. Because of its thin wall, the enlarged section can easily collapse. Thus, it can serve as an inline reservoir, providing compliance in the venous line to reduce the pressure pulsations at the pump inlet. The Better-Bladder also transmits the blood pressure flowing through it across its thin wall, allowing pump inlet pressure to be measured noninvasively by measuring the gas pressure of the housing via the gas port. The degree of \u201cgravity drainage\u201d is user-adjustable by setting the negative pressure in the Better-Bladder housing. If the suction generated by the venous pump becomes too great, the pump is slowed or stopped by a pump controller. The Better-Bladder does not have a gas purge port or a screen to inhibit gas bubbles. It is also much smaller, having nominal volume of 80 ml for adult perfusion as compared to over 1,000 ml for a venous reservoir.","Despite users acknowledgement that SSR are safer, hard shell reservoirs are easier to use and therefore more widely used. For example, it is easier to connect the inlet tubing located at the top of the hard shell reservoir than to the inlet tube of the SSR located at the bottom. Though some SSRs are premounted by the manufacture to a supporting plate (e.g. Cobe see U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,039), most require multiple hanging hooks for proper support (e.g. Baxter's SSR model # BMR1900 has 3 holes at the top and 4 holes at the bottom), an inconvenience at best, a danger in an emergency. Present mounted SSR do not improve the tube connection by much. It would be a clinical advantage to provide a SSR that allows fast mounting and dismounting, and tube connection that are easy or even easier than that of hard shell reservoir. Another requirement for present SSR is the use of a supporting faceplate (e.g. see FIG. 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,526). These are used to improve the bubble path from the blood to the top of the reservoir. Such faceplates are again inconvenient, require additional assembly time by the user, and may obstruct the direct approach to the front wall of the bag. The latter is useful when bubbles \u201cstuck\u201d on the wall are to be dislodged. The elimination, or at least the reduced requirement, of a front plate is another desirable attribute.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,823,045 \u201cMeasuring Blood Volume in Soft-Shell Venous Resevoirs (sp.) by Displacement\u201d illustrates a SSR enclosed in a rigid housing. This invention suggests sealing a SSR within a rigid housing but does not suggest applying vacuum to the fluid surrounding the SSR. In fact, neither the FIGs. nor the specifications mention a port for adjusting the fluid in sealed container 12. Van Driel's patent has some major flaws. The tubes connected to the bag are to be \u201cthreaded through resilient seals 26 in the bottom of container 12 . . . \u201d also renders '045 clinically irrelevant. If, though not described as such, container 12 is disposable, then the system as described is too expensive. If, as understood, container 12 were not disposable, then \u201cthreading\u201d the tubes would break sterility, and would be very difficult, especially if a seal is required. Further, since the outside diameter of perfusion connectors are larger than the OD of the tubing they connect, it would be impossible to have any of the tubing of the SSR connected to anything until after they have been threaded. In addition, the housing needs to be sufficiently wide for the user to place their hands and thread the inlet and outlet tubes at the bottom of box 12, a major disadvantage that hinders quick setup and increases the likelihood of contamination. This invention has not been reduced to clinical practice.","Since the SSR is sealed in container 12, external means are provided by '045 to \u201cmassage\u201d the SSR with \u201cvibrator\u201d 36. In fact, since vibrator 36 is not connected to the wall of the SSR, it can only squeeze the wall rather than the pull and push motions required for vibration. This provides significantly less manipulation ability as compared to direct contact with the bag.","PCT's International Publication Number WO 99\/08734 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Minimally Invasive Surgery Vacuum-Assisted Venous Drainage\u201d illustrates in FIG. 9 a standard SSR (\u201cpreferably BMR-800 or BMR-1900\u201d) completely sealed in a rigid housing. It is also suggested that \u201c . . . a pressure differential between the interior and exterior of the reservoir . . . \u201d be maintained. This design is as impractical as that of US Pat, '045. If the bag and rigid housing are assembled and shipped to the end user as a single unit, the unit becomes very expensive and therefore would be used only for VADV cases. The expense arises from a housing required to support a large force. The force can be calculated as (Pressure)*(Area). Thus, to support a pressure of \u2212250 mmHg with a safety factor of 2 for a box that holds a bag like the BMR-1900 (10\u2033 high by 12\u2033 wide), the force on each faceplate is 1200 lb! The inventors did not suggest, nor showed or described, a mechanism for the user to seal the bag in the box. Even if there was a mechanism, it would be very difficult, time consuming, and, as described with relation to '045, most likely to break sterility. And, once sealed it would be impossible for the user to contact the bag.","Both '045 and '08734 illustrate the rigid housing as a rectangular box. A better design to support the large external force due to the large area and vacuum used would be an ellipsoid cross section or at least rounded corners.","Both '045 and '08734 illustrate the great need for designs that allow simple, inexpensive, and quick means to seal and remove the bag from its container even with long tubing or large connectors without affecting its sterility. Simple and quick means to reach the enclosed bag would also be welcomed. The present invention overcomes these clinically non-workable prior art designs.","It is standard practice to place the venous reservoir above the oxygenator to assure that the microporous membrane is always under positive pressure. A negative pressure would result in air crossing the membrane and entering the arterial line, a very dangerous situation. When VAVD is used, suction can be applied to the venous reservoir only once the arterial pump is generating a positive pressure in the arterial line. Otherwise, the suction applied to the venous reservoir can draw air across the membrane. A one-way valve at the pump outlet prevents vacuum applied to the venous reservoir from reaching the membrane oxygenator, but a one-way valve incorporated into the outlet of the present venous reservoir is preferable. Means to assure that the gas side of the membrane oxygenator is always positive relative to the blood side would also be a major safety feature for all VAVD applications.","The present invention incorporates improved designs for venous reservoirs that provide the benefits of prior art devices (limiting pump suction using the safer, pliable blood reservoir) while avoiding their disadvantages (air entrapment, inability to utilize VAVD, required vigilance for air removal). Further, its advantages and uniqueness are also enhanced by providing the user with means to adjust the degree of suction applied for venous augmentation and assuring that a greater area of the screen is effective in liquid transport.","Briefly, the present invention in its simplest form consists of a blood reservoir having at least one pliable wall, a blood inlet, a blood outlet, and a gas purge port. In one preferred embodiment, a first structure having tubular cross section and semirigid wall is placed above said inlet thereby providing a first path for undesirable bubbles entering the reservoir to move to the top where they are eliminated via said gas purge port. The first structure preferably has an effective cross section that is larger than the ID of said inlet tube thereby slowing any blood flow and allowing more favorable conditions (longer time, lower drag) for gas bubbles to float upward. The wall of the first structure is sufficiently rigid to prevent collapse of said pliable wall from blocking said first path. In another preferred embodiment, the pliable wall of the venous reservoir is sealed externally, forming a pressure chamber external to the venous reservoir. Controlled suction applied to said external chamber is transmitted across said pliable wall thereby controlling the negative pressure of the blood at which said pliable wall moves.","Another preferred embodiment has all the tubes at the top of the SSR. These tubes pass through, sealed within, and physically supported by a rigid disposable supporting plate providing three major advantages. First, the bag is supported by hanging the supporting plate in a supporting fixture, much like the hard shell reservoir. This allows the user to \u201cdrop in\u201d the SSR and just as easily remove the SSR from its holder. Second, the supporting plate provides simple sealing means along a single plane, an extremely important feature for simple and secure sealing of the SSR within housing for VAVD applications. Third, by having all the tubes for the bag entering from its top, the bottom of the bag is unhindered and can be placed lower to the floor allowing greater gravity drainage. In addition, because the bag hangs from the top, the weight of the SSR\/blood contributes to the seal of the supporting plate against the housing. Designed properly, this gravitational force can eliminate or greatly simplify any clamping required by other designs.","It is therefore the objective of the present invention to provide an improved venous blood reservoir with at least one pliable wall that provides a path for gas bubbles entering the inlet to move unhindered up to the gas purge port.","A further objective of the present invention is an improved venous blood reservoir, having at least one pliable wall, allowing the user to adjust the negative pressure applied to said pliable wall thereby allowing for augmented venous drainage.","A further objective of the present invention is an improved venous blood reservoir designed to maintain its external wall from contacting the screen material and thereby reducing the resistance to blood flow across the screen.","Yet another objective of the present invention is to incorporate a one-way valve at the outlet of the venous reservoir, said valve preventing blood from being sucked into the venous reservoir when pressure at the outlet of the venous reservoir is positive relative to the liquid pressure in the venous reservoir.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved venous blood reservoir with at least one pliable wall that when placed at the pump inlet, provides compliance that reduces pressure fluctuations at said pump inlet.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved venous blood reservoir with at least one pliable wall that when placed at the pump inlet, provides automated means to eliminate air.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved venous blood reservoir with at least one pliable wall and with a relatively large gas purge port, said port providing a more volumetrically effective gas purge, and one that is less traumatic to the blood.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide automated means to detect air in the venous reservoir and utilize said means to alarm the user or control the suction used to remove air from the venous reservoir.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide the user with a SSR that is simple to use, and easy to load and unload from its holder or from its container.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide the user with a SSR having all its connections above the bag facilitating said connections and allowing a lower placement of the reservoir thus providing greater gravity drainage.","Another objective of the present invention is to utilize gravity to facilitate sealing of the SSR in its VAVD container.","Another objective of the present invention is to utilize the applied suction to facilitate sealing the SSR within its VAVD container.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a single plane to seal SSR in VAVD container.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a non-disposable VAVD container that supports at least \u2212100 mmHg.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a disposable cover\/holder as part of the SSR for the VAVD container.","Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a single venous bag that can be used with either standard or with VAVD thus, reducing cost of inventory and simplifying the user's set up.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a disposable SSR incorporating a structure that facilitates sealing the bag within a non-disposable VAVD container, thus reducing cost.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a SSR incorporating means to prevent the SSR from pulling out of, or twisting within its holder.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a means to allow suction application to both SSR and cardiotomy independent of the height difference between the two.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a means to reduce the chance of gas pulled across the microporous membrane when suction is applied to the venous reservoir.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a VAVD housing having an ellipsoid cross section that can better support a large external force and streamlined to the shape of the SSR.","Another objective of the present invention is to provide a VAVD housing for SSR that does not require the user's hands to be placed within said housing when mounting said SSR in said housing","Other objectives, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent by reference to the following detailed description, but nonetheless illustrative, of the presently preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings therein.","Reference should now be made to the drawings wherein the same reference numerals are used throughout to designate the same or similar parts. It should be noted that the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, as shown in , is for descriptive purposes, and should not be taken as a limitation to the use of the devices described hereinafter. It should also be noted that the term soft shell reservoir, venous bag and bag are used interchangeably.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["123","1102","123","1103","1103","135","1104","1105","157","1107","172","1103","1114","1115","1104"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIGS. 2","i":["a","b","c","d ","e "],"b":["2","2","2","2","1819","1","2","2","3","3","2","4","2","1","8","5","5","1"]},"In one of the preferred embodiment, shown in , first inlet chamber  has a larger inside diameter than inlet tube  (e.g. 1.0\u2033 v. 0.5\u2033), said larger diameter serves to slow the velocity of the blood (e.g. \u00bc the inlet velocity), and thus allow more time for bubbles to rise to the top where they can be removed. Slowing the blood also reduces the tendency of the flowing blood to carry the bubbles, especially the smaller ones, by reducing the drag on the bubbles by the moving blood. Lower velocity also lowers the tendency of larger bubbles to break into smaller ones; larger bubbles have a higher buoyancy and less of a chance of crossing screen  into expandable chamber , and flowing out of the bag through outlet tube  shown in . With sufficient pressure across screen , the bubbles could cross into chamber  and travel to outlet  of the reservoir, a very undesirable outcome. To reduce that possibility, inlet chamber  is open at the bottom where debubbled blood can exit first inlet chamber  at . To improve flow conditions, the outlet of inlet tube , , is preferably centered with the centerline of chamber , as also shown in (cross-section \u2013\u2032 in ). Also shown is one preferred embodiment of structure  that centers inlet tube  within chamber  formed by screen . Connector , shown in and as a cross section taken of along line \u2013\u2032 shown in , lines up and connects inlet tube  to inlet chamber . Thus, in one preferred embodiment, connector  has a wheel cross-section with an internal circular structure connected via spokes to an external circular structure . The inside diameter of inside structure that allows interference fitting to the outside diameter of inlet tube  and the outside diameter of outside structure supports cylinder . The space between internal structure and outside structure maintained by spokes forms a fluid communication between inlet chamber  and expandable chamber  as indicated by the downward facing arrow at the bottom of . It should also be obvious that since screen  may be flimsy, it may need radial support, as for example internal cage , see (cross section \u2013\u2032 in ) and . Screen  can be attached to cage  by various means (e.g. insert molding) longitudinally and radially to or and longitudinally to ribs , for example, by adhesive. This would maximize the ID of first internal chamber  to provide a smooth and straight vertical flow path thereby facilitating the upward motion of the bubbles.","With this design, as is the case for present venous reservoir bags (e.g. Bentley, Cobe, Sarns\/3M, Minntech) most of the incoming blood would exit via screen  across which very few bubbles, if any, cross. However, present venous reservoir bags are made of four layers: the two outside layers being flexible PVC sheets and the two inside layers being a screen (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,734,269). The screen is usually folded over with the fold being in the center of the venous reservoir bag and its edges sandwiched and sealed along at least two of edges of the two PVC outer layers. This design is simple but it provides no means to keep the internal surface of the external PVC walls from contacting the external wall of the screen. This contact reduces the effective screen area available for blood flow, especially at low blood volumes, causing further problems because more bubbles cross the screen at lower blood volumes. For example, tests conducted with the Cobe venous reservoir bag (Model # VRB, Cobe Lakewood, Colo.) showed that at a blood flow of 4.0 L\/min and an air flow of 750 mL\/min, the bubble count (size >50\u03bc) with a blood volume of 750 ml in the bag was 35 bubbles\/sec as compared to 94 bubbles\/sec when the blood volume was 500 ml. The Baxter venous reservoir bag (Model # BMR-1900, Baxter\/Bentley Irvine, Calif.) had similar results: the bubble count increased from 69 bubbles\/sec to 160 bubbles\/sec when the blood volume decreased from 750 to 500 ml.","The present invention eliminates the problem of screen to wall contact by introducing means to maintain the wall of the venous reservoir bag away from the screen as well as to maintain a vertical column of blood within first inlet chamber . This can be achieved by either incorporating the means into the disposable bag, or by interfacing a disposable bag with a nondisposable holder, the combination providing the aforementioned means. illustrates one preferred embodiment of the disposable type. Here, a semi rigid cylinder  with perforated wall is placed over screen  forming second inlet chamber  in fluid communication with expandable chamber  via said perforations as well as its open bottom at . The perforations can be effectively formed by using a tubular net with, for example 0.030\u2033 to 0.100\u2033 diameter strands forming a diamond shaped opening, see  in , and can be obtained from Nalle Plastics Inc. Austin, Tex. The tubular net can be made of polypropylene, polyester, Nylon, or polyethylene. It must possess at least three properties: 1) sufficient stiffness (either by rigidity of the material or thickness of the yarn) and structure to keep walls  and  (, , ) of venous reservoir bag  () away from screen  thereby maintaining chamber ; 2) an opening to allow unhindered fluid communication between chamber  and expandable chamber ; and 3) cause no undesired interaction with biological fluids. Tubular net  preferably extends vertically from the bottom of venous reservoir  at its inlet to the top of said reservoir and can be attached to the external wall of air-venting tube  for support. The inlet to cylinder , , may extend below screen  providing free fluid communication between inlet  and expandable chamber . With this design, experiments similar to those described for the Cobe and Baxter bags result in a steady bubble count of 60 at bag volumes of 500 and 1000 ml.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":["e ","b. "],"b":["23","1","1","2","2","2","4","4","4"]},"As shown in , screen  extends to the top of venous reservoir  where it is sealed to gas venting tube . This seal prevents blood from exiting at the top where it may drag bubbles out of inlet chamber  into expandable chamber . Should gas volume increase at tube  and displace blood volume at the top of chamber , the gas could cross screen  and enter chamber  and chamber . Because screen wall  may get wet again before all the gas at the top of chamber  is removed, that gas can be trapped. Purge tube  (see and ) is provided to allow gas to be purged from chambers  and . For that purpose, the topmost entry point of tube  into chamber  is the highest point in chamber  (e.g. point is higher than point ). Tube  extends from air-venting tube  into chamber , said extension preferably having holes in its wall to provide better fluid communication with chamber  along the entire length of tube . Holes allows air to enter tube  and be evacuated as described before. Other holes may be punched into tube  to allow air to be evacuated at any blood level. The smaller diameter of tube  and the location of its outlet at the top of venting tube  reduces the chance of blood flowing (with bubbles) from chamber  to chamber  via tube . The extension of tube  into chamber  also forms two channels, shown as in  cc, for air to travel along the tube upwards because the tube prohibits the opposite walls of the bag from making complete contact.

As well known in the art, tube  can alternatively be sealed directly into chamber  and external to tube . As shown, tube  is exposed to the same suction applied to air-venting tube .","With the present invention because, air moves freely to the top of bag  where it can be purged easily. It therefore should be obvious that the degree of suction applied and the blood volume removed in order to purge the gas should be significantly lower than with present devices. The smaller blood volume removed, the lower flow required to remove the gas and the larger ID of the purge line all contribute to significantly lower blood damage. This is especially true when stopcocks, which have a very small ID (e.g., 0.062\u2033 and sometimes less) and are used with present devices, are eliminated.","The user may not easily determine the presence of bubbles or the blood level in first inlet chamber  due to the opacity of the blood and\/or screen . Yet another innovation provides means to easily ascertain the presence of bubbles by increasing the ID of air-venting tube  to at least \u00bc\u2033 but preferably \u215c\u2033 or greater. Other venous reservoir bags have gas ports of \u215b\u2033 ID or smaller, which presents a high resistance to gas and blood flow. The increased port diameter of the present invention increases the ease by which bubbles rise up tube  for two reasons. First, gas bubbles move up easier in a liquid filled tube having a diameter larger than the diameter of the bubbles. Second, a larger diameter tube accommodates larger bubbles with greater buoyancy, providing greater upward force on the bubbles relative to the capillary force within a liquid filled tube that inhibits their movement. Thus, by having an exhaust tube with a larger diameter, the user could pull blood up into tube . Should air enter first inlet chamber , it would travel up and replace the blood in tube  causing the visible blood level (see ) in tube  to drop, an indication that air entered the venous reservoir and must be removed. It should be understood that the process can be automated by incorporating level detector  radial to tube , said detector  connected to a suction controller and\/or alarm monitor via transmitter line ","As shown, detector  provides means to detect the presence of air. Monitor\/controller  provides means to alarm the user to air entering tube  and\/or start a suction means that applies the required suction to outlet of tube , to remove said air and raise the liquid level. Once the level detector detects the rising liquid (i.e. the absence of air), it stops the alarm and\/or stops the suction used to remove the gas from the venous reservoir. Stopping air removal when the blood reaches the level of detector  assures that air but not blood is withdrawn from tube . Monitor\/controller  can, for example, control suction means , a roller pump, or valve means , via interconnecting means or respectively. When roller pump is used as the suction means to removes the air from tube  via tube , and then the suction is controlled by controlling the speed of the pump. Alternatively, suction means can be wall suction (with or without a vacuum regulator). Here, the vacuum required to remove the air from tube  is controlled by control unit  actuating valve means  via interconnecting means . The valve can open or close tube  interconnecting outlet of tube  to suction means  by actuating valve means  that can for example, be a solenoid actuated tubing clamp that opens (unclamps) and closes (clamps) tube . Also, as described in reference to one way valve  in reference to , preferably one-way valve , placed just below outlet of tube , prevents air from entering the reservoir if the reservoir empties and is exposed to the suction generated by arterial pump . Though blood loss in liquid form is prevented from exiting outlet of tube , blood in the form of foam may still do so. To limit blood foam from exiting the top of tube , a defoamer means is used to collapse the blood foam into liquid that then flows back down into blood chamber . This is illustrated in by defoamer sponge , preferably incorporating anti-foam A and placed below valve , used to break up blood in the form of foam that reaches the inlet of valve . Placement of defoamer  at the top of tube  provides the desirable defoaming action while limiting contact between the defoamer and the blood.","As shown in the large diameter of chamber  allows more time for the bubbles to rise to the top and causes less turbulence that could hinder the upward motion of the bubbles. Most of the blood preferably flows from chamber  to chamber  across screen , thereby assuring the upward motion of the bubbles. This preference is enhanced by cylinder  maintaining screen  free of contact with venous reservoir walls  and , see . Typically, if wall screen  forms a cylinder with a 1\u2033 diameter, then for an 8\u2033 high structure, its surface area is 25 in. This large effective area is available for blood flowing from inlet chamber  to expandable chamber  and is virtually independent of the blood volume in expandable chamber . Annular space  formed by cylinder  and screen  and better seen in , serves to separate gas from the blood; bubbles that cross wall  can still be buoyed upward to the top of chamber  where they can be removed by tube . The blood then flows from expandable chamber  to outlet port . Should air enter chamber , it can still float to the top of said chamber and be eliminated via tube .  cc, which is an enlargement of the circled section shown in , illustrates how tube  forms air channels , described in reference to and , thereby enhancing air removal by keeping walls  and  slightly apart along the length of tube . Thus with this design, there are three chambers for air elimination: chambers , , and .","A major reason a collapsible bag is used as a venous reservoir is to prevent air from being pumped out of the bag and into the patient should the venous reservoir empty. In present bags this is achieved by having the outlet port ( in ) at the lowermost point of the bag. This can be incorporated into the present invention. Alternatively, the inlet of outlet tube , , can be cut on a diagonal (nominal 35\u00b0 to 65\u00b0) with its pointed end protruding into expandable chamber  and its low point in line with the periphery of the bag at , as shown in . Tube  should be made of relatively soft material (e.g. 55 Shore A) and have a relatively large ID\/wall ratio (e.g. 0.5\u2033\/0.062\u2033=8). Since a larger ID\/wall ratio, as well as softer durometer wall, requires a lower pressure difference across the wall of the tube to collapse the tube, then the combination of higher ratio and lower durometer can be used to quantify the ease of said collapse, (ID\/wall)\/durometer. Thus, for the above example, (0.5\u2033\/0.062\u2033)\/(55)=0.147. This number is significantly higher than that obtained for the outlet tube typically used at the outlet of present venous reservoirs (0.5\u2033\/0.093\u2033)\/(65)=0.082. Since the ease of tube collapse is related to (ID\/wall), (see my U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,450: Innovative Pumping System for Peristaltic Pumps), even a small change in that ratio causes a large change in ease of collapse. Thus, the softer tubing and\/or high ID\/wall ratio allows collapsing walls  and  of venous reservoir bag  to gradually, rather than suddenly, impede the flow out of outlet tube . Once empty of liquids, the present aspect of the invention provides a looser seal about the outlet as compared to standard bags. Thus, when inlet flow resumes, less volume is needed to open the outlet tube, thereby providing resumption of flow sooner than present venous reservoir bags.","An experiment was conducted to determine the negative pressure developed between the outlet of venous reservoir  and the inlet of pump  when pump  (see ) was pumping at 6.0 L\/min out of venous reservoir  and the venous flow into the venous reservoir was less than 6.0 L\/min. The reservoir was emptied and its outlet collapsed. Also measured was the blood volume required in the venous reservoir to reopen the venous reservoir outlet. Once emptied, the outlet of the Cobe reservoir bag stayed closed until the volume in the bag increased to over 1,400 ml. During that time, the pump inlet pressure (measured in line  in ) decreased to and remained at over \u2212600 mmHg. Once the blood volume in the bag reached 1,400 ml, sufficient pressure was exerted to expand walls and release the collapsed outlet of the venous reservoir, thereby allowing resumption of blood flow from the venous reservoir to the pump inlet. A similar experiment with the Baxter bag required an increase in blood volume of 400 ml before the high negative pressure at the pump inlet (\u2212580 mmHg) was relieved and the bag outlet opened up. With the present invention, only 350 ml were required to open the venous reservoir outlet and reestablish flow, and the maximum negative pressure was only \u2212400 mmHg.","As shown in , , , , layers  and  are heat sealed (e.g., by radio frequency welding) by a double margin along their upper and lower edges, by a relatively wide seal along their right edge and by a narrower seal along their left edge. Anchoring holes (eyelets) , used to hang bag , can be formed by punching holes through, and along, the top and bottom of the heat sealed surface. The preferred configuration includes a hole on both sides of inlet tube , outlet tube , and air-venting tube , and in the upper corner of the bag opposite tube  to facilitate secure attachment of the bag to the frame, see ","It should be understood that various sizes of the venous reservoir can be made without necessarily affecting their performance; for example, three popular sizes having capacities of 400, 1200, and 2000 ml are some of the possibilities. To simplify manufacturing and reduce costs of the hardware, all reservoir sizes can have the same footprint so each size can utilize the same frame. Here, smaller capacity reservoirs have a smaller bag portion and larger peripheral area (). Anchoring holes , , , , , , and used to attach each bag to the frame can be accommodated by corresponding adjustable supporting pins in the frame, for example, as well known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0115"},"figref":["FIGS. 7","FIG. 2","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 2"],"i":["a","b","c ","a","a","b ","a","c ","a","d","d","b","b ","c ","a","a ","a.

This arrangement works but requires constant vigilance and intervention by the user to control air removal. Another innovative feature of the present invention is that air can be automatically eliminated from the reservoir with little or no user intervention required. Three preferable designs for the air purge port use a hydrophobic membrane, a floating ball, or controlled suction. All three methods allow air to be removed with very little, or no blood loss. The user would have the option to connect wall suction or one of the sucker pumps as the suction source for the air purge port, preferably having some regulating means to adjust\/limit the degree of suction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["45","425","425","44","425","45"],"i":["a","a "]},"The membrane is used to automatically remove air  that may accumulate at the top of the venous reservoir by applying suction (from the hospital supply) to air-venting tube . Hydrophobic microporous membrane  prevents the loss of blood  from the venous reservoir. Thus the combination of the hydrophobic membrane and suction applied to the external side of the membrane provides means to automatically remove the air from the blood chamber without blood loss.","Another preferred embodiment, shown in and , utilizes a tubular microporous membrane  in fluid communication with purge port , said tubular membrane internally supported and sealed to perforated rigid housing . Perforated rigid housing  allows gas to cross membrane  and enter chamber  unimpeded. Housing  is sealed at the bottom along . Chamber , formed by housing , is in fluid communication with purge port . Annular space  is formed by circular membrane  and air-venting tube . Air-venting tube  could be in fluid communication with first inlet chamber  shown in and preferably located on top of chamber . Normally annular space  is filled with blood. Should air  enter line  (see ), it would rise up chamber , as shown in , enter annular space  (and ), across membrane  into chamber  (), across port of one-way valve , and be purged via purge port . Applying suction to purge port  facilitates air removal by increasing the pressure difference across membrane . As with the \u201croof\u201d design referenced in , vertical placement of the tubular membrane  facilitates \u201cpeeling\u201d of the blood layer off of the surface of the membrane, thereby improving long-term gas transfer.","The second preferred method to automatically remove air utilizes a floating ball, which allows air but not blood to be removed through the purge port. As shown in , housing forms chamber  that allows air bubbles to rise unhindered as previously described for chamber  and tube  in reference to . Housing incorporates ball cage , floating ball  and unidirectional valve . Port of unidirectional valve  providing fluid communication between chamber  and gas exhaust port , is open as long as air  is present in chamber . When most of the air has been eliminated, the rising fluid level brings ball  to the top of chamber , effectively closing port . In this position, any further withdrawal of fluid from the venous reservoir is prevented. When more air enters the reservoir, the blood level falls, ball  drops, and the applied suction removes air . Suction may be provided by a wall source or a suction pump, but preferably is controlled for the purpose described below.","There are two forces maintaining ball  up against port keeping said port closed: the buoyancy of the ball and the suction force applied at the gas port (Fs). Fs=(\u03c0d2S\/4, where d is the inside diameter of air port in contact with ball , and S is the negative pressure (suction) applied via air-venting tube  against said ball. The upward force, Fs, must be less than the weight of the ball so that when the blood level drops, the weight of the ball overcomes Fs and the ball falls. Cage , in general has a larger ID than the OD of ball , see in and , where is a line drawing illustrating another view of the ball cage used in taken along line \u2013\u2032. Cage  aligns the ball with air port . The bottom of cage  narrows down to an ID smaller than the OD of ball , see and , where is a line drawing illustrating another view of the bottom of the ball cage used in taken along line \u2013\u2032. The smaller ID serves to retain ball  within its chamber  and prevents it from falling into the venous reservoir. For this design, for example, ball  may be a 1\u2033 solid polypropylene ball (specific gravity sp=0.90), or a hollow ball (where sp is adjustable). Air port seal could, for example, be made of soft silicone and the ID of the air port may be 1\/32\u2033. To assure a good seal, the surface of the ball should have a fine finish, preferably with a tolerance of 0.001\u2033 or better. The applied suction should be low to assure that ball  does not \u201cstick\u201d to gas port in the closed position, and to minimize blood damage. For example, a pressure of \u221230 mmHg can be applied to remove the air. This degree of suction is sufficient to withdraw the air and maintain the liquid column within first and second inlet chambers  and  when flexible chamber  is less than full, see . As shown, the suction means to remove the air is a regulated vacuum source. The automatic means to remove air with little or no blood loss is the ball opening to allow suction to remove air, and closing to prevent blood loss. This combination of ball valve and regulated suction is similar in function to that shown in reference to wherein the level sensor (here the floating ball) is the means to sense the presence of air and automatically control suction application. In one of the embodiments of , it is the tubing clamp opening the tube (and here the ball dropping) to apply vacuum to remove air and clamping off the tube (here the ball rising against the valve seat) to stop suction to prevent blood loss. To prevent excess suction (e.g. over \u2212150 mmHg) from being applied, the line between air venting tube  and the suction source can include a t-connector with a suction regulating valve  attached at the inlet of side port (). Such valves are commercially available at various cracking pressures and are currently used for IV infusion sets (e.g., NP Medical, Clinton, Mass., cost <$0.25). As well known in the art, blood trap (not shown) may be incorporated so any blood that may enter the line would not progress to the suction source, and, in fact, blood loss may be returned to the patient. This can also be achieved by connecting air-venting tube  at to Cardiotomy reservoir  (see ), to which suction is applied.","Another preferred method to remove air is a variation of the second method but without the floating ball valve combination. As shown in , the top of first inlet chamber  of venous reservoir  is extended into \u201cchimney\u201d  that serves to vent air and is connected to cardiotomy reservoir , to which suction is applied at . The degree of suction should be sufficient to elevate the blood level into chimney , even when the expandable chamber  is less than full. Thus, any air  entering inlet tube  would float to the top of first inlet chamber  and enter chimney . The air would then displace the liquid in chimney , coalesce with air volume that interfaces between the blood in chimney  and outlet of chimney , and the additional suction would pull the liquid up the chimney to its original level. This system requires that chimney  have an ID that facilitates upward movement of air bubbles, even large ones. The length of the chimney needs to be at least equal to the level of the expected level of liquid column  when suction is applied to chimney  and expandable chamber  is full. Beyond that height, the outlet of chimney can be connected via \u00bc\u2033 ID tube  to cardiotomy reservoir . Air space maintained below chimney outlet assures that the blood does not enter smaller diameter tube . Suction, applied at , can be provided by the wall source, or suction pump  () connected to cardiotomy reservoir , said suction regulated (e.g. by a vacuum regulator) to appropriate levels as well known in the art. It should be obvious that the suction applied to tube  equals that applied to the cardiotomy reservoir. Further, when regulated wall suction is used then the means to control the suction to automatically remove the air is vacuum regulator .","As described in the Description of the Prior Art, improved venous drainage can be achieved by applying some negative pressure on the venous blood. Another aspect of the invention allows the user to apply suction with a collapsible reservoir. , , and illustrate venous reservoir , previously described in reference to , , and , placed in generally elliptical, clear rigid, housing . Housing  is open both at its bottom, defined by border , and at its top, defined by border , said borders having sealing gaskets  and  respectively. , , and illustrate venous reservoir , previously described in reference to , , and , placed in generally elliptical, clear rigid, housing . Bottom cap  also is sealed to inlet tube  at and outlet tube  at . A similar arrangement is made at the top of venous reservoir  where rigid disk is sealed along top gasket  of housing . Thus, the user would slip chimney  of disposable venous reservoir  into the bottom of housing , push it up and insert it through opening at the top of housing . When lined up, rigid disk is pushed against gasket  and bottom cap  seals against gasket . The bottom and top seals are reinforced and maintained by cap  held against housing  by snaps , , and that lock onto ridge of cap . At the end of the case, snaps and, shown in , and snaps, and shown in , each of which is hinged at its midpoint (e.g. see of hinge ) are pushed inward, as shown by respective arrows  and  for snaps and , causing the bottom of said snaps (e.g. shown in ) to move outward, see for example \u2032 in , releasing said snaps from locking ridge and thereby allowing the removal of venous reservoir .","Chamber , formed between venous reservoir  and rigid housing , communicates via port with vacuum regulator , said regulator used to adjust the degree of suction applied to chamber  using knob . Gauge can be used to indicate the applied suction. As described before, venous reservoir  responds to pressure differences across its walls  and  (). Thus, diminished blood flow from patient , see , due to increased resistance to flow (e.g. smaller cannula) can be increased by applying suction to chamber . The suction \u201cpulls\u201d walls  and  outward thereby pulling the blood into the blood chamber. For safety, housing  is sized to assure that venous reservoir  cannot over-expand beyond defined limits, said limits defined as a volume in blood chamber  that would result in a pressure measured at the top of blood chamber  being greater than 10 mmHg. Thus, as chamber  of venous reservoir  expands, walls  and  move towards the walls of housing  until they make contact, see and in . Once contact is made, further outward motion of walls  and  is limited by rigid housing . To facilitate the use of the system, housing  incorporates pole clamp , said clamp provides a simple connection of said housing to a heart-lung machine. It should be understood that a rigid component, such as rigid cylinder , incorporating into venous reservoir , see and , is required to facilitate both the introduction of said venous reservoir  into housing , and the sealing of said reservoir against gasket , shown in . To enhance the ability of the user to see the blood in venous reservoir , light , shown in , can be added to the back of housing .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8","FIGS. 9","FIGS. 8","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIGS. 9"],"i":["a ","a ","e","f ","d ","b ","c","e ","e ","e ","e","c ","c ","a ","b","a ","a ","b","b ","b ","c","c ","c ","b","a ","a ","c ","c ","b","b ","b ","c","d ","d","a","b ","c.

Outlet end of inlet tube  is preferably sealed, forcing blood out exiting holes . Exit holes are preferably located only along the top length of tube  situated in inlet section that faces air removal section , see . Thus, venous blood, entering inlet tube  in a downward flow at inlet , is diverted from a downward flow to a more horizontal flow and then in an upward direction through exit holes . The diversion in flow occurs within inlet tube  distal to inlet . The upward blood flow pushes bubbles towards air removal section .

With the present SSR, as described in reference to  cc and and , channels are formed along the outside diameter of tubes , , and  providing a pathway for bubbles to move upward to air removal section and on to access holes of air removal tube . Air removal efficiency is further improved by extending tube , and preferably also infusion tube , from the top of blood chamber  downward into inlet section , at least 50% of the vertical distance between the top and the bottom of inlet section but preferably over 80% of the height inlet chamber . If no screen is used, then said extension downward from the top of blood chamber  is at least 50% of the height of blood chamber .","As shown in , air removal tube  preferably extends in a diagonal direction within blood chamber thereby providing a longer air removal channel than that possible with said tube extending only vertically.

In fact additional intermediate gas purge tubes (not shown), similar to tubes  and  may be incorporated in a similar manner to provide more numerous air removal channels.

Supporting plate  can serve to support bag  by dropping it into holder , as is done with prior art hard shell reservoir (e.g. Baxter holder p\/n HSRH for hard shell reservoir p\/n HSR4000). For this purpose, the perimeter of supporting plate  is preferably larger than the perimeter of venous reservoir .","Inlet of outlet tube  tube may also be designed to prevent pocket , shown in , from prematurely collapsing (i.e. while there is still blood in outlet chamber ) and uncollapsing once blood returns to outlet chamber . This is achieved by having the inlet of tube  cut longitudinal to form a scoop-shape whose walls provide the resilience to maintain the walls of bag  of section apart from each other. A similar design was described in reference the inlet of outlet tube  shown in ","Another advantage of having all the tubes for the SSR entering from its top is that the bottom of the bag is unhindered by tubing and can be placed lower on to the floor thereby allowing greater gravity drainage.","It should be obvious that other designs of SSR  shown in can be made without compromising the spirit of the present invention. For example, is a line drawing of the bottom part of another preferred embodiment of a SSR, SSR . is a line drawing of a cross section taken of along line \u2013\u2032. SSR  is identical to SSR  shown in and except its outlet section is shaped as a funnel and its outlet tube  enters said outlet section through back wall via an angled connection. Here, as for outlet of bag , outlet tube  exits outlet section at lowest point, pocket . The angled connection can be made utilizing, for example, a Halkey-Roberts semi rigid connector # 727AC (St. Petersburg, Fla.) RF welded to wall and then connecting outlet tube  to said connector. This design with an angle connector eliminates the need for outlet tube  to be bent, as is the case for the design of outlet tube  shown in . Though not illustrated, it is also possible to have outlet tube  contained within blood chamber  and exiting at the top of bag .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0142","num":"0141"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13","FIG. 13","FIGS. 13","FIG. 13"],"i":["e ","ee ","e ","a ","b ","a ","a ","a ","a ","aa","a ","a.

In one embodiment, cover  preferably has two protrusions along its perimeter, and , said protrusions forming a channel between accepting open perimeter of container . This combination lines up cover  and container , provides a better seal, and hinders cover  from sliding off container .","Rim along the open perimeter of housing  may incorporate sealing gasket  against which cover  can seal when vacuum is applied to chamber . When regulated vacuum is applied, via port  shown in , SSR  can be used to enhance venous drainage, as described in aforementioned VAVD. For VAVD, the cross section of container  is preferably ellipsoid, a shape that accommodates the general shape of SSR  and provides mechanical strength. It also serves to line up top of bag  with its supported bottom, as well as preventing cover  from rotating and thereby preventing the bag from twisting. Twisting along the vertical axis is also minimized by guides and extending from the bottom of container , accepting bag . Preferably, guides and support bag  via outlet tube , which is stiffer than pliable wall  and . Container  preferably should be made from crystal clear, rigid, scratch resistance, tough material such as polycarbonate that can withstand an internal pressure of at least \u2212250 mmHg. Since cover  is disposable, it can be made from less expensive material, such as polyvinyl chloride, and need not be clear or scratch resistance. Cover  required the physical strength to withstand the expected pressure differences across its wall when used for VAVD, preferably supporting a minimum internal pressure of \u2212200 mmHg. Structures such as ribs , shown in , can be used to reinforce cover . Reducing opening by extending shown in , to \u201cjust\u201d allow loading of venous reservoir, reduces the area of cover  that is exposed to vacuum and therefore reduces its required strength.","The top loaded SSR , compared to the bottom loaded design shown in , has significant advantages. SSR  can be easily placed in the housing with one hand. Once placed, it stays in the holder\/housing without clamps (e.g. and in ). With top loading\/support, the weight (gravity) of the blood in bag  pulls down cover  against seal  rather than pulling away, thereby using gravity, at least partially, to initiate a seal between cover  and container . Also, the support on top and the weight (blood volume) on the bottom tend to \u201cstraightens out\u201d bag . Top loading also provides a single flat plane to seal the bag and its associated tubing within housing . This feature is extremely important to assuring simplicity, reliability, and cost effectiveness. Making one of the walls of the housing a disposable rather than the entire housing as shown in  of PCT '16893, reduces costs significantly. Further reduction in costs is achieved by making the disposable wall, a wall with a small area (e.g. top or bottom wall). A smaller area requires lower force to support the same pressure difference and therefore allows use of thinner cover.","Top loaded SSR has two additional advantages. First, when placing venous reservoir  into its holder by hanging it by it supporting plate , blood in blood chamber  tends to settle at the bottom of blood chamber  lowering the center of gravity towards the bottom of the venous reservoir and far below, supporting plate . Thus, supported at its top and pulled down by weight of the blood, gravity is used to assist in maintaining the venous reservoir in a vertical position. Second, cover  responds to pressure differences across its wall in a useful manner. Thus, when suction is applied to chamber , cover  pulls tighter against seal ; the additional sealing force approximating the product of the area of  exposed to the vacuum applied and the level of vacuum. For example, for a cover 2\u2033 wide and 7.5\u2033 long, when a suction of \u221250 mmHg (\u22121 psi) the sealing force would be 15 lbs. Similarly, should the vacuum fail, and cover  was not secured to ridged housing , a build up of pressure within chamber  would provide a force to open cover  to relief pressure should it rise above atmospheric. Accidental pressure build up due to failed vacuum supply can also be achieved by introducing a small \u201cleak\u201d that prevents total sealing yet is small enough to allow suction in the operating room to overcome that leak and provide the desired regulated vacuum. Such a leak could for example be between 100 and 500 cc\/min.","It is obvious that the safety features described with respect to apply to bag  and housing  shown . For example, housing  is sized to assure that venous reservoir  cannot over-expand beyond defined limits, said limits defined as a volume in blood chamber  that would result in a pressure measured at the top of blood chamber  of +10 mmHg. Should blood chamber  of venous reservoir  expand, walls  and  would move outward until they make contact with the vertical walls of housing , as shown for walls and in . Once contact is made, further expansion of walls  and  is limited by the vertical walls of rigid housing .","For non-VAVD applications container  need not be sealed. For example, front wall of housing  shown in , can be minimized or eliminated to allow the user to reach bag  without removing the bag from the holder. This still provides a venous reservoir featuring easy top loading and connections of the inlet tube, outlet tube, and purge port to the extracorporeal circuit made by an end user from the top of the venous reservoir. Top connections are easier to make in the operating room than the side or bottom connections required with prior art soft shell venous reservoirs. It should also be obvious that bag  can incorporate additional tubing (e.g. for cardiotomy return) in a manner similar to that shown for inlet tube  and\/or outlet tube . The advantage of top loading being maintained as long as said additions allow top cover  to be used as shown. To simplify changing from a closed housing and open front wall housing, front wall of housing , can be designed as a removable wall as described in detail in reference to door  of housing  in and ","The aforementioned design of SSR incorporating a disposable supporting plate adds little cost compared to the added convenience and shorter set up time making it economical to use the bag for standard or VAVD procedures. This reduces cost of inventory and simplifies the user's set up and learning curve.","It should be emphasized that all the designs for sealing a venous reservoir having at least one flexible wall within a rigid housing for example, as described in reference to , , , , or , allow the introduction of a venous reservoir into a rigid container without compromising the sterility of the blood contacting surfaces of the venous reservoir. As well known in the art, the blood contacting surfaces of a venous reservoir consist of at least the inside walls of the blood chamber as well as that of the inlet, the outlet, and the air removal tubes. Thus, the present invention overcomes one of the major obstacles, though not mentioned as such in the description of the prior art, inherent in prior art SSR intended to be sealed within a housing, see aforementioned US Pat. '045 and PCT '08734.","Cover  may also incorporate tubing connectors , , , and , shown in , that facilitate assembly of bag tubing and eliminate the need for separate tubing connectors. Thus, inlet tube  is sealed (e.g. solvent bonded) to the bottom of inlet connector , said inlet connector providing fluid communication between itself and said inlet tubing. Similarly, outlet tube  is sealed to the bottom of outlet connector , said outlet connector forming fluid communication between itself and said outlet tubing. To further enhance the functionality of outlet connector , unidirectional valve may be placed within outlet connector . One-way valve  is a safety feature that prevents back flow from the arterial line,  shown in , should arterial pump  stop. Air removal tube  is sealed to the bottom of air removal connector , said connector forming fluid communication between itself and said air removal tubing. Like connector , air removal connector may incorporate unidirectional valve . This valve assures that air cannot enter the bag via connector . Lastly, infusion tube  is sealed (e.g. solvent bonded) to the bottom of infusion connector , said infusion connector forming fluid communication between itself and said infusion tubing. An additional advantage of incorporating rigid connectors into cover : they provide physical strength to the cover further preventing buckling under high vacuum.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0152"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13","FIGS. 13","FIG. 13"],"i":["f ","c ","a","a","a ","b","f","b","b ","b ","a ","b ","b ","a ","a ","a ","b","a "],"b":["1105","1105","1309","1105","1309","813","818","1391","1391","1390","1309","13","1308","1388","1391","1390","1105","1105","1390","1392","1393","1393","1390","1394","1390","1308","1388","1391","1394","1390","1392","1394","1390","1390","1392","1394","813","1105","1105","12","1391","1309","1309","1105","1309","1105","1309","1105"]},"Applying suction to the gas side of the oxygenator can reduce Otransfer rate because the partial pressure of O, pO, on the gas side is lowered by the percentage decrease in total pressure on the gas side. Thus, when suction of \u221250 mmHg is applied to the gas side, the total pressure is lowered by 50\/760 or 7% thereby nominally reducing the Oexchange by 7%. Considering that the percent Oused in the sweep gas is less than 100%, it is possible to compensate for decreased total pressure by increasing the % of Oin the sweep gas. To avoid reduction in Oexchange, it is desirable to apply suction to the gas side only when there is none or very low blood flow. Low blood flow can be indicated by low pressure on the blood side. To achieve this desirable result, suction applied to the gas side of the oxygenator is throttled with valve , said valve responding to pressure readings taken of arterial line  shown in . For example, when the pressure in line  falls below 100 mmHg (a pressure indicating low blood flow), a signal is sent to direct valve  to apply suction to gas exhaust line of oxygenator  shown in . It should be pointed out that the decrease in Oexchange due to suction application on the gas side (i.e. reduction in pO) is compensated by longer residence time of the blood (lower blood flow). Applying vacuum to the gas side has no adverse affect on COexchange.","The scope of the invention should not be limited to the aforementioned embodiments. The invention can be extended to other embodiments as illustrated with the venous reservoir having a single flexible wall assigned to Cordis Dow Corp and made by C.R. Bard (U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,190). Currently, there are no means to apply suction to the venous blood utilizing this Bard venous reservoir. With the present invention, applying suction to this design of a venous reservoir is simple. , a three dimensional view, , a cross sectional view of , and , a cross sectional view along lines and \u2032 shown in , all illustrate a modification of the venous reservoir component shown in FIG. 1 of Pat. '190. Blood enters venous reservoir  at inlet  into chamber , said chamber formed by rigid wall  and flexible wall , shown in a semi-full position. Wall  is also shown in an almost empty position as indicated by dashed line \u2032. Flexible wall is sealed to rigid wall  along periphery , said seal made by solvent bonding, RF welding, ultrasonic welding or other appropriate method. Air entering expandable blood chamber  is extracted via gas exhaust port . Gas exhaust port  may incorporate an automated gas removal means, as shown for example, utilizing a hydrophobic membrane as described in reference to . Blood exits via outlet tube . For augmented venous return, the present invention adds face plate  that seals the external surface of flexible wall  along periphery of face plate , forming sealed pressure chamber . The seal and seal therefore can sandwich the free ends of flexible wall  and can be made simultaneously. Gas port is in fluid communication with sealed pressure chamber , and is preferably connected to vacuum regulator  shown and previously described in reference to and . Faceplate , is preferably clear and rigid such as clear PVC, polycarbonate, polyethylene terephtalate (PET), polyethylene terephtalate glycol (PETG), polyester, or alike. Faceplate  does not have to be biocompatible because it does not contact blood. It should be clear that by incorporating sealing means between faceplate  and flexible wall , similar to those described in reference to , faceplate  could be made nondisposable. Whether disposable or not, faceplate  forming pressure chamber  allows the user to apply suction to chamber  via port , said suction transmitted to the blood via flexible wall  thereby providing augmented venous return.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0155"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 13"],"i":["b ","aa ","b ","a ","a","a"],"b":["108","1019","1019","108","108","108","1019","1019","1082","108","107","107","1019","108","108","108","1389","107","108"]},"It should be understood that a comprehensive description of each of the applications of the invention is beyond the scope of a patent application and therefore the aforementioned descriptions are given as illustrations and should not be used to limit the intent, spirit, or scope of the invention.
