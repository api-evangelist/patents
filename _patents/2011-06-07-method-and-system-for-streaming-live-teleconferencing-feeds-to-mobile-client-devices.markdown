Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to streaming live feeds. More particularly, the present invention relates to streaming live feeds to mobile client devices.","2. Background Art","Real time communication between multiple parties located in separate geographical locations can be easily accomplished through the use of teleconference systems. Participants may use a teleconference system at one location to generate and deliver telecommunication information, such as a live video feed, to teleconference systems at other locations. By using existing public networks such as the Internet, teleconference systems can be readily implemented without building an expensive proprietary network, allowing for cost effective real-time communication between distant participants.","Recent solutions for video teleconferencing include Cisco's \u201cTelepresence Recording Server\u201d, which allows participants to create and send high quality video feeds to other Cisco telecommunication servers. A related solution is Cisco's \u201cMedia Experience Engine (MXE) Series\u201d, which allows a live feed or recorded videos of a teleconferencing system to be streamed to local desktop computers.","However, currently available teleconferencing systems, including the above solutions, are unable to accommodate remote participants who are outside the vicinity of such system installations. Participants must be physically present in the vicinity of the teleconferencing system installation. However, situations often arise where the participation and feedback of a remote participant is desirable, for example a person that may be away on travel, in a meeting, at a remote client site, in a vehicle or on a flight, or in another location that is outside the range of the teleconferencing installation.","Accordingly, there is a need to overcome the drawbacks and deficiencies in the art by providing a method of streaming live video feeds, such as a live teleconference feed, to remote participants.","There are provided methods and systems for streaming a live teleconference feed to a mobile client device, substantially as shown in and\/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.","The present application is directed to a method and system for streaming low latency live teleconferencing feeds to a mobile device through a network. The following description contains specific information pertaining to the implementation of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be implemented in a manner different from that specifically discussed in the present application. Moreover, some of the specific details of the invention are not discussed in order not to obscure the invention. The specific details not described in the present application are within the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art. The drawings in the present application and their accompanying detailed description are directed to merely exemplary embodiments of the invention. To maintain brevity, other embodiments of the invention, which use the principles of the present invention, are not specifically described in the present application and are not specifically illustrated by the present drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","170","170","190","125","105","170","102","103","175","170","101","104","175"],"i":["a ","b","a ","a","b ","b. "]},"The conventional teleconferencing system of  allows users to participate in a conference wherever a teleconference subsystem is installed. Teleconference rooms and may be remotely located from each other. Accordingly, users  and  may participate in a conference using teleconference subsystem , and users  and  may participate in the same conference using teleconference subsystem . Teleconference system and may be implemented from any combination of teleconference hardware devices such as, for example, laptop computers, desktop computers, video cameras, web cameras, video projectors, microphones, voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephones, and conferencing software. Teleconference system and may exchange data through network , which may comprise a public network such as the Internet, a cellular network, or a proprietary network.","Remote user  may be traveling, attending an outside meeting, visiting a client site, or otherwise unable to attend teleconference room or in person. In many situations, it may be desirable to allow remote user  to participate in a conference. However, with conventional teleconferencing systems, participating users must be in physical proximity to a teleconferencing subsystem installation, such as teleconference subsystem or . Since conventional teleconferencing systems are designed as closed systems where only vendor specific solutions may interoperate, conference access may be denied to unsupported devices, such as mobile client device . Thus, unless remote user  travels to teleconference room or teleconference room , remote user  may be unable to participate in the conference. Remote user  and other remote users are thus unable to provide valuable conference feedback and participation.","Accordingly, turning to ,  presents a diagram of a system for streaming a live teleconference feed to a mobile client device, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Diagram  of  includes teleconferencing subsystem , video splitter , streaming apparatus , cloud network , data link  and , radio frequency network , desktop computer , portable computer , and mobile client device . Teleconferencing subsystem  includes live video feed  and display devices . Streaming apparatus  includes real time transcoding program , processor , and memory . With regards to , mobile client device  may correspond to mobile client device  of , and teleconferencing subsystem  may correspond to teleconferencing subsystem or of ","Live video feed  may comprise a video stream that is captured in real-time, such as an in-progress teleconference session. Conventionally, live video feed  may be directly connected to one or more of display devices  within teleconferencing subsystem . Display devices  may include one or more video projectors, standard definition televisions, LCD monitors, high definition televisions (HDTVs), CRT monitors, or other displays. Using a teleconferencing system similar to that as shown in , local conference participants using teleconferencing subsystem  may observe local and\/or remote conference participants live on display devices . However, as previously discussed, a remote user using mobile client device  may be unable to participate in the conference when conventional conferencing systems are utilized.","Accordingly, video splitter  and streaming apparatus  are introduced to create a video signal processing and distribution chain. Video splitter  may be equipped with one or more audio\/video interfaces including high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI), digital visual interface (DVI), video graphics array (VGA), S-video, and\/or component video. Video splitter  receives live video feed  in one of the above A\/V interfaces and provides a duplicated video signal concurrently to display devices  and to streaming apparatus .","Streaming apparatus  may comprise, for example, a server computer with video capture hardware. The video capture hardware of streaming apparatus  may include similar A\/V interfaces as video splitter . Streaming apparatus  may be managed through a web user interface (UI), extensible markup language (XML) application programming interface (API), command line interface (CLI), or other interfaces. Additionally, streaming apparatus  can be monitored using a web UI, XML API, simple network management protocol (SNMP), memcached based output, electronic mail (e-mail), CLI, or other monitoring solutions.","Streaming apparatus , using processor , may execute real time transcoding program  to encode live video feed  in real-time, which may then be further stored and\/or transmitted across cloud network  and\/or radio frequency network  to various client devices. As shown in , the transmission may occur over a combination of both cloud network  and radio frequency network . Streaming apparatus  may use, for example, the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or real time streaming protocol (RTSP) when publishing the transcoded live video feed . Real time transcoding program  may detect when a valid video signal is being received from video splitter  to begin a transmission session performing real-time video transcoding for storage or distribution, and may also detect an absence of a valid video signal to end the transmission session. Real time transcoding program  may also update a log including transmission session timestamps, video input and transcoding formats, client streaming session data and statistics, and other metadata for each transmission session.","During the transmission session, real time transcoding program  may convert live video feed  into an intermediate video stream in real time, which may comprise encoding to a specific video codec standard, audio codec standard, output resolution, frame rate, or another output specification. In some embodiments of the invention, real time transcoding program  may also record the intermediate video stream to local or network storage.","The intermediate stream and recorded video may be streamed and recorded using any appropriate file container such as a Smith Micro Proprietary Format, Flash Video (FLV), Windows Media Video (WMV), Third Generation Partnership Project file format (3GP), audio video interleave (AVI), and others. The recorded video may also be further transcoded into another output specification if necessary, for example transcoded into a lower quality stream to preserve storage space or network bandwidth.","For transcoding, the video codec standard may comprise H.264, H.263, Moving Pictures Expert Group 4 (MPEG-4), or another video codec. The audio codec standard may comprise advanced audio coding (AAC), adaptive multi-rate (AMR), MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 audio layer 3 (MP3), or another audio codec. Output resolution may comprise 1080 p, 720 p, 480 p, 360 p, or another resolution. Frame rate may comprise 60 frames per second (fps), 30 fps, 24 fps, 15 fps or another frame rate.","Streaming apparatus  may support streaming to multiple client devices comprising various hardware architectures, including mobile client device , desktop computer , and portable computer . Mobile device  may comprise any handheld device including a mobile phone, a smartphone, or a handheld videogame device. Desktop computer  may comprise, for example, a personal computer or a workstation. Portable computer  may comprise, for example, a laptop or a tablet PC.","For streaming to remote client devices such as mobile client device , desktop computer , and portable computer , streaming apparatus  may rely on various distribution networks including cloud network  and radio frequency network . Cloud network  may comprise, for example, a cluster of servers hosted on a public network such as the Internet. Radio frequency network  may comprise, for example, a private cellular network.","After receiving a stream request from a remote client, streaming apparatus  may generate a video stream tailored to the specific hardware configuration and network connection of the remote client. The request may be received, for example, from a web based user interface or a dedicated client side application. The network connectivity of the remote client device, including downlink speed, may be measured. To reduce latency, the stream request may be serviced from a specific server on cloud network  having the shortest ping time to the remote client device. Furthermore, the specific playback capabilities of the client device may be determined, which may include processor speed, hardware accelerated decoding capabilities, display resolution and refresh rate, color depth and color space, and other information. The playback capabilities may be extracted from metadata included in the stream request, for example.","Real time transcoding program  of streaming apparatus  may then transcode the intermediate video stream into a final video stream to respond to the stream request, wherein the final video stream has optimized video quality based on the playback capabilities of the client device while factoring in prevailing network conditions. For example, if a client device includes a display with a 720 P resolution and a 60 hertz refresh rate, then a 720 P\/60 FPS stream may be provided. However, if the network connectivity of the client device is insufficient to support a sufficient bitrate for acceptable encoding quality, the quality of the final video stream may be downgraded as necessary, for example by lowering resolution to 480 P or lowering framerate to 30 FPS.","Additionally, to support adaptive streaming, the encoding parameters of the final video stream may be dynamically modified during streaming to accommodate changes and fluctuations in client network connectivity. In this manner, adaptive streaming may improve the end user experience by reducing freezing, stuttering, and other audio\/video artifacts of the final video stream that may result from network buffer underruns.","After streaming apparatus  transcodes the intermediate video stream into a final video stream, streaming apparatus  may be ready to stream the final video stream to the requesting remote client device through cloud network , radio frequency network , and\/or another network. As shown in , the streaming may occur over a combination of both cloud network  and radio frequency network . Cloud network  may also include a secure cloud based network, for example to limit conference access to authorized clients only. If cloud network  includes a secure cloud based network, then streaming apparatus  may use an encrypted channel, such as HTTPS, to securely authenticate the credentials of a requesting client device and to transmit the final video data stream. Thus, mobile client device , desktop computer , portable computer , and other remote client devices may advantageously participate in a live conference, optionally in a secure manner, without being in local proximity to teleconferencing subsystem .","While only a single teleconferencing subsystem  is shown in , in alternative embodiments multiple conferencing subsystems may be supported. For example, a central streaming apparatus in cloud network  may receive intermediate video streams from streaming apparatuses of a plurality of teleconferencing subsystems. The central streaming apparatus may then process the intermediate video streams in real-time, for example by implementing a split screen or picture-in-picture display, thereby allowing remote client devices to observe multiple live conferences concurrently. Additionally, while only three remote client devices are shown, cloud network  may be scaled as necessary to support a large number of client devices concurrently, such as 500, 2500, or more client devices.","Furthermore, in some embodiments of the invention, streaming apparatus  or the central streaming apparatus may also receive participatory responses or feedback from remote client devices. For example, mobile client device  may include a microphone, a camera, a touchscreen or a tablet to allow user input in the form of audio, video, drawings or text. This user input may be transmitted as a separate stream or mixed with one or more of the intermediate video streams and distributed through cloud network , radio frequency network , and\/or other networks to other client devices. As shown in , user input may be transmitted over a combination of both cloud network  and radio frequency network . Additionally, in some embodiments, a supplementary client device may be added to conferencing subsystem  to receive and display the transmitted user input, allowing local conference participants to also observe reactions and feedback from remote users in real-time. The supplementary client device, not shown in , may be connected to one of the display devices .","As discussed above, the live video is supplied from a closed teleconference system. Further, an input may be received from the client device in response to the live video stream, where such input is integrated into the live video.","Moving to ,  shows a flowchart describing the steps, according to one embodiment of the present invention, by which a live teleconference feed may be streamed to a mobile client device. Certain details and features have been left out of flowchart  that are apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a step may comprise one or more substeps or may involve specialized equipment or materials, as known in the art. While steps  through  indicated in flowchart  are sufficient to describe one embodiment of the present invention, other embodiments of the invention may utilize steps different from those shown in flowchart .","Referring to step  of flowchart  in  and diagram  of , step  of flowchart  comprises processor  of streaming apparatus  executing real time transcoding program  to receive live video feed  from video splitter , wherein video splitter  is concurrently outputting live video feed  to at least one of display devices . As previously described, real time transcoding program  may detect the start of a valid video signal from video splitter , which corresponds to the start of step .","Referring to step  of flowchart  in  and diagram  of , step  of flowchart  comprises processor  converting, in real time, live video feed  received from step  into an intermediate video stream. As previously described, the intermediate video stream may be transcoded into various video codec standards and file containers. Optionally, the intermediate video stream may be stored locally or over a network.","Referring to step  of flowchart  and diagram  of , step  of flowchart  comprises processor  determining playback capabilities of a client device. For example, mobile client device  may send a stream request over cloud network  and\/or radio frequency network  to streaming apparatus  over a web-based or client side user interface, as previously described. In response, processor  may, for example, read client metadata included in the stream request to determine the playback capabilities of mobile client device . Furthermore, the network connectivity of mobile client device  may be tested and analyzed, for example by conducting a connection test to determine ping time and downlink speed.","Referring to step  of flowchart  and diagram  of , step  of flowchart  comprises processor  transcoding the intermediate video stream from step  into a final video stream based on the playback capabilities determined in step . In this manner, a final video stream with optimized video and audio quality for mobile client device  may be provided. Furthermore, as previously described, the transcoding may take into consideration the network connectivity of mobile client device  to deliver an optimized final video stream, for example by utilizing servers of a cloud network having lower ping times to reduce latency. In alternative embodiments of the invention, the playback capabilities of the client device may be ignored, in which case a default encoding profile may be used for transcoding in step , and step  may be skipped.","Referring to step  of flowchart  and diagram  of , step  of flowchart  comprises processor  streaming the final video stream from step  for output to a display of mobile client device . As discussed previously, cloud network , radio frequency network , and\/or another network may be utilized for streaming. Additionally, adaptive streaming may be utilized to accommodate changing network conditions. If cloud network  includes a secure cloud based network, then optional security features including client authentication and an encrypted transfer channel such as HTTPS may be provided.","Thus, the present invention enables remote users to advantageously participate in a conference even if the remote users are distant from teleconferencing subsystem . Moreover, user input from remote users may be received by streaming apparatus  and provided to other client devices and displays, providing a new feature of collaborative feedback from remote users. Accordingly, the present invention may greatly expand the range of locations from where participants may participate in a teleconference session.","Moreover, while the present invention has been illustrated using a conferencing system as an example, the present invention is also broadly applicable to any closed system that provides a live video feed, but does not directly support remote client devices. In this manner, various closed systems may be augmented with real-time remote client device streaming and remote user collaboration in a cost effective manner using commodity hardware. Cloud networks and distributed cloud based server networks may also be utilized to efficiently scale for any number of required concurrent clients. In this manner, vendor lock-in using high cost, limited functionality, and proprietary solutions can be advantageously avoided.","From the above description of the invention it is manifest that various techniques can be used for implementing the concepts of the present invention without departing from its scope. Moreover, while the invention has been described with specific reference to certain embodiments, a person of ordinary skills in the art would recognize that changes can be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention. As such, the described embodiments are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. It should also be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein, but is capable of many rearrangement, modifications, and substitutions without departing from the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art after reviewing the following detailed description and accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
