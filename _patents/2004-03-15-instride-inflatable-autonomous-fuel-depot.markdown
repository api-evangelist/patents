{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to a system using a lightweight expandable fuel container. More particularly, this invention relates to a cost effective fuel-replenishing system having expandable, inflatable bladders filled with petroleum products that are capable of being towed through water to remote places to supply fuel where needed.","Most modern navies are responsible for transporting personnel and their equipment over extended supply lines to distant objectives ashore. Because of the distances involved, refueling of ships and other craft often is required during transit.","One well known method to assure sufficient refueling capability is to deploy one or more ships as dedicated tanker ships at designated re-fueling depots along the transit route to facilitate ship-to-ship refueling. Troop and supply laden ships and other craft in need of refueling pull alongside or behind each tanker ship at the refueling depots. The tanker ship and ships and craft then are anchored together with tethers and large floating bumpers, and fuel lines are passed from one craft to the other. Careful maneuvering on the part of all craft is necessary to keep the operation safe such that fuel lines and tethers do not break or that metal hulled craft do not bang into one another causing structural damage.","Aside from the fact that this refueling scenario is intensive to coordinate, is time consuming, and may be tactically dangerous, the ships and personnel that are dedicated to carrying the fuel supply can be dispersed to different depots for undue periods of time. As a consequence, they cannot be available to support other logistics missions that they were originally designed to perform. Another problem is that some of the craft being used as refueling tankers typically are not designed for such missions and have to be modified or fitted with kits to perform the function of being a tanker\/fuel depot. A further limitation of this scenario is that the tanker craft usually are expensive and irreplaceable assets that should not be put in harms way susceptible to enemy fire while acting simply as an at-sea fuel tank.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for an inexpensive, relatively disposable system and a method of covertly or clandestinely pre-positioning fuel that provides an autonomous refueling depot at the exact location it is needed to support advancing expeditionary forces, to free up other navy craft for other high value missions that they were originally designed to support.","An object of the invention is to provide a system and method for supplying fuel to ships and other craft advancing across the open ocean.","Another object of the invention is to provide system and method for refueling ocean going craft that can provide fuel at the exact location it is needed.","Another object of the invention is to provide a portable system and method for refueling ocean going craft that frees-up other navy craft for other high value missions that they were designed to support.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system and method for refueling having a lightweight, compact, expandable fuel container.","Another object of the invention is to provide system and method for refueling having a low cost expandable container to be filled with fuel and\/or deployed from inside or outside amphibious well-deck ships.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system and method for refueling having an expandable container and capability to autonomously pilot the fuel tank to a desired mid-transit location and an interrogation means to identify its location to intended users.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system and method for refueling having a buoyancy control system to properly orient the fuel tank and adjust buoyancy as fuel is being pumped in\/out, a means to pump fuel to users, and a means to stay on-station at a mid-transit location via anchor or pilot-less autonomous control system.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system and method for refueling having a means to seal each flexible fuel container from possible punctures and tears and to provide a level of self-repair ballistic resistance to projectiles and fragmentation hazards.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is to a fuel depot and method for autonomously and clandestinely providing fuel to transiting ships. An elongate streamlined flexible bladder member has flexible hull walls and divider walls separated by uniform spaces to form fuel compartments having a fuel valve and fuel pump. The bladder member can transit submerged to a remote destination. A fuel and water tight composition in and\/or along the spaces prevent fuel and water leaks to ambient water and between the compartments. A submersible propulsion system has propulsive machinery and steering gear for towing the bladder member. A command\/control system on the submersible propulsion system generates and couples driving signals for the propulsion system to tow and steer the bladder member to the remote destination using the preprogrammed computer, inertial navigation system (INS), global positioning system (GPS), and RF transceiver of the command\/control system.","Referring to , an inflatable, autonomous fuel depot  of the invention is depicted at the surface  of a body of water  such as the ocean. Fuel depot  can be deployed in an in-stride mode to replenish ships and other ocean-going craft  proceeding underway during transit between staging areas and distant objectives, or fuel depot  can be anchored as a fixed station moored along or near the transit-way by at least one anchor  dropped from an anchor bay . This flexibility allows fuel depot  to supply liquid fuel  and\/or other fluids where needed to support successful passage.","In-stride autonomous fuel depot  has a flexible, bag-like, inflatable bladder member  for holding thousands of gallons of fuel . Because bladder member  flexible, it takes up little space when it is deflated. Consequently, prior to deployment several bladder members  can be stowed flat or rolled-up on deck, in holds, or in warehouses and not take up large amounts of space, see also . Bladder member  is connected to towing lines  via pad eyes  and has a streamlined, elongate shape pointed fore and aft to reduce hydrodynamic drag as it is towed through water . When inflated (fuel-filled) or deflated (empty), bladder member  can be made to have buoyancy in water  that permits submerged transit to allow clandestine deployment. Inflatable bladder member  of fuel depot  can be towed to a predetermined location by a propulsion system  connected to towing lines . A combination radio-controlled\/autonomous command\/control system  in propulsion system  assures controllable steering of fuel depot  to a selected location. At or on the way to the designated location, an interrogation system  on fuel depot  can transmit signals to reveal its location to users to expedite in-site refueling.","Inflatable bladder member  can have an outer flexible hull wall  and an inner flexible hull wall  and flexible divider walls  and  that extend across bladder member  and divide it into separate fuel compartments . Each of compartments  can be filled with the same type or a different composition of fuel  as desired.","Referring also to , walls , ,  and  can be made of one or more layers of strong and flexible natural or man-made material and\/or fabric, such as for example, the high tensile strength, flexible, and abrasion resistant material marketed under the trademark KEVLAR by DuPont Inc, 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Del. 19898. A multitude of spaced-apart threads or flexible links  have their opposite ends connected to hull walls  and  and divider walls  and  to create spaces  between them. Spaces  virtually uniformly separate outer and inner hull walls  and  and divider walls  and  when pressurized gas or other pressurized fluid  is fed by one or more valves  into spaces . This distends spaces  and allows compartments  to extend to their flexible limits. Flexible walls , , , and  having threads\/links  can be assembled to create joined-together spaces  forming a common spatial separation  among walls. Optionally, flexible walls , , , and  can be made to have flexible end divider portions  to isolate spaces  that are separated from one another.","Pressurized gas  in spaces  helps shape bladder member  into a streamlined, elongate form having oppositely tapered ends that reduce hydrodynamic drag as bladder member  is towed through water . When filled with JP5 or other military fuel, bladder member  can become slightly positively buoyant as the specific gravity of fuels  such as diesel, JP4 or JP5 jet fuels is slightly less than that of seawater  (0.8 vice 1.03 for seawater ). Gas valves  can vent gas  from spaces  of separation  to allow their complete deflation along with bladder member  when fuel  has been pumped from compartments  by pumps .","A fuel port\/valve  at the top of each compartment  is connected to a fuel pump  immersed in fuel  inside each compartment . Fuel port\/valves  and fuel pumps  receive fuel  while compartments  of bladder member  are being filled at a tanker ship, for example. Fuel port valves  and fuel pumps  also pass fuel  from compartments  when refueling ships and craft  via hoses and fittings connected to port\/valves . Fuel port\/valves  have openings for venting air from compartments  to allow complete filling of compartments  without any air spaces and complete deflation of compartments  when fuel  has been pumped from them by pumps .","Referring also to , flexible hull walls  and , and flexible divider walls  and  are tailored to give bladder member  a cross-sectional shape having a flattened bottom A that helps hold each fuel port\/valve  above each compartment  and above water . Several tensioner-straps  can be connected at opposite ends to the top and bottom parts of inner flexible wall  to extend across compartments  and help hold bottom A in its flattened shape. Negative ballast  also can be added at bottom A of compartments  to help maintain the upright orientation for water-free delivery of fuel  through fuel port\/valves .","A ballasting valve  and small compressed air tank  can be located on bladder member  at the bottom of each compartment . Valves  and tanks  are connected by a control lead A to command\/control system  to selectively control the buoyancy and ballast of bladder member . Positive buoyancy or negative ballasting of compartments  is done by venting some of ambient seawater  and\/or pressurized air from tanks  in or out of compartments  by valves . The vented seawater can be blown out by pressurized air from tanks .","Since some ambient seawater  can be brought into compartments  to add ballast to them, bladder member  of fuel depot  can sink or submerge to a level that is at and below surface  of water  and be virtually visibly undetectable when bladder member  is filled or deflated. This buoyancy\/ballasting capability of valves  and air tanks  in compartments  gives fuel depot  a buoyancy control option that can make it more clandestine.","Because fuel  is lighter than seawater , mixing of the liquids can be minimal when compartments  are at least partially filled with fuel . However, a flexible septum B can be included in each compartment  that extends over each valve  and air tank  to form a flexible ballasting chamber C that keeps fuel  and vented seawater separated when fuel  is contained in compartments , see . Visible detection of the appropriately ballasted and buoyant bladder member , submerged propulsion system , command\/control system  and interrogation system  is therefore virtually not possible from any appreciable distance. Upward protruding antennas to be described can be of such small dimensions as to be unnoticeable.","The clandestine, submerged condition of bladder member  can be reversed by venting air from tanks  to push out vented seawater  from compartments  through valves . Fuel pumps  also can be actuated to draw-in ambient air through fuel valves  to raise bladder member  to and above surface . These actuations of tanks , valves , fuel pumps , and valves  can be initiated in accordance with preprogrammed instructions in computer , remote RF control signals , GPS coordinate signals and\/or location sensing by INS , as discussed below.","Each bladder member  can be constructed from a plethora of other materials than mentioned above and by many different techniques currently commercially available. Irrespective of the chosen materials and techniques, bladder member  is made to be flexibly inflatable and capable of securely containing large volumes of fuel , particularly when more than one is connected in-line or side-by-side. For example, a proven method of sealed construction of flexible fabric walls is illustrated by the tensioned stitched fabric sealing method pioneered by Zodiac International. Such sealed fabric construction techniques are shown by way of example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,074,261 wherein an inflatable pneumatic enclosure has a constrained geometric shape comprising two main walls, held relative to each other in an inflated state by a multiplicity of flexible links interposed between the walls and having an inflation valve fixed in at least one of the walls for inflating the enclosure. A wide variety of fabrics can be chosen and then sealed using the construction and fabric sealing techniques pioneered by Zodiac Inflatable Surface Craft. Another method to construct bladder member  can utilize the technology relied upon to make the foldable fluid storage units and the ocean-towable bladders known as Sea Slugs produced by CANFLEX USA, Inc. P. O. Box 1014, 412 Thirtieth Street, Anacortes, Wash. 98221.","Hull walls  and  and divider walls  and  can be made fuel and water-tight by impregnating or coating them with polymer, elastomer, or other compositions  that remain flexible after curing and are not soluble by either water  or fuel . Separating spaces  also could be filled with a viscous polymeric sealing gel-like composition  that is also fuel and water-tight and not soluble in water  or fuel . Optionally, sealing gel  could be impregnated in or coated on the surfaces of hull walls  and  and divider walls  and  adjacent to separating spaces . When a coating of sealing gel  is selected, it can be along the lines as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,035, and an appropriate polymeric sealing material can be layered on the fabric sandwich of bladder member  to automatically seal punctures that might occur during use. An exemplary puncture sealing formulation that could be used can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,295,525. Compositions  and  can seal punctures in hull walls  and  and divider walls  and  to prevent fuel leaks to ambient water  and fuel and water leaks between or to compartments  like well known fuel tank sealants have sealed fuel tanks in military aircraft. Compositions  and gel  can assure protection of the environment and reduce the chances of catastrophic failure that could occur if the contents of one compartment  become mixed with the contents of another compartment .","Propulsion system  of autonomous fuel depot  can be any one of many different surface and submerged propulsion units to tow fuel-filled bladder member  to a designated remote location and return it empty for refilling at a resupply staging area. Propulsion system  could be a jet-ski type personal watercraft riding on surface , or a submersible torpedo-like unit like the U.S. Navy's current remote mine hunting system (RMS) vehicle that is schematically depicted in . Suitable steering gear and propulsive machinery well known in the art, as well as sufficient on-board fuel would be included in the selected design of propulsion system  to tow bladder member  to its intended destination. Propulsion system  can be made to have a relatively low, wide profile for stability and desirable stealth characteristics and is coupled to tow lines  extending to pad eyes  at the front of bladder member . The towing arrangement of propulsion system  and bladder member  has hydrodynamic efficiency when traveling through the water  to allow for greater ranges and higher speeds of transit when bladder member  is either inflated or un-inflated.","A combination radio\/autonomous command-control system  on propulsion system  of fuel depot  provides an autonomous deployment and recovery capability that enables fuel depot  to transit to predetermined locations or actively change its destination and location en route for refueling in light of changing tactical situations. Command\/control system  can have a preprogrammed computer , an inertial navigation system (INS) , a global positioning system (GPS)  and\/or RF transceiver  that individually or in combination can be used to generate driving signals (shown as arrow ) for propulsion system  that steer fuel depot  to the location of an intended fueling rendezvous.","A wide variety of subsystems A of propulsion system  are responsive to signals such as driving signals  and have been around for years to effect responsive and desired changes in an interconnected system such as propulsion system . Typical subsystems A are off-the-shelf units used for radio-controlled model aircraft and ships and other radio-controlled devices. These subsystems A can be a part of propulsion system  and may include appropriate sets of servo-mechanisms and power supplies that can be connected to throttles and steering linkages of motor connected jet and\/or propeller drives. The servo's can be controlled via interconnected logic circuits and\/or software\/firmware control that are linked to receive driving signals  that cause the servo's to displace the linkages to change speed and\/or turn propulsion system  to the left or the right, and fuel depot  is steered onward.","A suitable design and appropriate programs and instructions for computer  of command\/control system  to provide the necessary driving signals  for propulsion system  to power and maneuver fuel depot  are well known and can be readily be selected and tailored by one of ordinary skill in the art. An appropriate INS  of command\/control system  can be selected from many known, available units and appropriately interfaced with propulsion system  by a routineer to create and couple the necessary driving signals  for propulsion system  for responsively steering fuel depot  to the intended fueling rendezvous. One skilled in the art would also select an appropriate off the shelf unit for GPS  of command\/control system  that is responsive to GPS coordinate signals  from NAVSTAR satellites  to provide the necessary driving signals  that cause propulsion system  to take fuel depot  to intended destinations. RF transceiver  of command-control system  is responsive to RF control signals (shown as arrow ) from a remote station . RF control signals  might be coupled from RF transceiver  to computer  to generate driving signals  that change course heading or speed and\/or be used to stop progress, recall, or bring fuel depot  to an updated destination where it safe and\/or needed.","A combination RF\/GPS antenna  is mounted on propulsion system  to extend above surface  of water  and is connected to command-control system . RF\/GPS antenna  receives impinging GPS coordinate signals  and RF control signals  and respectively connects them to GPS receiver A of GPS  and RF transceiver  to initiate responsive driving signals . Either of signals  or  can be coded to covertly control the progress of fuel depot  to a specific location or to initiate a real-time change as a situation changes.","Progression of fuel depot  to a fueling rendezvous can rely on driving signals  generated by GPS . Driving signals  are created in system  via appropriate power supply, logic control and servos that are linked to an impeller steerage unit A of propulsion system . Prior to deployment of fuel depot  destination GPS coordinates can be programmed into the logic unit of GPS  via keypad entry or later during transit via RF control signal . As fuel depot  proceeds forward, GPS  continually receives GPS location information signals  through antenna  from NAVSTAR Satellite System  and continually calculates its own position relative to the desired location. Responsive driving signals  control appropriate servos in propulsion system  to steer the fuel depot  either right or left in order to reach the desired rendezvous location. At any time during transit, RF control signals  can initiate generation of responsive driving signals  via RF transceiver  and command\/control system  to updated information regarding an intended destination.","Interrogation system  has an identification friend or foe (IFF) unit  and antenna A that can be incorporated on propulsion system  (or on inflatable bladder member ) and are connected to RF transceiver , a suitable IR transceiver  and\/or a laser transceiver . IFF unit  is coupled to command\/control system  via lead B and can be a responder responsive to receive or emit electromagnetic energy (shown as arrows  or  respectively) at radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), or other shorter wavelengths like those commonly emitted by laser devices. Remote interrogating transceiver sources  on ships and craft  that are seeking the exact location of fuel depot  for refueling purposes, for example, can transmit coded interrogating energy  over a relatively wide area of the ocean region. When IFF unit  receives coded (or uncoded) interrogating energy  from ship  it can respond or reply by transmitting RF, IR, or laser emissions of coded electromagnetic energy  to reveal more precisely the location of fuel depot . Reciprocally, IFF unit  could send coded interrogating signals  from where fuel depot  is located along the transit route that indicate location, and the friendly ships  having remote sources  could home in on the location of the transmissions or translate the coded signals of energy  to find the otherwise hidden location of fuel depot . Both IFF unit  and distant interrogating sources  are appropriately tuned to be responsive to the RF, IR, and laser emissions and are well known in the art. Both IFF unit and remote source  can operate for periods of time in passive modes waiting to receive coded friendly electromagnetic signals  or . Optionally, a coded RF control signal (shown as arrow A) could be transmitted from RF transceiver  in a Chirp signal form to fuel depot  to cause it to respond and reveal its GPS location to ships  of friendly forces via signals . Another method would be to allow friendly forces of sources  to interrogate in the general area of a rendezvous point and have fuel depot  respond with a flashing strobe  on antenna . RF control signals , A for RF transceiver  can be very high frequency signals or higher and of limited transmitted power to limit the range of transmission to avoid unnecessary dissemination of the transmitted information. All transmitted signals including signals  and  also can be transmitted at controlled levels of power to avoid unwanted interception.","Another option of fuel depot system  is to include an acoustic transceiver  on propulsion system  (or bladder member ). This capability can provide bidirectional acoustic communications links with distant acoustic stations using ambient seawater  as the transmitting path for information instead of radiating electromagnetic signals through the air as described above.","In operation, fuel depot  of the invention can be transported from a rear area into a theater of operations by conventional cargo ships and aircraft. Bladder member  is shipped and stored as a rolled or folded together package  to take up minimal space as shown in . Then, bladder member  is unfolded on a beach or in water  and connected to propulsion system  at a safe distance away from an area of possible conflict. Appropriate driving signals  generated by programming computer  in command\/control system  on propulsion system  initiate propulsion system  to tow fuel depot  and autonomously progress to a tanker ship. Preprogramming and instructions entered in computer  along with GPS signals, INS inputs or RF signals received by command\/communication system  cause propulsion system  to autonomously steer fuel depot to the side of a tanker ship or inside the well-deck of an amphibious ship. Compartments  of bladder member  are filled with fuel  and fuel depot  can autonomously proceed in accordance with predetermined instructions in command\/control system  to a remote designated location. Preprogramming and instructions entered in computer  along with GPS signals, INS inputs, RF signals, and\/or acoustic signals received by command\/communication system  along the way can autonomously steer fuel depot  to the distant objective destination by propulsion system . Anytime along the way different destinations, different transit speeds, different times of arrival, etc. can be initiated from remote station  and ships , and ships  using their IFF units  can initiate IFF unit  to locate and establish precise rendezvous with fuel depot . When the supply of fuel  has been pumped from bladder member , command\/control system  senses this and couples appropriate driving signals  to propulsion system  to tow the deflated bladder member  on a return trip to a tanker ship for replenishment or redeployment to a different destination. This procedure can be performed autonomously, but can be changed from a remote station  or ships .","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of system and method of fuel depot  can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. Its uncomplicated, compact design that incorporates structures long proven to operate successfully lends itself to numerous modifications to permit its reliable use under the hostile and demanding conditions encountered during some operations. System and method of fuel depot  can be fabricated in different physical arrangements from a wide variety of constituents that have proven capabilities to provide long term reliable deployment of needed POL products under a multitude of different operational conditions. System and method of fuel depot  of the invention can be modified within the scope of this inventive concept to provide reliable fuel replenishment for ships on their way to a theater of operations or could be used as a remote stationary fueling station that can return to a rear staging area for its replenishment.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. System and method of fuel depot  provides an autonomous, reliable and capable means of assuring a supply of fuel  for ships and craft  in transit. Therefore, system and method of fuel depot , as disclosed herein are not to be construed as limiting, but rather, are intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["5","5"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
