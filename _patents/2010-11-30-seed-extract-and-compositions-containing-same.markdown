In comparison with these species well known in the West, has remained quite marginal. It is above all the alimentary use of the seeds thereof that has led to some written works regarding it. Current data concerning it mainly stems from two or three Western works on African Sahelian plants, and documents of international organisations written by authors who are for the most part from Burkina Faso. For instance, this traditional use is perfectly set out in the reports of Mr. Ou\u00e9tian Bognounou, Officier and Chevalier de l'Ordre National, Chevalier des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques, floristics and ethnobotanics research officer of the INERA of Burkina Faso, co-authored with Mr. Marc Olivier, ethnobotanics consultant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"i":["Acacia macrostachya ","Acacia macrostachya.

Different structures enable the SC to ensure its barrier function: the intercellular lipids, the cornified envelope, corneodesmosomes.","This barrier is reinforced by a second line of defence situated in the and constituted of tight junctions.","B. Evaluation of the Gene Expression of the Markers of the Differentiation and the Barrier","a. Materials and Methods:","Normal human keratinocytes were treated for 24 or 48 hours by 0.01 or 0.05% hydrolysate (w\/v); in parallel, keratinocyte controls were cultivated under conditions favourable to differentiation (\u201cHigh Ca\u201d calcium supplemented medium).

Results:","The hydrolysate very strongly and significantly increased the gene expression of keratin 1 and keratin 10. Furthermore, the hydrolysate significantly increased the gene expression of filaggrin, involucrin, loricrin and transglutaminase 1 (TGase 1).","All of these proteins are involved in the formation of the cornified envelope.","The hydrolysate thus contributes to reinforcing the cornified envelope and thus to improving the resistance of the epidermal barrier.","In addition, filaggrin, as precursor of NMF (natural moisturizing factor) is involved in the moisturising of the epidermis. Thus, through an action on the filaggrin, hydrolysate contributes to improving the moisturising of the epidermis.","The hydrolysate significantly increased the gene expression of desmoglein 1 (Dsg 1) and desmocolline-1 (Dsc 1), constituent proteins of corneodesmosomes, this effect is thus in favour of a reinforcement of the cohesion of the ","Gene Expression of Differentiation Markers and the Barrier by Keratinocytes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0179"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00018","num":"00018"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},{"i":"Acacia"},{"i":"Acacia"},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Control","hydrolysate","hydrolysate","Control High"]},{"entry":[{},"cells","0.01%","0.05%","Ca"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["KERATIN 1","1.00","2.29 (+129% *)","4.43 (+343%","5.42 (+442%"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"***)","***)"]},{"entry":["KERATIN","1.00","2.28 (+128% *)","3.52 (+252%","8.95 (+795%"]},{"entry":["10",{},{},"***)","***)"]},{"entry":["FILAGGRIN","1.00","1.01 (+1% ns)","1.64 (+64% **)","4.11 (+311%"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"***)"]},{"entry":["INVOLUCRIN","1.00","1.81 (+81%","1.18 (+18% ns)","1.16 (+16>%"]},{"entry":[{},{},"***)",{},"ns)"]},{"entry":["LORICRIN","1.00","1.54 (+54% ns)","3.53 (+253%","0.98 (\u22122%"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"**)","ns)"]},{"entry":["TGase 1","1.00","1.60 (+60% *)","1.40 (+40% ns)","2.25 (+125%"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"***)"]},{"entry":["Dsgl","1.00","1.39 (+39% ns)","1.49 (+49% *)","3.25 (+225%"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"***)"]},{"entry":["Dscl","1.00","1.57 (+57% *)","1.38 (+38% ns)","2.70 (+170%"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"***)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":[{},{},{}]},"The activity of hydrolysate was studied by quantitative RT-PCR on the level of expression of 16 genes mainly coding for tight junction proteins as well as for the major proteins of the communicating junctions of the epidermis.","Normal human keratinocytes were treated or not (control) with 0.05% and 0.1% hydrolysate (w\/v) or the reference (1.5 mM calcium chloride CaCl) for 24 hours.

Dermal Matrix and Oxidative Stress","A. Introduction","Modifications of the skin with age result from modifications of the cellular functions and progressive modifications of the composition and the structure of the extra-cellular dermal matrix. In fact, the dermis undergoes a gradual loss of its thickness with a reduction of essential macromolecules, such as collagen and elastin. This diminution may be attributed to a reduction in the synthesis thereof and\/or to an increase in the degradation thereof by MMP (matrix metalloproteinases) for example.","The relation between oxidative stress and ageing is today well established. In fact, there is an accumulation in the aged cells of damaged molecules leading to an alteration of cellular functions. To protect itself against this oxidative stress, the","cell has different anti-oxidant defence mechanisms of which the microsomal heme-oxygenase enzyme forms part.","The effect of hydrolysate on the modulation of the extra-cellular matrix of the dermis and on the stimulation of the anti-oxidant defences was evaluated on a dermal fibroblasts model in which the gene expression of elastin, MMP1 and heme oxygenase 1 was studied by quantitative RT-PCR in real time.","B. Materials and Methods","Normal human fibroblasts were treated for 24h with 0.01% and 0.05% hydrolysate (w\/v) or with the reference TGF\u03b21 at 5 ng\/ml.
