title: Adaptive input interface
abstract: User input on a computing device can be intelligently predicted using one or more learning algorithms. When user text input is received, an input repository comprising a plurality of text items is accessed. The plurality of text items includes a plurality of user-specific text items, which are classified according to a probabilistic model. One or more input predictions are inferred by applying the probabilistic model to the user text input. A suggested text input is presented using an output element of the computing device. The suggested text input is based on the user text input and one or more text items from the input repository. Additional input is received which overrides the suggested text. Any text associated with the user override is then classified within the probabilistic model, thereby updating the input repository based on the user override.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["People are increasingly utilizing portable computing devices that have a wide variety of capabilities. In many cases, these devices can communicate over various wireless channels, and include a wide variety of input mechanisms. Unfortunately, many portable computing and electronic devices include very small-scale keyboards on which it can be difficult for users to type with speed and accuracy. To help users overcome the difficulty of using such keyboards, some devices include software to analyze user input as the user types and predict the user's intended final input. Some devices simply replace the user's input with the predicted input. Other devices may present a selection of suggestions as the user types and allow the user to decide whether to accept one of the suggestions. However, such software may result in user frustration if the software does not learn from historical user input and improve the predictions and\/or suggestions.","Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments provide for intelligent prediction of user input on a computing device. In at least some embodiments, an input repository including a plurality of text items is accessed when user text input is received. The plurality of text items can include a plurality of user-specific text items, which are classified according to at least one probabilistic model. One or more input predictions can be inferred by applying the probabilistic model to the user text input. At least one suggested text input can be presented using an output element of the computing device. The suggested text input can be based on the user text input and, for example, one or more text items from the input repository. Additional input may be received which overrides the suggested text. Any text associated with a user override then can be classified within the probabilistic model, thereby updating the input repository based on the user override.","Various other applications, processes and uses are presented below with respect to the various embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"In this example, the computing device  has a display screen  (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) element) operable to display image content to one or more users or viewers of the device. In at least some embodiments, the display screen provides for touch or swipe-based input using, for example, a physical or virtual keyboard based on capacitive or resistive touch technology. Such a display element can be used to, for example, enable a user to provide input by pressing on an area of the display corresponding to an image of a button, such as a right or left mouse button, touch point, etc. The device can also have touch and\/or pressure sensitive material  on other areas of the device as well, such as on the sides or back of the device. While in at least some embodiments a user can provide input by touching or squeezing such a material, in other embodiments the material can be used to detect motion of the device through movement of a patterned surface with respect to the material. Various other inputs can be provided as well as should be apparent in light of the teachings and suggestions contained herein.","The example computing device  can include one or more image capture elements for purposes such as conventional image and\/or video capture. As discussed elsewhere herein, the image capture elements can also be used for purposes such as to determine motion and receive gesture input. While the computing device in this example includes one image capture element  on the \u201cfront\u201d of the device and one image capture element  on the \u201cback\u201d of the device, it should be understood that image capture elements could also, or alternatively, be placed on the sides or corners of the device, and that there can be any appropriate number of capture elements of similar or different types. Each image capture element may be, for example, a camera, a charge-coupled device (CCD), a motion detection sensor, or an infrared sensor, or can utilize another image capturing technology. The computing device can also include at least one microphone  or other audio capture element capable of capturing audio data, such as may be used to determine changes in position or receive user input in certain embodiments. In some devices there may be only one microphone, while in other devices there might be at least one microphone on each side and\/or corner of the device, or in other appropriate locations.","The device  in this example also includes at least one motion- or position-determining element  operable to provide information such as a position, direction, motion, or orientation of the device. These elements can include, for example, accelerometers, inertial sensors, electronic gyroscopes, electronic compasses, and GPS elements. Various types of motion or changes in orientation can be used to provide input to the device that can trigger at least one control signal for another device. The example device also includes at least one communication mechanism , such as may include at least one wired or wireless component operable to communicate with one or more electronic devices. The device also includes a power system , such as may include a battery operable to be recharged through conventional plug-in approaches, or through other approaches such as capacitive charging through proximity with a power mat or other such device.

Messaging window  includes a scrolling display area  where text messages are displayed and a text entry area , including a cursor  that follows the user's typed input  (\u201cOh grrr :-(\u201d). Although the keyboard depicts standard English characters, some embodiments may include a keyboard capable of generating user input in different languages, including various alphanumeric characters, etc. Any software application that accepts user input that can be expressed in characters via computing device  is well within the scope of various embodiments",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"In step  of , a computing device detects that user text input has been received. In step , the computing device accesses an input repository in order to look up elements of the user input. In some embodiments, the input repository is stored in a data store on the device. The input repository provides a way to store and compare user input to a set of input items (e.g., known terms, words, phrases, and\/or phonemes); in some embodiments, the input repository also provides a way to evaluate the user input with respect to spelling, capitalization, punctuation, or other similar aspects. It may also evaluate the user input in light of a collection of grammar rules (including user-specific grammar rules). The input repository may include user-specific input items that have been added to the input repository to customize the repository for individual user(s) of the device. In some embodiments, the user-specific input items are retrieved based on a user identifier that identifies either a device or an individual user (e.g., MAC address, login\/password, user ID).","In some embodiments, the plurality of input items are classified within the input repository according to a probabilistic model. Any conventional and appropriate probabilistic model may be used, e.g., a Bayesian network, an n-gram model, a hidden Markov model, etc. Such probabilistic models may be used to infer the user's intended final user input in light of characters that have already been input by the user.","In step , one or more input predictions are inferred by applying the probabilistic model to the user text input. For example, in an embodiment based upon a Bayesian network, the plurality of input items are mapped over a set of neighboring nodes in the network, and an input prediction may be determined by mapping the received user input to a set of neighboring nodes Nin the network, and then, for each child node of node N, applying its probability function to calculate a posterior probability distribution for each child node Ngiven nodes N. In some embodiments, the set of one or more input predictions may include the entire set of possible results that depend from node Nin the network. In some embodiments, the set of one or more input predictions may include only those possible results that depend from node Nin the network and have a probability higher than a specified threshold. In some embodiments, the set of one or more input predictions may include only the top two (or three or four, etc.) possible results with the highest probability, and that depend from node Nin the network.","In step , the computing device presents suggested text using an output element of the device. In some embodiments, suggested input includes only the input prediction with the highest probability; in some embodiments, suggested input includes the entire set of one or more input predictions.","Suggested input may be presented using any appropriate output element of the device. In some embodiments, suggested input is displayed on a visual output element, such as a screen of the device, or transmitted to a display via a video output of the device. In some embodiments, displaying a suggested input comprises replacing the user input as entered on the screen with the suggested input (typically, only in cases where the suggested input includes only a single input prediction). In some embodiments, displaying a suggested input comprises displaying a pop-up window, text area, drop-down\/scrolling listbox, or selection of radio buttons that display one or more input predictions. In some embodiments, suggested input is presented using an audio output element of the device, such as may include verbalizations or other sounds transmitted using a speaker embedded in the device or transmitted via an audio output of the device to a speaker, headphones, or the like. In some embodiments, displaying a suggested input comprises utilizing a haptic interface of the device to transmit mechanical stimulation through an actuation mechanism of the device.","In step , the computing device detects that further user input has been received. The user may have accepted or selected one of the input predictions, or the user may have implicitly or explicitly declined to utilize the suggested input and entered a user override. In the case of an acceptance, there may be multiple ways to present a suggested input. In some embodiments, when the original user text input is simply replaced with the suggested text, the user may implicitly indicate acceptance by continuing to type and not going back to undo the suggested input. In some embodiments, when the suggested input is presented as a list of options, the user may explicitly indicate acceptance of the suggested input by selecting one of the options. In some embodiments, one or more buttons may be provided to enable a user to indicate that a particular suggested input should always be used or should never be used.","In the case of a user override, entry of an override trigger is detected immediately after a suggested input was presented. An override trigger is an indication that the suggested input may have been inappropriate, so the user text input that follows the override trigger indicates that the input repository needs to be updated. In some embodiments, the override trigger comprises a completely explicit type of user input, such as clicking on a \u201cCancel\u201d button that is presented along with the suggested input. In some embodiments, the override trigger comprises a less obvious, but still explicit, type of user input, such as using the backspace key to delete a suggested input that automatically replaced the user text input. In some embodiments, the override trigger may be followed by replacement user text input. In some embodiments, the override trigger may be more implicit, such as by continuing to type in disregard of a suggested input that is presented after the user typed the first few characters. In some embodiments, one or more buttons may be provided to enable a user to indicate that a particular suggested input should always be overridden with the user text input.","In step , the computing device determines whether the user text input received in step  comprises a user override or user acceptance of the suggested text. In one embodiment, the user override is incorporated into the input repository regardless of whether the user override overrode or accepted the suggested text. In some embodiments, the user override may only be incorporated into the input repository in one of those two cases.","In step , the input repository is updated based on the further user input received in step . This step enables embodiments to \u201clearn\u201d from the user's input and acceptance of suggested input or entry of override triggers. In some cases, replacement user text input may be added to the input repository as new input items, and in other cases, an existing input item in the input repository may have their probabilities updated to place greater weight upon the existing input item. In some embodiments, the updating comprises classifying replacement user text input associated with the user override within the probabilistic model. In such embodiments based on a Bayesian network, additional nodes may be added to the network, and a prior probability distribution of the probabilistic model may be updated. In some embodiments, updating the prior probability distribution comprises updating a smoothing algorithm associated with the nodes in the network. In some embodiments, the user override may be separately stored in the input repository. In step , if appropriate, a second suggested input may be presented using the output element of the device, as with the suggested text.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"In step , a server (in a cloud or otherwise) receives user text input that was entered into a computing device and, in at least some embodiments, transferred across a network.

order to provide functionality such as that described herein,  illustrates an example set of basic components of a computing device , such as the device  described with respect to . In this example, the device includes at least one processor  for executing instructions that can be stored in at least one memory device or element . As would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the device can include many types of memory, data storage or computer-readable storage media, such as a first data storage for program instructions for execution by the processor , the same or separate storage can be used for images or data, a removable storage memory can be available for sharing information with other devices, etc. The device typically will include some type of display element , such as a touch screen, electronic ink (e-ink), organic light emitting diode (OLED) or liquid crystal display (LCD), although devices such as portable media players might convey information via other means, such as through audio speakers. As discussed, the device in many embodiments will include at least one image capture element , such as one or more cameras that are able to image a user, people, or objects in the vicinity of the device. In at least some embodiments, the device can use the image information to determine gestures or motions of the user, which will enable the user to provide input through the computing device without having to actually contact and\/or move the device. An image capture element also can be used to determine movement of the device, as discussed herein. An image capture element can include any appropriate technology, such as a CCD image capture element having a sufficient resolution, focal range and viewable area, to capture an image of the user when the user is operating the device. The device can include at least one additional input device  able to receive conventional input from a user. This conventional input can include, for example, a push button, touch pad, touch screen, wheel, joystick, keyboard, mouse, trackball, keypad or any other such device or element whereby a user can input a command to the device. These I\/O devices could even be connected by a wireless infrared or Bluetooth or other link as well in some embodiments. In some embodiments, however, such a device might not include any buttons at all and might be controlled only through a combination of visual and audio commands such that a user can control the device without having to be in contact with the device.","The example device also includes one or more wireless components  operable to communicate with one or more electronic devices within a communication range of the particular wireless channel. The wireless channel can be any appropriate channel used to enable devices to communicate wirelessly, such as Bluetooth, cellular, or Wi-Fi channels. It should be understood that the device can have one or more conventional wired communications connections as known in the art. The example device includes various power components  known in the art for providing power to a computing device, which can include capacitive charging elements for use with a power pad or similar device as discussed elsewhere herein. The example device also can include at least one touch- and\/or pressure-sensitive element , such as a touch sensitive material around a casing of the device, at least one region capable of providing squeeze-based input to the device, etc. In some embodiments this material can be used to determine motion, such as of the device or a user's finger, for example, while in other embodiments the material will be used to provide specific inputs or commands.","In some embodiments, a device can include the ability to activate and\/or deactivate detection and\/or command modes, such as when receiving a command from a user or an application, or retrying to determine an audio input or video input, etc. In some embodiments, a device can include an infrared detector or motion sensor, for example, which can be used to activate one or more detection modes. For example, a device might not attempt to detect or communicate with devices when there is not a user in the room. If an infrared detector (i.e., a detector with one-pixel resolution that detects changes in state) detects a user entering the room, for example, the device can activate a detection or control mode such that the device can be ready when needed by the user, but conserve power and resources when a user is not nearby.","As discussed, different approaches can be implemented in various environments in accordance with the described embodiments. For example,  illustrates an example of an environment  for implementing aspects in accordance with various embodiments. As will be appreciated, although a Web-based environment is used for purposes of explanation, different environments may be used, as appropriate, to implement various embodiments. The system includes an electronic client device , which can include any appropriate device operable to send and receive requests, messages or information over an appropriate network  and convey information back to a user of the device. Examples of such client devices include personal computers, cell phones, handheld messaging devices, laptop computers, set-top boxes, personal data assistants, electronic book readers and the like. The network can include any appropriate network, including an intranet, the Internet, a cellular network, a local area network or any other such network or combination thereof. Components used for such a system can depend at least in part upon the type of network and\/or environment selected. Protocols and components for communicating via such a network are well known and will not be discussed herein in detail. Communication over the network can be enabled via wired or wireless connections and combinations thereof. In this example, the network includes the Internet, as the environment includes a Web server  for receiving requests and serving content in response thereto, although for other networks, an alternative device serving a similar purpose could be used, as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.","The illustrative environment includes at least one application server  and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers, layers or other elements, processes or components, which may be chained or otherwise configured, which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein, the term \u201cdata store\u201d refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing, accessing and retrieving data, which may include any combination and number of data servers, databases, data storage devices and data storage media, in any standard, distributed or clustered environment. The application server  can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store  as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device and handling a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server provides access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content such as text, graphics, audio and\/or video to be transferred to the user, which may be served to the user by the Web server  in the form of HTML, XML or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses, as well as the delivery of content between the client device  and the application server , can be handled by the Web server . It should be understood that the Web and application servers are not required and are merely example components, as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.","The data store  can include several separate data tables, databases or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example, the data store illustrated includes mechanisms for storing content (e.g., production data)  and user information , which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store is also shown to include a mechanism for storing log or session data . It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store, such as page image information and access rights information, which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store  is operable, through logic associated therewith, to receive instructions from the application server  and obtain, update or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example, a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case, the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type.
