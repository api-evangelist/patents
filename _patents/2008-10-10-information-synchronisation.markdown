Technical Field","This invention relates to a method and apparatus for synchronising information across a set of computer applications.","Information used in a computer application can take many forms, with an example being financial or accounting data. The information may be sales order information, invoice information, stock information or any of the other types of financial information that is used.","Each information entry is referred to as an object and objects are stored in data stores.","A problem is encountered when objects that are replicated across several data stores are modified. The ideal situation is that any modification is instantaneously reflected across all replicas such that the information is up-to-date everywhere. Due to objective constraints such as connection reliability and latency, resilience or the desire to keep objects highly available, it is not practicable (and in most cases not necessary) to keep the whole network of applications up-to-date all the time.","It is therefore considered that the applications interact and exchange information with the aim of achieving a consistent underlying content. This interaction is called synchronisation.","2. Description of Related Art","An existing method for synchronising data uses vector clock synchronisation, which uses an algorithm for generating a partial ordering of events in a distributed system and detecting causality violations. Interprocess messages contain the state of the sending process's logical clock. A vector clock of a system of N processes is an array of N logical clocks, one per process, a local copy of which is kept in each process with the following rules for clock updates.","Initially all clocks are zero.","Each time a process experiences an internal event, it increments its own logical clock in the vector by one.","Each time a process prepares to send a message, it sends its entire vector along with the message being sent.","Each time a process receives a message, it compares the vector clock included in the message with its own vector clock. If the vector clock included in the message is strictly greater than the vector clock of the process, the process accepts the new state contained in the message and replaces its vector clock by the vector clock contained in the message. If the vector clock included in the message is strictly smaller than the vector clock of the process, the process ignores the message. If the two vector clocks are not comparable (each one has an entry that it strictly greater than the corresponding entry in the other one), the receiving process signals a conflict and applies a conflict handling rule to update its state.","The vector clock is attached to each object in a data store. Synchronisation is achieved by using the algorithm outlined above.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a more efficient method of synchronising data sets.","According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus and method as set forth in the appended claims. Other features of the invention will be apparent from the dependent claims, and the description which follows.","According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of synchronising at least first and second instances of an information set comprising a plurality of entries, wherein said first and second instances are located on different nodes of a system, the method comprising:\n\n","Preferably, an existing node value and current logical clock value pair of an entry is deleted and replaced with a new node value and current logical clock value pair when said entry is changed.","A timestamp value may be attached to each data entry when said entry is changed, in addition to the node value and current logical clock value pair.","The current logical clock value may be referred to as a tick.","Preferably, the synchronisation is performed in a bi-directional manner, for example from the first instance to the second instance and then from the second instance to the first instance.","Preferably, synchronisation is performed for one information set at a time. This feature is advantageous over performing synchronisation one data entry at a time.","Each digest is preferably located at a node to which it relates.","The digest may comprise a node value and logical clock value pair for each node of the system.","The digest may additionally include a conflict priority value for each node of the system.","The node value and current logical clock value pair and\/or the digest may be carried by a data feed or syndication feed, such as an RSS feed or an Atom feed.","The nodes may be endpoints that carry one instance of the information set. The node values may be URLs.","Two digests may be provided for each synchronisation event, which digests may be floor and ceiling digests, corresponding to a state of a node before a modification event and after a modification event respectively","The invention extends to a synchronisation device operable to perform the method of the above aspect.","The synchronisation device may be an application running on a computer system.","According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a computing system comprising a plurality of nodes, wherein each node incorporates an instance of an information set, the computing system being operable to synchronise the instances of the information set, and comprising at least one synchronisation logic means operable to\n\n","The synchronisation logic means may comprise a synchronisation endpoint, which may be an interface or service, for each node or for each instance of the information set.","The synchronisation logic means may comprise one or more synchronisation engines. The synchronisation engines may be operable to drive exchanges of messages between synchronisation endpoints. The synchronisation engines and synchronisation endpoints may reside on different computers. Alternatively, a synchronisation engine may reside on the same computer as a synchronisation endpoint.","Each synchronisation endpoint is preferably operable to perform the attaching and digest generation for its given node.","Preferably, the synchronisation engines are operable to communicate with endpoints to perform the synchronisation function.","The nodes may be computer applications running on one computer or may be applications running on different computers.","According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a computer program product comprising instructions, which when run on a computer are operable to implement a method of synchronising at least first and second instances of an information set comprising a plurality of entries, wherein said first and second instances are located on different nodes of a computer system, the method comprising:\n\n","In order to address the problems relating to synchronisation referred to above various attributes for a synchronisation scheme have been identified.","The solution should conform to the necessities of the various use cases arising in practice.","Some of the beneficial attributes are as follows.","Given sufficient interactions between applications and in the absence of modifications, a synchronised state between data stores should be achieved.","The scheme should support casual node interaction.","The system used should allow for implementation that is topology independent.","The scheme should offer robustness and consistency.","The scheme should offer bi-directional synchronisation.","The scheme should handle conflicts between the states of objects in an algorithmic and rigorous manner.","The scheme should contain a solution for error logging and handling.","The scheme should support catch-up and immediate synchronisation scenarios.","The scheme should offer location independence for a synchronisation engine.","The scheme should offer partial synchronisation support.","Full resynchronisation ability should be possible.","Simple implementation should be achievable.","A scheme has been developed for providing synchronisation of information sets that takes into account the objectives set out above.","1.1 Vector Clock Synchronisation","A synchronisation protocol is based on \u201cvector clock\u201d synchronisation the well know technique referred to above and used by several synchronisation\/replication systems: P2P networks, replicated file systems, etc.","Vector clocks provide an elegant solution to the problem of maintaining several copies of a given object in synchronisation and detecting conflicts.","Assuming that a given object O is replicated on several nodes N1, N2 . . . , in a system of connected computing applications the vector clocks are constructed as follows:\n\n","O may have different vector clocks at different nodes. The goal of the synchronisation system is to bring O in synchronisation across nodes. When O is fully synchronised, its vector clock is the same on all nodes.","By comparing the vectors clocks of O on two nodes, the synchronisation algorithm can decide if the versions can be brought in synchronisation (and how) or if there is a conflict. The following table explains how this comparison works (VOj stands for the vector clock of O at node j):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0079"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Case","Example","State","Action"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["VO1 = VO2","VO1 = (N1 5)(N2 7)(N3 8)","N1 and N2 have the same","None"]},{"entry":[{},"VO2 = (N1 5)(N2 7)(N3 8)","version of O."]},{"entry":["VO1 < VO2","VO1 = (N1 5)(N2 7)(N3 8)","N1's version of O is an","Replace N1's version"]},{"entry":[{},"VO2 = (N1 5)(N2 8)(N3 8)","ancestor of N2's version.","of O by N2's version"]},{"entry":["VO1 > VO2","VO1 = (N1 6)(N2 7)(N3 9)","N2's version of O is an","Replace N2's version"]},{"entry":[{},"VO2 = (N1 5)(N2 7)(N3 8)","ancestor of N1's version.","of O by N1's version"]},{"entry":["Not","VO1 = (N1 6)(N2 7)(N3 9)","N1 and N2 have a","Conflict.

This is actually not a requirement and the algorithm works just as well if the tick is incremented every time a synchronisation pass is run rather than every time an object is modified. So, the nodes can use either strategy to manage their clocks.","To be precise, and to get the same algorithm for the two strategies, the clock must actually be managed as follows:\n\n","With this convention, the tick can be interpreted as the \u201cfirst value that has not been synchronised\u201d rather than the \u201clast value that has been synchronised\u201d when the synchronisation pass is run. This may not be the most natural convention but it makes the algorithm work regardless of whether the tick is incremented at modification time or at synchronisation time.","1.3 Conflict Resolution","The algorithm uses a simple mechanism based on priorities and timestamps to resolve conflicts. The idea is the following:\n\n","The conflict resolution can be optionally implemented by adding a priority value to the vector clock pairs. The vector clock is now a list of triplets (Ni, Ti, Pi) where Ni is the node id, Ti is Ni's tick when O was last modified at Ni, and Pi is Ni's conflict priority. Also, the synchronisation metadata should contain the last modification timestamp of each object. So, the synchronisation metadata for object O is the combination of its extended vector clock (list of triplets) and its last modification timestamp.","The conflict resolution algorithm works as described in the following table (the timestamp is reduced to hh:mm to keep table clean):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0096"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Case","Example","Winner","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Priorities","VO1 = (N1 6 1)(N2 7 2)(N3 9 3)","VO1","Conflict involves N1, N2 and N3.

The process involves 4 steps numbered 1 to 4. All steps are initiated by the synchronisation engine and this figure shows the most general case where the source application, the target application, the engine and the event logger are distinct components that may eventually reside on different computers.","The process unfolds as follows:","At 1. the engine gets the target digest.","At 2 the engine sends the target digest to the source. The source uses the two digests (its own and the target one) to select the resources that need to be transferred to the target (it uses the algorithm described in 1.5). The source returns the delta feed to the engine.","At 3 the engine sends the delta feed to the target. The delta feed is a batch of create\/update\/delete instructions that the target provider executes to bring its data store in synchronisation. The delta feed also contains the two digests that have been used to select resources on the source side. The target uses these digests to detect and resolve conflicts (it uses the algorithm described in 1.6). When the batch has been fully processed, the target updates its digest to reflect the fact that the delta has been applied. The target returns diagnostic information about the success\/failure of the operations that have been submitted.","At 4 the engine sends the diagnostics that it just received to the event manager. The event manager logs them and alerts users if configured to do so.","The delta is a feed which is broken in pages (using the implementation example paging protocol). So the engine repeats steps 2, 3 and 4 on every page of the feed. At step 3, the target digest is only updated at the end of the last page (this operation could have been done as a separate step #5 to clearly isolate the loop in steps 2, 3 and 4 but then the engine would make an extra roundtrip to the target).","2.7 Observations","This architecture has some interesting properties:\n\n","The deployment can be simplified by embedding the engine into one of the endpoints. In this case, the communications between the engine and its embedding endpoint can be short-circuited (they are not required to go through HTTP and URLs). For example, if the engine is run from the source application and if the source also handles the diagnostics,  becomes the set up shown in , in which the numerals relate to the same functions mentioned above in relation to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0150"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In this simplified architecture the source is not a service provider any more, it has become an application that consumes services exposed by another application.","If bi-directional synchronisation is needed between the two applications, we can still use the same simplified architecture. To synchronise in the other direction,  shows the architecture, in which again the numerals relate to the same functions mentioned above in relation to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0153"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0154"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 2 and 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0155"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},"2.9 Other Deployment Scenarios","The \u201csimplification exercise\u201d above shows that implementation example synchronisation can accommodate both a \u201csuite\u201d scenario where a central engine coordinates synchronisation passes between services and a \u201cdisconnected laptop\u201d scenario where each laptop runs its own synchronisation engine.","But the architecture allows many more variants because all the interactions go through URLs and the location of the components is not of great significance (all that is required is that the engine can access the other component's URLs). Flexibility is particularly important on the error reporting side, and nothing prevents the engine from sending the diagnoses to more than one diagnostic endpoint. In the context of an application suite, this is usually not required because the suite has a central event management facility, but when the applications do not belong to a suite, the implementation example allows the system to be configured to report errors in one of the applications, or in the other, or in both, or sometimes in one sometimes in the other (depending on the direction for example). This decision should be dictated by product considerations and the implementation example architecture should be able to accommodate the various needs of product integration scenarios.","2.10 Immediate and Catch-Up Synchronisation","The engine described above works in \u201ccatch up\u201d mode. Synchronisation is done in passes, which may be run by a scheduler or launched manually. The synchronisation passes use the following logic:\n\n","In a number of scenarios, it is important to propagate changes as soon as possible instead of having to wait for a synchronisation pass. This \u201cimmediate\u201d mode involves a slightly different process:\n\n","The implementation example synchronisation protocol is designed to handle the two modes under a common protocol. Of course, the source implementation will be different in the two modes (in catch-up mode, the source needs to provide an entry point to query the delta, in immediate mode, the source needs to be able to detect changes), but the protocol is designed so that the target side can handle both modes in a uniform way (the target does not need to be aware of which mode is used).","Also, the implementation example synchronisation protocol is designed to support a mix of the two modes. This feature is important because the immediate mode is challenging. For example, one of the applications may be offline or the target application may be down when the source tries to propagate changes. This can be solved by introducing a queue to guarantee delivery but this has drawbacks (queue needs to remain active if source application is closed, queue may end up wasting lots of resources, especially is a target is never reachable, etc.). An alternative is to consider that the immediate mode is only a \u201cbest effort\u201d to propagate changes, and to use the \u201ccatch up\u201d mode to ensure that systems will be brought back in synchronisation periodically even if some immediate synchronisation requests have been lost.","In immediate mode, the architecture is typically as shown in , which shows a typical configuration for immediate synchronisation. The source application pushes its changes to a target application. The main difference with the catch up mode is the elimination of a roundtrip to query the target digest. This configuration is more efficient to propagate changes than the catch up configuration depicted in  but a real system would probably combine both configurations so that it can revert to catch up mode when the immediate mode fails.","The main difference with the catch up mode is that the engine does not read the target digest any more (this would involve an extra roundtrip), it only pushes the delta to the target.","The implementation example protocol handles the immediate mode and the mix of modes by using a \u201crich\u201d (selfdescribing) delta message. The implementation example delta message contains:\n\n","The process is to include two digests that delimit the delta (change) in the feed. These two digests are called the \u201cfloor\u201d and \u201cceiling\u201d digests. They are set as follows:\n\n","With this refinement, the target knows precisely what the delta contains. The target checks if the tick intervals defined by the floor and ceiling are contiguous to its own tick values (the target digest). If the intervals are contiguous, the target can update its digest. Otherwise, if there is a gap between the tick interval defined by floor\/digest and the target digest, the target knows that at least one immediate synchronisation has been missed and it does not update its digest. The next catch up synchronisation will close the gap.","The rationale for having two digests in the message is to make the feeds more \u201cself describing\u201d. They do not contain only the changes; they also contain information about the two digests that bracket the changes. This is useful in immediate mode because it allows the target to check if the range of changes sent by the source is contiguous with the changes that have already been incorporated on the target. If the range of changes is contiguous, the target can incorporate them and update its digest. If they are not (this happens if a previous immediate synchronisation message has not been delivered to the target), the target should discard the request.","The implementation protocol is designed so that the target side can handle the catch up mode and the immediate mode with the same logic. This is why the same message (feed) is used for both modes, with two digests in the message. This make the protocol more robust (for example in the unlikely scenario where the target node is restored from an old backup between the time the source queried its digest and the time the source sends its changes).","The following table shows how this algorithm works.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0183"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},"New",{}]},{"entry":["Floor","Ceiling","Target","Target","Comments"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["(N1 6 1)","(N1 7 1)","(N1 6 1)","(N1 7 1)","N1 propagates a change to N2 in immediate"]},{"entry":["(N2 7 2)","(N2 7 2)","(N2 9 2)","(N2 9 2)","mode.
