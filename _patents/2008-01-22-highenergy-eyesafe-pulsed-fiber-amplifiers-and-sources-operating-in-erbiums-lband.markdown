In some embodiments, the amplifying fiber is a double-clad fiber having an outer cladding (having a relatively low index of refraction, i.e., lower than the index of refraction of an inner cladding), wherein the outer cladding constrains the pump light to propagate only in the inner cladding (having middle index-of-refraction value) and the core (having a higher index of refraction than the inner cladding), and the inner cladding constrains the signal light to propagate only in the core. (Some embodiments use index-of-refraction compositions and\/or doping profiles that vary the index of refraction across the outer cladding, the inner cladding and\/or core, in order to control the mode profiles for the pump light and\/or signal light.) In some embodiments, the signal pulse is applied for substantially the entire duration of the pump pulse, and the system is designed to supply enough pump power and\/or to shape the amplitude of the signal pulse, in order to maintain an inversion of the active species (i.e., a sufficient proportion of the erbium atoms are ionized) so as to maintain a substantially constant amplification of the L-band optical signal). If the pump light is applied before the arrival of the signal light, the amount of inversion (i.e., stored power) can build up such that when the signal is launched into the amplifying fiber, the initial portion of the signal pulse is amplified to a greater extent (called \u201covershoot\u201d which is undesirable for many applications) than are the middle and later portions of the signal pulse. To prevent this, some embodiments delay the application of pump light to the amplifying optical fiber until the start or slightly after the start of the signal pulse.","In some embodiments, the signal pulse is pre-shaped (e.g., starting at an initially low amplitude and then building in amplitude), in order to compensate for a reduction in gain that can occur if an appreciable amount of pump power is stored in the fiber (e.g., if there is a non-negligible inversion remaining from a previous pump pulse, or if the fiber is optically pumped on a continuous (cw) or quasi-cw basis).","In some embodiments, the signal pulse is amplitude modulated within each pulse (e.g., in some embodiments, a sine-wave amplitude modulation is applied, such that the signal will have negligible amplitude between pulses, but the amplitude of at least some of the signal pulses is equal to the product of (a constant (which can be zero) plus a sine wave) times a pulse (the amplitude of which, in various embodiments, is constant, increasing, or decreasing). In some embodiments, the amplitude modulation (e.g., the sine-wave portion) is frequency modulated (i.e., the sine-wave component varies in frequency during the pulse). In some embodiments, the frequency modulation is chirped (e.g., starting at a low-frequency and increasing in frequency for substantially the duration of the pulse). In some embodiments, the chirped amplitude-modulated pulse is used in a LADAR system. In some embodiments, the chirped amplitude-modulated pulse is used in a range-gated imaging system.","In some embodiments, the systems of the present invention are capable of, and do, deliver high energy, (up to and exceeding 20 mJ), long bursts (10-40 microseconds (\u03bcs)), of chirped amplitude-modulated radiation (wherein the chirp includes 10 MHz-800 MHz modulation frequencies; i.e., the chirp in one \u201cpulse\u201d starts at 10 MHz and changes frequency in a continuous manner up to 800 MHz) at eye-safe wavelengths in erbium's L-band (e.g., using wavelengths in the range of about 1550 nm to about 1630 nm) with good beam quality (M<2.8). In some embodiments, a ytterbium-free (Yb-free) double-clad large-mode-area (LMA) erbium fiber in an amplifier configuration operating in the L-band and in particular the far L-band (e.g., some such embodiments operate at a signal wavelength of 1590 nm) is used to enhance the efficiency and energy storage of the fiber optical amplifier. By employing pulse pumping (i.e., providing optical pump light into the fiber amplifier only while extracting power, which can be considered quasi-cw operation depending on the pulse length) the output energy per pulse is increased. Pulse pumping also minimizes ASE and transient-induced Q-switching at low pulse-repetition-rate (rep-rate) operation. Further, by advancing or delaying the start of the extraction pulse relative to the start of the pump pulse by a few micro-seconds (e.g., starting the pump pulse 1 to 10 microseconds before or after the start of the signal pulse, the amount and direction of which are easily determined empirically, such as shown in . D), pulse steepening (early pulse overshoot\/distortion due to stored pump power that increases the amount of gain early in the signal pulse) is minimized or removed, and signal amplification is achieved with excellent fidelity (e.g., the amount of gain remains substantially constant for the duration of the signal pulse).","There have been many reports and products based on pulse amplification in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, but to date these have been exclusively restricted to the so-called C-band (in the central band of the conventional erbium high-gain window) having wavelengths, between 1535 nm to 1565 nm, which are shorter wavelengths than those of the L-band. While this is partly due to a need or desire for short fiber lengths (a need driven by nonlinearity management), it is also due to a lack of understanding of the inherent energy-storage advantage of L-band amplifiers. Siegman suggests (see, e.g., the book \u201cLasers\u201d by A. E. Siegman, ISBN-10: 0935702113, University Science Books; New Ed edition (January 1986)) an advantage of a factor of two (2) for using a four-level fiber amplifier versus a three-level fiber amplifier, based simply on the assumption of half the ions being available in a three-level laser and all of the ions being available in a four-level laser. In a fiber amplifier, however, self saturation limits the number of available ions for pulse amplification. When this is accounted for by using the designs of the present invention, an erbium amplifier operating in the extreme L-band can actually produce pulses having ten (10) times the energy of a signal pulse at the peak of the erbium-gain bandwidth. While a greater fraction of the ions are available for amplifying a signal at the gain peak wavelength in a short fiber, the L-band amplifier of the present invention has an advantage because the absolute number of ions involved in amplification can be increased through use of longer fiber. While the long fiber and associated nonlinearities may impose limits on the peak power (measured in watts) that can be extracted or the line-width of the signal, there are applications, such as AM-modulated LADAR, medical treatments and materials processing, where relatively long pulses are useful or even desirable.","Even in the nanosecond-pulse-length (ns-pulse-length) regime, higher energies (measured in joules) can be extracted by designing the system judiciously around an L-band wavelength. In a cladding-pumped system, the clustering losses associated with very high concentrations of an active dopant (e.g., erbium) are mitigated by both the cladding pumping scheme and the off-peak signal wavelength. Hence high-dopant-concentration fibers, conventionally ruled out on efficiency grounds for C-band operation, may compensate for the longer lengths of gain fibers (or relative length in terms of erbium ions) required in L-band amplifiers.","Yb-free fibers based on an alumino-silicate host therefore become the preferred approach for some embodiments of the present invention. While cladding pumping of the C-band signal wavelengths is facilitated by the Yb co-doping in conventional fiber amplifiers, in some embodiments of the present invention, L-band efficiency and energy storage actually benefit from the weak pump rate associated with double-clad fibers. The main benefits, in some embodiments, are inversion flattening and mitigation of clustering-induced pump losses.","An L-band system can be expected to yield perhaps two times (2\u00d7) the energy in a nanosecond-pulsed system (i.e., amplifying signal pulses in a range of about 1 ns to about 10 ns) and provide a six-times (6\u00d7) advantage in output energy in a long-signal-pulse system (i.e., amplifying signal pulses in a range of about 1 microsecond to about 100 microseconds).","Although the use of the present invention is described for a few specific applications such as AM-modulated LADAR, medical treatments and materials processing, in other embodiments, the present invention provides high-power and\/or high-energy laser pulses for any number of other applications that benefit from the high-power IR radiation.","Although the following detailed description contains many specifics for the purpose of illustration, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the following preferred embodiments of the invention is set forth without any loss of generality to, and without imposing limitations upon the claimed invention.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The leading digit(s) of reference numbers appearing in the Figures generally corresponds to the Figure number in which that component is first introduced, such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component that appears in multiple figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label, and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["100","100","110","110","113","115","116","116","199"]},"In some embodiments, a high amount of pump power (e.g., up to several hundred watts or more, e.g., in some embodiments, about 10 W, 20 W, 30 W, 50 W, 75 W, 100 W, 150 W, 200 W, 250 W, 300 W, 400 W, 500 W, 1000 W, 2000 W, 3000 W, 4000 W, 5000 W or more than 5000 W) is supplied by the pump laser system into the amplifying fiber(s) during the entire pump pulse.","In some embodiments, the pump pulse is launched into the EDFA simultaneously with or after the signal pulse starts, and ends simultaneously with or before the signal pulse ends, in order to prevent energy accumulation in the EDFA, which helps maintain a constant amount of gain during the signal pulse. By continuing the signal pulse for a short time after the pump pulse ends, any residual pump energy will be drained into the signal output, which helps prevent build-up of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) (which is usually considered noise for some embodiments) between signal pulses. Such a configuration is particularly useful for relatively long signal pulses (i.e., pulses lasting several microseconds to several hundreds of microseconds). By starting the signal pulse before the pump pulse is turned on, there is no buildup of pump power (which would cause high gain at the beginning of the signal pulse, and thus result in pulse steepening), and thus the gain will be substantially constant during the time that the pump pulse is on.","In some embodiments, the present invention uses systems, components, and methods as described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,260,299 to Fabio Di Teodoro et al., titled \u201cMULTI-SEGMENT PHOTONIC-CRYSTAL-ROD WAVEGUIDES COUPLED ACROSS A FREE-SPACE GAP AND ASSOCIATED METHOD\u201d, which issued Aug. 21, 2007, and which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the systems, components, and methods as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,260,299 are modified to use erbium-only doping in large-core fibers and\/or photonic-crystal rods (PCRs) and\/or photonic-crystal fibers (PCFs), and L-band-wavelength optical signals and\/or pump-pulsing as described herein.","In some embodiments, large cores are used in the EDFA of the present invention, which in some embodiments, are multimode cores and in other embodiments, are single-mode large-more-area (LMA) cores in fibers, PCFs, or PCRs as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,260,299. The large core provides a large amplifying volume, allowing very large pulse energies by presenting very large numbers of ionized amplifying atoms (e.g., pumped erbium ions). Since the amount of gain is reduced by using signal wavelengths in the L-band (or other wavelengths that are not in the central highest-gain (C-band) wavelengths of erbium (or other rare-earth species, if those are used instead)), longer fiber lengths than those typically used for amplifying C-band wavelengths are used if higher gains are desired (e.g., when amplifying very short pulses to high powers and energies).","In some embodiments, a long pump pulse is launched into the EDFA well before and continuing until the signal pulse starts, and ends simultaneously with or slightly before or after the signal pulse ends, in order to obtain energy accumulation in the EDFA, which obtains high gain and puts very high amounts of power (e.g., 1 or more megawatts) into very short signal pulses, due to the high gain during the signal pulse. By using a long pump pulse and a short signal pulse at or near the end of the pump pulse, there is substantial build-up of pump power. Some embodiments include narrow-bandwidth optical filters between each of several stages, and\/or optical gating between each of several gain stages to prevent ASE buildup, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,260,299.","In order to apply the teachings of the present invention to other wavelengths, some embodiments replace erbium-only doping in the amplifying fiber with doping using another rare-earth element, and use signal wavelengths that are to one or the other side of the peak-gain wavelength of the rare-earth element being used, in order to obtain higher pulse energies (typically measured in joules, where 1 joule=1 watt-second=1 Newton-meter) in wavelengths other than erbium's L-band of wavelengths. Generally, the present invention works better when using a fiber having a core doped with one or another of the rare-earth elements and the fiber amplifier is operating in the L-band of the rare-earth element being used. Thus, in some embodiments, a fiber amplifier with a core doped with thulium is used, and amplifies a signal wavelength in thulium's L-band (i.e., a signal wavelength (e.g., of about 2 microns) that is longer than the wavelength of maximum gain for thulium). In other embodiments, a fiber amplifier with a core doped with ytterbium is used, and amplifies a signal wavelength in ytterbium's L-band (i.e., a signal wavelength (e.g., of about 1.12 microns) that is longer than the wavelength of maximum gain for ytterbium). In still other embodiments, a fiber amplifier with a core doped with another rare-earth element is used, and amplifies a signal wavelength in that rare-earth element's L-band (i.e., a signal wavelength that is longer than the wavelength of maximum gain for that rare-earth element).","In other embodiments, ytterbium-free erbium-doped fibers are used, but are driven with signal wavelengths shorter than erbium's C-band (i.e., signal wavelengths shorter than 1530 nm).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["101","101","110","112","110","113","110","115","116","115","114","115","116","199","111","115","115","116","116","116","116","199"]},"In some embodiments, as described in U.S. Pat.

Long-distance LADAR requires high-power laser pulses, such as are provided by some embodiments of the present invention. The L-band wavelengths provided by the present invention are particularly attractive for some embodiments of LADAR systems, since much of the L-band radiation is absorbed primarily in the front of the eye, thus preventing it from reaching and damaging the retina. Other uses include materials processing, such as laser-heat treating of surfaces, laser welding, laser ablation, and laser cutting. Still other embodiments include medical treatments, since many human tissues are strongly absorbent in L-band radiation (particularly those tissues that absorb wavelengths of 1.55 to 1.60 microns).","Some embodiments of the present invention utilize low-gain optical-amplifier structures. The fact that these are low gain allows much more energy to be pumped into the active gain medium, such that when a signal pulse arrives, much energy is available. In contrast, when using high-gain media, ASE (amplified spontaneous emission) is readily amplified by high-gain media, and therefore depletes the stored energy before the signal pulse can come in and utilize that energy by being amplified by it.","Our studies demonstrated the viability of 20 mJ energy and 140 W average power targets for modulated pulses of 10-40 microsecond (\u03bcs) durations in a double-clad Yb-free erbium amplifier, operating in the L-band and using pulsed pumping. Specifically: pulse pumping enables energy extraction beyond the steady-state energy storage limits while also alleviating pulse distortion under heavy saturation and the parasitic Q-switching common when cw pumped amplifiers are operated at low repetition frequencies. L-band operation (1570-1610 nm), which can be considered as a result of the low peak powers, is more efficient than C-band (1530-1565 nm) operation because of greater pump absorption. L-band amplifiers can store twice the energy of a C-band amplifier for a given pump power. L-band operation also reduces pulse distortion. Pulse distortion can also be controlled by adjustment of fiber length and timing of pump pulses relative to the signal pulses. This timing cannot be adjusted for cw pumping, further validating the pulse pumping approach and ruling out the possibility of maintaining good pulse fidelity with cw pumping for some embodiments. (Other embodiments that use longer fibers to obtain enough gain can use cw or quasi-cw pumping and very short signal pulses (e.g., signal pulses between 1 ns (or shorter that one ns) and less than about 10 ns to avoid SBS) to obtain very high output power (1 MW or more) while using L-band signal wavelengths.) In some embodiments, the necessary gain for certain applications can be achieved in an amplifier using a plurality of gain stages (e.g., a five-stage amplifier in some embodiments) with gain partitioning e.g., at 12 dB per stage, in some embodiments) and increasing core diameter of the fibers from stage to stage. Modulation (e.g., sine-wave nodulation or chirped sine-wave modulation) imposed on the seed signal during the long pulses is shown to be preserved in the amplifier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},"We have found that operation in the L-band is optimum for certain applications in that some embodiments provide more energy. These results are seen in the plot of pulse energy versus pulse number in  and the plot of the distortion ratio versus pulse number in  for an optimized L-band (25-meter fiber with signal wavelength at 1590 nm) compared to a C-band amplifier (10-meter fiber with signal wavelength at 1550 nm). Clearly for some embodiments, L-band operation provides a superior operating point and design baseline for certain embodiments needing high pulse energy and low distortion.","Before reaching this conclusion, several model runs were made with operation at 1550 nm and 10-meter fiber.

We show by modeling that efficiency and energy storage enhancement is achieved by operating at 1590 nm in the L-band wavelength range. We further demonstrate advantages of the pulse pumping concept. This provides three major benefits, namely (1) removal of pulse distortions at high energy extraction, (2) avoidance of transient induced Q-switching at low rep-rates, and (3) opportunity to overdrive the pump diodes at up to three times the rated power.

To reach eye safe wavelengths, we must employ laser materials that operate directly in the eye safe region or use nonlinear conversion techniques. One of Aculight's commercial products in 1996 was a periodically poled LiNbOoptical parametric converter for pulsed 1064 nm lasers, and an eye-safe fiber laser heads Aculight's product line today for 3D range-gated imaging. It has been demonstrated that a diode-pumped fiber laser provides twice the efficiency compared with what has been obtained with optical parametric conversion of 1-micron sources. Materials that lase directly in the eye-safe region, such as Er:glass, are possibilities, but have serious limitations in terms of handling the average power conditions and beam quality. We therefore sought an approach based on optical fiber.","The wavelength range of 1480-1600 nm dictates that a fiber-based amplifier should be based on either a trivalent erbium or a thulium rare-earth doped fiber amplifier, or perhaps a Raman fiber amplifier. Thulium amplifiers have been shown to operate with reasonable efficiency in the 1480 nm to 1510 nm region, but due to the need for a low-phonon energy environment to date only fluoride based glasses or other phonon engineered multi-component glasses have been employed (see \u201cKomukai et al. 1995\u201d and \u201cSamson et al. 2000\u201d, cited above). These glasses are not considered mature enough for high power applications with the development currently only targeting so-called S-band amplifiers for wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) telecom applications at modest power.","Raman amplification is also worthy of consideration (see Stolen et al. 1973 cited above). For example, a high energy high power Yb amplifier operating at 1060 nm could be shifted to the desired wavelength range in a multi-pass Raman amplifier. This would require the development of a 1060 nm laser with power and energy at least four (4) times the specification (to allow for the efficiency of the Raman converter) as well as specially engineered Raman gain fiber, fiber Bragg gratings and pulse synchronization techniques. The complexity, high initial cost and concerns about nonlinearities, such as self phase modulation, stimulated Brillouin scattering and cross-gain modulation, were reasons to reject this approach.","We therefore decided to base our approach on a trivalent erbium-doped silica-based amplifier. This left one major technology decision, namely whether to employ an energy transfer-pumping scheme with Yb co-doping or to directly pump the erbium ions. Our choice was to directly pump the erbium ions. Our reasoning for this is summarized in the following Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Relative merits of Er and Er:Yb double-clad amplifiers"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["TECHNICAL ISSUE","ERBIUM","ERBIUM\/YTTERBIUM"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Pump wavelength","976 \u00b1 5 nm","976 \u00b1 2 nm or 920 \u00b1 20 nm"]},{"entry":["Pump brightness required","High","Low (approx factor 4 lower)"]},{"entry":["Efficiency","Typically >40%","Typically <30%"]},{"entry":["Operating wavelength","1550-1605 nm","1535-1615 nm"]},{"entry":["Composition\/reproducibility","Alumino-silicate\/good","Phospho-silicate\/poor"]},{"entry":["Power dynamic range","Limited by pump power only","Also limited by energy transfer"]},{"entry":["Transient performance","Management techniques","bottlenecking Parasitic giant pulse"]},{"entry":[{},"available","formation at 1060 nm is a failure"]},{"entry":[{},{},"mechanism"]},{"entry":["Beam quality","Low NA designs enable","Inherently high NA so beam quality"]},{"entry":[{},"differential bend loss modal","degrades more rapidly with increased"]},{"entry":[{},"discrimination","core diameter"]},{"entry":["Energy storage","Low NA limits ASE","High NA increases ASE limiting"]},{"entry":[{},"allowing greater storage","energy storage"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Some key factors influencing our choice were the better efficiency, higher energy storage and absence of power-limiting energy-transfer bottlenecking (see Townsend et al. 1973). From a manufacturing standpoint, the easier processing of Yb-free compositions is also a factor.","Design of Double-Clad EDFAs","Some embodiments call for average powers close to the highest reported in this wavelength band and pulse energies orders of magnitude higher than previously reported. We first looked at the design tradeoffs for pump absorption and gain of a double-clad EDFA. Erbium amplifiers (see Desurvire, E., -, John Wiley & Sons, 1994) are usually designed to operate either in the C-band between 1530 nm and 1565 nm at an inversion close to 0.63 or in the L-band between 1565 nm and 1605 nm at an inversion close to 0.38. It is also possible to operate in an intermediate band with an inversion close to 0.5. This, as might be expected, gives a gain peak between the C and L-bands at around 1565 nm. With a given fiber type, the L-band amplifier is typically six (6) times longer than a C-band amplifier. The intermediate band amplifier is typically twice as long as a C-band amplifier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"]},"It is clear that, from the point of view of efficient pump absorption, a double-clad EDFA operating in the intermediate or L-band will be easier to scale in power because larger ratios of cladding-to-core diameter ratio are permitted. The larger the cladding waveguide, the more multimode power can be coupled into the fiber.","Cladding Waveguide Requirements","The analysis above clearly indicates that a double-clad EDFA should have the smallest possible cladding waveguide dimensions. Of course the waveguide also needs to be large enough to enable coupling of the pump diodes. Our pump waveguide dimensions for the final stage of amplification are therefore driven by the average power requirements at the high repetition rate end of the specification.","At 20 mJ (modulated) pulse energy and 7 kHz rep-rate the average output power is 140 W. In some embodiments, our pump power requirements assume a modest 30% efficiency for approximately 500 W of coupled pump power.","The highest brightness pumps currently available commercially are manufactured by Limo (www.limo-microoptic.com) or Jenoptik (www.jenoptik.com) with candidate sources being 25-30 W pumps coupled to a 105-\u03bcm, 0.22 NA fiber or 90-W to 100-W pumps coupled to a 200-\u03bcm, 0.22 NA fiber. A bundle of five 100-W pumps should couple efficiently into a 200-\u03bcm 0.48 NA fiber, based on the simple principle of brightness conservation. Our design for some embodiments is, therefore, built around a fiber with a 200-\u03bcm cladding and a numerical aperture of 0.48.","Energy-Storage Estimates","The energy stored in an amplifier can be approximated by the difference in population inversions between small signal and saturated gains, scaled by the fiber length. An estimate the potential stored energy in each of the three amplifier types in the example is shown in . It was assumed to use a wavelength of 1530 nm in the C-Band, 1565 nm in the intermediate band and 1590 nm in the L-band. The necessary saturated gain of 12 dB was targeted and a typical maximum small signal gain of 40 dB for any wavelength within the band was assumed. The results are summarized in Table 3 for a core diameter of 70 microns. There is clearly an advantage, in some embodiments, of going to the L-band for increased energy storage and providing peak powers that do not cause unwanted nonlinearities.

Because the pulses are long compared to the \u03c4relaxation time, it is possible for the inversion level to stay high even when pumping at 980 nm if sufficiently high pump power is used. For comparison we also looked at pumping at 1480 nm.

This further validates our choice of an Yb-free fiber amplifier rather than an Er:Yb fiber amplifier, because the energy transfer rate from Yb to Erbium in Er:Yb fiber is of the order of the pulse durations. This bottlenecking would prevent pulsed pumping of Er:Yb fibers at the level required in this application.

To generate beam quality (e.g., M<2.8) some embodiments use the described novel large-core, low-NA, Er-doped fiber amplifier.

In some embodiments, a laser-illuminated range-gated imaging system is useful for imaging at long ranges and through obscurants (such as fog, smoke, mist, haze, rain and the like). Range-gated imaging permits imaging at long ranges while minimizing the effect of obscurants (fog, rain, or smoke) in the atmosphere. In some embodiments, range-gated imaging uses a pulsed laser to illuminate the scene while the reflected light is detected by a camera with a short exposure timeframe referred to as a gate. The gate has a delay (the minimum out-and-back time of the laser pulse measured from the launch of the laser pulse that illuminates the scene until the pulse returns from the closest object in the range of the gate) and a duration (the out-and-back time from the closest object in the scene to the most-distant object in the scene). The gate is delayed so imaging occurs at a particular range (to ignore reflections and scattering from objects closer than the range), and ends after a predetermined time (to ignore reflections and scattering from objects farther than the range); thus the image is only from the reflection of objects at that range. Laser range gating systems send out a pulsed laser beam to illuminate the scene; the reflected light is detected by a shortwave infrared (SWIR) camera with a short exposure time. The exposure time and a delay from the launch of the laser pulse are synchronized so that they can detect images within a certain range of distances. Long-range identification is important for military operations such as target identification and friend-versus-foe determination (called Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)). To acquire images at night, illuminators can be very useful. However, using illuminators in continuous-wave (CW) mode can blind the imaging system when obscurants such as dust, smoke, or fog are present, due to the backscattered light. Similarly, microscopic particles in water can obscure objects that are being imaged underwater. The range-gated imaging system removes these scattered reflections and allows imaging within the desired range only. One key to safe range-gated imaging is to employ laser sources in the SWIR band. These sources, such as popular 1550 nm lasers, are eye-safe, reducing potential harm to either combatants or noncombatants on the battlefield. In some embodiments, high-speed gated InGaAs SWIR imagers are used, such as are available from the Sensors Unlimited portion of the ISR Systems division of Goodrich Corporation. InGaAs also allows for an all-solid-state solution, using solid-state fiber lasers of the present invention instead of gas lasers, which reduces long-term maintenance and cost. A range-gated system images only the reflected light within a certain time period, which corresponds to a predetermined range of distances. Different ranges can be detected by varying the delay time and duration time; the images of objects at longer distances are better improved by adjusting (lengthening) the delay to ignore back-scattered light (due to obscurants such as haze and the like) between the camera and object being imaged, while objects at nearer distances are better imaged by adjusting (shortening) the duration of the gate to ignore back-scattered light from further than the object. In yet other embodiments, the round-trip travel time for the light pulse is measured as the transmitted laser beam is scanned over an object, to enable construction of a three-dimensional image of an object. In such embodiments, the time to the latest return pulse may be measured, to image an object which may be behind smoke, fog, foliage, or camouflage netting.","In some embodiments, the at least one erbium-doped fiber section is incorporated into a materials-processing system. The choice of using erbium-doped fiber and the choice of a particular L-band signal wavelength may be made, based on the particular material(s) being processed, because the output wavelength is more readily absorbed by the particular material(s) being processed than other wavelengths are absorbed. In other cases, the wavelength produced by the erbium-doped fiber may be preferentially absorbed by one or more components of the material being processed, while leaving other components of the material being processed unaffected or undamaged because they have weaker absorption at the signal wavelength produced by the fiber. In yet other cases, the large pulse energy of an L-band erbium fiber laser system can enable materials processing that would not be feasible using other types of fiber lasers producing less energy per pulse.","In some embodiments, the signal pulses have additional modulation (e.g., amplitude modulation that imposes a sine-wave modulation and\/or pulse modulation (fast changing) times a pulse-shape envelope (constant with its start time adjusted relative to the signal pulse and\/or slow changing to compensate for gain changes during the pulse) within the pulse envelope. This modulation can impose structure within a relatively long optical pulse, allowing finer range resolution in a LIDAR system than would be feasible with a single long, unstructured pulse. In materials processing applications, many shorter, higher-peak power pulses could be generated by modulating a pulse envelope of long duration, which can facilitate processing of some materials.","In some embodiments, at least one of the at least one erbium-doped fiber sections has a multimode core. By permitting the fiber core to be multimode, the fiber core can made be larger. This in turn will allow more energy to be stored in the fiber's core, and enable higher peak powers to be achieved as well.","In some embodiments, at least one of the at least one erbium-doped fiber sections has a pedestal profile in the core (such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/567,740 titled \u201cAPPARATUS AND METHOD FOR AN ERBIUM-DOPED FIBER FOR HIGH-PEAK-POWER APPLICATIONS\u201d by John D. Minelly, which is incorporated herein by reference), wherein the index of refraction next to the core is increased (the pedestal) and the index of the core itself is raised relative to the index of the pedestal.","In some embodiments, at least one of the at least one erbium-doped fiber sections has a photonic-crystal-fiber core. Photonic-crystal-fiber cores enable engineering of the index-of-refraction profile of the core beyond the limits usually possible with conventional cores. In conventional erbium-doped fibers, it is very difficult to create large-mode-area (LMA) fibers, because the erbium doping in the core (which is necessary to achieve amplification) causes a large index step with respect to the cladding index. This large step index in turn makes the fiber numerical aperture high, which for larger core diameters causes the core to be multimode. By engineering a photonic-crystal-core erbium-doped fiber to have a smaller index step between the core and the cladding, fewer modes will be supported (with proper engineering (such as described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,260,299, which is incorporated herein by reference), a single mode is supported), leading to better beam quality. In some embodiments, the erbium doping, pump pulsing, and L-band signal wavelengths are used in the various structures, systems and methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,260,299, and when so combined, these combinations form embodiments of the present invention.","In some embodiments, at least one of the at least one erbium-doped fiber sections has a flattened mode profile. Typical conventional optical fibers have mode profiles that resemble Gaussian shapes, with high intensity near the center of the core, falling off to lower intensity approaching the edge of the core. By tailoring the index profile, some embodiments provide a flatter shape to the signal mode, which then resembles a super-Gaussian or flat-top shape. In some embodiments, the present invention uses fiber profiles such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/556,658 titled \u201cAPPARATUS AND METHOD FOR A WAVEGUIDE WITH AN INDEX PROFILE MANIFESTING A CENTRAL DIP FOR BETTER ENERGY EXTRACTION\u201d by John D. Minelly et al, which is incorporated herein by reference. This allows more efficient energy extraction before the onset of nonlinear effects than can be achieved in a fiber without a flattened mode profile.","In some embodiments, a length of the fiber in the power amplifier stage(s) corresponds to absorption of between 300 dB and 2000 dB of small-signal inversion at the wavelength of peak absorption (e.g., small-signal inversion denoting a normalized length with respect to erbium concentration; for example, if the 1530 nm absorption in a fiber is 50 dB\/m, then 300 dB-2000 dB of small-signal inversion translates to absolute lengths of the power-amplifier fiber of between 6 and 40 m).","In some embodiments, the present invention provides an apparatus that includes an optical-fiber amplifier having at least one erbium-doped fiber section; and at least one source of optical pump light operatively coupled to the at least one erbium-doped fiber section, the apparatus operable to amplify signal pulses to high energy in the at least one erbium-doped fiber section, the signal pulses having a wavelength in the range of about 1565 nm to about 1630 nm.
