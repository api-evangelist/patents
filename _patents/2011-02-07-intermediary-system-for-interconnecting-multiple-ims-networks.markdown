{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/112,187, filed Apr. 30, 2008, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/915,730, filed on May 3, 2007, both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to telecommunications services. More particularly, the present invention relates to capabilities that enhance substantially the value and usefulness of various messaging paradigms including, inter alia, IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).","2. Background of the Invention","As the \u2018wireless revolution\u2019 continues to march forward the importance to a Mobile Subscriber (MS), for example a user of a Wireless Device (WD) such as a mobile telephone, a BlackBerry, etc. that is serviced by a Wireless Carrier (WC), of their WD grows substantially.","One consequence of such a growing importance is the resulting ubiquitous nature of WDs\u2014i.e., MSs carry them at almost all times and use them for an ever-increasing range of activities.","Coincident with the \u2018social explosion\u2019 of WDs technological advances have yielded, among other things, new communication paradigms such as IMS.","IMS is a standardized Next Generation Networking (NGN) architecture that, among other things, provides a framework for a collapsed mobile and fixed services infrastructure (e.g., a form of Fixed Mobile Convergence [FMC]) in support of, possibly inter alia, the ubiquitous delivery of a wide range of (voice, data, multimedia, etc.) services to end users (such as, among others, MSs).","Descriptions of the architecture, function, etc. of IMS may be found in various of the specification documents from the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) including, for example, Technical Specification 23.228.","The need exists for an infrastructure that allows the full universe of MSs, through their WDs, to seamlessly participate in the new communication environment\/paradigm IMS.","The present invention, aspects of which may be characterized as IMS Exchange or IMS, provides such capabilities and addresses various of the (not insubstantial) challenges that are associated with same. Among other things IMSmay:","1) Provide key interoperability capabilities across, among other entities, disparate fixed providers (such as, for example, landline carriers) and WCs.","2) Facilitate the seamless operation of important services such as, possibly inter alia, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) across multiple networks, platforms, etc.","3) Provide legacy support (thus, as just one possibility, potentially extending the useful life of various elements of a WC's infrastructure, various legacy WDs, etc.).","In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided an intermediary system for interconnecting multiple IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) networks. The system includes at least one input unit selectably connectable to a first IMS network from which a message is received, at least one output unit selectably connectable to a second IMS network through which said message can reach a destination address, and a process, routing, and switching (PRS) complex operable to manipulate aspects of, and alter at least a portion of, said message received from said input unit and sent to said output unit. In a preferred embodiment, the PRS complex performs a routing operation based on a destination address of said message.","These and other features of the embodiments of the present invention, along with their attendant advantages, will be more fully appreciated upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the associated drawings.","It should be understood that these figures depict embodiments of the invention. Variations of these embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the teachings contained herein.","Aspects of the present invention build atop, and extend substantively, the concept of a centrally-located, full-featured MICV facility. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901 entitled \u201cINTERMEDIARY NETWORK SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING MESSAGE EXCHANGE BETWEEN WIRELESS NETWORKS,\u201d and its associated continuations, for a description of a MICV, a summary of various of the services\/functions\/etc. that are performed by a MICV, and a discussion of the numerous advantages that arise from same.","As depicted in  and reference numeral  a MICV  may be disposed between, possibly inter alia, multiple WCs (WC\u2192WC) on one side and multiple Service Providers (SP, SP\u2192SP) on the other side thus \u2018bridging\u2019 all of the connected entities. A MICV  thus, as one simple example, may offer various routing, formatting, delivery, value-add, etc. capabilities that provide, possibly inter alia:","1) A WC (WC\u2192WC and, by extension, all of the MSs \u2192, \u2192, \u2192 that are serviced by the WC WC\u2192WC) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of SPs SP\u2192SP, and","2) A SP SP\u2192Sp with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of WCs (WC\u2192WC and, by extension, to all of the MSs \u2192, \u2192, \u2192 that are serviced by the WCs WC\u2192WC).","Generally speaking a MICV may have varying degrees of visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to the (MS E\u2190\u2192MS, MS\u2190\u2192SP, etc.) messaging traffic:","1) A WC may elect to route just their out-of-network messaging traffic to a MICV. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to just the portion of the WC's messaging traffic that was directed to the MICV by the WC.","2) A WC may elect to route all of their messaging traffic to a MICV. The MICV may, possibly among other things, subsequently return to the WC that portion of the messaging traffic that belongs to (i.e., that is destined for a MS of) the WC. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to all of the WC's messaging traffic.","IMSx extends the concept of a centrally-located, full-featured MICV by abstracting away, and to the extent possible isolating away, all of the complexities, inherent incompatibilities, etc. that are associated with IMS. IMSprovides, among other things, a single protocol, interface, etc. agnostic access or connection point into which different entities within an IMS ecosystem (for example, possibly inter alia, carriers) may \u2018plug.\u2019","To help illustrate aspects of IMS's single access\/connection point consider IMS\u2032 three logical planes (as illustrated in  and reference numeral ):","1) Services Plane . For example, one or more Application Server (AS) instances , Billing facilities , Reporting facilities , etc.","2) Control Plane . For example, a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) capability , a Call Session Control Function (CSCF) capability , one or more Media Gateway (MG) instances , etc.","3) Network or Transport Plane . Support, interfaces, etc. for, possibly inter alia, Voice over IP (VoIP) , WiFi , Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) , Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) , etc.","As illustrated in  and reference numeral  the different functional elements of an entity (e.g., carriers such as C\u2192C, etc.) within an IMS ecosystem may plug in to IMS's single access\/connection point \u2014e.g., elements of carrier C's  Control Plane and Network or Transport Plane may plug in to IMS's single access\/connection point \u2192, elements of carrier C's  Services Plane may plug into IMS's single access\/connection point . Similar access points may be realized at \u2192.","As illustrated in  and reference numeral  the single access\/connection point  serves much like a fa\u00e7ade, behind which connected entities (e.g., carriers such as C\u2192C, etc.) may access one or more of the virtual implementations of IMS\u2032 logical planes \u2192.","Thus, for example, as a carrier's environment grows and changes, as a carrier's business needs and models change and evolve, as a carrier deploys new service offerings, etc. it can, possibly among other things, plug into (and thus take advantage of the features and functions that are offered by) different combinations of the virtual implementations of IMS\u2032 logical planes all through the single access\/communication point.","Additionally, placing the virtual planes behind a single fa\u00e7ade allows for, possibly among other things, ongoing and dynamic changes, updates, etc. to the physical implementation of a plane without any impact on, or interruptions to, any of the connected entities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500","sub":"X"},"1) Carriers, Networks, Providers, etc. . The full universe of users (such as, possibly inter alia, MSs) of User Equipment (UE) -UE\u2192UE, such as for example mobile telephones, computers, Blackberrys and PalmPilots, etc.\u2014are supported by carriers, networks, providers, etc. The carriers, networks, providers, etc.  may connect to IMS(which is shown, generally, below the carriers, networks, providers, etc. layer , and which would fit within, e.g., element  of ) using the single access\/communication point that was described above and then, possibly inter alia, exchange traffic with IMSover any combination of a range of communication channels\u2014e.g., Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\/Internet Protocol (IP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\/IP, Signaling System Number 7 (SS7), etc.\u2014using any combination of a range of protocols\u2014e.g., SIP, Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP), MM4. etc. .","2) Protocol . A Protocol Engine (PE) Complex  may house a dynamically updateable set of one or more PEs (PE\u2192PE in the diagram). A PE may, for example, leverage a body of flexible, extensible, and dynamically updateable configuration information as it completes its tasks, including possibly inter alia:","A) Receiving incoming and sending outgoing traffic using any combination of the supported communication protocols, paradigms, etc.","B) Performing various extraction, validation, editing, formatting, conversion, etc. operations on the elements of an incoming and\/or outgoing data stream\u2014e.g., source address, destination address, encoding indicators or flags, payload or body, etc. The specific elements that were just described are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other elements are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","C) Encapsulating various elements of an incoming data stream within an internal (i.e., intra-IMS) artifact and\/or un-encapsulating various elements of an outgoing data stream from an internal artifact. An exemplary internal artifact is depicted in  and reference numeral . Such an artifact  may include a header  that includes various information , such as a type, or identifier, properties  that include other information  such as source address, destination address, and\/or date\/time for a given message, and a body  that may contain the contents of the body of an original message.","The catalog of PE processing steps that was described above is illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other processing steps are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","3) Processing, Routing, Switching (PRS) . A Switching Complex (SC)  may house, possibly inter alia, a dynamically updateable set of one or more SC Directors  (SCD, SCD\u2192SCD in the diagram), a dynamically updateable set of one or more Queues  (Q\u2192Q in the diagram), and a Cross Complex Highway (CCH) .","A dynamically updateable set of one or more Queues (e.g., Q\u2192Q) may operate as intermediate or temporary buffers for incoming and outgoing traffic.","A CCH  may consist of a rotating \u2018buffer\u2019 containing a configurable number of Time Slots (TS\u2192TS in the diagram) that may be utilized for, possibly inter alia, the rapid redirection of traffic when, for example, no further substantive processing, routing, etc. of that traffic is required. For example, a SCD  may deposit incoming traffic that was received from a PE (e.g., PE\u2192PE) on to one or more TSs (e.g., TS\u2192TS) on a CCH  and, as the CCH  \u2018rotates\u2019 or \u2018spins\u2019, a SCD  (e.g., the same SCD or another SCD) may at the appropriate point remove traffic from those TSs (e.g., TS\u2192TS) for return to a PE (e.g., PE\u2192PE).","A SCD  may handle incoming traffic and outgoing traffic and may, possibly inter alia:","A) Selectively deposit incoming traffic (e.g., traffic received from a PE [e.g., PE\u2192PE]) on one or more Queues (e.g., Q\u2192Q) for subsequent processing by a PRS Engine (PRSE) .","B) Selectively remove processed traffic from one or more Queues (e.g., Q\u2192Q) for return to a PE (e.g., PE\u2192PE).","C) Selectively deposit incoming traffic (e.g., traffic received from a PE [e.g., PE\u2192PE]) on one or more TSs (e.g., TS\u2192TS) on a CCH .","D) Selectively remove traffic from one or more TSs (e.g., TS\u2192TS) on a CCH  for return to a PE (e.g., PE\u2192PE).","The catalog of SCD activities that was described above is illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other activities are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","A PRSE Complex  may house a dynamically updateable set of one or more PRSEs (PRSE\u2192PRSE in the diagram).","A PRSE (e.g., PRSE\u2192PRSE) may be workflow-based, with a dynamically updateable set of one or more workflows removing incoming traffic from a Queue (e.g., Q\u2192Q), performing all of the required processing operations (explained below), and depositing processed artifacts on a Queue (e.g., Q\u2192Q). Through flexible, extensible, and dynamically updatable configuration information a workflow component may be quickly and easily realized to support any number of activities. For example, workflows might be configured to remove an item from a Queue (e.g., Q\u2192Q); deposit an item on a Queue (e.g., Q\u2192Q); perform one or more lookup operations in support of traffic routing; implement aspects of a logical IMS plane; etc. The specific workflows that were just described are exemplary only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other workflow arrangements, alternatives, etc. are easily possible.","A PRSE (e.g., PRSE\u2192PRSE) may leverage a comprehensive, flexible, scalable, etc. lookup facility (indicated, albeit at a very high level, as Routing Data  in the diagram) to support, possibly inter alia, its traffic routing operations. Such a lookup facility may provide authoritative answers to inquiries like \u201cAt this moment in time what carrier services the Telephone Number (TN) 1-703-555-1212?\u201d, \u201cWhat entity services the SIP address sip: john.doe @bigcompany.com?\u201d, etc. Among other things such a lookup facility may address (1) the complexities that are associated with all of the different TN numbering plans, schemes, etc. that exist around the world; (2) the complexities that arise with worldwide Mobile Number Portability (MNP) regimes; etc. A more detailed depiction of such a lookup facility is presented in  and reference numeral . Such a lookup facility may consist of, possibly inter alia:","A) An Electronic Numbering (ENUM) fa\u00e7ade  through which various PRSEs (E\u2192 in the diagram) may connect, submit routing inquiries, receive routing responses, etc.","B) A dynamically updateable set of one or more In-Memory Databases (In-Memory Database\u2192In-Memory Database in the diagram) that optionally house or host selected data (including, possibly inter alia, data from a Composite Routing Database [CRD] ) to provide, as one example, optimal performance.","C) A Real-Time Query Facility (RTQF)  through which inquiries may be dispatched real-time to authoritative bodies (such as, for example, TN assignment administrators) around the world. A RTQF  may support multiple communication channels, paradigms, protocols, etc. (such as, possibly inter alia, SS7 , TCP\/IP , UDP\/IP, SMPP , etc.).","D) A CRD  containing comprehensive routing information for, possibly inter alia, TNs within all of the different TN numbering plans, schemes, etc. that exist around the world. A CRD  may receive updates (e.g., dynamically, on a scheduled basis, etc.) from any number of sources or feeds including, possibly inter alia, domestic  (such as, for example, from a Local Exchange Routing Guide [LERG], from one or more Number Portability Administration Centers [NPACs], etc.) and international  (such as, for example, from Hong Kong, from the United Kingdom, etc.).","With reference again to , the catalog of PRS processing activities that was described above is illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other processing steps are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","4) Persistence . A Database (DB) Complex  may house a dynamically updateable set of one or more DBs (DB\u2192DB in the diagram). A DB (e.g., DB\u2192DB) may contain a range of data or information including, possibly inter alia, Transaction Detail Records (TDRs, which may capture elements or aspects of all of the traffic is processed by IMS); selected details of all administrative, processing, etc. activities; etc.","A Data Warehouse (DW) Complex  may house a dynamically updateable set of one or more DWs (DW\u2192DW in the diagram). A DW (e.g., DW\u2192DW) may be fed by, possibly inter alia, a suite of flexible, extensible, and dynamically updatable Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL), Universal Rating Engine (URE, described further below), etc. facilities  that may pull data or information from, possibly among other sources, one or more DBs (e.g., DB\u2192DB).","The DBs (e.g., DB\u2192DB) and DWs (e.g., DW\u2192DW) that are depicted are logical representations of the possibly multiple physical repositories that may be implemented to support, inter alia, configuration, word catalog, calculation, etc. information. The physical repositories may be implemented through any combination of conventional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) such as Sybase or Oracle, through Object Database Management Systems (ODBMSs), through in-memory Database Management Systems (DBMSs), through specialized data repositories, or through any other equivalent facilities.","5) Administration . An Administrator  may provide management for or \u2018command and control\u2019 over all of the different IMSelements through, as one example, a Web-based interface. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other interfaces (e.g., data feed, Application Programming Interface [API], etc.) are easily possible.","Additionally, an Administrator may provide access to the body of flexible, extensible, and dynamically updateable configuration information that all of the different IMSelements rely upon.","An Administration layer or tier may provide comprehensive reporting facilities . Such reporting facilities may leverage, possibly inter alia, one or more DBs (e.g., DB\u2192DB) and\/or one or more DWs (e.g., DW\u2192DW) to generate scheduled (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, etc.) and\/or on-demand reporting with report results delivered (to, for example, a MS or a WC or a MICV or others) through Short Message Service (SMS)\/Multimedia Message Service (MMS)\/IMS\/etc. messages; through Electronic Mail (E-Mail); through Instant Messenger (IM); through a World Wide Web (WWW)-based facility; through an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) facility; via File Transfer Protocol [FTP]; through an API; etc. Generated reports may contain, possibly inter alia, textual and graphic elements.","The specific IMSlayer or tier arrangement that was described above is illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other arrangements are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","Beyond providing basic IMS support and services IMSmay offer, among other things, additional (e.g., value-add) features and functions such as, possibly inter alia:","1) Billing. Support for a comprehensive array of billing (e.g. rating, etc.) activities. Such billing activities may leverage a URE to flexibly and dynamically rate events (where an event may include, possibly inter alia, some aspect of incoming traffic, some activity by a PRSE, etc.). A URE may evaluate any number of items as it rates an event, including for example:","A) One or more TDRs.","B) One or more charging models, pricing plans, etc. (that may consider, possibly inter alia, origination [such as, for example, carrier, TN, SIP address, etc.], destination [such as, for example, carrier, TN, SIP address, etc.], surcharges and discounts, date, day of week, time, volume, etc.).","C) One or more flexible, extensible, and dynamically configurable Point in Transaction (PiT) hooks. At a PiT hook one or more processing actions (e.g., a calculation, a call out to an external system, etc.) may be completed.","A URE may preserve the results of a rated event in, possibly inter alia, one or more TDRs.","2) Support for public and private IP addresses.","3) Support for, possibly inter alia, IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6).","4) Support for variable Quality of Service (QoS) levels each level having, possibly inter alia, different cost\/charging paradigms. For example, different QoS levels may be established for different classes of traffic, etc.\u2014e.g., one QoS level for voice traffic (such as VoIP), another QoS level for interactive video, another QoS level for streaming video, another QoS level for image and text exchanges (through vehicles such as SMS and MMS), etc.","5) Filtering. Support for, possibly inter alia, zero, one, or multiple Black List and\/or White List artifacts; malware (e.g., virus) detection; spam detection; etc. Each filtering option may have, possibly inter alia, one or more cost\/charging paradigms.","6) Sandbox. The ability to create one or more \u2018sandboxes\u2019 or \u2018experimentation areas\u2019 wherein an entity (such as, for example, a carrier) may conduct controlled development activities, perform testing, complete evaluation efforts, conduct demonstrations, etc. A sandbox option may have, possibly inter alia, one or more cost\/charging paradigms.","7) Augmentation. Support for the selective addition, insertion, etc. in to the processed traffic of:","A) Informational elements\u2014e.g., a service announcement, a relevant or applicable factoid, etc. An informational element may be selected statically (e.g., the same informational text is used), selected randomly (e.g., informational text is randomly selected from a pool of available informational text), or location-based (i.e., informational text is selected from a pool of available informational text based on the current physical location of a source and\/or recipient [e.g., a MS\u2032 WD] as derived from, as one example, a Location-Based Service [LBS] or similar facility).","B) Advertising content\u2014e.g., textual material, multimedia (images of brand logos, sound, video snippets, etc.) material, etc. containing advertisements, promotional materials, coupons, etc. The advertising material may be selected statically (e.g., the same advertising material is used), selected randomly (e.g., advertising material is randomly selected from a pool of available material), or location-based (i.e., advertising material is selected from a pool of available material based on the current physical location of a source and\/or recipient [e.g., a MS\u2032 WD] as derived from, as one example, a LBS or similar facility). IMSmay optionally allow advertisers to register and\/or provide (e.g., directly, or through links\/references to external sources) advertising content.","It is important to note that the hypothetical example that was presented above, which was described in the narrative and which was illustrated in the accompanying figures, is exemplary only and was presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous alternatives, variations, modifications, etc. to the presented example are easily possible and, indeed, are fully within the scope of the present invention.","The following list defines acronyms as used in this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Acronym","Meaning"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"API","Application Programming Interface"]},{"entry":[{},"AS","Application Server"]},{"entry":[{},"CCH","Cross Complex Highway"]},{"entry":[{},"CRD","Composite Routing Database"]},{"entry":[{},"CSCF","Call Session Control Function"]},{"entry":[{},"DB","Database"]},{"entry":[{},"DBMS","Database Management System"]},{"entry":[{},"DSL","Digital Subscriber Line"]},{"entry":[{},"DW","Data Warehouse"]},{"entry":[{},"E-Mail","Electronic Mail"]},{"entry":[{},"ENUM","Electronic Numbering"]},{"entry":[{},"ETL","Extraction.
