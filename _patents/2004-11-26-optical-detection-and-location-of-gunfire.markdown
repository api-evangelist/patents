{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein maybe manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to weapon fire detection, and more particularly to a hemispherical field-of-view optical system and method for the detection and location of sniper gunfire.","2. Description of the Related Art","Snipers present a significant hazard to deployed soldiers and to the public at large. Single-shot gunfire events are difficult to locate, thus snipers tend to escape detection and, in the absence of credible detection and retaliation capability, constitute a repetitive and dangerous hazard. A sniper shot can be detected both by the muzzle blast and by the bullet shock wave. A conventional acoustic array can determine the direction and range from which the shot is fired with reasonable accuracy, and may provide classification and possible identification of the weapon based on acoustic signatures. Acoustic systems may also detect supersonic bullets, and provide additional discrimination against noise (i.e., fireworks, blanks, etc.). Usually, conventional optical weapon fire detection systems sense the optical energy released or generated when a weapon is discharged.","Acoustic and optical gunfire detection and location systems exist, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,936,822 issued to Hirschberg on Feb. 3, 1976, U.S. Pat. No. 5,970,024 issued to Smith on Oct. 19, 1999, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,215,731 issued to Smith on Apr. 10, 2001, the complete disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. Generally, acoustic systems use multiple widely spaced microphones with algorithms, which use relative detection times to obtain an approximate direction of the gunfire event, for providing a probable classification and identification of the weapon used. However, acoustic systems generally provide an approximate line-of-bearing with an approximate range. Therefore, the location of the sniper shooter may not be sufficiently precise to accurately return defensive fire.","Further, optical systems may not provide a very wide field-of-view, thereby limiting the probability of detecting gunfire at any given moment. Generally, optical systems exploit spectral signatures of gunfire, which can enhance detection and reduce false alarms. The lack of an efficient wide field-of-view optical weapon fire detection system may be a significant handicap in current military operations as well as in pseudo-military and non-military settings.","Therefore, there is a need for an improved very wide field-of-view optical system capable of detecting, documenting, and identifying gunfire events, which can accurately determine the direction of the gunfire and provide necessary information for effective retaliation.","In view of the foregoing, the invention comprises an optical gunfire detection system comprising an image-capturing device operable for detecting light, wherein the light comprises any of ultraviolet, visible, or infrared light; a narrowband Fraunhofer line filter connected to the image-capturing device, and operable for partially restricting transmission of the light; a quadric reflector operable for transmitting images to the image-capturing device, wherein the quadric reflector is capable of providing a field-of-view of 360 degrees azimuth and at varying elevations with respect to the horizon. Quadric surfaces include spheres, paraboloids, hyperboloids, and ellipsoids, and will be exemplified hereafter by a convex paraboloid. Such surfaces have one or more axes of radial symmetry and a corresponding azimuthal plane perpendicular to each symmetry axis. The invention also comprises a lens system, wherein the lens system is positioned along the symmetry axis of the parabolic reflector and provides a circular field-of-view centered on the symmetry axis; an image storage device connected to the image-capturing device, wherein the image storage device comprises a solid-state digital memory unit operable to store multiple seconds of video imagery; a real-time computer implemented mechanism connected to the image storage device, the computer-implemented mechanism operable for detecting locations of gunfire associated with the images and classifying the type of weapon used; an acoustic device in communication with the computer-implemented mechanism, and operable for verifying the classifications of the gunfire; a position or designator laser operable for identifying the locations of the gunfire; and a defense mechanism comprising the designator laser and operable to defend against a source of the gunfire. The reflector and lens system cooperate to provide a nearly spherical field of view coverage for detection of possible gunshot events.","The real-time computer implemented mechanism comprises a program storage device readable by computer, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the computer to perform a method of weapon identification, wherein the method comprises identifying a potential gunfire event; determining optical signatures of the gunfire event, wherein the optical signatures comprise spectral, spatial, and temporal optical signatures; comparing the optical signatures with known signatures of known gunfire events; and correlating optical gunfire event detection, classification, and identification with acoustic gunfire event detection, classification, and identification to identify a weapon producing the gunfire.","The optical gunfire detection system may further comprise a mirror, wherein the mirror is positioned along an axis of the parabolic reflector, and wherein the mirror provides an increased resolution of the images; and a zoom lens positioned between the mirror and the image-capturing device, wherein the zoom lens provides an increased magnification and resolution of the images.","The invention also comprises a method of detecting sniper gunfire comprising observing images in a field-of-view using a convex parabolic reflector; transmitting the images to an image-capturing device, wherein the image-capturing device detects light, wherein the light comprises any of ultraviolet, visible, or infrared light; storing the images in an image storage device, wherein the image storage device comprises a solid-state digital memory unit operable to store multiple seconds of video imagery; using a real-time computer-implemented mechanism connected to the image storage device to detect locations and classifications of gunfire associated with the images; verifying the classifications of the gunfire using an acoustic device in communication with the computer-implemented mechanism; and identifying the locations of the gunfire using a position or designator laser. The method further comprises partially restricting transmission of the light using a narrowband Fraunhofer line filter; providing an azimuthal field-of-view of 360-degrees using the convex parabolic reflector; defending against a source of the gunfire using a defense mechanism; providing an axial field-of-view using a lens system, wherein the lens system is positioned along an axis of the parabolic reflector; and increasing the resolution of the images using a mirror, wherein the mirror is positioned along the symmetry axis of the parabolic reflector. Also, the method comprises increasing the magnification and resolution of the images using a zoom lens positioned in between the mirror and the image-capturing device.","The invention provides a relatively simple optical system with a very large view of the surrounding environment and with digital video storage capabilities for detecting sniper gunfire. Also, the invention provides optical confirmation of a gunfire event by using an acoustic device in communication with a computer-implemented mechanism, thereby reducing false alarms. Moreover, the invention provides verification of the direction from which the shot was fired with improved accuracy and precision. Additionally, the invention provides the approximate range to the shooter based on the time from the optically detected muzzle flash to the acoustic detection of the associated sound. Furthermore, the invention provides a digital video image of the gunfire location, providing a means for locating and pursuing the shooter, and for retaliation. In addition to the above, the invention also provides for the classification and identification of the weapon used based on the combination of optical and acoustic, spectral, spatial, and temporal signatures.","These and other aspects and advantages of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, is given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.","The invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.","As previously mentioned, there is a need for a very large field-of-view optical system and video capturing mechanism for image storage to detect and document gunfire events, and to provide means for identification of and retaliation against a sniper or shooter. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there are shown preferred embodiments of the invention.","As illustrated in , an embodiment of the invention provides an optical gunfire detection system  comprising an image-capturing device  operable for detecting light, wherein the light comprises any of ultraviolet, visible, or infrared light; a narrowband Fraunhofer line filter  connected to the image-capturing device , and operable for partially restricting transmission of the light; a convex parabolic reflector  operable for transmitting images to the image-capturing device , wherein the convex parabolic reflector  is capable of providing an azimuthal field-of-view  of 360 degrees; a lens system , wherein the lens system  is positioned along the axis  of the convex parabolic reflector . In , the system  is orientated in an upward position with the axis  of the system pointed vertically so that the lens system  provides a vertical field-of-view  about the zenith and the parabolic reflector provides a 360 degree field-of-view  including the entire horizon. The gunfire detection system also includes an image storage device  connected to the image-capturing device , wherein the image storage device  comprises a solid-state digital memory unit  operable to store multiple seconds of video imagery; a real-time computer-implemented mechanism  connected to the image storage device , wherein the computer-implemented mechanism  is operable for detecting locations and classifications of gunfire associated with the images .","The system  further comprises an acoustic device  in communication with the computer-implemented mechanism , and operable for verifying the classifications of the gunfire; a position laser or laser designator  operable for identifying the locations of the gunfire; and a defense mechanism  comprising the laser designator  and operable to defend against a source of the gunfire. The defense mechanism  preferably is in communication with the computer-implemented mechanism .  illustrates various lines-of-sight as indicated by the dotted lines and illustrates the reflective  and refractive  fields-of-view (FOV).","In the systems  and  shown in , the parabolic shape of the parabolic reflector  is a member of a family of quadrics. A quadric is a quadratic surface, defined by equations of second degree in three variables, including spheres, paraboloids, ellipsoids, and hyperboloids. Thus, while the reflector  is shown as a convex parabolic reflector in the preferred embodiments of , a more general description of the reflector would be a quadric reflector. The quadric reflectors have at least one axis of symmetry. In , the axis of symmetry  is the vertical dashed line in the middle of the figure and extending through the middle of the reflector  and pointed at the center of the camera. In  the axis of symmetry  is similarly shown. If the axis of symmetry is oriented vertically (e.g. pointed toward the zenith), a 360 degree azimuth angle includes the entire horizon. A vertical orientation of the systems ,  would be one preferred operating position for use of the systems.","The function of a Fraunhofer line filter is to eliminate the solar background. Only a narrow range of wavelengths is transmitted, specifically that in which the intensity of sunlight is very low (see Fundamentals of Optics, by Jenkins and White, McGraw-Hill, 1957 and also at www.daystarfilters.com). This allows detection of a moderately bright light source without having an intense solar background interfering with the measurement\/detection","In a second embodiment shown in , an optical gunfire detection system  comprises an image-capturing device  operable for detecting light, wherein the light comprises any of ultraviolet, visible, or infrared light; a narrowband Fraunhofer line filter  connected to the image-capturing device , and operable for partially restricting transmission of the light; a convex parabolic reflector  operable for transmitting images to the image-capturing device , wherein the convex parabolic reflector  is capable of providing an azimuthal field-of-view  of 360-degrees; an image storage device  connected to the image-capturing device , wherein the image storage device  comprises a solid-state digital memory unit  operable to store multiple seconds of video imagery.","The system  further comprises a real-time computer-implemented mechanism  connected to the image storage device , the computer-implemented mechanism  operable for detecting locations and classifications of gunfire associated with the images; an acoustic device  in communication with the computer-implemented mechanism , and operable for verifying the classifications of the gunfire; a laser designator  operable for identifying the locations of the gunfire; and a defense mechanism  comprising the laser designator  and operable to defend against a source of the gunfire.","Further, the system  comprises a lens system , wherein the lens system  is positioned along an axis  of the convex parabolic reflector  and provides an axial field-of-view  about the axis  (or about the zenith with a vertical orientation of the system ); a mirror , wherein the mirror  is positioned along an axis  of the convex parabolic reflector , and wherein the mirror  provides an increased resolution within the axial field-of-view ; and a zoom lens  positioned between the mirror  and the image-capturing device , wherein the zoom lens  provides an increased magnification and resolution of the images.  illustrates various lines-of-sight as indicated by the dotted lines and illustrates the reflective  and refractive  fields-of-view (FOV).","A flow diagram illustrating a preferred method of the invention is shown in , wherein the method of detecting sniper gunfire comprises observing  images , , ,  in a field-of-view using a convex parabolic reflector , ; transmitting  the images , , ,  to an image-capturing device , , wherein the image-capturing device ,  detects light, wherein the light comprises any of ultraviolet, visible, or infrared light; storing  the images , , ,  in an image storage device , , wherein the image storage device ,  comprises a solid-state digital memory unit ,  operable to store multiple seconds of video imagery; using  a real-time computer-implemented mechanism ,  connected to the image storage device ,  to detect locations and classifications of gunfire associated with the images , , , ; verifying  the classifications of the gunfire using an acoustic device ,  in communication with the computer-implemented mechanism , ; and identifying  the locations of the gunfire using a laser designator or position laser , .","As illustrated in the flow diagram of , the method further comprises partially restricting  transmission of the light using a narrowband Fraunhofer line filter , . Further, the method comprises providing  an azimuthal field-of-view of 360 degrees using the convex parabolic reflectors , , observing  an axial field-of-view using a lens system , ,  wherein the lens system  is positioned along an axis  of the convex parabolic reflector . The method further includes increasing  the resolution of the images ,  using a mirror , wherein the mirror  is positioned along an axis of the convex parabolic reflector ; and increasing  the magnification and resolution of the images ,  using a zoom lens  positioned in between the mirror  and the image-capturing device ; and defending  against a source of the gunfire using a defense mechanism , .","The optical system ,  essentially observes a nearly spherical scene in all directions while monitoring the imagery for signs of gunfire. The color spectrum, shape, and duration of all bright flashes would be compared to known gunfire signatures to discriminate gunfire events from other bright flashes such as solar glints, flash photography, etc. using the acoustic device ,  in combination with the computer-implemented mechanism , .","The real-time computer implemented mechanism ,  comprises a program storage device readable by a computer , tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the computer  to perform a method of weapon identification, wherein the method, which is illustrated in the flow diagram of , comprises identifying  a potential gunfire event; determining  optical signatures of the gunfire event, wherein the optical signatures comprise spectral, spatial, and temporal optical signatures; comparing  the optical signatures with known signatures of known gunfire events; and correlating  optical gunfire event detection, classification, and identification with acoustic gunfire event detection, classification, and identification to identify a weapon producing the gunfire.","The real-time algorithm software automatically detects sniper events, and determines the direction and range of the shooter and is able to classify and\/or identify the weapon used using a comparison to a saved library of known signatures of known gunfire events. That is, it compares the gunfire event to a previous gunfire event saved in its memory embodied as a computerized library. Moreover, the software compares results of the optical signatures with that of acoustic signatures to provide verification and to reduce false alarms.","Thus, the invention uses software to (1) identify the weapon where the gunfire is emanating from and (2) comparing this to a saved library of known signatures of known gunfire events. However, these signatures are not merely acoustic signatures; rather, the invention also includes optical signatures as described above in conjunction with the acoustic signatures described above to provide the comparison. Moreover, the invention uses the results of the optical signatures and compares it with the acoustic signatures in determining if (1) a weapon is the source of the noise (as opposed to other noises) and (2) to verify that classification of the gunfire.","A representative hardware environment for practicing the present invention is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of an information handling\/computer system in accordance with the invention, having at least one processor or central processing unit (CPU) . The CPUs  are interconnected via system bus  to random access memory (RAM) , read-only memory (ROM) , an input\/output (I\/O) adapter  for connecting peripheral devices, such as disk units  and tape drives , to bus , user interface adapter  for connecting keyboard , mouse , speaker , microphone , and\/or other user interface devices, such as a touch screen device, to bus , communication adapter  for connecting the information handling system to a data processing network, and display adapter  for connecting bus  to display device . A program storage device readable by the disk or tape units is used to load the instructions, which operate the invention, which is loaded onto the computer system.","The image-capturing device ,  is preferably a digital video camera comprising a microprocessor chip and the image storage device , . The microprocessor chip is capable of implementing and running algorithm-based software for computerized processing of the images , . The image storage device ,  is preferably a digital video storage device capable of capturing and storing several seconds of video imagery for subsequent display on a monitor or display device . The solid-state image storage device ,  is preferably used in a \u201ccontinuous loop\u201d mode to capture data prior to the identification of a gunfire event, either by analysis of the image data or by detection of an acoustic gunfire signature. The video memory device ,  would therefore always comprise the last few seconds (or minutes) of image data. The older (or oldest) data stored in the image storage device ,  would be continuously overwritten until a gunfire event is detected, at which time relevant frames of video would be quickly identified and stored. Thus, the video memory device ,  could be used to continuously record imagery until an event was detected either by the acoustic device ,  or by the optical signature algorithm software, and then relevant frames of images can be saved for further processing and\/or transmission on a display unit .","The image data could also be used to provide feedback on a retaliation system ,  which comprises the laser designator ,  to guide return fire from nearby personnel, or some other weapon system which could be then aimed at the origin of the gunfire. The retaliation system ,  may comprise weaponry, or other similar defense mechanisms or devices known in the art. The laser designator ,  aids in specifically depicting the location of the gunfire. Preferably, the laser designator ,  is a low-power laser such as a red helium-neon laser or a semiconductor laser, etc., which can be precisely steered to produce a visible spot at the location of the detected gun flash. The advantage of this is that nearby personnel need not directly view the display  to determine the location of the shooter; rather they can view the location directly in the field of vision. The optical system ,  could be used as a stand-alone system, or preferably could be used most effectively in conjunction with other acoustic gunfire detection systems to confirm simultaneous optical and acoustic gunfire signatures.","The invention provides a relatively simple optical system with digital video storage capabilities for detecting sniper gunfire. Also, the invention provides optical confirmation of the gunfire event by using an acoustic device in communication with a computer-implemented mechanism, thereby reducing false alarms. Moreover, the invention provides verification of the direction from which the shot was fired with improved accuracy and precision. Additionally, the invention provides an approximate range to the shooter based on the time from the optically detected muzzle flash to the acoustic detection of the associated sound. Furthermore, the invention provides a digital video image of the sniper location (and the shooter) providing a means for locating and pursuing the sniper, and for retaliation. In addition to the above, the invention also provides for the classification and identification of the weapon used based on the combination of optical and acoustic spectral, spatial, and temporal signatures.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
