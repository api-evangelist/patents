{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel fused 4-aminopyrimidines, to processes for preparation thereof, to the use thereof, alone or in combinations, for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases and to the use thereof for production of medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO can bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to bind to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.","Through the formation of cGMP and the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial role in different physiological processes, more particularly in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion, and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in the event of disorders based on disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system can be suppressed, which can lead, for example, to hypertension, platelet activation, increased cell proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects, a possible NO-independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.","Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates, the effect of which is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of heme. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","In the last few years, there have been descriptions of some compounds which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587] and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","As stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase, WO 00\/06569 discloses fused pyrazole derivatives, and WO 03\/095451 carbamate-substituted 3-pyrimidinylpyrazolopyridines. WO 2010\/065275 discloses substituted pyrrolo- and dihydropyridopyrimidines as sGC activators.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as very potent stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"48.09mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08765769-20140701-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":"A is (C-C)-alkanediyl or a group of the formula"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"11.68mm","wi":"18.97mm","file":"US08765769-20140701-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["where","* is the attachment site to the pyrimidine ring,","# is the attachment site to the carbonyl group,","the ring Q is a 4- to 6-membered heterocycle,","and","where (C-C)-alkanediyl may be substituted by 1 or 2 substituents independently selected from the group of fluorine, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl, hydroxyl and amino,\n        \n        "]}},"Ris hydrogen or fluorine,","Ris (C-C)-alkyl or benzyl,\n    \n    "]}},"Inventive compounds are the compounds of the formula (I) and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, the compounds, encompassed by formula (I), of the formulae specified hereinafter and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, and the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter as working examples and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, to the extent that the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","Inventive compounds are likewise N-oxides of the compounds of the formula (I) and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof.","Preferred salts in the context of the present invention are physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds. Also encompassed are salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical applications but can be used, for example, for isolation or purification of the inventive compounds.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds include acid addition salts of mineral acids, carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids, for example salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and benzoic acid.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds also include salts of conventional bases, by way of example and with preference alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium salts) and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, by way of example and with preference ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine and N-methylpiperidine.","In the context of the invention, solvates refer to those forms of the inventive compounds which, in the solid or liquid state, form a complex by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of the solvates in which the coordination is with water. Solvates preferred in the context of the present invention are hydrates.","The inventive compounds may, depending on their structure, exist in different stereoisomeric forms, i.e. in the form of configurational isomers or else optionally as conformational isomers (enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, including those in the case of atropisomers). The present invention therefore encompasses the enantiomers and diastereomers, and the respective mixtures thereof. It is possible to isolate the stereoisomerically homogeneous constituents from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; preference is given to using chromatographic methods for this purpose, especially HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","Where the inventive compounds can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention encompasses all the tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the inventive compounds. An isotopic variant of an inventive compound is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the inventive compound has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than that which occurs usually or predominantly in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into an inventive compound are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of an inventive compound, such as, more particularly, those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be of benefit, for example, for the study of the mechanism of action or of the active ingredient distribution in the body; due to the comparative ease of preparability and detectability, compounds labeled particularly with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. Furthermore, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic advantages as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the inventive compounds may therefore, in some cases, also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the inventive compounds can be prepared by the processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the procedures described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and\/or starting compounds.","The present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the inventive compounds. The term \u201cprodrugs\u201d includes compounds which may themselves be biologically active or inactive but are converted to inventive compounds while resident in the body (for example metabolically or hydrolytically).","In the formula of the group which may represent A, the end point of the line marked by the symbol * or # does not represent a carbon atom or a CHgroup, but is part of the bond to the respective atom to which A is attached.","In the context of the present invention, unless specified otherwise, the substituents are defined as follows:","Alkyl in the context of the invention is a linear or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferred examples include: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, 1-methylpropyl, tert-butyl.","Alkanediyl in the context of the invention is a linear divalent alkyl radical having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Examples include: methylene, ethane-1,2-diyl or propane-1,3-diyl.","Heterocycle in the context of the invention is a saturated heterocycle having a total of 4 to 6 ring atoms, which contains one or two ring heteroatoms from the group of N, O and\/or S and is joined via a ring carbon atom. Examples include: azetidinyl, oxetanyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrazolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, morpholinyl and thiomorpholinyl. Preference is given to azetidinyl, oxetanyl, pyrrolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, piperidinyl and tetrahydropyranyl.","If radicals in the inventive compounds are substituted, the radicals may be mono- or polysubstituted, unless specified otherwise. In the context of the present invention, all radicals which occur more than once are defined independently of one another.

For this purpose, they can be administered in a suitable manner, for example by the oral, parenteral, pulmonal, nasal, sublingual, lingual, buccal, rectal, dermal, transdermal, conjunctival, otic route, or as an implant or stent.","The inventive compounds can be administered in administration forms suitable for these administration routes.","Suitable administration forms for oral administration are those which work according to the prior art, which release the inventive compounds rapidly and\/or in a modified manner and which contain the inventive compounds in crystalline and\/or amorphized and\/or dissolved form, for example tablets (uncoated or coated tablets, for example with gastric juice-resistant or retarded-dissolution or insoluble coatings which control the release of the inventive compound), tablets or films\/oblates which disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity, films\/lyophilizates or capsules (for example hard or soft gelatin capsules), sugar-coated tablets, granules, pellets, powders, emulsions, suspensions, aerosols or solutions.","Parenteral administration can be accomplished with avoidance of an absorption step (for example by an intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intraspinal or intralumbar route) or with inclusion of an absorption (for example by an intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, percutaneous or intraperitoneal route). Administration forms suitable for parenteral administration include preparations for injection and infusion in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilizates or sterile powders.","For the other administration routes, suitable examples are inhalable medicament forms (including powder inhalers, nebulizers), nasal drops, solutions or sprays, tablets, films\/oblates or capsules for lingual, sublingual or buccal administration, suppositories, ear or eye preparations, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspensions (lotions, shaking mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermal therapeutic systems (e.g. patches), milk, pastes, foams, sprinkling powders, implants or stents.","Oral or parenteral administration is preferred, especially oral administration.","The inventive compounds can be converted to the administration forms mentioned. This can be done in a manner known per se by mixing with inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients. These excipients include carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersing or wetting agents (for example sodium dodecylsulfate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin), stabilizers (e.g. antioxidants, for example ascorbic acid), dyes (e.g. inorganic pigments, for example iron oxides) and flavor and\/or odor correctors.","In general, it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of from about 0.001 to 1 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg\/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg\/kg and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg\/kg of body weight.","It may nevertheless be necessary in some cases to deviate from the stated amounts, specifically as a function of the body weight, route of administration, individual response to the active ingredient, nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. Thus, in some cases less than the abovementioned minimum amount may be sufficient, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.","The working examples which follow illustrate the invention. The invention is not restricted to the examples.","The percentages in the tests and examples which follow are, unless stated otherwise, percentages by weight; parts are parts by weight. Solvent ratios, dilution ratios and concentration figures for liquid\/liquid solutions are each based on volume.","Abbreviations and Acronyms",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0053","list-style":"none"},"li":["aq. aqueous solution","calc. calculated","DCI direct chemical ionization (in MS)","DMF dimethylformamide","DMSO dimethyl sulfoxide","eq. equivalent(s)","ESI electrospray ionization (in MS)","Et ethyl","h hour(s)","HPLC high-pressure, high-performance liquid chromatography","HRMS high-resolution mass spectrometry","conc. concentrated","LC\/MS liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry","LiHMDS lithium hexamethyldisilazide","Me methyl","min minute(s)","MS mass spectrometry","NMR nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","Pddbatris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium","Ph phenyl","RT room temperature","Rretention time (in HPLC)","t-Bu tert-butyl","THF tetrahydrofuran","UV ultraviolet spectrometry","v\/v volume to volume ratio (of a solution)","XPHOS dicyclohexyl(2\u2032,4\u2032,6\u2032-triisopropylbiphenyl-2-yl)phosphine\n\nLC\/MS Methods:\n\nMethod 1 (LC-MS):\n"]}},"Instrument: Waters ACQUITY SQD UPLC System; column: Waters Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8\u03bc 50\u00d71 mm; eluent A: 1 l water+0.25 ml 99% formic acid, eluent B: 1 l acetonitrile+0.25 ml 99% formic acid; gradient: 0.0 min 90% A\u21921.2 min 5% A\u21922.0 min 5% A; oven: 50\u00b0 C.; flow rate: 0.40 ml\/min; UV detection: 210-400 nm.","Method 2 (LC-MS):","MS instrument: Waters ZQ; HPLC instrument: Agilent 1100 Series; UV DAD; column: Thermo Hypersil GOLD 3\u03bc 20 mm\u00d74 mm; eluent A: 1 l water+0.5 ml 50% formic acid, eluent B: 1 l acetonitrile+0.5 ml 50% formic acid; gradient: 0.0 min 100% A\u21923.0 min 10% A\u21924.0 min 10% A; oven: 55\u00b0 C.; flow rate: 2 ml\/min; UV detection: 210 nm.","Method 3 (LC-MS):","Instrument: Waters ACQUITY SQD UPLC System; column: Waters Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8\u03bc 30\u00d72 mm; eluent A: 1 l water+0.25 ml 99% formic acid, eluent B: 1 l acetonitrile+0.25 ml 99% formic acid; gradient: 0.0 min 90% A\u21921.2 min 5% A\u21922.0 min 5% A oven: 50\u00b0 C.; flow rate: 0.60 ml\/min; UV detection: 208-400 nm.","Starting Compounds and Intermediates",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0286"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00025","num":"00025"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00025","he":"36.66mm","wi":"36.24mm","file":"US08765769-20140701-C00025.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The synthesis of this compound is described in WO 2003\/095451, example 6A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0288"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00026","num":"00026"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00026","he":"18.71mm","wi":"30.23mm","file":"US08765769-20140701-C00026.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"A suspension of 25 g (130.90 mmol) of 2,6-dichloro-5-fluoro-3-cyanopyridine in conc. sulfuric acid (125 ml) was stirred at 60-65\u00b0 C. for 1 h.
