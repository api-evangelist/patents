title: System and method for the measurement of the unambiguous roll angle of a projectile
abstract: A system for the measurement of an angle of roll of a projectile is disclosed. The projectile has a casing with a rear end, a front end, and a side wall extending therebetween. The system includes a radar configured to transmit a polarized electromagnetic signal toward the projectile and a groove disposed on the side wall of the casing. The groove has a width, a depth, and a length, the width extending along a longitudinal axis of the projectile, the depth extending inwardly from an outer surface of the casing toward the longitudinal axis, and the length extending along the outside of the casing. The radar is further configured to receive a return signal from the projectile, wherein the return signal from the groove is modulated as a function of the angle of roll of the projectile. Amplitude or phase modulation of the return signal from the groove can be used to uniquely determine the roll angle of the projectile.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","a. Technical Field","The present disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for measuring the unambiguous roll angle of a projectile.","b. Description of the Related Art","Various approaches exist for determining the roll angle of a projectile using polarized radiation. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,039,029 describes an approach where a monitor determines, from the ground, the orientation (roll and attitude) of a missile by observing the character of a signal transmitted therefrom. By transmitting a linearly-polarized signal to a ground receiver, the missile identifies a given plane fixed with respect to the body frame of the missile. The plane is identified at the ground receiver by comparing the ratio of the signal received in any two cross-polarized directions. To resolve the attendant 180\u00b0 ambiguity, the monitor employs an antenna array disposed on the missile that is switchable, back-and-forth, between two equal power lobes. The monitor operates with a single transmitter, and the lobe structure of the transmitted signal is obtained using a linearly-polarized antenna array with electronic phase switching between the aforementioned equal power lobes. This approach requires that the projectile contain a transmitter, therefore creating additional costs and requiring valuable space on the projectile.","Another approach for determining the roll angle of a projectile using polarized radiation is disclosed and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,414,430. The system described therein includes a transmitter for emitting position-determining polarized radiation (space wave) in the direction of the projectile, and a receiver arranged in the projectile for receiving the emitted radiation. The emitted space wave is composed of a carrier wave reference with frequency f, which has been phase-modulated with a modulation frequency f, wherein f<fand wherein fforms a submultiple of the carrier wave frequency f. Similar to the approach in U.S. Pat. No. 5,039,029, this approach requires that the projectile contain a transmitter.","Yet another approach for determining the roll angle of a projectile is to use polarization-sensitive reflectors. U.S. Pat. No. 5,490,643 describes a system including an optical device located in the rear of a projectile, the optical device having a retro-reflector fitted with a polarizer and, at the projectile firing station, a light source whose beam illuminates the rear of the projectile. A light flux analyzer deduces the roll angle of the projectile from the direction of polarization of the light-flux reflected by the projectile. The polarizer has a refraction index discontinuity positioned on the rear of the projectile, before the retro-reflector, with an angle of inclination between the direction normal to its plane of index variation and the longitudinal axis of the projectile and chosen to be greater than the Brewster angle. The light source is laterally offset laterally with respect to the firing axis of the projectile. These two measurements give rise to a modulation of intensity of the reflected light beam as a function of the roll angle plus or minus 2\u03c0, which gives, to two successive maximum values of the signal of the analyzer, different amplitudes that enable the signals to be differentiated, and therefore make it possible to remove the ambiguity of \u03c0 resulting from the measurement of the direction of polarization. This approach requires space on the end of the projectile. For some missiles, rockets, and artillery pieces, there is no space available on the back of the projectile for the polarization-sensitive reflectors. For example, for some missiles, the end of the missile is occupied by motor components. As well, exhaust plumes may mask the end of the projectile.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,483,455 discloses a device for the unambiguous measurement of the angle of roll of a projectile. The system includes a radar equipped with means for processing and sending a signal to the casing of the projectile in at least one direction of incident polarization, and a set of parallel grooves made on the casing, the depth of which is modulated dissymmetrically with respect to the axis of symmetry of the projectile. The axis of symmetry of the projectile does not pass through the point of the antenna of the radar where the antenna beam is generated. The processing means analyze, in reception, a signal that is back-scattered by the casing of the projectile, the signal being modulated as a function of the angle of roll of the projectile. The modulation has two maximum local values corresponding to two angular roll positions of the projectile when the polarization is parallel to the grooves. The processing means removes the 180\u00b0 ambiguity by comparing the levels of the local maximum values. Again, this approach requires space on the end of the projectile for the placement of the grooves. As previously noted, space is not always available at the end of a projectile.","Therefore, there is a need for improved systems and methods that address these and other shortcomings of the prior art.","Briefly described, systems and methods for determining the unambiguous roll angle of a projectile are disclosed. A representative embodiment of a system for the measurement of an angle of roll of a projectile, the projectile having a casing with a rear end, a front end, and a side wall extending therebetween, includes a radar transmitter configured to transmit a polarized electromagnetic signal toward the projectile. A groove is disposed on the side wall of the casing, the groove having a width, a depth, and a length, the width extending along a longitudinal axis of the projectile, the depth extending inwardly from an outer surface of the casing toward the longitudinal axis, and the length extending along the outside of the casing. The system also includes a radar receiver configured to receive a return signal from the projectile. The amplitude of the return signal from the groove is varied as a function of the angle of roll of the projectile.","Another embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method of measuring an angle of roll of a projectile, the projectile having a casing with a rear end, a front end, and a side wall therebetween. The method includes forming a groove having a width, a depth, and a length on the side wall of the projectile, the width extending parallel to a longitudinal axis of the projectile, the depth extending inwardly from an exterior of the casing toward the longitudinal axis, and the length extending along the exterior of the casing perpendicularly to the width. The method further includes transmitting a polarized electromagnetic signal toward the projectile, the projectile having a radar signature that varies with the angle of roll of the projectile.","Yet another embodiment of the present disclosure relates to a system for the measurement of an angle of roll of a projectile, the projectile having a casing with a rear end, a front end, and a side wall extending therebetween. The system includes a radar transmitter configured to transmit a polarized electromagnetic signal toward the projectile and a groove disposed on a cylindrical portion of the side wall of the casing. The groove has a width, a depth, and a length, the width extending along a longitudinal axis of the projectile, the depth extending inwardly from an outer surface of the casing toward the longitudinal axis, and the length extending along the outside of the casing. A radar receiver is configured to receive a return signal from the projectile, the relative phase of the return signal from the groove being modulated as a function of the angle of roll of the projectile. The system further includes processing means for analyzing the modulated return signal, the processing means determining the angle of roll by determining a modulating effect of the groove on the return signal.","Other systems, methods, features and\/or advantages will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and\/or advantages be included within this description and be protected by the accompanying claims.","The foregoing description has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present disclosure to the precise forms disclosed. Modifications and\/or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The embodiments discussed, however, were chosen and described to illustrate the principles of the present disclosure and its practical application to thereby enable a person having ordinary skill in the art to utilize the present disclosure and various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and\/or variations are within the scope of the present disclosure as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly and legally entitled.","Disclosed herein are systems, apparatuses, and methods to which an angle of roll of a projectile can be measured. In particular, the angle of roll of the projectile can be measured using radar that is configured to transmit an electromagnetic signal toward the projectile and receive a return signal from the projectile. The projectile has a roll-angle groove exposed on a side wall of a casing of the projectile. The electromagnetic signal that is transmitted by the radar reflects off of the roll-angle groove of the projectile, which provides a return signal received by the radar. The roll rate and the unambiguous roll angle can be determined from the amplitude modulation and\/or phase modulation of a radar return signal scattered by the groove. The roll rate and the unambiguous roll angle can be used to initiate an action on the projectile that requires knowledge of these parameters through a wireless communication link on the projectile. For example, the projectile can have a thruster on the side wall of the projectile to steer the projectile to an intended target based on the determined roll rate and unambiguous roll angle. Example systems are first discussed with reference figures. After the exemplary systems have been described, examples of the operation of the system are provided to explain the manner in which the angle of roll of the projectile can be measured.","Referring now in more detail to the figures in which like reference numerals identify corresponding parts,  is a perspective view of an embodiment of a system that measures an angle of roll of a projectile. The system  includes a projectile A and radar . The projectile A includes a roll-angle groove A disposed on a casing  of the projectile A, which is further described in relation to . The projectile launch device (not shown) is displaced from the location of the radar . The radar  transmits electromagnetic signal A-B, preferably polarized, to the projectile A. Because of the close proximity of the surface to the radar  and the projectile A, the transmitted electromagnetic signal A-B reaches the projectile A in multiple paths. For example, the electromagnetic signal A reaches the back  of the rear end  of the projectile A. The electromagnetic signal A hits the back  of the projectile A and bounces back a return signal A to the radar . The electromagnetic signal B also travels on another path that bounces off a surface , such as ground or water, then off the roll-angle groove A of the projectile A. The electromagnetic signal B returns back to the surface  then to the radar  as return signal B. The radar  calculates the amplitude modulation based on the return signal A and B, which can be used to determine the roll rate and is used to determine the unambiguous roll angle of the projectile A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["15","1","3","5","13","5","15","10","5","5","13","11","3","13","11","3","7","5","15","5","9","3","9","15","5","1","9"]},"It should be noted that although  show the projectile launch device  being parallel to the surface , the system can be employed where the projectile launch device  is not parallel to the surface  as the projectile launch device  travels to its target.

The opposed side  of the roll-angle groove A is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and the opposed side  is in a plane that extends at an acute angle relative to the opposed side  of the projectile A. The width of the groove A increases monotonically, e.g., linearly, from each of the opposed ends ,  to the center  of the roll-angle groove A. The depth D of the groove A is the distance between the base  of the groove A and the outside surface of the side wall . The varying width of the projectile A enables the system  to modulate the amplitude of the return signal  deflected off the roll-angle groove A as a function of roll angle. The return signal  that is deflected off the roll-angle groove A having the smallest amplitude modulation near the opposed ends ,  and the largest amplitude modulation near the center  of the roll-angle groove A.
