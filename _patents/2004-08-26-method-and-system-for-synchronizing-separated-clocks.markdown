No. 60\/499,411, filed 26 Aug., 2003, which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","1. Technical Field","The present invention is generally related to the synchronization of clocks that are separated.","2. Description of the Related Art","High-accuracy synchronization of clocks plays an important role in fundamental physics and in a wide range of applications such as communications, message encryption, navigation, geolocation and homeland security. A classical method of time synchronization of spatially separated clocks is Eddington slow clock transport. In this approach, two co-located clocks are initially synchronized, and then one of the clocks is slowly transported to another location to synchronize with a distant clock, i.e., a geographically separated clock. For most technological applications, this method is not practical because it requires transport of hardware, i.e., the clock, as well as conflicting requirements: on the one hand, clock transport must be slow to reduce the relativistic effect of time dilation, but on the other hand, the transport must be fast enough so that significant time differences do not accrue from unavoidable timing errors due to the limited frequency stability of the transported clock's mechanism or due to gravitational potential differences along the path of the transported clock.","Today, in practical applications, a satellite system, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), is used for synchronizing two spatially separated clocks. GPS is a satellite system in which signals are sent from satellite-to-ground and from ground-to-satellite to synchronize the satellite clocks with a master clock on the Earth. The time-synchronization accuracy provided by a GPS receiver is on the order of 20 nanoseconds (ns). However, there are applications, such as coherent detection of high-frequency electromagnetic signals, where time synchronization is required to an accuracy that cannot be provided by GPS. Therefore, there exists a need for synchronizing spatially separated clocks to an accuracy better than the nanosecond range","Systems and methods for synchronizing a first clock with a second clock, wherein the clocks are separated, are disclosed. A representative system, among others, includes a correlated particle emitter that emits a first particle stream and a second particle stream. Particles in the first particle stream are quantum mechanically correlated with particles in the second particle stream. The system also includes: a first target having the first clock and a first particle detector, and a second target having the second clock and a second particle detector. The first target uses the first clock and the first particle detector to determine arrival times of particles included in the first particle stream, and the second target uses the second clock and the second particle detector to determine arrival times of particles included in the second particle stream.","An embodiment of a method can be broadly summarized by the following steps: transmitting along a first particle path a first stream of particles to a target having the first clock; transmitting along a second particle path a second stream of particles to a second target having the second clock; determining an offset for the first clock based upon arrival times of particles in the first stream of particles at the first target and upon arrival times of particles in the second stream of particles at the second target; and applying the offset to the first clock.","Other systems, methods, features, and\/or advantages will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and\/or advantages be included within this description and be protected by the accompanying claims.","It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments are merely possible examples of implementations. Many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments. All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of this disclosure and the present invention and protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","14","16","12","18","20","18","20","12","13","10","12","13","12","18","20","22","24"]},"Conceptually, the reference clock  is an idealized clock that does not suffer from imperfections of hardware, i.e., the reference clock  keeps perfect or proper time. Time measured with respect to the reference clock  is referred to as coordinate time, (t), which is a global quantity, which is associated with the metric of space-time, g, and enters into the definition of the system of 4-dimensional space-time coordinates.","Those skilled in the art understand the wave particle duality principle elucidated by DeBroglie. Consequently, the correlated particles  and  are both particles and waves, and the particle streams  and  are both streams of particles and beams of waves.","The particle stream  is directed to a first target  along a transmission path (T) . The first target  includes a particle reflector , and during this initialization, the particle reflector  reflects the incident particle stream . Upon reflection, the particle stream  travels along a reflection path (R)  to the particle receiver .","The particle stream  travels from the CPE  to a second target  along a second transmission path (T) . The second target  includes a particle reflector , and during initialization, the particle stream  is reflected by the particle reflector  along a second reflection path (R) . In some embodiments, the particle reflectors  and  are optical devices such as corner cube reflectors or mirrors. It should be noted that in some embodiments, the particle reflectors  and  are not 100% reflective.","The transmission path  has three legs: (1) from the CPE  to the variable particle delay element ; (2) through the variable particle delay element ; and (3) from the variable particle delay element  to the second target . Similarly, the reflection path (R)  has three legs: (1) from the second target  to the variable particle delay element ; (2) through the variable particle delay element ; and (3) from the variable particle delay element  to the particle receiver .","The particle receiver  receives particle streams  and . In some embodiments, the particle receiver  measures the amount of correlation between received particles carried by the particle streams  and . For example, in one embodiment, the particles  and  are biphotons (correlated or entangled photon pairs, such as are produced by the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when a non-linear crystal is pumped by a laser) and the particle receiver  is a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, which measures the amount of interference (i.e., two-photon coincident counting rate) between correlated biphotons. The destructive interference between correlated biphotons is a maximum (i.e., minimum in the two-photon coincident counting rate) when the optical paths (T+R) and (T+R) are the same.","A controller  is in communication with the PPEA  via electrical connectors  and . Electrical connector  carries electrical signals from the particle receiver  to the controller . Using the signals from the particle receiver , the controller  provides control signals to the variable particle delay element  via electrical connector . The variable particle delay element  responds to the control signals to change, or maintain, the particle path through the variable particle delay element , i.e., to change, or maintain, the time that it takes the particle  to traverse the variable particle delay element . In some embodiments, the variable particle delay element  is adapted to vary its index of refraction, thereby providing variable delay for light waves (photons).","It should be noted that for a given configuration of the variable particle delay element , the time to traverse the variable particle delay element  is approximately independent of direction. In other words, for a given configuration, the transmission lag through the variable particle delay element  is approximately the same as the reflection leg through the variable particle delay element . Furthermore, it should be noted that in a preferred embodiment, the correlated particle emitter  and the particle receiver  are disposed such that they are approximately coincident. By having the correlated particle emitter  approximately coincident with the particle receiver , the time of flight along the transmission paths (T, T)  and  is approximately equal to the time of flight along the reflection paths (R, R)  and , respectively. Generally, the transmission paths (T, T)  and  are spatially much greater than the physical separation of the correlated particle emitter  and the particle receiver , and consequently, for all practical purposes the particle receiver  and correlated particle emitter  appear to be coincident as viewed from the targets  and .","In one embodiment, the components of the PPEA  are disposed on a microchip, which includes the necessary circuitry for providing communication paths between the components. In other components, the components are separate modules. Those skilled in the art are familiar with networking of the components such that power and signals are provided to the necessary components.","Generally, the controller  is a processing device that can include any custom made or commercially available processor, a central processing unit (CPU) or an auxiliary processor among several processors associated with the computer system, a semiconductor based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip), a macroprocessor, one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), a plurality of suitably configured digital logic gates, and other well known electrical configurations comprising discrete elements both individually and in various combinations to coordinate the overall operation of the computing system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","12","48","50","52","54","48","56","50","50","56","56","50","18","20","56","56","22","24","50"]},"The tuners  and  receive particle streams (laser beams)  and , respectively. The tuner  directs particle stream (laser beam)  along transmission path (T) , and the tuner  directs particle stream (laser beam)  along transmission path (T) . The tuners  and  are comprised of mirrors and other optical devices known to those skilled in the art.","In some embodiments, the laser  is a continuous wave laser such as an argon-ion laser oscillating at 351.1 nm, and the parametric down converter  is a crystal that lacks inversion symmetry. Examples of crystals used in parametric down conversion are a barium beta borate or a potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["16","16","58","60","62","64","58","60","62","18","20","60","62","64","66","68","60","62","64"]},"The coincidence analyzer  determines the number of coincidences, i.e., the number of particles that are detected at the photon detectors  and  per unit time.

The satellite control center  includes the necessary software, hardware, and personnel for controlling the targets\/satellites  and  and for communicating with the targets\/satellites  and  over communication links  and , respectively. The controller  signals the satellite control center , via a communication link , when the transmission and reflection paths (, ) and (, ) (See ) have been substantially equalized. The satellite control center  then signals the targets\/satellites  and  to commence with synchronizing their respective clocks  and .","The correlated particle emitter  emits particle streams  and , which in some embodiments are comprised of biphotons. The particle stream  travels along the transmission path (T)  to the target\/satellite , and the particle stream  travels along the transmission path (T)  to the target\/satellite . Responsive to the signal from the satellite control center , the targets\/satellites  and  begin to collect particle arrival data for particles carried by the particle streams  and , respectively.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the particle reflectors  and  are not shown. The targets\/satellites  and  adjust\/move their respective particle reflectors  and  responsive to receiving a signal from the satellite control center , thereby exposing particle detectors  and , respectively, to the particle beams  and . In other embodiments, the particle reflectors  and  are not 100% reflective, and in that case, the particle detectors  and  are partially exposed to the particle beams  and  without adjusting\/moving the particle reflectors  and . In some embodiments, the particle detectors  and  are photodetectors.","The particle detectors  and  detect the arrival of particles and record the arrival times of the particles with respect to the clocks  and , respectively. Photon arrival time data at satellite  is given by a set of numbers {\u03c4}, where j=1, N, which is typically about 1 million data points, which are recorded in a particle arrival table . The satellite  also records photon arrival time data in a particle arrival table (not shown), and the arrival times of photons at the satellite  are denoted by the set of number {\u03c4}, where j=1, N. Typically, the intensity of particle streams  and  are such that about 1 million data points are accumulated at the targets\/satellites  and  within approximately one second or so, or fast enough such that mechanical imperfections in the clocks  and  can be ignored, or that motion of the two clocks can be ignored, or, a separate correaction can be made for clock motion. The data accumulation occurs fast enough that the clocks  and  appear to be ideal clocks having \u201cproper time\u201d, or alternatively, that a clock correaction can be applied to the time kept by the real hardware clock to make it effectively keep proper time to the needed accuracy. On the world line of clock , the \u201cproper time\u201d elapsed between the reception of the first particle (t) and the kparticle (t) recorded in the particle arrival table  is given by: \u03c4+\u0394\u03c4=t\u2212t, where \u03c4is the time that the kparticle arrived as measured by clock , and \u0394\u03c4is the clock correaction that relates coordinate time (t) to \u201cproper time\u201d for clock .
