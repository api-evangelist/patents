title: Network traffic-analysis-based suggestion generation
abstract: In one embodiment, a networked device running a social networking application logs local area network traffic in order to maintain a table of connected users on the same LAN. In such embodiments, the networked device uploads its log of LAN traffic to a social networking system, which associates each MAC address with a user of the social networking system, and detects and identifies recurring patterns when the user of the networked device and other users are on the same LAN. Based upon such patterns, the social networking system may suggest that the two users become friends or otherwise interact on the social networking system. In particular embodiments, a networked device running a social networking application may broadcast mDNS messages containing its social networking ID, allowing other similarly configured devices on the same LAN to interact with the user of the device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to social networking","A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interest. The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a webpage, or a newsfeed, for a particular user, comprising the recent activities of the user's first-degree connections on the social network. Users utilizing mobile devices having data connections to the social networking system may upload photos or perform actions remotely that appear on his or her news feed when the content is completely uploaded to the social networking system","Particular embodiments relate to a social networking application resident on a client device that monitors and logs local area network traffic, such as layer 2 configuration protocol messages, in order to determine what other devices, and therefore the users associated with the devices, are commonly encountered on the network. In particular embodiments, client or server-side processing may identify patterns of exposure to a particular user\/device, and the social networking system may generate and push suggestions to the owners of the devices to interact on the social networking system. In particular embodiments, the client may employ a beacon-type multicast protocol explicitly including the user's social networking identifier for nearby devices to discover the client. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","Social networking systems traditionally allow groups of users to connect on a social networking site after a real-life interaction has occurred. For example, two friends in real life may add a friendship link between their social networking user accounts to share media, content, photos, status updates, and the like. As another example, two users who are introduced at a party may later add each other as friends or professional contacts on the social networking system. However, the use of social networking services has been limited to increasing interaction between two users after some sort of off-network, real-life introduction.","Several social networking applications have attempted to promote social network interaction between strangers, or to make introductions between two strangers based on location or interests. For example, the application HOLLER allows users to join a group (for example, surfers) and the application pushes notifications to the user when other members of the group are within a predetermined distance. As another example, MINGLE users fill out an introduction card and post it to their current location, and may view other users \u201cmingling\u201d at the same location on their mobile device. Similarly, groupchat application Sonar allows users to see other sonar users' profiles who are in the same general vicinity, and initiate instant messaging chats with the users. Applications such as YOBONGO and LOKAST offer similar functionality. However, current location-based social networking offerings all require users to be concurrently geographically collocated to initiate social networking interactions.","Particular embodiments are now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other through, the system. Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system. Thereafter, the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password. As used herein, a \u201cuser\u201d may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.","When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a \u201cuser profile\u201d, in connection with the user. The user profile may include information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user. For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date, gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile. The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user considers to be his friends. A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile. Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction. For example, if Bob and Joe are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other. If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection. Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends). Connections may be added explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational institution). The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.","The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time. The user may also update his or her profile information at any time. For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information. Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time. A user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile. Again, such information may be updated from time to time to reflect the user's most-recent activities. Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile. For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or remove the user as a friend). A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages\u2014typically known as wall-posts. A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.","A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. A social network may be represented using a graph structure. Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network. Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users. In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.","A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events. For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities. For example, the social networking system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user's profile, such as in a wall post or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system. Social networking system may also allow users to configure events. For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event. The invited users may receive invitations to the event and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it). Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar. Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times, dates, locations and identities of other users.","The social networking system may also support a privacy model. A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party applications. A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile. For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated with the user and\/or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information. A privacy setting defines, or identifies, the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party application) that may have access to the user datum. The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections, a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the Internet). A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted. Additionally, a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.","Social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to geographic locations or places. Places may correspond to various physical locations, such as restaurants, bars, train stations, airports and the like. Some places may correspond to larger regions that themselves contain places\u2014such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport. In one implementation, each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social networking system, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/763,171, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application (e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile device. For example, social networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about a place. In addition to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user. For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more location-based services that record the user's location. For example, users may access the geo-social networking system using a special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a browser client). The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System (GPS) or other geo-location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system. In addition, the client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to check-in at various locations and communicate this location to other users. A check-in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and, using a mobile device, access the geo-social networking system to register the user's presence at the place. A user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user's current location or create a new place. The user may also provide comments in a text string when checking in to a given place. The user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check-in (such as friends of a user) and associate them with the check-in as well. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/574,614, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, describes a system that allows a first user to check-in other users at a given place. An entry including a comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may be displayed to other users. For example, a record of the user's check-in activity may be stored in a database. Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check-in activities of users at a given place and include such check-in activity in web pages (or other structured documents) that correspond to a given place. For example, social networking system may select the check-in activity associated with the friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page corresponding to a place. U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/858,718, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, describes an example geo-social networking system that can be used in connection with particular embodiments. The check-in activity may also be displayed on a user profile page and in news feeds provided to users of the social networking system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","102","102","103","104","105"]},"In particular embodiments, databases , , , , and  may be operably connected to the social networking system's front end. In particular embodiments, the front end  may interact with client device  through network cloud . Client device  is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating (e.g., remotely) over a computer network. Client device  may be a desktop computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), in- or out-of-car navigation system, smart phone or other cellular or mobile phone, or mobile gaming device, among other suitable computing devices. Client device  may execute one or more client applications, such as a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera, etc.) or special-purpose client application (e.g., Facebook for iPhone, etc.), to access and view content over a computer network. Front end  may include web or HTTP server functionality, as well as other functionality, to allow users to access the social networking system. Front end  may also include a newsfeed generator that generates news feeds in response to user requests. In particular embodiments, news feed generator resides on one or more servers separate from front end . Network cloud  generally represents a network or collection of networks (such as the Internet or a corporate intranet, or a combination of both) over which client devices  may access the social network system.","In particular embodiments, location database  may store an information base of places, where each place includes a name, a geographic location and meta information (such as the user that initially created the place, reviews, comments, check-in activity data, and the like). Places may be created by administrators of the system and\/or created by users of the system. For example, a user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database . As discussed above, a created place may correspond to a hub node, which an administrator can claim for purposes of augmenting the information about the place and for creating ads or other offers to be delivered to users. In particular embodiments, system front end  may construct and serve a web page of a place, as requested by a user. In some embodiments, a web page of a place may include selectable components for a user to \u201clike\u201d the place, check in to the place, upload photos related to the place (in connection with a check-in or at a later time). In particular embodiments, location database  may store geo-location data identifying a real-world geographic location of a user associated with a check-in. For example, a geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be identified by the computer's IP address. For example, a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with cellular, Wi-Fi and\/or GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower triangulation, Wi-Fi positioning, and\/or GPS positioning. In particular embodiments, location database  may store a geographic location and additional information of a plurality of places.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","201","201","200","200"],"i":["a","b"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","200","202","203","201"]},"Devices on LAN  exchange a number of configuration messages upon initially connecting to LAN  through the default gateway. For example, devices connecting to a network utilizing the Internet Protocol (IP) suite must exchange layer 2 address resolution protocol (ARP) messages in order to map their IP address to their unique media access control (MAC) addresses. When a device needs to transmit data to another device on the same network, it knows the source and destination addresses for the data transfer. It must some how map the destination address to a MAC address before forwarding the data. First, the sending station will check its ARP table to see if it has already discovered this destination station's MAC address. If it has not, it will send a broadcast on the network with the destination station's IP address contained in the broadcast. Every station on the LAN receives the broadcast and compares the embedded IP address to its own. only the station with the matching IP address replies to the sending station with a packet containing the MAC address for the station. When the destination device lies on a remote network, one beyond a router, the process is the same except that the sending station sends the ARP request for the MAC address of the default gateway. It then forwards the information to that device. The default gateway will then forward the information over what ever networks necessary to deliver the packet to the network on which the destination device resides. The router on the destination device's network then users ARP to obtain the MAC of the actual destination device and delivers the packet.","Typically, initial configuration messages are no longer used by applications after all network nodes have obtained their IP addresses and built their ARP tables. However, in many cases, link layer protocol messages continue to be exchanged between nodes on the network. For example, in an 802.11 wireless network, nodes my transmit request to send (RTS) frames and receive CTS frames from wireless access point . Other nodes receiving RTS and CTS frames refrain from sending data for a predetermined amount of time to reduce collisions. A listening device, such as node E, may log this traffic as well to build its log table of devices. Although Smartphone (Node E) is designated as the \u201clistening\u201d device in , it should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that any of Nodes A-E may also run a social networking application for logging LAN traffic.","This disclosure contemplates monitoring and logging any type of LAN traffic, including, at the link layer: inverse or reverse ARP (InARP\/RARP), neighbor discovery protocol (NDP), open shortest path first (OSPF), layer 2 tunneling protocol (L2TP), point-to-point protocol (PPP), media access control messages and the like. In particular embodiments, the social networking application logs link-layer messages in order to obtain a correspondence between a unique device and its IP address, but continues to log upper layer protocol messages in order to determine whether the device remains connected to the network. For example, once the social networking application determines that a particular IP address corresponds to a particular MAC address, the application may assume that the device is connected to the LAN so long as it notices traffic direct to or from that IP address in the absence of another link layer configuration message mapping the address to a different MAC address.","In particular embodiments, listening nodes may log multicast domain name service (mDNS) LAN traffic. MDNS messages are commonly used as a means of resource discovery without the use of a centralized DNS server. In mDNS, a node searching for a particular host broadcasts an mDNS query message, and the corresponding host replies with a multicast message announcing itself. MDNS is used by resource-discovery protocols such as Apple's Bounjour and Linux Avahi. In particular embodiments, listening nodes may be programmed to interpret mDNS messages in order to ascertain the type of device or resource broadcast in an announce message, and log the data in its LAN traffic log.","In particular embodiments, devices running a social networking application may be configured to transmit and interpret a specialized social networking mDNS message. For example, listening device node E may connect to LAN  and seek to discover if any other members of the social networking system are on the same LAN. In response, other nodes running the social networking application may transmit an mDNS announce message. In particular embodiments, the mDNS announce message may include the announcing node's associated social networking user identification. In particular embodiments, the mDNS announce message may include activities the user is open to engaging in, such as friending, instant messaging chat, voice\/video chat, games, sharing music\/files\/video, sharing links, exchanging contact information, and the like. In particular embodiments, the mDNS announce message may include profile information that the user specifies, such as interests, groups, pages that the user has become a fan of, and the like. In particular embodiments, the mDNS query may contain all or some of the aforementioned social networking information. This disclosure contemplates the inclusion of any social networking information in multicast DNS messages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","301","302","303","304","305","306","307","308","309","309","309","309","300"]},"For didactic purposes, table  contains four logged transmissions across the LAN. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that table  may include several thousand transmissions, with the number of transactions increasing dramatically with the number of nodes joining and leaving the network and the connection duration. In particular embodiments, listening nodes, such as Node C, maintain a different table for each LAN. In particular embodiments, listening nodes maintain a single table with a LAN identifier field. This disclosure contemplates any suitable means of storing logged LAN traffic.","Entry  of table  is an example piece of logged LAN traffic, in this example, and ARP request as indicated by field . In this example, node E (the listening device) broadcasts (via transmission to MAC address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) a request for the MAC address of the default gateway at 192.168.0.1. Almost immediately thereafter, listening node E logs the transmission of . In entry , the default gateway (at 192.168.0.1) transmits its MAC address in an ARP response back to node E. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that multiple intervening transmissions may take place between transmission  and ; such transmissions will be similarly logged and stored in table  by node E.","In table entry , node E logs an http transmission between Node A and the default gateway. The listening node E may, in particular embodiments, fill in fields  and  of table  via consulting its own ARP tables. As an example in entry , listening node E receives and logs an mDNS entry advertising social networking resources from Node B (at 192.168.0.101). Node B broadcasts an mDNS messages as in an mDNS announce message in Bonjour advertising its MAC address  and social networking ID . Thus, all devices on the LAN that are capable of interpreting mDNS messages of this type; i.e., all devices on the LAN running the social networking application, may communicate with node B on the social network or through the social networking application. If other nodes are also listening nodes, such as node E, listening nodes will store an association between the MAC address of node B and the social networking identifier . Thus, listening nodes assume that any traffic they see on the network destined for the MAC address  or originating from MAC address  for entry  indicates that the user associated with the user ID  is on the LAN. As previously discussed above, mDNS messages may contain any number of fields containing information from the social networking system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","300"]},"Table  represents the processed log data from table . In particular embodiments, table  is organized primarily by MAC address, each MAC address in column  is associated with a particular device, and for each MAC address , table  includes a time\/date the device was first encountered , the duration of the encounter , the device type , and a network identifier . In particular embodiments, the network identifier may be a unique randomly-assigned alphanumeric string for each discrete network. In particular embodiments, the network identifier may be pulled from social networking system . For example, if a user of a listening node checks-in to a location on the social network while connected to the LAN available at the checked-in location, the listening node may utilize the location's social networking identifier, or node ID, as the network identifier . In particular embodiments, this processing is performed on the back end of social networking system . In particular embodiments, social networking system logs every user's IP address, physical location, and MAC address at the time of a check-in for future resolution to build a LAN table.","In particular embodiments, device type  may be ascertained by MAC address filtering. For example, it is common for the first three bytes of any MAC address to represent an identifier of the manufacturer of the device. In particular embodiments, the next byte may represent the device type. Thus, by referencing a particular MAC address against a database of manufacturer\/device identifiers, the social networking server, or alternatively a listening node itself, may ascertain the type of device and filter table  accordingly. For example, in particular embodiments, entries  and  may be filtered and removed from table , because it is unlikely there is a social networking user identifier associated with a router (entry ) or a printer (entry ).","Because one object of particular embodiments is to ultimately identify users of the social networking system that a listening node often encounters or spends time with, the only relevant data stored with each unique MAC address is the time and date of the interaction, the duration of the interaction, and, eventually, the social networking user identification associated with the MAC address. Thus, table  may store multiple entries for a device even though the social networking UID has never been obtained by the listening device. However, upon upload to a social networking server, if the user of a particular device has ever logged into the social networking system via the device associated with that unique MAC address, the social networking server may fill in column  of table  with a series of associated social networking identifiers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["501","502"]},"At Step , the listening node listens to and logs all LAN traffic. Methods of monitoring LAN traffic are well-known in the art. In particular embodiments, listening nodes log encrypted traffic with only the sender and destination IP address. In particular embodiments, listening nodes drop all encrypted packets. In particular embodiments, listening node logs only packets containing a MAC address, such as ARP\/RARP packets. In particular embodiments, listening node logs all packets after a MAC-IP address association has been made for a particular IP address. In particular embodiments, the listening node only logs the most recent packet having the same IP address as a previously associated IP address. For example, listening nodes are primarily only concerned with the duration another node is on the same LAN. After learning that a device (via its MAC address) is connected to the LAN at a particular IP address, there is no need for the listening node to log all traffic to or from that IP address; it is only necessary to log the last transmission from the IP address, or any new MAC address taking the IP address. Thus, in a particular embodiment, a listening node may utilize a buffer of a predetermined size and only enter the most recent transmission from an IP address into table . In particular embodiment, listening nodes may only log certain types of traffic. In particular embodiments, listening nodes log any type of resource-sharing mDNS packets. For example. listening nodes may be configured to understand commonly-known or utilized resource-sharing protocols, such as AppleTalk, Samba, Avahi, Bounjour, and the like. This disclosure contemplates any suitable method of listening to and logging LAN traffic.","For each LAN transmission, listening nodes also assess whether the LAN transmission contains any explicit social networking identifiers. For example, if a node on the network broadcasts an mDNS message containing his or her social networking user identifier, as in transmission , listening nodes may display the user interface of  concurrently with adding the logged transmission to table .","At Step , the listening node uploads the table to the servers of social networking system  for analysis. In particular embodiments, the listening nodes upload their LAN traffic logs whenever they disconnect from a particular LAN. In particular embodiments, listening nodes transmit their tables to social networking system  at predetermined intervals, such as at the end of every day. In particular embodiments, listening nodes perform preprocessing on their stored LAN traffic tables  before transmitting them to social network . In such embodiments, listening nodes parse table  to determine the overall duration, time of week, and network identification for each unique MAC address. In particular embodiments, listening nodes may perform MAC lookups from a device table to obtain device types as disclosed above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["601","203","300","400","203","203"]},"At Step , social networking system  performs processing to detect and identify frequently occurring patterns indicating that two devices have spent a large amount of time together. In particular embodiments, social networking system  performs association rule learning for all the aggregated log data. In particular embodiments, social networking system  performs association rule learning for all log data over a predetermined period of time, such as thirty days. In particular embodiments, social networking system  utilizes the fp-growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) algorithm to determine patterns of devices on the same LAN. This disclosure contemplates any suitable method of detecting and identifying patterns of user devices logged into the same local area network.","At Step , social networking system  qualifies the patterns based on a number of factors. In particular embodiments, social networking system  only generates suggestions for patterns that exceed a total aggregate amount of time spent on the same network. For example, the social networking system may qualify a pattern of two users on the same network for three hours every week, but not for a pattern of two users who are on the same network every day for five minutes. In particular embodiments, social networking system  qualifies patterns based on the consistency or regularity. For example, randomly spending four hours total together at an airport twice in the last  days may not justify generating a suggestion for the two users to add each other on the social network, but connecting to the same public transit wifi network every day may. In particular embodiments, the social networking system takes into account other social factors in determining whether to generate a suggestion to the user. For example, the social networking system may take into account the users' age group, relationship status, gender, number of mutual friends, interests, and the like. For example, the social networking system is more likely to generate a suggestion for two users who are both single from 20-30 that spend an hour at Starbucks once a week than one of the aforementioned singles a 65-year-old retiree, regardless of the amount of time the retiree's device is seen on the same LAN.

In particular embodiments, the suggestion is delivered through a notification channel to the users' mobile device. In particular embodiments, the suggestion appears on the right-hand side of his or her profile view. In particular embodiments, the notification is delivered via a text message or email. In particular embodiments, the notification is delivered as an MMS message. In particular embodiments, the notification is delivered as a message on the social networking site.

Suggestion context is the social networking system's rationale for pushing the suggestion to the user; it is a text description of the qualified patterns that prompted the suggestion generation. For example, suggestion context indicates that the user and John Smith  spend 3 hours at the Starbucks in Palo alto every Friday afternoon together, even though they are not friends on the social networking system. Similarly, indicates the user and Sarah James  spend an hour together on the airport wifi network every two Sundays. The user receiving this notification may leverage other elements in the suggestions, such as profile pictures, mutual friends, and mutual interests to use as conversation in a real-life interaction. In particular embodiments, social networking system  may push suggestions to two users who have been on the same wifi network before, but never at the same time, as in suggestion . In suggestion , the two users both spend a great deal of time at Stanford Law Library, but either never at the same time, or never in a set pattern. In such situations, the social networking system may still push a suggestion to the users, particularly if other factors indicate that the two users would make good friends. For example, if both users are in the same age group, single, of opposite genders, in the same industry, and share the same interests, the social networking system may push a suggestion to the users, despite the fact that they have never actually been on the same network at the same time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7A"],"b":["718","719","720","721","722","723","720","723","724","718"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","800","800","800","800","800","800","800"]},"In particular embodiments, computer system  includes a processor , memory , storage , an input\/output (I\/O) interface , a communication interface , and a bus .
