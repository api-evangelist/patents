The United States Government has certain rights in these inventions.","This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/478,429, filed Jun. 4, 2009 and titled \u201cExternal Split Field Generator,\u201d which is incorporated by reference.","1. Technical Field","This application relates to devices that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and, more particularly, to generating electrical energy through magnetic field interactions.","2. Related Art","A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. Most generators include an armature and a magnetic field source. Electrical energy may be induced in a conductive member of the armature when there is a relative movement between the armature and a magnetic field. In some implementations, electrical energy may be generated at the armature by passing a moving magnetic field across a stationary armature. In these configurations, the armature would be the stator of the generator and the magnetic field source would be the rotor of the generator. In other implementations, the electrical energy may be generated at the armature by moving the armature through a stationary magnetic field. In these configurations, the magnetic field source would be the stator of the generator and the armature would be the rotor of the generator. When mechanical energy (e.g., a rotation force) is applied to the rotor of the generator, an electrical energy (e.g., current and voltage) may be induced in the armature. The induced electrical energy may then be output to power other electrical devices.","A generator includes a coil of conductive material. A stationary magnetic field source applies a stationary magnetic field to the coil. An internal magnetic field source is disposed within a cavity of the coil to apply a moving magnetic field to the coil. The stationary magnetic field interacts with the moving magnetic field to generate an electrical energy in the coil.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.","A generator may include an armature, a moving magnetic field source, and a stationary magnetic field source. Electrical energy may be induced in a conductive coil of the armature in response to an interaction between the armature, the moving magnetic field, and the stationary magnetic field. The moving magnetic field source may be positioned adjacent to a substantially neutral point of the conductive coil where the amount of flux from the moving magnetic field source would be balanced across both sides of the coil about equally. In this position, the moving magnetic field source alone may not induce much, if any, electrical energy in the coil. That result, however, may be substantially different when the stationary magnetic field is applied to the coil. The stationary magnetic field may be generated to pull magnetic flux from the moving magnetic field source back and forth across the coil as the polarity of the moving magnetic field alternates between north and south. When the moving magnetic field source is showing the coil a north polarity, more of the flux will be located in one side of the coil. When the moving magnetic field source is showing the coil a south polarity, more of the flux will be located in the other side of the coil. This flux interaction between the coil, the moving magnetic field, and the stationary magnetic field may result in an increased efficiency of the generator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","102","104","106","104","106"]},"The internal magnetic field source  includes a magnet  and a shaft . The magnet  produces a moving magnetic field in the vicinity of the armature . In one implementation, the magnet  may be a permanent magnet with multiple poles. As the magnet  is rotated about the axis of the shaft , a conductive member of the armature  may experience an alternating polarity from the internal magnetic field source . The portion of the magnet  nearest to the conductive member of the armature  may alternate between being a north pole and a south pole. In one implementation, the magnet  may have one north pole and one south pole. Therefore, the armature  may experience two pole changes per full rotation of the shaft  (e.g., from north to south, and then from south back to north). Alternatively, the magnet  may have more than one north pole and more than one south pole. Therefore, the armature  may experience more than two pole changes per full rotation of the shaft . If the magnet  has two north poles alternating with two south poles, then the armature  may experience four pole changes per full rotation of the shaft . Other implementations of the magnet  may include any other number of poles to provide different numbers of pole changes per rotation of the shaft . In one such implementation, the magnet  may be a combination of multiple magnets that are arranged so that the same polarity is facing out all the way around the magnet . In this implementation, the pole changes experienced at the armature  may result from transitions between one pole, such as a north pole, to a magnetically neutral area of the magnet . Another transition would then occur when the magnetically neutral area transitions back to another north pole as the magnet  rotates.","In another implementation, the magnet  may comprise a field source coil. To generate a moving magnetic field, an alternating current may be applied to the field source coil. In this implementation, the alternating current excited coil generates a moving magnetic field without moving any mechanical parts. When the alternating current is flowing in one direction through the field source coil, the magnet  will have a first polarity. When the alternating current is flowing in the other direction through the field source coil, the magnet  will have the opposite polarity. In this configuration, the generator  may operate as a transformer.","The armature  includes a frame , a coil , a first stationary magnetic field source , and a second stationary magnetic field source . The coil  may be formed from a conducting material, such as a copper wire. The coil  may be disposed about the frame . In one implementation, the coil  may include one or more conductive windings wrapped around the frame .","The frame  may include a core , one or more cavities , and an outer surface . The coil  may be wound on the outer surface  of the frame  so that the coil  is wrapped about the core . The portion of the frame  that supports the coil  may be made of a non-conducting and non-magnetizing material, such as wood, plastic, or the like. The core  may be made from a magnetizing material, such as iron, steel, ferrous alloys, or the like.","The cavity  of the frame  provides a space for the internal magnetic field source  to generate a moving magnetic field near the coil . The internal magnetic field source  may be rotated about an axis inside the cavity . The axis may be the axis of the rotating shaft . The frame  may include a passageway that allows the rotating shaft  to reach the internal magnetic field source  in the cavity . The cavity  may be filled with a magnetizing material that at least partially surrounds the internal magnetic field source . The filler material may be placed around the internal magnetic field source  in a way that allows rotation of the internal magnetic field source .","The stationary magnetic field sources  and  may be substantially stationary relative to the coil . In one implementation, the stationary magnetic field sources  and  may be connected with the armature . Alternatively, the stationary magnetic field sources  and  may be an integral portion of the armature . The stationary magnetic field source  may be disposed on a first end portion of the frame  or core . In one implementation, the first end portion may be the outermost end of the frame  or core . In another implementation, the first end portion may be any portion of the frame  or core  located on that side of the coil . The stationary magnetic field source  may be located at a point to the left of the coil  (based on the perspective of ). The stationary magnetic field source  may be disposed on a second end portion of the frame  or core . In one implementation, the second end portion may be the outermost portion of the frame  or core . In another implementation, the second end portion may be any portion of the frame  or core  located on that side of the coil . The stationary magnetic field source  may be located at a point to the right of the coil  (based on the perspective of ).","The stationary magnetic field sources  and  may comprise permanent magnets or direct current energized elements, such as coils. The polarity of the stationary magnetic field source  is opposite the polarity of the stationary magnetic field source . The stationary magnetic field sources  and  are positioned to be attracted to each other. In , the south pole of the stationary magnetic field source  is closer to the coil  than the north pole of the stationary magnetic field source . The north pole of the stationary magnetic field source  is closer to the coil  than the south pole of the stationary magnetic field source . In this configuration, there is an attraction between the south pole of the stationary magnetic field source  and the north pole of the stationary magnetic field source . In other implementations, the north pole of the stationary magnetic field source  and the south pole of the stationary magnetic field source  may be facing the coil  to provide the attraction between the stationary magnetic field sources  and .","The stationary magnetic field sources  and  apply a stationary magnetic field to the coil . In one implementation, the stationary magnetic field sources  and  may apply a stationary magnetic field along a substantially longitudinal axis of the coil . When the stationary magnetic field sources  and  are disposed on the frame  that supports the coil , the magnetic field between the stationary magnetic field sources  and  passes along or through the core  of the frame . When the coil  is wound on the frame  about the core , the core  may define the longitudinal axis of the coil . Therefore, the stationary magnetic field may pass along the longitudinal axis of the coil  by passing along or through the core .","The magnetic strength and position of the stationary magnetic field sources  and  may be based on a desired electrical output of the armature . For example, the electrical output from the armature  may depend on the strength and position of the stationary magnetic field sources  and . The strength and position of the stationary magnetic field sources  and  may be set so that the stationary magnetic field is strong enough to sufficiently pull the magnetic flux from the internal magnetic field source  back and forth across the coil . If the stationary magnetic field sources  and  are far away or are weak, the stationary magnetic field may not be strong enough to sufficiently pull the magnetic flux from the internal magnetic field source  back and forth across the coil to induce electrical energy in the coil as the internal magnetic field source  alternates polarity. Alternatively, if the stationary magnetic field sources  and  are too strong or too close together, then the stationary magnetic field may interfere with the ability of the moving magnetic field from the internal magnetic field source  to interact as strongly with the coil . The optimal position and strength of the stationary magnetic field sources  and  may be based on the material used to form the core , the size of the coil , and\/or the position of the internal magnetic field source  relative to the coil . The strength and position of the stationary magnetic field sources  and  may be adjusted until a desired output is achieved on the armature  based on the other selected components and attributes of the generator .","In one implementation of the generator , the stationary magnetic sources  and  may be N-42 Neodymium, \u215e of an inch in diameter, \u215b of an inch thick, and with a surface field of about 2885 Gauss (0.2885 Tesla). Alternatively, the surface field may be about 1000 Gauss to about 5000 Gauss, although the range may depend on the magnetic field spacing and the core material. The strength of the external magnetic field source  may be about 2500 Gauss (0.25 Tesla). The distance of the external magnetic field source  may be about 1 mm from the coil . Alternatively, the external magnetic field source  may be positioned to be closer or further away from the coil , such as up to several inches away from the coil . Any of these sizes, numbers, or measurements may be adjusted based on the intended application.","The internal magnetic field source  may be positioned adjacent to a substantially neutral point  of the coil . Depending on the shape of the coil , the internal magnetic field source  may be positioned substantially perpendicular to the substantially neutral point  of the coil . The substantially neutral point  may be the point in the coil  where the amount of flux from the internal magnetic field source  is balanced across both sides of the coil  about equally (without the interaction with the stationary magnetic field). If the internal magnetic field source  is located adjacent to the neutral point  of the coil , then the flux change from the internal magnetic field source  may produce a minimal induced electromagnetic force in the coil before addition of the stationary magnetic field from the stationary magnetic field sources  and . In this position, due to the balance across the coil, the moving magnetic field alone may not induce much, if any, electrical output from the coil . That result, however, may be substantially different when the stationary magnetic field is applied to the coil .","To identify the substantially neutral point  of the coil , the internal magnetic field source  may be placed adjacent to a first point on the inner side of the coil . The internal magnetic field source  may then be rotated to generate a moving magnetic field in the vicinity of the coil  before the stationary magnetic field is applied to the coil  (e.g., before stationary magnetic field sources  and  are placed on the armature  or other location). As the internal magnetic field source  rotates in the first chosen location, the output voltage from the armature  may be monitored. If the armature  is outputting little or no voltage as the internal magnetic field source  rotates at the first chosen location, then that location may be near the substantially neutral point  of the coil . If the armature  is transmitting a relatively large amount of voltage as the internal magnetic field source  rotates at the first chosen location, then that location may not be near the substantially neutral point  of the coil . In that situation, the internal magnetic field source  may be moved adjacent to a second point on the inside of the coil . The output voltage is measured with the internal magnetic field source  rotating at this new location. Once a position is determined for the internal magnetic field source  that results in little or no output voltage from the armature  (before the stationary magnetic field is applied to the coil ), then that position may be identified as the substantially neutral point  of the coil .","When the internal magnetic field source  rotates at the neutral point  of the coil , no output voltage may result at the armature (before the stationary magnetic field is applied to the coil ). In practice, however, some small amount of voltage may be transmitted from the armature  even if the neutral point  of the coil  is properly identified. Therefore, the neutral point  may include the absolute neutral point of the coil  as well as surrounding areas that may result in some small amount of voltage. The acceptable level of voltage induced when the internal magnetic field source  is at the neutral point  varies based on user defined tolerances as well as the desired strength of the output voltage. In one implementation, the neutral point may encompass several different possible positions for the internal magnetic field source  within an area around the absolute neutral point so that the output voltage, when the stationary magnetic sources  and  are not in place, would be about 5% of the output voltage that would occur when the stationary magnetic sources  and  are in place. In other implementations, other output voltage tolerance levels may be used, such as 20%, 10%, 1%, 0.1%, or the like.","In one implementation where the expected output voltage is about 4 volts when the stationary magnetic sources are in place, the output voltage when the stationary magnetic sources are removed may be in the range of about 5 mV (e.g., about 0.1% of the 4 volt expected output). However, the output voltage when the stationary magnetic sources are removed may be higher or lower than 5 mV, depending on the size and uniformity of the coil , and the acceptable positioning of the external magnetic field source  around the neutral point .","When the coil  is substantially uniform and symmetric (e.g., the individual windings of the coil  are uniformly distributed along the length of the coil ), the substantially neutral point  of the coil  may comprise the center point of the coil along the length of the coil, as shown in . Therefore, the internal magnetic field source  may be placed substantially perpendicular to the center point of the coil . If the coil  is not substantially uniform or symmetric, then the substantially neutral point  may be offset from the center of the coil  (e.g., to the left or right).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","104","114","104","122","104","104","114","114","114"]},"A first instance of the internal magnetic field source  may apply a first moving magnetic field to the coil . A second instance of the internal magnetic field source  may apply a second moving magnetic field to the coil . The second internal magnetic source may be aligned relative to the coil  so that the polarity of the second internal magnetic field source experienced at the coil  substantially matches the polarity of the first internal magnetic field source. As the multiple internal magnetic field sources are rotated about their respective axes, each internal magnetic field source may show substantially the same polarity to the coil  at a given time. When the south pole of the first internal magnetic field source is nearest to the coil , the south pole of the second internal magnetic field source may also be nearest to the coil .

Therefore, the multiple phase system of the generator  may reduce the amount of mechanical energy required to turn the shaft.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIGS. 13-15","FIG. 13"],"b":["1302","116","118","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1402","114","120","114","1404","1406","120","1408","1410","120","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"b":["1502","120","120","1504","120","1506","120","1508","120","1510","120","1504","1506","1508","1510","120"]},"The term \u201ccoupled\u201d may encompass both direct and indirect coupling.
