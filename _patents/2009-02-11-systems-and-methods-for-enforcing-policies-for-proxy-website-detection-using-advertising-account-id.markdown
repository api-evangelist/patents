We will now turn to a description of the threat management system ","Over recent years, malware has become a major problem across the internet . From both technical and user perspectives the categorization of a specific threat type, such as whether it is a virus, worm, spam, phishing exploration, spyware, adware, or the like, is becoming reduced in significance. The threat, no matter how it's categorized, may need to be stopped at all points of the enterprise facility , including laptop, desktop, server facility , gateway, and the like. Similarly, there may be less and less benefit to the user in having different solutions for known and unknown threats. As such, a consolidated threat management facility  may need to be applied to the same set of technologies and capabilities for all threats. The threat management facility  may provide a single agent on the desktop, and a single scan of any suspect file. This approach may eliminate the inevitable overlaps and gaps in protection caused by treating viruses and spyware as separate problems, while simultaneously simplifying administration and minimizing desktop load. As the number and range of types of threats has increased, so may have the level of connectivity available to all IT users. This may have lead to a rapid increase in the speed at which threats may move. Today, an unprotected PC connected to the internet  may be infected quickly, say within 10 minutes, which may require acceleration for the delivery of threat protection. Where once, monthly updates may have been sufficient, the threat management facility  may automatically and seamlessly update its product set against spam and virus threats quickly, for instance, every five minutes, every minute, continuously, or the like. Analysis and testing may be increasingly automated, and also may be performed more frequently; for instance, it may be completed in 15 minutes, and may do so without compromising quality. The threat management facility  may also extend techniques that may have been developed for virus and malware protection, and provide them to enterprise facility  network administrators to better control their environments. In addition to stopping malicious code, the threat management facility  may provide policy management that may be able to control legitimate applications, such as VoIP, instant messaging, peer-to-peer file-sharing, and the like, that may undermine productivity and network performance within the enterprise facility .","The threat management facility  may provide an enterprise facility  protection from computer-based malware, including viruses, spyware, adware, Trojans, intrusion, spam, policy abuse, uncontrolled access, and the like, where the enterprise facility  may be any entity with a networked computer-based infrastructure. In an embodiment,  may depict a block diagram of the threat management facility providing protection to an enterprise against a plurality of threats. The enterprise facility  may be corporate, commercial, educational, governmental, or the like, and the enterprise facility's  computer network may be distributed amongst a plurality of facilities, and in a plurality of geographical locations. The threat management facility  may include a plurality of functions, such as security management facility , policy management facility , update facility , definitions facility , network access rules facility , remedial action facility , detection techniques facility , testing facility , threat research facility , and the like. In embodiments, the threat protection provided by the threat management facility  may extend beyond the network boundaries of the enterprise facility  to include enterprise facility  client facility's  that have moved into network connectivity not directly associated or controlled by the enterprise facility . Threats to enterprise facility  client facilities  may come from a plurality of sources, such as from network threats , physical proximity threats , secondary location threats , and the like. In embodiments, the threat management facility  may provide an enterprise facility  protection from a plurality of threats to multiplatform computer resources in a plurality of locations and network configurations, with an integrated system approach.","In embodiments, the threat management facility  may be provided as a stand-alone solution. In other embodiments, the threat management facility  may be integrated into a third-party product. An application programming interface (e.g. a source code interface) may be provided such that the threat management facility  may be integrated. For instance, the threat management facility  may be stand-alone in that it provides direct threat protection to an enterprise or computer resource, where protection is subscribed to directly with the threat management facility . Alternatively, the threat management facility may offer protection indirectly, through a third-party product, where an enterprise may subscribe to services through the third-party product, and threat protection to the enterprise may be provided by the threat management facility  through the third-party product.","The security management facility  may include a plurality of elements that provide protection from malware to enterprise facility  computer resources, including endpoint security and control, email security and control, web security and control, reputation-based filtering, control of unauthorized users, control of guest and non-compliant computers, and the like. The security management facility  may be a software application that may provide malicious code and malicious application protection to a client facility  computing resource. The security management facility  may have the ability to scan the client facility  files for malicious code, remove or quarantine certain applications and files, prevent certain actions, perform remedial actions and perform other security measures. In embodiments, scanning the client facility  may include scanning some or all of the files stored to the client facility  on a periodic basis, may scan applications once the application has been requested to execute, may scan files as the files are transmitted to or from the client facility , or the like. The scanning of the applications and files may be to detect known malicious code or known unwanted applications. In an embodiment, new malicious code and unwanted applications may be continually developed and distributed, and updates to the known code database may be provided on a periodic basis, on a demand basis, on an alert basis, or the like.","In an embodiment, the security management facility  may provide for email security and control, where security management may help to eliminate spam, viruses, spyware and phishing, control of email content, and the like.

In an embodiment, security management facility  may provide for web security and control, where security management may help to detect or block viruses, spyware, malware, unwanted applications, help control web browsing, and the like, which may provide comprehensive web access control enabling safe, productive web browsing. Web security and control may provide internet use policies, reporting on suspect devices, security and content filtering, active monitoring of network traffic, URL filtering, and the like. In an embodiment, the security management facility  may provide for network access control, which may provide control over network connections. Network control may stop unauthorized, guest, or non-compliant systems from accessing networks, and may control network traffic that may not be bypassed from the client level. In addition, network access control may control access to virtual private networks (VPN), where VPNs may be a communications network tunneled through another network, establishing a logical connection acting as a virtual network. In embodiments, a VPN may be treated in the same manner as a physical network.","In an embodiment, the security management facility  may provide for host intrusion prevention through behavioral based protection, which may guard against unknown threats by analyzing behavior before software code executes. Behavioral based protection may monitor code when it runs and intervene if the code is deemed to be suspicious or malicious. Advantages of behavioral based protection over runtime protection may include code being prevented from running, whereas runtime protection may only interrupt code that has already partly executed; behavioral protection may identify malicious code at the gateway or on the file servers and deletes it before reaching end-point computers and the like.","In an embodiment, the security management facility  may provide for reputation filtering, which may target or identify sources of known malware. For instance, reputation filtering may include lists of URLs of known sources of malware or known suspicious IP addresses, or domains, say for spam, that when detected may invoke an action by the threat management facility , such as dropping them immediately. By dropping the source before any interaction can initiate, potential threat sources may be thwarted before any exchange of data can be made.","In embodiments, information may be sent from the enterprise back to a third party, a vendor, or the like, which may lead to improved performance of the threat management facility . For example, the types, times, and number of virus interactions that a client experiences may provide useful information for the preventions of future virus threats. This type of feedback may be useful for any aspect of threat detection. Feedback of information may also be associated with behaviors of individuals within the enterprise, such as being associated with most common violations of policy, network access, unauthorized application loading, unauthorized external device use, and the like. In embodiments, this type of information feedback may enable the evaluation or profiling of client actions that are violations of policy that may provide a predictive model for the improvement of enterprise policies.","In an embodiment, the security management facility  may provide for the overall security of the enterprise facility  network or set of enterprise facility  networks, may provide updates of malicious code information to the enterprise facility  network, and associated client facilities . The updates may be a planned update, an update in reaction to a threat notice, an update in reaction to a request for an update, an update based on a search of known malicious code information, or the like. The administration facility  may provide control over the security management facility  when updates are performed. The updates may be automatically transmitted without an administration facility's  direct control, manually transmitted by the administration facility , or the like. The security management facility  may include the management of receiving malicious code descriptions from a provider, distribution of malicious code descriptions to enterprise facility  networks, distribution of malicious code descriptions to client facilities , or the like. In an embodiment, the management of malicious code information may be provided to the enterprise facility's  network, where the enterprise facility's  network may provide the malicious code information through the enterprise facility's  network distribution system.","The threat management facility  may provide policy management facility  that may be able to block non-malicious applications, such as VoIP , instant messaging , peer-to-peer file-sharing, and the like, that may undermine productivity and network performance within the enterprise facility . The policy management facility  may be a set of rules or policies that may indicate enterprise facility  access permissions for the client facility , such as access permissions associated with the network, applications, external computer devices, and the like. The policy management facility  may include a database, a text file, a combination of databases and text files, or the like. In an embodiment, a policy database may be a block list, a black list, an allowed list, a white list, or the like that may provide a list of enterprise facility  external network locations\/applications that may or may not be accessed by the client facility . The policy management facility  may include rules that may be interpreted with respect to an enterprise facility  network access request to determine if the request should be allowed. The rules may provide a generic rule for the type of access that may be granted; the rules may be related to the policies of an enterprise facility  for access rights for the enterprise facility's  client facility . For example, there may be a rule that does not permit access to sporting websites. When a website is requested by the client facility , a security facility may access the rules within a policy facility to determine if the requested access is related to a sporting website. In an embodiment, the security facility may analyze the requested website to determine if the website matches with any of the policy facility rules.","The policy management facility  may be similar to the security management facility  but with the distribution of enterprise facility  wide access rules and policies that may maintain control of the access of client facility  to enterprise facility  network resources. The policies may be defined for application type, subset of application capabilities, organization hierarchy, computer facility type, user type, network location, time of day, connection type, or the like. Policies may be maintained by the administration facility , through the threat management facility , in association with a third party, or the like. For example, a policy may restrict IM  activity to only support personnel for communicating with customers. This may allow communication for departments requiring access, but may maintain the network bandwidth for other activities by restricting the use of IM  to only the personnel that need access to IM  in support of the enterprise facility . In an embodiment, the policy management facility  may be a standalone application, may be part of the policy management facility , network server facility , may be part of the enterprise facility  network, may be part of the client facility , or the like.","In embodiments, the threat management facility  may provide configuration management, which may be similar to policy management, but may specifically examine the configuration set of applications, operating systems, hardware, and the like, and managing changes to their configurations. Assessment of a configuration may be made against a standard configuration policy, detection of configuration changes, remediation of improper configuration, application of new configurations, and the like. An enterprise may keep a set of standard configuration rules and policies which may represent the desired state of the device. For example, a client firewall may be running and installed, but in the disabled state, where remediation may be to enable the firewall. In another example, the enterprise may set a rule that disallows the use of USB disks, and sends a configuration change to all clients, which turns off USB drive access via a registry.","In embodiments, the threat management facility  may also provide for the removal of applications that may interfere with the operation of the threat management facility , such as competitor products that may also be attempting similar threat management functions. The removal of such products may be initiated automatically whenever such products are detected. In the case where such applications are services are provided indirectly through a third-party product, the application may be suspended until action is taken to remove or disable the third-party product's protection facility.","Threat management against a sometimes quickly evolving malware environment may require timely updates, and the update management facility  may be provided by the threat management facility . In addition, a policy management facility  may also require update management (e.g. as provided by the update facility  herein described), as the enterprise facility  requirements for policies change enterprise facility , client facility , server facility  enterprise facility . The update management for the security facility  and policy management facility  may be provided directly by the threat management facility , such as by a hosted system or in conjunction with the administration facility . In embodiments, the threat management facility  may provide for patch management, where a patch may be an update to an operating system, an application, a system tool, or the like, where one of the reasons for the patch is to reduce vulnerability to threats.","In embodiments, the security facility  and policy management facility  may push information to the enterprise facility  network and\/or client facility , the enterprise facility  network and\/or client facility  may pull information from the security facility  and policy management facility  network server facilities , there may be a combination of pushing and pulling of information between the security facility  and the policy management facility  network servers , enterprise facility  network, and client facilities , or the like. For example, the enterprise facility  network and\/or client facility  may pull information from the security facility  and policy management facility  network server facility  may request the information using the security facility  and policy management facility  update module; the request may be based on a certain time period, by a certain time, by a date, on demand, or the like. In another example, the security facility  and policy management facility  network servers  may push the information to the enterprise facility's  network and\/or client facility  by providing notification that there are updates available for download and then transmitting the information. The combination of the security management  network server facility  and security update module may function substantially the same as the policy management facility  network server and policy update module by providing information to the enterprise facility  network and the client facility  in a push or pull method. In an embodiment, the policy management facility  and the security facility  management update modules may work in concert to provide all the needed information to the enterprise facility's  network and\/or client facility  for control of application execution. In an embodiment, the policy update module and security update module may be combined into a single update module.","As threats are identified and characterized, the threat management facility  may create definition updates that may be used to allow the threat management facility  to detect and remediate the latest malicious software, unwanted applications, configuration and policy changes, and the like. The threat definition facility  may contain threat identification updates, also referred to as definition files. A definition file may be a virus identity file that may include definitions of known or potential malicious code. The IDE definition files may provide information that may identify malicious code within files, applications, or the like. The definition files may be accessed by security management facility  when scanning files or applications within the client facility  for the determination of malicious code that may be within the file or application. The definition files may contain a number of commands, definitions, or instructions, to be parsed and acted upon, or the like. In embodiments, the client facility  may be updated with new definition files periodically to provide the client facility  with the most recent malicious code definitions; the updating may be performed on a set time period, may be updated on demand from the client facility , may be updated on demand from the network, may be updated on a received malicious code alert, or the like. In an embodiment, the client facility  may request an update to the definition files from an update facility  within the network, may request updated definition files from a computing facility external to the network, updated definition files may be provided to the client facility  from within the network, definition files may be provided to the client facility  from an external computing facility from an external network, or the like.","In an embodiment, a definition management facility  may provide for the timely updates of definition files information to the network, client facilities , and the like. New and altered malicious code and malicious applications may be continually created and distributed to networks worldwide. The definition files that maintain the definitions of the malicious code and malicious application information for the protection of the networks and client facilities  may need continual updating to provide continual defense of the network and client facility  from the malicious code and malicious applications. The definition files management may provide for automatic and manual methods of updating the definition files. In embodiments, the network may receive definition files and distribute the definition files to the network client facilities , the client facilities  may receive the definition files directly, or the network and client facilities  may both receive the definition files, or the like. In an embodiment, the definition files may be updated on a fixed periodic basis, on demand by the network and\/or the client facility , as a result of an alert of a new malicious code or malicious application, or the like. In an embodiment, the definition files may be released as a supplemental file to an existing definition files to provide for rapid updating of the definition files.","In a similar manner, the security management facility  may be used to scan an outgoing file and verify that the outgoing file is permitted to be transmitted per the enterprise facility  rules and policies. By checking outgoing files, the security management facility  may be able discover malicious code infected files that were not detected as incoming files as a result of the client facility  having been updated with either new definition files or policy management facility  information. The definition files may discover the malicious code infected file by having received updates of developing malicious code from the administration facility , updates from a definition files provider, or the like. The policy management facility  may discover the malicious code infected file by having received new updates from the administration facility , from a rules provider, or the like.","The threat management facility  may provide for a way to control access to the enterprise facility  networks. For instance, the enterprise facility  may want to restrict access to certain applications, networks, files, printers, servers, databases, or the like. In addition, the enterprise facility  may want to restrict user access under certain conditions, such as the user's location, usage history, need to know, job position, connection type, time of day, method of authentication, client-system configuration, or the like. Network access rules may be developed by the enterprise facility , or pre-packaged by a supplier, and managed by the threat management facility  in conjunction with the administration facility . Network access rules and control may be responsible for determining if a client facility  application should be granted access to a requested network location. The network location may be on the same network as the facility or may be on another network. In an embodiment, the network access control may verify access rights for client facilities  from within the network or may verify access rights of computer facilities from external networks. When network access for a client facility  is denied, the network access control may send an information file to the client facility , the information file may contain data or commands that may provide instructions for the remedial action facility . The information sent by the network access facility  control may be a data file. The data file may contain a number of commands, definitions, instructions, or commands to be parsed and acted upon through the remedial action facility , or the like. The information sent by the network access facility  control may be a command or command file that the remedial action facility  may access and take action upon.","In an embodiment, the network access rules  may provide an information store to be accessed by the network access control. The network access rules facility  may include databases such as a block list, a black list, an allowed list, a white list, an unacceptable network site database, an acceptable network site database, a network site reputation database, or the like of network access locations that may or may not be accessed by the client facility . Additionally, the network access rules facility  may incorporate rule evaluation; the rule evaluation may parse network access requests and apply the parsed information to network access rules. The network access rule facility  may have a generic set of rules that may be in support of an enterprise facility's  network access policies, such as denying access to certain types of websites , controlling instant messenger  accesses, or the like. Rule evaluation may include regular expression rule evaluation, or other rule evaluation method for interpreting the network access request and comparing the interpretation to the established rules for network access. In an embodiment, the network access rules facility  may receive a rules evaluation request from the network access control and may return the rules evaluation to the network access control.","Similar to the threat definitions facility , the network access rule facility  may provide updated rules and policies to the network access rules facility . The network access rules facility  may be maintained by the network administration facility  using the network access rules facility  management. In an embodiment, the network administration facility  may be able to maintain a set of access rules manually by adding rules, changing rules, deleting rules, or the like. Additionally, the administration facility  may be able to retrieve predefined rule sets from a provider that may provide a set of rules to be applied to an entire enterprise facility . The network administration facility  may be able to modify the predefined rules as needed for a particular enterprise facility  using the network access rules management facility .","When a threat or policy violation is detected by the threat management facility , the threat management facility  may provide for a remedial action facility . Remedial action may take a plurality of forms, such as terminating or modifying an ongoing process or interaction, sending a warning to a client or administration facility  of an ongoing process or interaction, executing a program or application to remediate against a threat or violation, record interactions for subsequent evaluation, or the like. Remedial action may be associated with an application that responds to information that a client facility  network access request has been denied. In an embodiment, when the data file is received, remedial action may parse the data file, interpret the various aspects of the data file, and act on the parsed data file information to determine actions to be taken on an application requesting access to a denied network location. In an embodiment, when the data file is received, remedial action may access the threat definitions to parse the data file and determine an action to be taken on an application requesting access to a denied network location. In an embodiment, the information received from the facility may be a command or a command file. The remedial action facility may carry out any commands that are received or parsed from a data file from the facility without performing any interpretation of the commands. In an embodiment, the remedial action facility may interact with the received information and may perform various actions on a client requesting access to a denied network location. The action may be one or more of continuing to block all requests to a denied network location, a malicious code scan on the application, a malicious code scan on the client facility , quarantine of the application, terminating the application, isolation of the application, isolation of the client facility  to a location within the network that restricts network access, blocking a network access port from a client facility , reporting the application to a administration facility , or the like.","Remedial action may be provided as a result of a detection of a threat or violation. The detection techniques facility  may include monitoring the enterprise facility  network or end-point devices, such as by monitoring streaming data through the gateway, across the network, through routers and hubs, and the like. The detection techniques facility  may include monitoring activity and stored files on computing facilities, such as on server facilities , desktop computers, laptop computers, other mobile computing devices, and the like. Detection techniques, such as scanning a computer's stored files, may provide the capability of checking files for stored threats, either in the active or passive state. Detection techniques, such as streaming file management, may provide the capability of checking files received at the network, gateway facility, client facility , and the like. This may provide the capability of not allowing a streaming file or portions of the streaming file containing malicious code from entering the client facility , gateway facility, or network. In an embodiment, the streaming file may be broken into blocks of information, and a plurality of virus identities may be used to check each of the blocks of information for malicious code. In an embodiment, any blocks that are not determined to be clear of malicious code may not be delivered to the client facility , gateway facility, or network.","Verifying that the threat management facility  is detecting threats and violations to established policy, may require the ability to test the system, either at the system level or for a particular computing component. The testing facility  may allow the administration facility  to coordinate the testing of the security configurations of client facility  computing facilities on a network. The administration facility  may be able to send test files to a set of client facility  computing facilities to test the ability of the client facility  to determine acceptability of the test file. After the test file has been transmitted, a recording facility may record the actions taken by the client facility  in reaction to the test file. The recording facility may aggregate the testing information from the client facility  and report the testing information to the administration facility . The administration facility  may be able to determine the level of preparedness of the client facility  computing facilities by the reported information. Remedial action may be taken for any of the client facility  computing facilities as determined by the administration facility ; remedial action may be taken by the administration facility  or by the user of the client facility .","The threat research facility  may provide a continuously ongoing effort to maintain the threat protection capabilities of the threat management facility  in light of continuous generation of new or evolved forms of malware. Threat research may include researchers and analysts working on known and emerging malware, such as viruses, rootkits a spyware, as well as other computer threats such as phishing, spam, scams, and the like. In embodiments, through threat research, the threat management facility  may be able to provide swift, global responses to the latest threats.","The threat management facility  may provide threat protection to the enterprise facility , where the enterprise facility  may include a plurality of networked components, such as client facility , server facility , DNS server facility , administration facility , firewall , gateway, hubs , routers, threat management appliance , desktop users, mobile users, and the like. In embodiments, it may be the end-point computer security facility , located on a computer's desktop, which may provide threat protection to a user, and associated enterprise facility . In embodiments, the term end-point may refer to a computer system that may source data, receive data, evaluate data, buffer data, or the like, such as a user's desktop computer as an end-point computer, a firewall as a data evaluation end-point computer system, a laptop as a mobile end-point computer, a PDA as a hand-held end-point computer. In embodiments, end-point may refer to a source or destination for data, including such components where the destination is characterized by an evaluation point for data, and where the data may be sent to a subsequent destination after evaluation. The end-point computer security facility  may be an application loaded onto the computer platform or computer support component, where the application may accommodate the plurality of computer platforms and\/or functional requirements of the component. For instance, a client facility  computer may be one of a plurality of computer platforms, such as Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and the like, where the end-point computer security facility  may be adapted to the specific platform, while maintaining a uniform product and product services across platforms. Additionally, components may have different functions to serve within the enterprise facility's  networked computer-based infrastructure. For instance, computer support components provided as hubs , routers, server facility , DNS server facility , firewalls , and the like, may require unique security application software to protect their portion of the system infrastructure, while providing an element in an integrated threat management system that extends out beyond the threat management facility  to incorporate all computer resources under its protection.","The enterprise facility  may include a plurality of client facility  computing platforms on which the end-point computer security facility  is adapted. A client facility  computing platform may be a computer system that is able to access a service on another computer, such as a server facility , via a network. This client facility  server facility  model may apply to a plurality of networked applications, such as a client facility  connecting to an enterprise facility  application server facility , a web browser client facility  connecting to a web server facility , an e-mail client facility  retrieving e-mail from an internet  service provider's mail storage servers , and the like. In embodiments, traditional large client facility  applications may be switched to websites, which may increase the browser's role as a client facility . Clients  may be classified as a function of the extent to which they perform their own processing. For instance, client facilities  are sometimes classified as a fat client facility  or thin client facility . The fat client facility , also known as a thick client facility  or rich client facility , may be a client facility  that performs the bulk of data processing operations itself, and does not necessarily rely on the server facility . The fat client facility  may be most common in the form of a personal computer, where the personal computer may operate independent of any server facility . Programming environments for fat clients  may include CURI, Delphi, Droplets, Java, win32, X11, and the like. Thin clients  may offer minimal processing capabilities, for instance, the thin client facility  may primarily provide a graphical user interface provided by an application server facility , which may perform the bulk of any required data processing. Programming environments for thin clients  may include JavaScript\/AJAX, ASP, JSP, Ruby on Rails, Python's Django, PHP, and the like. The client facility  may also be a mix of the two, such as processing data locally, but relying on a server facility  for data storage. As a result, this hybrid client facility  may provide benefits from both the fat client facility  type, such as multimedia support and high performance, and the thin client facility  type, such as high manageability and flexibility. In embodiments, the threat management facility , and associated end-point computer security facility , may provide seamless threat protection to the plurality of clients , and client facility  types, across the enterprise facility .","The enterprise facility  may include a plurality of server facility , such as application servers , communications servers , file servers , database servers , proxy servers , mail servers , fax servers , game servers , web servers , and the like. A server facility , which may also be referred to as a server facility  application, server facility  operating system, server facility  computer, or the like, may be an application program or operating system that accepts client facility  connections in order to service requests from clients . The server facility  application may run on the same computer as the client facility  using it, or the server facility  and the client facility  may be running on different computers and communicating across the network. Server facility  applications may be divided among server facility  computers, with the dividing depending upon the workload. For instance, under light load conditions all server facility  applications may run on a single computer and under heavy load conditions a single server facility  application may run on multiple computers. In embodiments, the threat management facility  may provide threat protection to server facilities  within the enterprise facility  as load conditions and application changes are made.","A server facility  may also be an appliance facility , where the appliance facility  provides specific services onto the network. Though the appliance facility  is a server facility  computer, that may be loaded with a server facility  operating system and server facility  application, the enterprise facility  user may not need to configure it, as the configuration may have been performed by a third party. In an embodiment, an enterprise facility  appliance may be a server facility  appliance that has been configured and adapted for use with the threat management facility , and located within the facilities of the enterprise facility . The enterprise facility's  threat management appliance may enable the enterprise facility  to administer an on-site local managed threat protection configuration, where the administration facility  may access the threat resources through an interface, such as a web portal. In an alternate embodiment, the enterprise facility  may be managed remotely from a third party, vendor, or the like, without an appliance facility  located within the enterprise facility . In this instance, the appliance functionality may be a shared hardware product between pluralities of enterprises . In embodiments, the appliance facility  may be located at the enterprise facility , where the enterprise facility  maintains a degree of control. In embodiments, a hosted service may be provided, where the appliance  may still be an on-site black box to the enterprise facility , physically placed there because of infrastructure requirements, but managed by a third party, vendor, or the like.","Simple server facility  appliances may also be utilized across the enterprise facility's  network infrastructure, such as switches, routers, wireless routers, hubs , gateways, print servers , net modems, and the like. These simple server facility appliances may not require configuration by the enterprise facility , but may require protection from threats via an end-point computer security facility . These appliances may provide interconnection services within the enterprise facility  network, and therefore may advance the spread of a threat if not properly protected.","One way for a client facility  to be protected from threats from within the enterprise facility  network may be a personal firewall. A personal firewall may be an application that controls network traffic to and from a client, permitting or denying communications based on a security policy. Personal firewalls may be designed for use by end-users, which may result in protection for only the computer on which it's installed. Personal firewalls may be able to control network traffic by providing prompts each time a connection is attempted and adapting security policy accordingly. Personal firewalls may also provide some level of intrusion detection, which may allow the software to terminate or block connectivity where it suspects an intrusion is being attempted. Other features that may be provided by a personal firewall may include alerts about outgoing connection attempts, control of program access to networks, hiding the client from port scans by not responding to unsolicited network traffic, monitoring of applications that may be listening for incoming connections, monitoring and regulation of incoming and outgoing network traffic, prevention of unwanted network traffic from installed applications, reporting applications that make connection attempts, reporting destination servers with which applications may be attempting communications, and the like. In embodiments, the personal firewall may be provided by the threat management facility .","Another important component that may be protected by an end-point computer security facility  is a network firewall facility , which may be a hardware or software device that may be configured to permit, deny, or proxy data through a computer network that has different levels of trust in its source of data. For instance, an internal enterprise facility  network may have a high level of trust, because the source of all data has been sourced from within the enterprise facility . An example of a low level of trust is the Internet , because the source of data may be unknown. A zone with an intermediate trust level, situated between the Internet  and a trusted internal network, may be referred to as a \u201cperimeter network\u201d. Since firewall facilities  represent boundaries between threat levels, the end-point computer security facility  associated with the firewall facility  may provide resources that may control the flow of threats at this enterprise facility  network entry point. Firewall facilities , and associated end-point computer security facility , may also be associated with a network node that may be equipped for interfacing between networks that use different protocols. In embodiments, the end-point computer security facility  may provide threat protection in a plurality of network infrastructure locations, such as at the enterprise facility  network entry point, i.e. the firewall facility  or gateway; at the server facility ; at distribution points within the network, i.e. the routers and hubs ; at the desktop of client facility  computers; and the like. In embodiments, the most effective location for threat detection may be at the user's computer desktop end-point computer security facility .","The interface between the threat management facility  and the enterprise facility , and through the appliance facility  to embedded end-point computer security facilities, may include a set of tools that may be the same for all enterprise implementations, but allow each enterprise to implement different controls. In embodiments, these controls may include both automatic actions and managed actions. Automatic actions may include downloads of the end-point computer security facility  to components of the enterprise facility , downloads of updates to existing end-point computer security facilities of the enterprise facility , uploaded network interaction requests from enterprise facility  components to the threat management facility , and the like. In embodiments, automatic interactions between the enterprise facility  and the threat management facility  may be configured by the threat management facility  and an administration facility  in the enterprise facility . The administration facility  may configure policy rules that determine interactions, such as developing rules for accessing applications, as in who is authorized and when applications may be used; establishing rules for ethical behavior and activities; rules governing the use of entertainment software such as games, or personal use software such as IM  and VoIP ; rules for determining access to enterprise facility  computing resources, including authentication, levels of access, risk assessment, and usage history tracking; rules for when an action is not allowed, such as whether an action is completely deigned or just modified in its execution; and the like. The administration facility  may also establish license management, which in turn may further determine interactions associated with a licensed application. In embodiments, interactions between the threat management facility  and the enterprise facility  may provide threat protection to the enterprise facility  by managing the flow of network data into and out of the enterprise facility  through automatic actions that may be configured by the threat management facility  or the administration facility .","Client facilities  within the enterprise facility  may be connected to the enterprise facility  network by way of wired network facilities  or wireless network facilities . Client facilities  connected to the enterprise facility  network via a wired facility  or wireless facility  may receive similar protection, as both connection types are ultimately connected to the same enterprise facility  network, with the same end-point computer security facility , and the same threat protected enterprise facility  environment. Mobile wireless facility  clients , because of their ability to connect to any wireless  network access point, may connect to the internet  outside the enterprise facility , and therefore outside the threat-protected environment of the enterprise facility . In this instance the mobile client facility , if not for the presence of the end-point computer security facility  may experience a malware attack or perform actions counter to enterprise facility  established policies. In addition, there may be a plurality of ways for the threat management facility  to protect the out-of-enterprise facility  mobile client facility  that has an embedded end-point computer security facility , such as by providing URL filtering in personal routers, using a web appliance as a DNS proxy, or the like. Mobile client facilities  that are components of the enterprise facility  but temporarily outside connectivity with the enterprise facility  network, may be provided with the same threat protection and policy control as client facilities  inside the enterprise facility . In addition, mobile client facilities  may receive the same interactions to and from the threat management facility  as client facilities  inside the enterprise facility , where mobile client facilities  may be considered a virtual extension of the enterprise facility , receiving all the same services via their embedded end-point computer security facility .","Interactions between the threat management facility  and the components of the enterprise facility , including mobile client facility  extensions of the enterprise facility , may ultimately be connected through the internet . Threat management facility  downloads and upgrades to the enterprise facility  may be passed from the firewalled networks of the threat management facility  through to the end-point computer security facility  equipped components of the enterprise facility . In turn the end-point computer security facility  components of the enterprise facility  may upload policy and access requests back across the internet  and through to the threat management facility . The Internet  however, is also the path through which threats may be transmitted from their source. These network threats may include threats from a plurality of sources, including websites , e-mail , IM , VoIP , application software, and the like. These threats may attempt to attack a mobile enterprise facility  client facility  equipped with an end-point computer security facility , but in embodiments, as long as the mobile client facility  is embedded with an end-point computer security facility , as described above, threats may have no better success than if the mobile client facility  where inside the enterprise facility .","However, if the mobile client facility  were to attempt to connect into an unprotected connection point, such as at a secondary location  that is not a part of the enterprise facility , the mobile client facility  may be required to request network interactions through the threat management facility , where contacting the threat management facility  may be performed prior to any other network action. In embodiments, the client facility's  end-point computer security facility  may manage actions in unprotected network environments such as when the client facility  is in a secondary location  or connecting wirelessly  to a non-enterprise facility  wireless internet  connection, where the end-point computer security facility  may dictate what actions are allowed, blocked, modified, or the like. For instance, if the client facility's  end-point computer security facility  is unable to establish a secured connection to the threat management facility , the end-point computer security facility  may inform the user of such, and recommend that the connection not be made. In the instance when the user chooses to connect despite the recommendation, the end-point computer security facility  may perform specific actions during or after the unprotected connection is made, including running scans during the connection period, running scans after the connection is terminated, storing interactions for subsequent threat and policy evaluation, contacting the threat management facility  upon first instance of a secured connection for further actions and or scanning restricting access to network and local resources, or the like. In embodiments, the end-point computer security facility  may perform specific actions to remediate possible threat incursions or policy violations during or after the unprotected connection.","The secondary location  may have no end-point computer security facilities  as a part of its computer components, such as its firewalls , servers , clients , hubs , wireless hubs , and the like. As a result, the computer components of the secondary location  may be open to threat attacks, and become potential sources of threats, as well as any mobile enterprise facility  clients  that may be connected to the secondary location's  network. In this instance, these computer components may now unknowingly spread a threat to other components connected to the network.","Some threats may not come directly from the Internet , such as from non-enterprise facility  controlled mobile devices that are physically brought into the enterprise facility  and connected to the enterprise facility  client facilities . The connection may be made from direct connection with the enterprise facility's  client facility , such as through a USB port, or in physical proximity with the enterprise facility's  client facility  such that a wireless facility  connection can be established, such as through a Bluetooth connection. These physical proximity threats  may be another mobile computing device, a portable memory storage device, a mobile communications device, or the like, such as CDs and DVDs , memory stick , flash drive , external hard drive, cell phone , PDAs , MP3 players, digital cameras, point-to-point devices, digital picture frames, digital pens, navigation devices, appliances, and the like. A physical proximity threat  may have been previously infiltrated by network threats while connected to an unprotected network connection outside the enterprise facility , and when connected to the enterprise facility  client facility , pose a threat. Because of their mobile nature, physical proximity threats  may infiltrate computing resources in any location, such as being physically brought into the enterprise facility  site, connected to an enterprise facility  client facility  while that client facility  is mobile, plugged into an unprotected client facility  at a secondary location , and the like. A mobile device, once connected to an unprotected computer resource, may become a physical proximity threat . In embodiments, the end-point computer security facility  may provide enterprise facility  computing resources with threat protection against physical proximity threats , for instance, through scanning the device prior to allowing data transfers, through security validation certificates, through establishing a safe zone within the enterprise facility  computing resource to transfer data into for evaluation, and the like.","Now that the overall system has been described, we turn towards a set of embodiments that apply policies to proxy communications. It should be understood that the following embodiments may be managed through a threat management facility  along with other services, such as those described herein.","It should be understood that, in embodiments, a web gateway may include a security facility . In this context, the security facility  may in effect eavesdrop on requests and responses that pass through the web gateway. As appropriate and in accordance with one or more policies, the security facility  may cause the gateway to drop certain incoming requests, drop certain incoming responses, prevent the retransmission of requests or responses, transmit any of a variety of messages or alerts, and so on. This is described in detail herein and elsewhere.","In some embodiments, client computers or other computing facilities may include the security facility . This is described in greater detail hereinabove with reference to  and elsewhere.","Proxy communications may involve a proxy server. The server C may be a proxy server outside of the enterprise . In some embodiments, the proxy server C may be a so-called \u201canonymizer\u201d that allows a user to indirectly access network content outside of the enterprise . In embodiments, the network content may include websites, web services, any and all data files or data streams, and so on. In any case, the indirect access may enable a user to access the network content via alternate URLs that are directed at the proxy server C rather than source servers for the content. Throughout this disclosure, proxy servers and anonymizers may be referred to interchangeably except where otherwise stated or clear from the context.","Some security applications, such as and without limitation parental control type applications, may be directed at restricting access to network content. To perform their intended function, these applications may need to function in a network environment that includes proxy servers.","In embodiments, the present invention may identify a plurality of website categories, such as content-based categories, security categories, and the like. For instance, content-based categories may include adult\/sexually explicit, advertisements & pop-ups, alcohol & tobacco, arts, blogs & forums, business, chat, computing & internet, criminal activity, downloads, education, entertainment, fashion & beauty, finance & investment, food & dining, gambling, games, government, hacking, health & medicine, hobbies & recreation, hosting sites, illegal drugs, infrastructure, intimate apparel & swimwear, intolerance & hate, job search & career development, kid's sites, motor vehicles, news, peer-to-peer, personals and dating, philanthropic & professional organizations, phishing & fraud, photo searches, politics, proxies & translators, real estate, reference, religion, ringtones\/mobile phone downloads, search engines, sex education, shopping, society & culture, spam URLs, sports, spyware, streaming media, tasteless & offensive, travel, violence, weapons, web-based e-mail, custom (user defined), uncategorized, and the like. For instance, security categories may include potentially unwanted application (PUA)\/adware, other\/mistyped, PUA\/system monitor, other\/potentially exploited, PUA\/remote, admin tool, pornography\/porn, PUA\/hacking tool, PUA\/other, entertainment\/banking, entertainment\/games, entertainment\/other, communication\/cell phones, entertainment\/shopping, PUA\/dialer, entertainment\/sports, entertainment\/youth, spam\/Chinese, media\/ads, spam\/drugs, media\/news, spam\/mortgage, media\/TV, spam\/other, search\/job search, spam\/product, spam\/Russian, spam\/stock, spam\/survey, illegal\/child abuse, illegal\/child pornography, illegal\/cracked or pirated software, malware\/rat repository, illegal\/criminal activities, malware\/reference, and the like.","A variety of proxy servers are described herein and still others will be appreciated. In practice, proxy servers may act as anonymizers, may insert advertising into network content, may act as a man in the middle that captures sensitive information such as user names and passwords, and so on. Generally, security applications may detect proxy servers, may monitor or block communications involving proxy servers, and so on. This is described in greater detail hereinafter and elsewhere.","In embodiments, proxy servers C may be provided by profit-seeking entities (\u201cproxy providers\u201d) that generate advertising revenue by inserting advertising into network content. For example and without limitation, a user may request a web page from a proxy server by submitting an alternate URL to the proxy server. The proxy server may receive the alternate URL, convert it to a primary URL, and then request the web page from a web server by submitting the primary URL to the web server. In response to the request, the web server may return the web page to the proxy server C. The proxy server C may then insert one or more advertisements into the web page before returning the web page to the user. When the user views or interacts with at least one of the advertisements, advertising revenue (typically from an advertising network such as Google AdSense, AdBrite, or the like) may be credited to an owner or operator of the proxy server.","In embodiments, the crediting of advertising revenue depends upon a unique account identifier that is embedded within the web page. This identifier may be communicated to the advertising network when the user views or interacts with an advertisement. Having received this identifier, the advertising network may credit advertising revenue to the entity that delivered the advertisement to the user.","In practice, the advertising network may require that the unique account identifier within the web page be encoded in the clear, without deliberate obfuscation or encryption. Moreover, the advertising network may require that only one account identifier be associated with each profit-seeking entity.","Policies, such as and without limitation those policies described hereinabove and elsewhere, may dictate that any and all communications with proxy servers C should be blocked.","Security facilities  or the like may eavesdrop on communications of computing facilities within an enterprise . Upon recognizing an outbound communication to a proxy server C, these security facilities  may block the outbound communication in accordance with a policy. In some embodiments, recognizing the outbound communication may include extracting a unique account identifier from the communication and matching that identifier to a database of identifiers that are known to be associated with proxy providers.","In some embodiments, the threat management facility  may include a database that contains associations between account identifiers and proxy providers. From time to time, these associations may be communicated to any and all of the security facilities . In some embodiments, any of the security facilities  may maintain a local cache or the like of at least some of the associations. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments any of the security facilities  may submit a unique account identifier in a query to the threat management facility , which provides an affirmative or negative response depending upon whether or not the unique account identifier is known by the threat management facility  to be associated with a proxy provider.","In some embodiments, the database containing associations between account identifiers and proxy providers may be updated via manual entries, automated proactive web scanning systems, and so on. It will be understood that a variety of such web scanning systems are possible, and all such systems are within the scope of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","152","152"]},"As shown by block , the security facility  may check to see if the account identifier exists in a database of account identifiers. As discussed hereinabove, in embodiments the database may exist within the security facility , within the management facility , partially within the security facility  and partially within the management facility , and so on. Also as discussed hereinabove, checking to see if the account identifier exists in the database may involve direct database access via a database query, indirect database access via a query to a remote system that itself queries the database, and so on. It will be understood that a variety of such embodiments are possible.","If the account identifier is in the database, the method  proceeds to block . Here, the security facility  blocks access to the network content. It will be understood that a variety of techniques may be employed to block the network content. These techniques may include, without limitation, simply not allowing the network content to transit the security facility , disabling or reconfiguring an application, disabling or reconfiguring a logical or physical network port, transmitting an appropriate message, and so on.","However, if the account identifier is not in the database, the method  proceeds to block . Here, the URL may be transmitted to a laboratory for analysis. In embodiments, the laboratory may include the threat management facility  or any other facility adapted to receive URLs for analysis.","Analysis of the URL may be conducted as shown by block . The analysis may be directed at determining whether the URL refers to a proxy server C. In some embodiments, the analysis may include accessing the network content at the URL, extracting an account identifier from the network content, and looking up the account identifier in a database of account identifiers that are known or suspected to be associated with proxy providers. In some embodiments, the analysis may include looking up the URL in a database of known or suspected proxy servers. In some embodiments, the analysis may include inspecting page structure and content of the network content. Generally, it will be understood that a variety of analytical systems and methods may be applied to determine whether the URL refers to a proxy server C.","If the laboratory's analysis of the URL indicates that the URL refers to a proxy server C, the process  may continue to block . Here, an account identifier from within the network content is added to a database of account identifiers of known or suspected proxy providers. Alternatively, the URL may be flagged and stored in a database for further review.","If the laboratory's analysis does not indicate an association between the URL and a proxy server then the process  may continue to block  where the URL is ignored.","Although the above examples and descriptions of the method  relate to proxy servers, the method  is not limited to applications involving proxy servers. For example and without limitation, an owner\/operator of websites may run a number of adult-oriented websites at some number of domains. Once the owner\/operator's account identifier becomes known, any domains or URLs found to contain that account identifier could be grouped together by owner\/operator. Since in this example the owner\/operator is known to be associated with adult-oriented websites, such domains or URLs may also be categorized (if even provisionally so) as being adult-oriented. This categorization may be stored in a database or the like, and may be used in the enforcement of policies directed at adult-oriented websites. Thus, generally, the method  may be employed to group domains or URLs together by account identifier, to associate owner\/operators with domains or URLs, to categorize domains or URLs, and so on.","Continuing on, embodiments of the present invention may identify proxy servers by recognizing a mismatch between a first URL of network content and an expected URL of the network content. Having so identified a proxy server, policies that relate to proxy server usage may be employed with respect to the first URL and the network content from it. In some embodiments, these policies may be directed at blocking requests for the network content at the first URL.","For example and without limitation, network content from Facebook may have an expected URL that includes the domain facebook.com. When network content from Facebook appears at a first URL that does not contain the domain facebook.com, embodiments may identify or suspect the first URL to be that of a proxy server. Thenceforth, a security facility  or the like that enforces the policy may recognize and block requests for network content at the first URL. A variety of other such examples will be appreciated, including without limitation examples relating to social networking sites, gaming\/downloading sites, inappropriate\/adult content sites, banking sites, and so on.","In order to recognize the mismatch, a variety of techniques may be employed to detect that the network content from the first URL in fact originates from another URL (i.e., the expected URL). For example, in practice websites typically contain a number of pages sharing a substantially consistent look and feel. This consistency may be preserved as a page is processed and forwarded by a proxy server. When this is the case, the look and feel may be reflected in common characteristics observable by a scanning mechanism at a security facility . In embodiments the common characteristics may be associated with the expected URL and may include text such as page titles, copyright messages, and the like; specific HTML structuring and layout; comments within HTML; common attributes, class names, script components, and so on; specific image files used as page decoration, particularly and without limitation so-called \u201cfavicons\u201d\u2014small graphical icons used within browsers that are closely tied to a particular website, organization, or brand; links that may not have been translated by the proxy server; style elements, style sheets, or the like; client-side executable content such as and without limitation JavaScript; elements within HTTP headers returned by a server from which the proxy server received the network content; and so on.","In some embodiments, a virus detection application may determine that network content from one URL in fact originates from another URL. Generally, the virus detection application may process network content in search of data that matches genes or identities of viruses. However, in such embodiments, genes or identities that match observed characteristics of known websites may be created and processed by the virus detection application as well. Matches according to these genes or identities may indicate that network content originates from a known website. Generally, this may be referred to herein and elsewhere as gene-based detection.","Yet another technique may be employed to identify URLs that are associated with proxy servers. This technique may involve crawling a large number of popular websites to produce a database of fingerprints for each of the websites. Such crawling may occur from time to time. In some embodiments, the fingerprints may include a checksum, a \u201cfuzzy\u201d or approximate fingerprint, and so on. In any case, the fingerprints, checksums, or the like may be stored in a database, which may be published from time to time. For example and without limitation, the threat management facility  may contain the database and may publish it to one or more of the security facilities . In some embodiments, the database may be published to subscribers that have paid for (or otherwise have provided consideration for) the database. In any case, this technique may be referred to herein and elsewhere as fuzzy fingerprinting.","Throughout this disclosure and elsewhere, a checksum may be calculated in a variety of ways, using any and all techniques for calculating a checksum applied to any and all portions of a website.","In some embodiments, web pages may be decomposed into page-level \u201cobjects\u201d by parsing HTML\/XML\/script content of the web pages. Each object and its relationship to the overall page may have a structural uniqueness. For example, it should be appreciated that a page's structure may be represented as a tree of page-level objects. Each object in the tree has a unique position within it, and this may relate to the structural uniqueness. For another example, it should be appreciated that, when displayed or rendered into a frame buffer, each (X,Y)-pixel in the page may be set according to one or more objects that are layered according to a Z-component or the like. In any case, based upon the structural uniqueness, any and all of the objects (or aspects thereof) may be identified. Once identified, a checksum of the objects may be calculated.","In some embodiments, certain response headers such as cookie headers or the like may be extracted. Once extracted, a checksum of these headers could be calculated.","In some embodiments, specific keywords or phrases could be matched using a fuzzy or simple substring matching on the entire web page. A checksum could then be calculated on these matched keywords or phrases.","It will be understood that a variety of embodiments for calculating a checksum of a website are possible.","In some embodiments, communications with an uncategorized website may be monitored for the presence of the fingerprints. When a detection threshold is exceeded, the website may be suspected of being an unauthorized republication of a genuine website. In practice, such republication of a website may be provided by a proxy server, a malicious website, or the like. For example and without limitation, an uncategorized website may provide numerous instances of network content that match fingerprints that are in the fingerprint database and that are known from web crawling to be associated with facebook.com. As a result, the uncategorized website may be re-categorized as suspicious, as a web proxy, or the like. Similarly, if the network content is in the fingerprint database and known to be associated with a bank, the uncategorized website may be categorized as a source of potential phishing attacks. A variety of other such examples will be appreciated.","When an unauthorized republication of a website is detected, all of the URLs associated with that website may be examined for a longest common prefix. For example and without limitation, the unauthorized republication may be associated with three URLs: http:\/\/www.example.com\/foo\/bar; http:\/\/www.example.com\/foo\/foo; and http:\/\/www.example.com\/foo\/baz. In this example, the longest common prefix is http:\/\/www.example.com\/foo. In embodiments, the longest common prefix may be stored in a database and communicated to security facilities . In some embodiments, any and all URLs beginning with the longest common prefix may be deemed URLs of unauthorized reproductions of network content.","When an unauthorized reproduction of a website is suspected, a confidence level may be assigned to that suspicion. In embodiments, the confidence level may be stored in a database, communicated to security facilities, and so on.","Depending upon the confidence level, a variety of actions may be taken when URLs associated with the reproduction are accessed. Such actions may without limitation include blocking a request to the network resource at the URL, blocking a response from the network resource at the URL, logging such requests or responses, and so on.","When the confidence level rises to a sufficient level, the URLs may be added to a list of detected proxy sites. A user may review this list for false positives, and provide an indication of the false positives. In some embodiments, this review may take place via a web browser with checkbox or other input elements for receiving the input. A variety of such embodiments will be understood.","In some embodiments, an indication of the detection of an unauthorized reproduction and the confidence level may be communicated to the threat management facility  for further analysis or distribution to security facilities .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","308","300","310","300","314"]},"At block , a test determines whether the network content's URL is valid. If it is, the source of the network content is not a proxy and the method  ends at block . However, if the network content's URL is invalid (e.g., when the network content is known to originate from another URL) then the URL may be added to a list of possible proxies, as shown by block . From there, a test determines whether the URL is already flagged as a potential proxy (block ).

In embodiments, the database may contain keywords that are provided by a manufacturer or provider of the threat management facility  or security facility . In some embodiments, the database may contain user-provided keywords.","In embodiments, searches may be submitted to search engines via a URL that contains the search phrase. Major search engines use established domain names in their URLs (e.g., google.com yahoo.com, et cetera) and such URLs may be singled out for processing. The processing may examine these URLs for disallowed keywords.","For example and without limitation, the following URL may be singled out on the basis of the domain name (google.com); subsequent processing of the URL may reveal the keyword \u201cproxy\u201d:","http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?h1=en&q=proxy&btnG=Google+Search&meta=","A variety of techniques for processing such URLs will be appreciated. All such techniques are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","In some embodiments, the database may include regular expressions that match disallowed search keywords or disallowed search URLs.
