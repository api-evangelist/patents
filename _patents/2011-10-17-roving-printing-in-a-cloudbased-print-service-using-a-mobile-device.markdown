{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This description relates to roving printing.","Users of computing devices and associated applications often desire to print specific documents or other application content. In an example user experience, an owner of a computer running a particular operating system purchases a printer, and then installs a version of a printer driver associated with the user's operating system onto the computer. In other example scenarios, a printer (i.e., associated printer driver) may be installed in the context of a network. In the latter scenario(s), it is possible to share the installed printer among multiple network users. For example, a local computer executing an application, operating system, and printer driver, may print from the application to a remote printer, using an intermediary print server. Somewhat similarly, an application may execute on a remote device, and the operating system and printer driver may be installed on the remote device, as well. Then, a user may experience or use the remotely-executing application at a local computer (e.g., in a remote desktop or other virtual computing environment), and may print to a local or remote printer which receives commands from the remotely-installed printer driver.","In many cases, a user may not be co-located with a desired printer at a time of identifying a document to be printed. For example, in the network printing example(s) above, a user at a network workstation may wish to print to a printer which is located on a different floor, or in a different building. In these and other scenarios, it may occur that a user wishes to initiate the actual printing of the document while the user is present at the identified printer. For example, the user may wish to maintain a confidentiality of the printed document, and may therefore wish to initiate the printing while present at the printer, so as to avoid an availability of the printed document at the printer while the user is in transit from the workstation to the printer (during which time unauthorized users may inadvertently or illicitly view or obtain the printed document).","Thus, for these and other reasons, printing techniques have been developed which enable a user to designate printing of a document at a first time (e.g., when the user is present at the workstation), without initiating actual printing of the document until a second, later time (e.g., when the user is present at the relevant printer). More specifically, for example, the user may send a print job for a given document to be temporarily stored remotely (e.g., at a network print server). Then, once the user has travelled from the workstation to the relevant printer, the user may interact with the relevant printer to initiate the printing of the document at the relevant printer. For example, the user may utilize input\/output hardware and\/or software at the relevant printer to fetch and otherwise initiate and execute the print job. In this way, the user may be assured of being present at the printer at the time of printing of the document. In particular, with respect to a need for maintaining a confidentiality of the document to be printed, the hardware\/software of the printer may include authentication functionalities for authenticating the user before initiating the printing of the document, so as to thereby further protect the confidentiality of content of the printed document.","Notwithstanding the features and associated advantages of the above (and related\/similar) printing techniques, users may further benefit from additional or alternative techniques for enabling enhanced flexibility, convenience, and confidentiality in printing scenarios in which a relevant printer is not co-located with a user\/device which originates a given print job.","According to one general aspect, a print server may include instructions stored on a computer-readable medium and executable by at least one processor. The print server may include an application manager configured to cause the at least one processor to receive, from an application utilized at a device at a first location, a print job, the print job identifying a virtual print queue and application content to be printed, the application manager being further configured to store the print job in association with the virtual print queue. The print server may include a print job router configured to cause the at least one processor to receive, after the storing, a print initiation identifying a printer at a second location, the print initiation identifying the print job, including print properties thereof, and originating from the second location. The print server may include a format converter configured to cause the at least one processor to generate, from the application content and using the print properties, a printable file in a format printable by the identified printer, for sending to the identified printer by the print job router.","According to another general aspect, a method may include receiving, from an application utilized at a device at a first location, a print job, the print job identifying a virtual print queue and application content to be printed. The method may include storing the print job in association with the virtual print queue, and receiving, after the storing, a print initiation identifying a printer at a second location, the print initiation identifying the print job, including print properties thereof, and originating from the second location. The method may further include generating, from the application content and using the print properties, a printable file in a format printable by the identified printer, for sending to the identified printer by the print job router.","According to another general aspect, a computer program product may be tangibly embodied on a computer-readable storage medium. The computer program product may include executable code that, when executed, is configured to cause a data processing apparatus to receive, from an application utilized at a device at a first location, a print job, the print job identifying a virtual print queue and application content to be printed, and store the print job in association with the virtual print queue. The executable code, when executed, may be configured to cause the data processing apparatus to receive, after the storing, a print initiation identifying a printer at a second location, the print initiation identifying the print job, including print properties thereof, and originating from the second location, and generate, from the application content and using the print properties, a printable file in a format printable by the identified printer, for sending to the identified printer by the print job router.","According to another general aspect, a print server may include instructions stored on a computer-readable medium and executable by at least one processor. The print server may include an application manager configured to cause the at least one processor to receive, from an application utilized at a device at a first location, a print job, the print job identifying a virtual print queue and application content to be printed, the application manager being further configured to store the print job in association with the virtual print queue. The print server may include a print job router configured to cause the at least one processor to receive, after the storing and from a mobile device at a second location, a print initiation identifying a printer at the second location and the print job, the print job router being further configured to send the application content to the identified printer, based on the print initiation.","According to another general aspect, a method may include receiving, from an application utilized at a device at a first location, a print job, the print job identifying a virtual print queue and application content to be printed. The method may include storing the print job in association with the virtual print queue, and receiving, after the storing and from a mobile device at a second location, a print initiation identifying a printer at the second location and the print job. The method may include sending the application content to the identified printer, based on the print initiation.","According to another general aspect, a computer program product may be tangibly embodied on a computer-readable storage medium. The computer program product may include executable code that, when executed, is configured to cause a data processing apparatus to receive, from an application utilized at a device at a first location, a print job, the print job identifying a virtual print queue and application content to be printed, and store the print job in association with the virtual print queue. The executable code, when executed, may be configured to cause the data processing apparatus to receive, after the storing and from a mobile device at a second location, a print initiation identifying a printer at the second location and the print job, and send the application content to the identified printer, based on the print initiation.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","102","104","106","102","102","102"]},"In , a device  is illustrated as an example of virtually any computing device from which a user may wish to identify, designate, or submit a print job. By way of non-limiting example, then, the device  may include a laptop or desktop computer, a netbook, a tablet computer, a smartphone, a camera, or any device which may store or have access to data which the user may desire to print.","In the example of , an operating system  is illustrated as executing an application . Again, these elements are included by way of illustration and example, and may include virtually any operating system or other platform on which virtually any application may run. For example, the operating system  may include operating systems such as the Windows operating system, Mac OS, or Linux, and may include mobile platforms such as Android, Symbian, or iPhone OS, to name a few examples. In other examples, the operating system  may include a browser-based operating system, such as the Chrome OS.","Consequently, the application  may include virtually any application which may run on any underlying operating system or platform. Examples of such applications are well-known and too numerous to mention in any detail, but generally include document processing applications, email applications, image editing or presentation software, a web browser, or virtually any application which provides the user with a rendering of data which the user may wish to print, or combinations thereof.","In particular, as referenced above, the application  may represent a web application which executes on a remote application server  as application . That is, the application  may include any application functionality which is accessed by the user over the network  and experienced locally as the application , e.g., using a browser running at the device . As is known, such web applications allow an owner or other provider of the application server  to assume responsibility for installing, configuring, executing, and maintaining the application  at the application server , so that the user of the device  may obtain the benefit of the application  without many or any of the associated costs and responsibilities. Techniques for executing such a web application, and related technology, are well known in the art and are therefore not described further in detail herein, except as may be helpful or necessary to understand operations of the system  of .","The network  may thus represent, for example, the public Internet or other wide area public or private network. The network  may represent, in further examples, a corporate or other intranet, and\/or a smaller-scale, local or personal network, any of which (and\/or combinations thereof) may be implemented using standard network technology.","Further in , a cloud-aware printer  is illustrated which is configured to communicate with the cloud print service  over the network . In this regard, the term \u201ccloud\u201d or \u201ccloud-aware\u201d references the use of \u201ccloud computing,\u201d which, generally speaking, includes a style of computing in which computing resources such as application programs and file storage are remotely provided over a network such as the Internet, typically through a web browser. For example, many web browsers are capable of running applications, which can themselves be application programming interfaces (\u201cAPI's\u201d) to more sophisticated applications running on remote servers. In the cloud computing paradigm, a web browser interfaces with and controls an application program that is running on a remote server. Through the browser, the user can create, edit, save and delete files on the remote server via the remote application program. Thus, it may be observed that the application server  and associated application  may also represent examples of cloud computing.","In the context of the cloud-aware printer , the cloud print service  enables the application  to print directly to the cloud-aware printer , without a requirement or need for (e.g., independently of), involvement of the operating system . In other words, the application  may communicate directly with the cloud print service  to thereby print to the cloud-aware printer , without e.g., requiring a local driver within the operating system . As a result, virtually any application  that may be configured to communicate with the cloud print service  may make use of the cloud-aware printer , as described in detail, below.","For example, the cloud print service  may be configured to register the user and\/or the device , as well as the cloud-aware printer . In a specific example, the device may be a smartphone, and the user may use the application  to purchase a ticket (e.g., a movie ticket, or an airline ticket). Then, the user may print the purchased ticket directly to the cloud-aware printer , even though the device  and\/or the operating system  may not have the resources, or otherwise be configured, to support native printing in a conventional sense (e.g., may not currently be executing a print driver of any sort associated with the cloud-aware printer ). In this way, the user of the application  may be provided with a print option and associated abilities that are not currently provided in conventional printing paradigms and techniques. Many other such examples are described herein, or would be apparent.","The cloud-aware printer  may be contrasted with a legacy printer, not specifically illustrated in , which does not natively support communication with the cloud print service . When using such a legacy printer, a separate device and\/or software may be utilized to impart the advantages of the cloud print service  to the legacy printer. It will be appreciated that all of the various features and functions of the cloud-aware printer  may be obtained through the use of a legacy printer supplemented with appropriate hardware\/software support.","In short, the system  provides an ability for virtually any application running on any device within the network  (e.g., the applications ,  and device ) to communicate with the cloud print service  to thereby print to any printer which is also in (direct or indirect) communication with the cloud print service . Consequently, users may benefit from increased printing options and abilities, and experience an overall decrease in the costs and efforts associated with doing so. Meanwhile, printer manufacturers may experience a decreased or eliminated need to provide users with the (updated) driver(s) and other prerequisites for users to fully experience the benefits of their products. This may result in, for example, higher customer satisfaction, and a decreased cost of producing and maintaining printers.","In particular, as referenced above, the system  may provide a number of enhanced features and functions related to roving printing. For example, in the example of , the application  may provide a print dialog  in conjunction with the cloud print service . For example, as shown, the device  may be located at a first location , while the cloud-aware printer  may be located at a different, second location . Thus, a user  utilizing the device  at the first location  may select application content associated with the application  (and\/or application ) for printing, and may submit (an identification of) the application content to the cloud print service , along with a specific or generic reference to, or identification of, the cloud-aware printer .","At a subsequent time, the user  may have traveled from the first location  to the second location . At that time, the user  may request or otherwise initiate an actual printing of the previously-identified application content at the cloud-aware printer . In other words, as described in detail in various example implementations below, the user  may directly or indirectly cause the cloud-aware printer  to fetch or otherwise receive the application content to be printed, so as to thereby obtain the printed content from the cloud-aware printer .","In this way, the user  may obtain confidential, secure printing, in a manner which is convenient and flexible. For example, in a first example, the user  may be present at the first location , and may be aware of, and may wish to print application content using, the cloud-aware printer  at the second location . For example, the user  may be a student, employee, or other user of a plurality of printers designated for use by a corresponding group of users of which the user  is a member. For example, the user  may represent an employee in an office who wishes to print to the cloud-aware printer , which may be located on a different floor or in a different building. In other examples, the user  may represent a student in a dorm room who wishes to print to the cloud-aware printer  which is located at a student center.","In the above and similar examples, the user  may have specific knowledge of an identity or location of the cloud-aware printer . However, in many other examples, it may occur that the user  has no specific knowledge of an identity or location of the cloud-aware printer  that will ultimately be used to print specified application content. For example, in the above examples, the user  may represent an employee or student who submits an identification of application content to be printed, without knowing at that time exactly where or when the user  will be when initiating the actual printing of the identified application content. For example, the user  may be traveling in a different city, and may not even be aware of a location or existence of the cloud-aware printer  that will ultimately be utilized in printing the identified application content. In such scenarios, as described in detail herein, the user  may submit the identification of the application content to be printed in a manner which is generic to available printers associated with the cloud print service  and with the user  (including the cloud-aware printer  in this context), and may nonetheless thereafter identify and utilize the cloud-aware printer  while present at the second location .","More specifically, as referenced above and as shown in , the application  may provide, in conjunction with the cloud print service , a print dialog  which enables the user  to provide a print submission identifying application content to be printed. In this regard, the print dialog  may be understood to include various conventional features associated with conventional print dialogs, which are therefore not included or described in specific detail herein.","As shown in , the print dialog  may include a printer selection drop-down list A which the user  may utilize to provide a submission of a print job to the cloud print service . Specifically, the printer selection drop-down list A may enable the user  to identify the cloud-aware printer  specifically, or, in other example implementations, may enable the user  to generically identify a printer associated with the user  and with the cloud print service  (at a present or future time), so that the user  may specifically identify the generically identified printer, at the time that the user  is present at the second location . In the latter examples, for example, the printer selection list A may identify a number of specific printers, as well as a virtual printer or virtual print queue which, as just described, generically represents a currently-unidentified printer to be identified at the later time at which the user  is present at the second location and wishes to initiate actual printing of the print job.","In an example of advantageous features provided by the system , the user  may thus experience an enhanced confidentiality or security of content that is printed using the cloud-aware printer . For example, in the implementations described herein, relevant documents are only printed by the cloud-aware printer  while the user  is present at the second location , and are not printed prior to an arrival of the user  at the second location . In this way, the printed documents are not left unattended, such as may occur in conventional remote printing scenarios in which printed documents are unattended while the user  is in transit from the first location  to the second location . As a result, the user  need not be concerned that unauthorized users may unintentionally or illicitly obtain possession of the documents to be printed.","Additionally, to further enhance these and related aspects which are associated with a confidentiality or security of the printed document, additional authentication of the user  may be required before printing of the documents may be allowed to commence. In this way, the user  (or other authorized users) may be further assured of being the only user(s) able to retrieve the printed documents in question.","For example, as described in more detail herein, the user  may utilize the cloud-aware printer  to provide identifying or other authenticating information, which may then be verified by the printer  and\/or the cloud print service  (e.g., using authentication manager ), so that printing of the requested documents may commence. For example, such authentication may include submission of a password or pin by the user , the swiping of an ID card using a card reader, the reading of a badge of a user , or many other identification\/authentication techniques, some of which are described or referenced in more detail, below.","In the example of , as also described in more detail herein, the print dialog  may include an authentication drop-down list B, which may enable the user  to specify an existence, type, or characteristic of authentication techniques to be used. For example, the authentication drop-down list B may enable the user  to select one or more of the just-described authentication techniques, or other authentication techniques. In other examples, the authentication drop-down list B may enable the user  to characterize or parameterize such authentication techniques. For example, the user  may be enabled to provide a particular password or pin which may later be required at the second location  in order to initiate printing.","In particular examples described in detail herein, e.g., with respect to  and , the user  may utilize a mobile device  at the second location  in order to initiate and execute the printing of identified documents by the cloud-aware printer . For example, as described, the user  may utilize the device  at the first location  to provide a submission of a print job identifying application content to be printed. The print job (e.g., the actual application content to be printed and\/or a reference or other identifier to the application content) may be stored using the cloud print service , so that, at a later time, the user  may arrive at the second location  while carrying the mobile device . Then, the user  may utilize the mobile device , e.g., to identify the cloud-aware printer , and\/or to otherwise communicate with the cloud print service  so as to provide the application content to be printed to the cloud-aware printer .","For example, the mobile device  may include or represent virtually any device which may be carried by the user  while in transit, including, e.g., a cell phone, Smartphone, tablet computer, netbook, notebook, or any such device. Thus, the mobile device  may include a wide range of possible feature sets, ranging from basic network connectivity all the way to providing full support for applications , , and browser-based support for communicating with the cloud print service  and\/or the cloud-aware printer . In particular, it may be appreciated that, in various examples, the mobile device  may be the same device  used by the user at the first location , or it may be an entirely different device.","Of course, the mobile device  is a non-limiting example of devices which may be used by the user  in the system . For example, the user  may utilize a kiosk or other computing device in a vicinity of the cloud-aware printer  in order to authenticate with the cloud print service  and, as described herein, release and execute one or more desired print jobs.","In the example of , it may be appreciated that use of the mobile device  in the context of the system  may provide the user with a high degree of convenience and flexibility in utilizing and implementing the roving printing scenarios described herein. For example, it may be appreciated that the mobile device  may typically be familiar to the user , so that the user  experiences a uniform interface with the cloud print service  and\/or the cloud-aware printer , even though the user may utilize a large number of varying types of printers represented by the cloud-aware printer  in the example of .","Further, it may be appreciated that, in such scenarios, since all the required functionality for interacting with the cloud print service  and\/or the cloud-aware printer  may be implemented using the mobile device , a minimal or substantially reduced feature set may be required at the cloud-aware printer  itself. That is, for example, the cloud-aware printer  may be manufactured with a minimal hardware\/software set required for communicating with the cloud print service . In particular, as described in detail herein, use of the mobile device  may reduce or eliminate a need of the cloud-aware printer  to maintain data associated with authenticating the user  in the various authentication scenarios described herein. As a result, manufacturers of the cloud-aware printer  may be enabled to provide low cost printers which are nevertheless fully compatible with the roving printer scenarios described herein.","As shown in , the cloud print service  may include a number of example components or modules which may be utilized to implement functionalities of the cloud print service , and, in particular, may be utilized to implement the various roving printing scenarios described herein. For example, the cloud print service  may include a registration manager , which may be configured to register printers and users. Thus, it may be appreciated that, through the use of the registration manager , the user  may register with the cloud print service , and may thereafter interact with the registration manager  to login to and utilize the cloud print service . For example, the registration manager  may store a username and password of the user , which the user  may provide, e.g., in conjunction with the original print job submission identifying application content to be printed (i.e., using the device ). Similarly, the user  may, in the example scenarios, use the same username\/password to authenticate to the cloud print service  while present at the second location in attempting to initiate actual printing of the application content. In particular, as shown and described, the user  may utilize the mobile device  to provide the relevant username\/password to the registration manager  for authentication of the user at the client print service .","Somewhat similarly, the cloud-aware printer , as well as various other printers (not specifically illustrated in the example of ), may be registered with the registration manager . In the described examples, it may be appreciated that a particular subset of such printers, including the cloud-aware printer , may be associated with the user . That is, the registration manager  may register a plurality of users and a plurality of printers, and may associate various subsets of users with various subsets of printers, depending on associated authorizations or permissions of the users\/printers. For example, a given user may register a number of printers with a user account of the user. In other examples, a network administrator may associate a plurality of printers with a given user. In still other examples, the registration manager  may enable sharing of printers between users, so that, for example, a first user registered in association with the cloud-aware printer  may share the cloud-aware printer  with the user .","In some examples, users already may have a user account with a separate and possibly related service or service provider. For example, various online services (e.g., other cloud-based computing resources) may provide functionalities such as email, data storage, and document processing, and, in such cases, the user may already have a secure user account established in connection therewith. In such cases, the cloud print service  may leverage or access such existing user accounts, e.g., to avoid a need to create a new user account, and to facilitate access of existing users of other services with the cloud print service , such as, e.g., for implementation of the printer-sharing techniques just described.","Thus, it may be appreciated that although the registration manager  is illustrated as being included within the cloud print service , it also may occur that some or all functionality related to the registration manager  may exist externally to the cloud print service . For example, the application server  may provide an email application as the application , and a user of the device  may be registered with this email application (service). In such a case, the application server  may have the responsibility of maintaining the user's account, and the cloud print service  may simply interface with the application server  and provide access to the user  once the user  is logged on into the application .","Further in , an application manager  may be configured to communicate with any application which may be desired to be used for printing within the system , including, e.g., the application , and the application . Thus, for example, the application manager  may implement various application programming interfaces (APIs) which enable such communication with external applications.","For example, the application manager  may include a print dialog API , which may be configured to render the print dialog . That is, as referenced above, the print dialog API  may render the print dialog  as including, e.g., the printer list A, the authentication list B, as well as associated printer capabilities, and other relevant information. The print dialog API  may render the print dialog , e.g., using Java script. It may be appreciated that the print dialog API  may thus provide or render the print dialog , and may thereby provide a common print dialog experience across all applications (e.g., applications , ) interfacing with the cloud print service .","In additional or alternative example implementations, the print dialog API  also may provide sufficient information for an application developer to construct a third party print dialog, which may be different in appearance than the print dialog , e.g., may have a proprietary appearance associated with a suite of applications provided by the developer\/provider thereof. In this way, the user  may provide desired printer selections and associated desired print characteristics, as well as identification of the actual content to be printed. As may be appreciated, such print data may be expressed in any conventional format, e.g., HTML, PDF, XPS, or an image format such as JPEG, to name a few.","A job submit API  may be utilized to receive the identification of application content submitted by the user  by way of the print dialog . For example, in some implementations, the user  may submit identification of the application content of the application  which is executed and stored locally using the device . In such cases, a format and associated print characteristics of the application content may be identified or otherwise specified at the time of submission thereof, and related values may be stored as such using the cloud print service , for later printing by the cloud-aware printer .","To give a specific example, the application  may include a spreadsheet application  executing on the device . In such an example, the user  may print a particular sheet of the spreadsheet application , and associated values for related print characteristics may be defined for storage thereof until the later time at which the user  arrives at the second location  and initiates the associated printing. For example, a formatting of number of columns and rows of the spreadsheet to be printed may be designated for an associated paper size, and may be stored in a manner just described. Of course, it may be appreciated that similar comments may apply to virtually any type of application content to be printed, e.g., word processing documents, webpages, images, or other application content. Such scenarios are referred to herein as \u201cprint-by-value\u201dprint scenarios, in which, as just described, values for associated print characteristics or properties are defined and stored at a time of submission thereof by the user  at the device  at the first location , as received by the job submit API .","In contrast, in other example scenarios, the print data received by way of print job submission by the user  may be represented or otherwise included by reference to remote print data, e.g., by identification of an appropriate uniform resource location (URL). For example, as described herein, the user  may wish to print application content associated with the web application  running on the application server . By way of comparison to the previous example, the application  also may represent a spreadsheet application. In these examples, however, it may occur that the submission of the application content and associated print characteristics\/properties need not be finalized at the time of submission. Rather, the job submit API  may simply receive and store a reference to the application content of the application  that is to be printed, without necessarily receiving or storing definite values for some or all of the related print characteristics. In such examples, at the later time at which the user  arrives at the second location  and initiates the actual printing of the spreadsheet of the application , an application data fetcher  may be configured to utilize the reference to the application  which was previously stored by the job submit API, to thereby obtain the relevant application content. Thus, such scenarios are referred to herein as \u201cprint-by-reference\u201d print scenarios.","Whether executing a print-by-value or print-by-reference scenario, the job submit API  may be configured to submit a corresponding print job, including application content to be printed and associated print characteristics, to a format converter , which may be configured to execute a conversion of the print job into a format which is consistent and compatible with the cloud-aware printer . For example, the job submit API  may receive a print job, and, to give a specific and non-limiting set of examples, a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) multi-part request which may include the printer capabilities expressed, e.g., in XPS, as well as a MIME type identifying the content type.","Thus, the application manager  may generally implement the functions of receiving a print request, and then receiving an associated print job, from, e.g., the application , . In general, the first function of a receiving a print request may include providing the user  with the print dialog  or other user interface with which the user  may select an available\/associated registered printer, and\/or as described herein, with which the user  may select a generic or currently unidentified printer. Receiving the print job may include receiving print data to be printed, possibly along with print characteristics characterizing preferences and other aspects of how their print data is desired to be printed (e.g., color versus black and white, paper size orientation, number of copies, or any other relevant or desired print characteristic). The application manager  may conduct other communications with the application , , as well, such as, e.g., providing a status of the printer of a print job during the print job.","Thus, it may be appreciated that the application manager  may communicate with the application ,  (or other application) in a format that is independent of a specific printer, e.g., that is generic with respect to all available or relevant printers within the system . In this way, the application ,  may be relieved of some or all of the burdens associated with needing knowledge of the destination printer when formulating and\/or sending a print job.","For example, when sending the print job, the application  may formulate both the print data and print characteristics in the same manner, regardless of whether the print job is destined for a particular identified printer, or is merely identified or associated with a generic, as yet undetermined, printer. In fact, even if the user  does not currently have any registered printer associated with his or her user account, the print job still may be forwarded to the cloud print service  for storage, and for later printing to the cloud-aware printer  or other printer that ultimately may be registered to the cloud print service  in conjunction with the account of the user , and at a time of arrival of the user  at such a printer at the second location .","Thus, it may be appreciated that the various APIs (e.g., , ) utilized by the application manager  and\/or the applications ,  may represent lightweight, consistent, customizable, and easily implementable APIs which may be utilized in conjunction with a large number of various types of applications. Moreover, such APIs may rarely, if ever, need to be updated or maintained by the user  in order for the user  to utilize the cloud print service  in conjunction with a particular application. Instead, such updates may be managed by an administrator or other provider of a cloud print service  and\/or by a provider of the application , so that the user  is unburdened of associated efforts and responsibilities.","Even as new printers are introduced into the marketplace over time, the user  may have the experience that the application  is able to utilize the new printers simply by way of registration of the new printers with the cloud print service . In particular, in the roving printing described herein, it may occur that the user  submits a print job at a first time and at the first location, at which time the cloud-aware printer  may not be registered in conjunction with the account of the user  at the registration manager , and\/or at which time the cloud-aware printer  may not even have been manufactured or produced. Nonetheless, in example scenarios, at the second time at which the user arrives at the second location , it may be appreciated that as long as the cloud-aware printer  has been installed and associated with the account of the user  at that time, the user  may initiate the printing of the print job at that time.","As referenced above, such print jobs received at the application manager  in the printer-independent or generic format, which may be specifically or generically identified with one or more printers, may be passed to the format converter , which may be configured to receive the print job and facilitate or execute conversion of the print job into a format associated with the designated (type of) printer for the print job in question. Such conversion may thus generally include, as needed, conversion of the print data itself, as well as conversion of the print characteristics specified in conjunction with the given print job.","In more detail, as is known, printers generally require low-level, device or type-specific instructions which provide a base by which printers actually apply ink to paper to achieve a desired appearance. Such instructions may therefore include very specific portrayals of the desired print outcome using, e.g., a page description language (PDL). For example, the language postscript may be used to describe a desired print outcome, which may then be rendered (e.g., or rasterized) by a specific printer using a print text or images. Additionally, fixed-layout document formats exist which are designed to facilitate device-independent printing all maintaining documents available. For example, the portable document format (PDF) is an example of such format, where .PDF documents may be generated using postscript. Somewhat similarly, the XML paper specification (XPF) provides such a fixed layout document, which is based on the eXtensible markup language (XML).","Thus, application content or other print data may be received from the application  in virtually any format, including, e.g., hypertext markup language (HTML), or in the format associated with document processing applications and\/or images, or any PDF or XPF formats referenced above. The format converter  may thus be configured to receive print data in these and any other various formats, and to convert the print data into a format that is recognizable by a designated printer, e.g., that is recognizable by the cloud-aware printer  that is designated and identified by the user  upon the arrival of the user  at the second location.","Similarly, as referenced above, the format converter  may be configured to convert the print characteristics associated with the print job into a format that is recognizable by the designated printer . That is, as referenced above, the print characteristics may include aspects of how the print data should or can be printed; i.e., based on preferences of the user and\/or (capabilities, or lack thereof) of the designated printer. For example, a given printer may be a black and white printer with no two-sided printing abilities, while a second printer may be a color printer with two-sided printing. The format converter  may thus provide appropriate conversion, depending on a selected printer and\/or on preferences of the user . The format converter  may then provide and execute a resulting, converted print job using, e.g., a protocol referred to herein as the cloud print protocol (CPP). Thus, the cloud print protocol allows the cloud print service  to communicate with the cloud-aware printer  (or with a legacy printer enabled to communicate with the cloud print service ).","As described herein, such preferences of the user  may be expressed at a time of submission of the print job using the device . In additional or alternative implementations, however, it may not be necessary for the user  to specify all desired print characteristics associated with the print job in question. Rather, additional flexibility or convenience may be provided by allowing the user  to provide or specify such print characteristics while at the second location .","For example, in the spreadsheet example provided above, the user  may utilize the cloud-aware printer  and\/or the mobile device  to submit various print characteristics to the format converter , while the user is located at the second location . Then, the formatter converter  may combine the thus-received print characteristics with the print job received from the application manager , e.g., using the application data fetcher  for retrieving print data by way of the stored reference to the application , so that the format converter  may thereafter proceed with finalizing a printable version of the application content which is compatible with the cloud-aware printer  and which conforms to the print characteristics specified by the user  at the second location . In this way, as referenced, the user  may be provided with significant convenience and flexibility in determining a final printed format of the application content in question, since the user  may configure relevant parameters even after arriving at the second location  of the cloud-aware printer . It may be appreciated that such features are thus provided to the user , even though the user  is not required to have knowledge of an identity or location of the cloud-aware printer  at the time of submission of the print job via the device  at the first location .","As may be appreciated from the above description, the cloud print service  may include job storage  which may provide one or more types of data storage related to operations of the cloud print service . For example, the job storage  may store print jobs and related information, where such print jobs\/information may be stored prior to and\/or after the format conversions provided by the format converter . For example, a print job may be stored in a printer-independent format in which the print job may have been received by the job submit API . In particular, the job storage  may store a link or other reference to the application , so as to facilitate and enable the above-described \u201cprint-by-reference\u201d printing scenarios. In other example implementations, the job storage  may store converted print jobs in which all print values have been assigned, for later access thereof by the cloud-aware printer  or other printer, such as may occur in the above-described \u201cprint-by-value\u201d printing scenarios.","In the example of , the job storage  may include a virtual print queue A which is specifically configured to receive and store print jobs from the device  which are designated for roving printing at a time of submission of the print job. For example, as may be appreciated from the present description (and as shown in ), the user  may utilize the print dialog  to select the virtual print queue A in conjunction with the printer selection drop-down list A. That is, the virtual print queue A may be represented within the provided printer list. In this way, as described, the user  may simply select the virtual print queue A from the list A, to thereby identify the associated print job within the job storage , so that the user  may retrieve the identified print job from the virtual print queue A upon arrival at the second location .","Thus, for example, it may be observed that print jobs of the user  may be stored in conjunction with the associated user account of the user , and in conjunction with one or more printers registered to that user and\/or in conjunction with the virtual print queue A. As a result, print jobs may be committed to short term or long term storage, so that, for example, the user  may locate, identify, and re-print desired print jobs even if the user  later accesses the cloud print service  from a different location (e.g., the second location ) and\/or using a different device than the device .","Further, it may be observed that conversion of the print job at least partially occurs at separate devices from the one or more devices in which the originating application ,  may itself be executing. In this way, for example, it is possible to formulate and submit a print job at least partially separately from a conversion of the print job into a printer-specific format, and to thereby divorce such conversion from an underlying operating system of the executing application, e.g., the operating system .","Further in the example of the cloud print service  of , a print job router  may be configured to route the converted print job from the format converter  and\/or the job storage  to a designated printer, e.g., the cloud-aware printer . The print job router  may further be configured to monitor and mediate execution and success\/failure of a given print job. The print job router  may thus be responsible for managing and monitoring ongoing print jobs from a plurality of users, including the user , which may be designated for a corresponding plurality of printers, including the cloud-aware printer .","As shown, the print job router  may include or otherwise be associated with a job fetch API  and\/or a job control API . For example, the job fetch API  may be configured to provide the print job to the cloud-aware printer , e.g., may be used by the cloud-aware printer  to fetch a desired print job, e.g., a print job specified from within the virtual print queue A, or, in other embodiments, a next available print job for the cloud-aware printer .","The job control API  may be responsible for authorizing the cloud-aware printer  as needed, and for receiving updated status information from the cloud-aware printer , e.g., whether the print job has completed or failed. Such status information also may be stored using the job storage , in association with the corresponding print job in question. The job control API  also may include status information including, e.g., whether a print job is currently queued by not yet downloaded to a corresponding printer, or spooled\/downloaded and added to a native printer queue of the cloud-aware printer  (if applicable).","Further, a printer identifier  is illustrated which may be configured to receive a request from the user  at the second location (e.g., by way of the mobile device ) to initiate a print job from the virtual queue A, as described herein. In such cases, the printer identifier  may be configured to receive an identification of the cloud-aware printer , e.g., using a bar code scanned by the mobile device, and to thereafter actually identify the cloud-aware printer , e.g., in conjunction with the registration manager . Thereafter, assuming the user  is registered with the cloud-aware printer , printing of the associated print job may proceed at the cloud-aware printer.","During execution, the printer job router  may be configured to communicate with, e.g., a print client  executing on firmware  of the cloud-aware printer . The print client  may communicate with the cloud print service , e.g., with the print job router , using the cloud print protocol referenced above.","More specifically, the print client  may be configured to register the cloud-aware printer  with the cloud print service , and to thereby associate the thus-registered printer  with a user of the device , e.g., the user . Moreover, the print client  may be configured to actually drive the cloud-aware printer  and thereby execute the desired printing.","In the example of , the cloud-aware printer  is illustrated as including the print client  within the firmware . The firmware , as would be appreciated by one of skill in the art, may represent factory installed hardware and\/or software which provides designated functions without generally requiring or allowing user modification or configuration (e.g., may utilize read-only memory). Thus, the cloud-aware printer  may be preconfigured from before time of purchase to communicate and coordinate with the cloud print service , to thereby provide a convenient and enjoyable user experience.","For example, the cloud-aware printer  may include a network access manager , user input , and a display (or other user output) , which may generally represent otherwise-conventional components that are therefore not described here in detail except as may be needed to assist in understanding example operations of the system . Of course, the cloud-aware printer  need not include all of the components -, and\/or may include additional or alternative components, which are also not discussed here in detail.","In the example of , the network access manager  may represent associated hardware\/software which enables a cloud-aware printer  to communicate over the network  with the cloud print service . For example, such communication may be conducted wirelessly if the cloud-aware printer  is within range of an appropriate wireless network. In other examples, the network access manager  may enable a wired connection of the cloud-aware printer  to the network , e.g., by way of connection to an appropriate router.","The user input  may represent virtually any sort of keypad, stylus, or other input technique for entering data to the cloud-aware printer . Similarly, the display  may represent virtually any sort of audio and\/or video display to output information to the user  or other user of the cloud-aware printer .","It will be appreciated that many other configurations of the cloud-aware printer  or other printers are contemplated for use in conjunction with the system . For example, as referenced above, a legacy printer, not specifically illustrated in the example of , may lack some of the functionality of the cloud-aware printer . For example, such a legacy printer may not have the network access manager  and\/or the firmware  which may be utilized to implement the print client  and otherwise communicate with the cloud print service . In such cases, the print client  may be configured to execute on or in conjunction with a computing device which is in communication with the legacy printer, and which has the available resources necessary to implement the functionalities described herein, and which may include an otherwise conventional printer driver  communicating with the legacy printer in question. Other variations and implementations of the printer  or related printers would be apparent, and are not described here in detail, except as may be necessary or helpful in understanding operations of the roving printer scenarios described herein.","Thus, it may be observed that the cloud print service  facilitates remote printing by the user , and, in particular, facilitates roving printing by the user  in which the user  submits a print job at the first location  using the device , and later initiates the actual printing of the print job while present at the cloud-aware printer  at the second location . Many variations on these and related roving printing techniques are described in detail, herein, or would be apparent to one of skill in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 1","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["200","200","200","200","200","200","200","200"]},"In the example of , a print job may be received from an application utilized at a device at a first location, where the print submission identifies a virtual print queue and application content to be printed (). For example, the application manager , e.g., the job submit API , may receive a print job from the user  at the device , where the user  may be executing the application  of the application server  at the device .","In a specific example, as described above, the application  may include a spreadsheet application provided as a web application by the application server , and the user  may wish to utilize roving printing to print the spreadsheet in question. For example, as described, the user  may currently be located at the first location , and may or may not have knowledge or certainty of the cloud-aware printer  at the second location  as the printer that will ultimately be used to execute printing of the spreadsheet content.","Consequently, as described, the user  may utilize the printer selection list A of the print dialog  to select a virtual printer associated with the virtual print queue A for submission of the associated print job thereto. As may be appreciated, and as described above, the user  need not provide or determine all relevant print characteristics associated with the submitted print job. For example, since, as just described, the user  may not have a knowledge or awareness of the cloud-aware printer  as the ultimate destination of the submitted print job, the user  therefore may be understood to lack knowledge of available capabilities which may be required for certain print characteristics and options to be utilized. For example, the user  may desire a certain paper size, color option or other print options associated with the desired printing of the spreadsheet content of the application . However, in practice, it may occur that, upon arrival at the second location , the user may determine that the cloud-aware printer  to be utilized may lack some or all of the desired features.","Thus, in the example of , the print job may be stored in association with the virtual print queue (), and may be stored in a manner which is not required to designate or assign values for some or all available print options. For example, the job submit API  may be configured to store the submitted print job in conjunction with the virtual print queue A by storing a link or other reference to the application , where, again, values for the various associated print options need not be specified at a time of storage of the reference within the virtual print queue A.","After storing, a print initiation identifying a printer at a second location may be received, the print initiation identifying the print job and including print properties thereof, and originating from the second location (). For example, the print job router  may be configured to receive such a print initiation from the user , e.g., by way of the cloud-aware printer  and\/or the mobile device . For example, upon arrival at the second location , the user  may discover that the cloud-aware printer  has capability for printing using a desired paper size, but does not provide a capability for color printing. In such scenarios, the user  may, for example, utilize the user input  and the display  of the cloud-aware printer  to identify the desired print job and to submit the desired print properties for communication to the format converter  by way of the network access manager . In alternative examples, the user  may utilize the mobile device  to identify the desired print job and submit the desired print properties to be associated therewith. Advantageously, as described herein, it may be appreciated that the user  may designate such print properties while present at the second location  of the cloud-aware printer , and need not resolve or determine an inclusion or exclusion of such properties when originally submitting the print job at the device . As a result, the user  may be more likely to obtain the best possible printing results available in a given circumstance, with a high degree of convenience and flexibility in doing so.","In example scenarios, the print initiation may include an initial identification of the cloud-aware printer  (e.g., in a first message) to be validated by the printer identifier , followed by actual provision of the print properties (e.g., in a second message). In other words, as described herein, the user  may initially arrive at the cloud-aware printer  at the second location , and may scan a bar code of the cloud-aware printer  (or otherwise obtain identifying information therefore). The printer identifier  may receive this bar code or other identification information, and may access the registration manager  to identify the cloud-aware printer  and determine whether the user  is authorized for use thereof. Thus, in this regard, it may be appreciated that although the printer identifier  is illustrated as a separate component in the example of  or the sake of clarity, in fact the printer identifier  may be implemented as part of the registration manager  and\/or the print job router .","From the application content and using the print properties, a printable file may be generated in the format that is printable by the identified printer (). For example, the format converter  may utilize the application data fetcher  to consult the virtual print queue A and utilize the reference stored therein to retrieve the relevant application content and other data from the application server , whereupon the format converter  may utilize the referenced application content and any print properties stored in conjunction therewith (if any) using the job storage , together with print properties received from the user  and originating from the second location , to thereby provide the specified application content in a printable file in any format printable by the cloud-aware printer , and including the desired and specified print properties.","Finally in the example of , the printable file may be sent to the identified printer (). For example, the print job router  may be configured to communicate with the print client  to send the printable file to the cloud-aware printer , for printing thereby and receipt thereof by the user .","Thus, the examples of  illustrate roving printing scenarios in which the user  obtains the features of confidentiality, security, and convenience associated with not being required to specify a particular printer at a time of submitting a print job, while also enabling the user  to specify some or all print properties related to the print job after a time of arrival at the second location , and in conjunction with initiating a fetch of the print job in question from the cloud print service . As shown and described, such features and benefits may be obtained using the cloud-aware printer , and\/or, optionally, using the mobile device . For example, it may be appreciated that the user input  and the display  of the cloud-aware printer  may be utilized to enable the user  to input desired print properties, fetch the print job in question, and otherwise communicate with the cloud print service .","Further, the user input  and the display  may represent various techniques for performing authentication of the user  prior to executing printing of the identified print job. For example, as described above, the various roving printing scenarios described herein may be associated with a requirement to authenticate a user  prior to the execution of a specified print job. In particular, the print dialog  may include the authentication drop-down list B which may enable the user  to select and parameterize or otherwise designate particular authentication methods which may be then required and executed using the authentication manager  of the cloud print service . For example, the authentication list B may enable the user  to submit preferences or specific types of authentication. For example, the user  may specify a particular password or PIN, which may thereafter be received by way of the user input  and the display  of the cloud-aware printer .","In other example implementations, authentication may be performed in conjunction with the mobile device . For example, as described in detail below, the user  may utilize the mobile device  to authenticate with the cloud print service  and\/or the application server , e.g., by submitting an applicable username\/password combination. In such implementations, it may be appreciated that a burden of providing and\/or facilitating authentication at the cloud-aware printer  may be reduced or eliminated. For example, the cloud-aware printer  need not store or access username\/password combinations associated with registered users. Moreover, since the user  may be likely to already utilize such authentication techniques in the context of the mobile device  when accessing the cloud print service  and\/or the application server , it may be appreciated that the benefits of authentication utilized in conjunction with the roving print scenarios described herein may be recognized and received by the user  with a minimal or negligible increase in effort on the part of the user .","Thus, in the example of , it may be observed that various \u201cprint-by-reference\u201d printing scenarios are implemented, in which the mobile device  may optionally be used. Meanwhile, in the example of the flowchart B of , printing scenarios are described in which \u201cprint-by-reference,\u201d \u201cprint-by-value,\u201d or other printing paradigms may be executed in conjunction with the use of the mobile device  at the second location .","Specifically, as shown, a print job may be received from an application utilized at a device at a first location, the print job identifying a virtual print queue and application content to be printed (). For example, the job submit API  may receive such print jobs from the device , in conjunction with execution of the application  and\/or the application , and including an identification of the virtual print queue A. Therefore, it may be appreciated that such a print job may include identification of relevant application content by virtue of a link or other reference thereto, as described above with respect to operation  of , and\/or may include a print job in which the associated application content is stored in conjunction with designated print properties using the job storage . For example, in the latter examples, in a \u201cprint-by-value\u201d scenario, the user  may execute the application  at the device , and may be required, or may decide, to designate all desired print properties\/characteristics associated with content of the application  to be printed.","Thus, independently of the above-described and other scenarios in which the print job may be received at the cloud print service , the print job may be stored in association with virtual print queue (). For example, the job submit API  may store either the link or other reference to the application content, or may store the application content itself, utilizing the job storage .","Subsequently, after the storing, a print initiation may be received from a mobile device at a second location, the print initiation identifying a printer at the second location and the print job (). For example, the printer identifier  may receive the identification of the cloud-aware printer  from the mobile device  and may select the cloud-aware printer  accordingly, and, based thereon, the print job router  may receive the print initiation for the identified printer from the mobile device  at the second location . As described herein, the mobile device  may send the print initiation including a first message which identifies the cloud-aware printer , followed by a second message which identifies the print job to be printed. As may be appreciated, the first message and the second message may be sent together or in sequence, and\/or the information in both messages may be sent in a single message.","In response, the application content associated with the print job may be sent to the identified printer, based on the print initiation (). For example, the print job router  may be configured to send application content stored using the job storage  and previously converted by the format converter  to the cloud-aware printer  for printing therewith. In alternative implementations, as referenced above, the format converter  may be required to complete conversion of stored or retrieved application content into a printable file which is printable by the cloud-aware printer , perhaps including print options entered by the user  using the mobile device  at the second location , for subsequent transmission by the print job router  to the cloud-aware printer .

In the example, the user has logged into the cloud print service  in conjunction with having logged into an account of the user  which is associated with a suite of productivity applications provided by a provider of the cloud print service  and\/or the application , i.e., a provider of the cloud print server  and\/or the application server .","Thus, in the example of , a URL  corresponds to a URL provided by the servers \/ and to corresponding applications represented by the application  and the cloud print service .

Of course, as described herein, the user  may utilize additional or alternative techniques for identifying the cloud-aware printer  when retrieving a document for printing from the virtual print queue A.","In general, an ability of the mobile device  to scan such a barcode associated with the cloud-aware printer  may rely on installation of availability of associated barcode scanning software on the mobile device . Consequently,  illustrates an example in which the mobile device  does not initially include such barcode scanning software, so that the user  may be initially required to download such barcode scanning software, as shown in the portion  in the screenshot of .","Based on the availability of such barcode scanning software, the mobile device  may be utilized to scan a barcode of the cloud-aware printer , as shown in the portion  in the screenshot of .

In still other implementations, the user may enter a unique name of the printer, or may use a camera and associated text-recognition software of the mobile device  to recognize the cloud-aware printer .","Thus, upon identifying the cloud-aware printer , the cloud print service  may provide a URL associated with the cloud-aware printer  to the mobile device . Specifically, as shown within a portion  in the screenshot of , the user  may be notified that the URL for the printer  has been located. Consequently, the user  may be provided with one or more options for utilizing the cloud-aware printer . Specifically, as shown, a selectable element  may be provided to the user  for opening a browser window using the identified URL. Similarly, selectable elements ,  may be provided to the user  to enable the user  to share the identified URL via email or SMS, respectively.","Upon selection of the selectable element , in the example of , the mobile device  may attempt to open a browser window using the URL of the portion .

For example, as described herein, the user  may wish to print the document \u201cTPS report cover\u201d to a remote location at which the cloud-aware printer  is present, i.e., the second location , but may wish to ensure that the document is not printed until the user  arrives at the second location . For example, in some of the examples provided above, in scenarios in which the user  is an employee working in a corporate network environment, the user  may wish to print the document \u201cTPS report cover\u201d to a printer which is present on a different floor, or in a different building, or in an entirely different campus of the employer of the user . In another example, in scenarios in which the user  is a student, the user  may wish to print the document \u201cTPS report cover\u201d to the cloud-aware printer  which may be present at a computer lab or other student resource facility as the second location .","In additional or alternative examples, as also described herein, the user  at the first location  may have no knowledge of the identity of the cloud-aware printer  and\/or the second location  at a time of printing of the document \u201cTPS report cover.\u201d For example, in scenarios in which the user  represents an employee, the user  may be traveling among various different corporate locations, and may not have knowledge of an exact time or location of which he or she will need to print the document in question. In scenarios in which the user  represents a student, the user  may have access to a number of different student resource facilities providing printers, and may not be certain of which of these student resource facilities will be used to print the document in question. In still other examples, the user  acting in a personal capacity may be traveling, e.g., on vacation, and may be planning on being present at a number of different cities or locations, and again may not be aware of a time or location at which the document in question will be printed.","Thus, as described, upon viewing the print dialog  provided by the print dialog API , the user  may utilize the printer selection drop down list A, or other suitable mechanism, to select association of the print job to be submitted with storage in association with the virtual print queue A. For example, in the terminology of , the virtual print queue A may be identified within the drop down list A as \u201cprint on the go.\u201d Thus, the user  may select this option using the list A, and, optionally, may use the authentication drop down list B to select and possibly parameterize or characterize a type or extent of authentication that will be required by the user  or other authorized party at a later time of printing.","In the example of , as described above, the print job in question is related to the web application , and, therefore, the user  need not provide all or any print options to be associated with the print job. For example, in some scenarios, the user  may simply select the document in question, and thereafter submit the print job using the print dialog , to be received by the job submit API . In other examples, the user  may utilize the print dialog  to select between a certain known subset of print options which are known to be present at any of the available printers. For example, such print options may include basic print options, e.g., a number of copies, a portrait or landscape mode, or other such features. For example, if the user  has a certain number of printers associated with his or her user account as stored using the registration manager , then a subset of print options which is common to all registered printers (or a subset thereof) may be made available by way of the print dialog .","Thus, in these and other scenarios, once the print job is received from the user  by way of the device , the cloud print service , e.g., the application manager , may store an appropriate link or other reference to the web application  in conjunction with the virtual print queue A (). For example, the job submit API  may receive the job submit and store a URL of the document to be printed at the virtual print queue A. Advantageously, as described herein and as may be understood from appreciating the description, the user  need not determine or be aware of all desired or available print options at the time of submitting the print job. Moreover, it is not necessary in these examples for the format converter  to execute any relevant format conversions for converting the document to be printed into a printable format compatible with the cloud-aware printer  that ultimately may be selected as the destination printer. Rather, the print job may simply be stored with reference to the document of the web application , until such later time as the subsequent print initiation and associated print options are received from the user .","Consequently, at a later time, the user  may arrive at the cloud-aware printer  at the second location , such as in the examples described above (). As described above with respect to the examples of , and with respect to the mobile device  of , the user  may utilize the mobile device  to execute the desired print job using the cloud-aware printer . In many cases, the user  already may be logged into a user account associated with the web application . For example, as just described with respect to the examples of , the web application  may be a document processing application included within a suite of web applications provided by an operator of the application server . In such scenarios, the user  already may be logged into a corresponding user account, so as, for example, to send and receive emails, receive calendar and other schedule notifications, and otherwise to interact with the application suite.","Thus, if the user is not already logged in to such a user account using the mobile device  (), then the user may easily log in using the mobile device  (). As described, such a login procedure may be executed in a manner which is otherwise completely conventional and therefore familiar to the user , and which does not provide any additional burden on, or knowledge by, the user . Moreover, the ability to provide such authentication may reduce or eliminate the need of the cloud-aware printer  to maintain relevant authentication data.","Of course, it will be appreciated from the above description that additional or alternative authentication measures may be used. For example, as described, the authentication manager  may utilize authentication parameters submitted by way of the authentication drop down list B, as well as functions and features of the cloud-aware printer  itself in receiving and verifying such authentication information as may be submitted by the user  using the user input  and display  of the cloud-aware printer  itself. However, as may be apparent, such authentication techniques may require additional resources on the part of the cloud print service , the cloud-aware printer , and of the user . Nonetheless, availability of such authentication techniques may be useful in various scenarios, e.g., such as when an enhanced level of security is desired, or when the user  does not have access to an appropriate mobile device .","In the example of , it may occur that once the user  is logged in using the mobile device , the corresponding printer selection list  of  may be provided to the user , including the virtual print queue job. As shown in , the corresponding printer selection may be identified using appropriate terminology, e.g., \u201cprint-on-the-go,\u201d and additional instructions may be provided for executing the corresponding printing, e.g., such as instructions for scanning a barcode of, or otherwise identifying, the relevant, nearby printer.","Thus, as shown with respect to , if the mobile device  does not currently have a corresponding barcode scanner software application (), then the user may be required to install such a barcode scanner (). Once the barcode scanner application is present, the user  may proceed to scan the barcode on the nearby printer, as shown and described above with respect to  ().","In this way, the printer identifier  may interact with the registration manager  to identify the cloud-aware printer  as being registered with the cloud print service . Subsequently, the print job router  may provide a printer URL associated with the printer  to the mobile device  (), as shown with respect to  above.","Upon an attempt of the user  to access the provided printer URL, e.g., through the use of the selectable elements -, the print job router , in conjunction with the registration manager , may determine whether the user  has access to the identified printer (). If not, then, as shown in portion  of , the print job router  may inform the user  that access has been denied, and may suggest use of a different printer (), in which time the user  may travel to a different printer () to further attempt printing of the desired document.","On the other hand, if the user  has access (), then the print job router , e.g., the job fetch API , may retrieve the relevant reference from the virtual print queue  and provide print options to the user  by way of the mobile  (). For example, the print job router  may utilize the application data fetcher  to utilize the reference of the virtual print queue A and access the web application  to retrieve the desired document \u201cTPS report cover\u201d to be printed.","Thus, as shown with respect to , the user  may be provided with various print options, and may select from among these before submitting a final request for printing to proceed. At such time, the print job router  may receive the document in question from the application  by way of the application data fetcher , as just described, and may receive the print options from the user  by way of the mobile device . In this way, the document in question and all associated print options may be provided together to the format converter , which may then proceed with executing the conversion thereof into a printable file which is compatible with printing by the cloud-aware printer . Thereafter, the converted printable file may be provided to the print job router  and thereby sent to the cloud-aware printer  for printing thereon (). In this way, the user  may receive the document to be printed at a time, place, and manner of the user's choosing, and in a manner which is convenient and flexible for the user .","It may be appreciated that, in various scenarios, the associated technical details for implementing the above described systems and methods may vary. For example, the example of  illustrates the cloud print service  and associated functionality as executing within the cloud print server . However, it may be appreciated that some or many of the above described functionalities may be performed using a browser application or other hardware\/software of the mobile device . For example, corresponding JavaScript code or other appropriate coding techniques may be used to cause a browser of the mobile device  to facilitate identification of the cloud-aware printer  as being associated with the cloud print service  and\/or the user , to identify and fetch the desired document from the application , and\/or to facilitate transfer of the print job in question from the virtual print queue A to a local print queue of the cloud-aware printer . Further, the mobile device  may be utilized to perform various status checks or other monitoring of the print job in question, e.g., may implement various functionalities described above with respect to the job control API .
