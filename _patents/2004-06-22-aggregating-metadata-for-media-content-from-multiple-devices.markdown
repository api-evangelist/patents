title: Aggregating metadata for media content from multiple devices
abstract: Collecting and augmenting metadata associated with media content stored on a plurality of devices for display to a user. The collected metadata remains available (e.g., visible) to a user after the device storing the corresponding media content is offline, disconnected, or otherwise unavailable. In particular, the invention permits metadata associated with media content stored on one or more devices (e.g., consumer electronic devices) to be enumerated, obtained, and promoted into another device (e.g., a personal computer) such that the metadata may be treated as if the media content is stored on the other device (e.g., the personal computer). In particular, the invention automatically detects an event generated in response to an action by a first device storing a media file. In response to the detected event, the invention matches and obtains metadata for the media content stored in the media file. A user organizes or otherwise manipulates the obtained metadata, for example, via a media player.

No. 10\/623,471, filed Jul. 18, 2003, entitled \u201cRESOLVING METADATA MATCHED TO MEDIA CONTENT,\u201d the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of media content. In particular, embodiments of this invention relate to obtaining and aggregating metadata for media content stored on a plurality of devices.","Due to recent advances in technology, computer users are now able to enjoy many features that provide an improved user experience, such as playing various media and multimedia content on their personal or laptop computers. For example, most computers today are able to play compact discs (CDs) so users can listen to their favorite musical artists while working on their computers. Many computers are also equipped with digital versatile disc (DVD) drives enabling users to watch movies.","In some multimedia environments, a computer has access to a computer-readable medium storing compressed media files. Common media file types include Moving Picture Experts Group audio layer-3 (MP3) files and WINDOWS MEDIA\u00ae technologies audio (WMA) and video (WMV) files. The computer typically organizes the media files into playlists when the compressed media files are played on the computer. The files may be organized according to metadata or other property data associated with the media content. Metadata for a digital media file such as an audio file usually includes general information pertaining to the media file itself. This information is typically stored within the file. For example, an audio file may have metadata tags for the song title, song artist, album title, and a rating. In another example, in the case of audio media files, the files may be organized by album, artist, genre, date, or some user-specified selection and ordering of metadata. A user navigates through this organization using menus and graphical displays to render the desired media files.","Often, users store media content on a variety of devices including personal computers, portable consumer electronic devices (e.g., MP3 players), removable hard drives, and network shares. Many of these devices have limited capabilities for metadata processing, updating, using, and querying, while other devices have no such capabilities at all. There is a need for a system that enables the central organization of media content stored on a plurality of devices even if all the media content is not physically stored on the same device (e.g., a computer-readable medium). Further, there is a need for a system that permits metadata for media content stored on a device external to a computing device to be augmented and promoted into the computing device such that the metadata may subsequently be treated (e.g., organized) as if the media content is stored on the computing device.","Accordingly, a system for creating entities on a device that mirror media content stored on a plurality of other devices is desired to address one or more of these and other disadvantages.","Embodiments of the invention include methods for promoting media content to end users through augmentation of metadata associated with the media content. For example, one embodiment of the invention permits metadata for media content stored on a device to be enumerated and promoted into another device (e.g., for display to a user) such that the metadata may be treated as if the media content is actually stored on the other device. The metadata is available to the user even after the device is disconnected or otherwise inaccessible by the other device. Some computing devices (e.g., personal computers) are able to display far richer metadata for the media content than what was presented to the computing device by another computing or storage device. Promoting or virtualizing metadata from a plurality of computing or storage devices into a central device for display to the user enables the creation of a virtual media library on the central device. Including such extended metadata on items of media content is very important to the digital media user. In one embodiment, the virtual media library permits user interaction with metadata for media collections on a personal computer and with metadata for media collections on external devices to occur in a seamless and highly interrelated manner to afford the user a rich media experience by abstracting access to the media collections.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a method collects metadata for media content stored on a plurality of devices. The method includes automatically detecting an event generated in response to an action by a first device. The first device has a media file stored thereon. The method also includes determining an identifier associated with the media file in response to the detected event. The method further includes obtaining metadata for the media file from a metadata provider using the determined identifier. The method stores the obtained metadata in a memory area associated with a second device and enables a user to manipulate the stored metadata.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, one or more computer-readable media have computer-executable components for collecting metadata for media content stored on a plurality of devices. The components include a driver component for automatically detecting a connection from a first device upon creation of the connection by the first device storing a media file. The components further include an identification component for identifying metadata associated with media content stored in the media file. The components further include a retrieval component for obtaining from a metadata provider the metadata identified by the identification component for the media content. The components also include a storage component for storing the metadata obtained by the retrieval component in a memory area associated with a second device. The components also include an application component for enabling a user to manipulate the metadata stored by the storage component.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a system collects metadata for media content stored on a plurality of devices. The system includes a memory area for storing metadata for media content. The media content is stored on a first device. The memory area is associated with a second device. The system also includes a processor configured to execute computer-executable instructions for automatically detecting a connection from a first device upon creation of the connection by the first device having media content stored thereon. The computer-executable instructions also include identifying metadata associated with the media content in response to the detected connection. The computer-executable instructions further include obtaining the identified metadata for the media content from a metadata provider. The computer-executable instructions include storing the obtained metadata in a memory area associated with a second device. The computer-executable instructions include displaying the stored metadata to a user and altering the display of the stored metadata responsive to termination of the connection.","In accordance with still another aspect of the invention, an operating system has an event handler associated therewith. The event handler has computer-executable instructions for automatically detecting a connection from a first device upon creation of the connection by the first device having a media file stored thereon. The computer-executable instructions determine an identifier associated with the media file in response to the detected connection. The computer-executable instructions obtain the metadata for the media file from a metadata provider using the determined identifier. The computer-executable instructions store the obtained metadata in a memory area associated with a second device. The computer-executable instructions enable a user to manipulate the stored metadata via an application program associated with the second device.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method collects metadata for media content stored on a plurality of devices. The method includes automatically detecting an event generated in response to an action by a first device. The first device stores a media file. The media file includes media content. The method also includes matching metadata to the media content in response to the detected event. The method further includes obtaining the matched metadata from a metadata provider. The method stores the obtained metadata in a memory area associated with a second device and enables a user to manipulate the stored metadata.","Alternatively, the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrates an exemplary multimedia environment in which the invention may be used. Portable consumer electronic devices generally have limited capabilities for processing, updating, using and querying metadata associated with media content stored by the devices. Embodiments of the invention permit metadata associated with various forms of media content stored on one or more devices to be enumerated and promoted into another device. In this manner, the metadata may be treated as if the media content is actually stored on the other device. For example, metadata associated with media content stored on a plurality of devices may be aggregated on a central device (e.g., a personal computer) at the same time. The metadata aggregated from the plurality of devices remains visible to a user of the central device even after the device actually storing the media content associated with the metadata is disconnected from the central device.","A user may organize or otherwise manipulate the metadata using, for example, a media player. In one embodiment, the invention includes copying or promoting metadata for media content stored on media devices such as the portable consumer electronic devices to another device such as the personal computer or other computing device. By aggregating metadata from these sources into a common repository on the computing device the invention provides substantial functional parity among the consumer electronic devices and the computing device. The computing device treats the metadata promoted by one of the consumer electronic devices as if the metadata were associated with media content stored by the computing device. For example, a user of the computing device is able to organize, rate, and otherwise manipulate the promoted metadata.","The invention also augments the metadata by obtaining updated metadata or additional metadata associated with the media content for those computing devices (e.g., personal computers) that are able to display far richer metadata than what was presented to the computing device by the portable consumer electronic devices. In an embodiment of this invention, the personal computer enriches the enumerated media content by offering to update the media content stored on the consumer electronic device with new, additional, updated, corrected, or extended metadata. Another improvement involves allowing the personal computer to offer behaviors or features such as \u201cPlay songs on this device that sound like each other.\u201d","Exemplary Media Environment","Referring further to the exemplary multimedia environment of , a system  has one or more computers  coupled to one or more consumer electronic devices  providing media content including audio data, video data, and\/or image data. For example, the devices  may include a compact disc (CD) player , a camcorder , or a camera . Additionally, the devices  may include other personal computers, removable hard drives, network shares, a Moving Picture Experts Group audio layer-3 (MP3) player, an audio system in an automobile, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, or the like. The consumer electronic devices  may include any suitable rendering filter or media player or device that is configured to render digital media so that the user can experience the content that is embodied on the consumer electronic device . For example, suitable media player applications include a CD media player and a DVD media player.","In this environment, the computer  stores, on a computer-readable medium , only the metadata for the media content that is stored on the consumer electronic devices . That is, in one embodiment, the computer  does not store the media content from the consumer electronic device . The computer  may, however, store other media content on the medium  for use by a media player program associated with the computer . In this manner, the medium  acts as a central metadata repository for metadata for media content stored on medium  as well as for metadata for media content stored on another device.","One aspect of the present invention enables the user or, particularly, enables a media player program executing on computing device  or client, to access, retrieve, and display for the user, so-called metadata. Those skilled in the art are familiar with metadata, which is simply information about data. In the context of the illustrated embodiment, metadata includes information related to specific content of a digital media file being played on the media player. Basic metadata includes, but is not limited to, a title, performer, genre, a track number, and the like. Extended metadata includes, but is not limited to, cover art, a composer, description of content, performer biographies, reviews, ratings, related performers, where to buy similar items, upcoming concerts, ticket sales, URLs to other related experiences including purchase opportunities, a studio, a director, and the like. In one embodiment, extended metadata may be organized into two main categories: metadata retrieved or downloaded, and metadata computed from the media file (e.g., digital signal processing of the file stream).","The user of consumer electronic device  connects the device  storing a digital media file to computer , or otherwise causes the device  to communicate with the computer , which in turn generates an event. Computer  has a processor configured to execute computer-executable instructions. In the embodiment of , the computer  includes several computer-executable components implementing an event handler  for processing the generated event. The components include a driver component , an identification component , a retrieval component , a storage component , an application component , a user interface component , and a display component . As described in greater detail herein, the driver component  automatically detects an event generated in response to an action by one of the consumer electronic devices . The identification component  determines an identifier associated with a media file stored on the device . The retrieval component  obtains metadata for the media file from a metadata provider  using the determined identifier. The metadata provider  matches metadata to the specific media content stored on the consumer electronic device . Metadata provider  communicates the metadata to computer . The metadata provider  includes any source that provides metadata or other property data including, but not limited to, a human operator, a local cache, a media library, or a remote server.","The storage component  shown in  stores the obtained metadata in a memory area associated with computer . The application component  enables a user to manipulate the stored metadata. The user interface component  prompts a user to determine whether to obtain via the retrieval component  the metadata associated with the media file from the metadata provider. The display component  displays the obtained metadata to the user.","Those skilled in the art will note that the invention software may be implemented with any number and organization of components or modules. That is, the invention is not limited to the specific configuration of components , , , , , , and , but may include more or less components having more or less individual functionality than described herein. For example, the event handler illustrated in  may encompass a single event handler processing events from all consumer electronic devices. Alternatively, the event handler may include a plurality of event handlers each specific to one or more of the consumer electronic devices. In addition, the components may be part of an operating system associated with computer , or may be part of an application program separate from the operating system.","In one example, the metadata is available from the metadata provider  via a data communication network . The computer  and metadata provider  are coupled to the data communication network . While the network  includes the Internet in one example, the teachings of the invention may be applied to any data communication network. Data communication network  may support, for example, client\/server communications or peer-to-peer connections.","In the examples herein, the media content of the digital media file is described in the context of content embodied on a CD or a DVD. It is to be appreciated and understood that the media content may be embodied on any suitable media and that the specific examples described herein are given to further understanding of the inventive principles. For convenience, a digital media file refers to one or more files representing, for example, a single song track or a collection of tracks such as would be found on an audio CD. The media content may include, without limitation, specially encoded media content (e.g., audio, video, or still images) in the form of an encoded media file.","Aggregating Metadata","Referring next to , a flow chart illustrates operation of an exemplary event handler executing on a central device (e.g., a personal computer). The event handler enables the creation of a database or other memory area storing metadata for media content and storing source information identifying the consumer electronic device storing the actual media content. A user is then able to process the database information to perform metadata lifecycle actions such as augmentation of the database information or further integration of the database information into a media library associated with the database. In one embodiment, the source information enables a central device to playback a media file stored in the consumer electronic device so long as the consumer electronic device is connected to the central device.","In , the illustrated method of the invention collects metadata for media content stored on a plurality of devices (e.g., consumer electronic devices) and creates metadata records or other entries for the media content into a file system of the central device. In general, an event handler of the invention executes to process events (e.g., device events, autoplay events, and change\/notify events). The events may be categorized in one embodiment as events indicating a change in scope (e.g., a new device has been connected) or events indicating no change in scope (e.g., the same device, but new content). The event may include one or more of the following: a device event, an autoplay event, a change event, and a notify event. In one embodiment, an event is generated in response to the storage of another media file on the consumer electronic device.","The method automatically detects an event generated in response to an action by a first device (e.g., a consumer electronic device) at . The consumer electronic device stores a media file. In one embodiment, automatically detecting the event includes automatically detecting a connection from one or more of the following: a consumer electronic device, a portable device, an external device, a handheld device, a computing device, and a storage device. For example, automatically detecting the event may include automatically detecting the insertion of a compact disc into a personal computer. Generating an event based on an action such as this is well known in the art.","The invention matches metadata to the media content in response to the detected event. There are numerous ways known in the art to match metadata to media content. For example, the media content may store a persisted identifier which may be matched to metadata. In another example, metadata may be identified by brute force matching using only bibliographic metadata obtained from the media content (or file storing the media content). In this example, fuzzy means may be employed to perform the matching. The invention is operable with all such means for matching metadata to the media content.","In the specific example of , the method matched metadata to the media content by determining an identifier associated with the media file in response to the detected event at . In one embodiment, the method determines the identifier associated with the media file by querying the consumer electronic device or accessing data stored on a computer-readable medium associated with the consumer electronic device. Determining an identifier associated with a computer-readable medium storing media content is well known in the art.","In one specific example, a table of contents (TOC) value takes the form of a physical identifier for a compact disc identifying the specific digital media file based on the offsets of each track on the disc. The TOC, defined by a well-known specification referred to as the Red Book, identifies audio CD-based absolute times for the start of each track. The TOC, found in the CD's lead-in area, is expected to be the same for all like-entitled CDs published from the same source.","The method sets forth obtaining metadata for the media file from a metadata provider using the determined identifier at . Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/623,471, filed Jul. 18, 2003, entitled \u201cRESOLVING METADATA MATCHED TO MEDIA CONTENT,\u201d previously incorporated herein by reference, describes a methodology for obtaining metadata for the media file from a metadata provider using the determined identifier. In one embodiment, obtaining the metadata is device specific or specific to the media content. As such, this embodiment of the invention identifies the device or media content (e.g., by extracting an identifier), and obtains the metadata using the extracted identifier. For example, the method sends the extracted identifier to a web service to obtain the metadata. Alternatively or in addition, the method may obtain or receive the metadata from the consumer electronic device and\/or the media content or file directly. In one embodiment, the method prompts the user to determine whether to obtain the metadata associated with the media file prior to actually obtaining the metadata. The method receives a determination from the user in response.","At ,  illustrates storing the obtained metadata in a memory area associated with the second device (e.g., the central device). For example, the method may store the metadata in a memory area (e.g., a file system) accessible by or otherwise associated with a media player for the central device. In an alternative embodiment, the method obtains the metadata, displays the obtained metadata to the user, and prompts the user to determine whether to add the obtained metadata to local storage (e.g., add to a media library associated with the consumer electronic device).","If the consumer electronic device has write capability, the media content may be enhanced by updating the files on the consumer electronic device with the obtained (e.g., extended) metadata and enabling behaviors such as \u201cplay songs on this device that sound like each other.\u201d In this embodiment, the method stores the obtained metadata on the consumer electronic device as soon as the metadata has been received to aid synchronization of the metadata between the central device and the consumer electronic device.","The central device displays the obtained metadata at  and enables the user to manipulate the metadata at  as if the media content associated with the metadata were stored on the central device. For example, the obtained metadata is displayed to the user via a media player. When the consumer electronic device is disconnected from the central device, the method automatically alters the display of the metadata items associated with the disconnected device at . That is, the user does not first need to attempt to render the media content before being informed of the unavailability of the media content. Altering or \u201cghosting\u201d the display of the metadata from the disconnected device includes dimming, shading, tinting, bolding, italicizing, or the like, the displayed metadata.","One or more computer-readable media have computer-executable instructions for performing the method illustrated in .","Referring next to , a screen shot illustrates an exemplary embodiment of an organizational application program manipulating the stored metadata. In , a media player application program displays metadata for media content stored locally as well as metadata for media content stored on another device (e.g., a consumer electronic device). In particular, Album F is stored on an external device that is currently offline as indicated by the italicized metadata.","Exemplary Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["130","130","130","132","134","136","134","132","136"]},"The computer  typically has at least some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media, which include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media, may be any available medium that may be accessed by computer . By way of example and not limitation, computer readable media comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.
