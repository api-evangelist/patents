title: Modular helmet-mask assembly
abstract: A modular helmet-mask assembly for protecting a user's head and face from hazards such as from chemical and biological warfare agents. The invention includes an impact resistant helmet; a face protection assembly, which can be attached and detached from the helmet; and a transparent, impact resistant lens. The face protection assembly includes an impact resistant face protection shell with a vision port, through which the transparent lens can be positioned; a flexible nosecup assembly positioned to engage the mouth and nose of the user, which also includes a breathe-through airflow assembly and filter unit; and a flexible face seal which surrounds the nosecup assembly and lens and engages the face of the user. An adjustable head harness is attached to the shell or face seal, for adjustably securing the face seal and nosecup to the user's face to maximize comfort and protection while preventing fogging of the lens.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, licensed, and used by or for the U.S. Government.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to respiratory masks, or more particularly to modular respiratory masks that offer protection from hazardous chemical and\/or biological warfare agents and the like.","2. Description of the Related Art","Protective masks are currently used by the military for protection against chemical and biological contaminants. However, such masks often impose a substantial physiological burden on the wearer. These masks are typically difficult to wear for prolonged periods because they are relatively bulky and heavy, have high breathing resistance, impair vision and communications, cause thermal stress, physical discomfort, and degrade job performance. Furthermore, the demands placed on such protective masks for use by the crews of military vehicles, such as land and sea vehicles and aircraft, are even greater due to the limitations on the size or bulk of such masks in crowded crew cabins, the need to avoid fogging of the lenses, and crew person exhaustion from heat buildup, physical discomfort, and respiratory effort.","Thus, mask systems used by military crews, and particularly vehicle crews, must be optimized for minimal bulk and weight, in order to readily fit within the limited crew space provided. In addition, such masks must be optimized to provide a sufficient flow of purified air for enhancing respiration and comfort, while minimizing lens fogging, heat stress, respiratory effort, and excessive pressure caused by the mask seals on contacted parts of the user's face and head.","Previous efforts to provide crew masks include the U.S. Army M45 (Aircrew) and M42 (Combat Vehicle) masks. These masks use a standard six-point suspension system and an intern periphery design, where the contact point\/seal between the mask and the skin of the user is provided by an inwardly turned mask edge. However, the M45 has no powered blower system due to weight and logistic concerns. While the M45 provides adequate unblown protection and defogging properties, this crew mask is known to be somewhat uncomfortable when used in combination with helmet systems, such as aircrew helmets, due to the harness buckles and the presence of the intern seal in the forehead area, where a crew helmet can press the seal into the forehead. In addition, the lack of a powered blower system results in high breathing resistance, adding to crew fatigue.","In an alternative approach, the U.S. Air Force AERP mask system eliminates the face seal, in favor of a neck seal design. In addition, both the U.S. Army M48\/M49 and the U.S. Air Force AERP use a dual canister blower system for providing the overpressure needed for protection against inward diffusion of toxic agents, and to provide additional airflow for keeping the lenses free of moisture or fog. Existing blowers are built to provide for air flow rates of approximately 4 cubic feet per minute (CFM) and attendant overpressure. Given the need for an air flow of approximately 4 CFM, the presently employed blowers for all current crew mask systems are sub-optimal in size and bulk.","Thus, there remains a need in the art for a crew mask for protection against chemical or biological toxic agents that provides a comfortable face seal and helmet interface and an optimized size and bulk of the equipment, while still providing adequate protection and defogging.","The present invention provides a solution to this problem. The invention includes a modular helmet-mask assembly which includes a helmet, a face protection assembly, and a transparent, impact resistant lens. The helmet is made of an impact resistant material for protecting the user's head. The face protection assembly, which can be attached and detached from the helmet, includes a face protection shell which is also made of an impact resistant material, for protecting the head and face of the user. The shell includes a vision port through the shell at the level of the eyes of a user, through which a transparent lens can be positioned for protection of the user's eyes. The face protection assembly includes a flexible nosecup assembly within the shell and flexible face seal on an inner surface of the shell. The flexible nosecup assembly is positioned to engage the mouth and nose of the user, and it includes a breathe-through airflow assembly and filter unit. The flexible face seal is disposed on an inner surface of the shell around the nosecup assembly and the lens, such that the face seal engages the face of the user. A strap or harness is attached to the shell or face seal, for adjustably securing the face seal and nosecup to the user's face to maximize comfort and protection while preventing fogging of the lens.","The invention provides a modular helmet-mask assembly which comprises:","(a) a helmet capable of enclosing the head of a user, said helmet comprising an impact resistant material; and","(b) a face protection assembly, alternately attachable to and detachable from a front part of said helmet, which face protection assembly comprises",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["(i) a face protection shell comprising an impact resistant material;","(ii) a vision port through the shell at the level of the eyes of a user;","(iii) a flexible nosecup assembly within the shell, which nosecup assembly is positioned to engage the mouth and nose of a user, said nosecup comprising a breathe-through airflow assembly and a filter unit;","(iv) a flexible face seal, disposed on an inner surface of the shell around the nosecup assembly and the vision port, which face seal is capable of engaging the face of a user; and","(v) an adjustable head harness attached at an surface of the shell or the face seal which is capable of engaging the back of a user's head to thereby adjustably secure the face seal and nosecup assembly to a user's face, and\n\n(c) either (i) or (ii):\n","(i) a transparent, impact resistant lens fixed to the vision port at the level of the eyes of a user;","(ii) a transparent, impact resistant lens rotatably attached at the front part of the helmet and positioned to alternately engage and disengage with the vision port of the shell at the level of the eyes of a user."]}}}},"The invention also provides a method for protecting a user's face from chemicals which comprises:","(I) providing a modular helmet-mask assembly which comprises",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["(a) a helmet capable of enclosing the head of a user, said helmet comprising an impact resistant material; and","(b) a face protection assembly, alternately attachable to and detachable from a front part of said helmet, which face protection assembly comprises\n        \n        ","(c) either (i) or (ii):\n        \n        "]}}}},"The invention provides a helmet-mask assembly for protecting the face and head of a user.  respectively show a helmet-mask assembly  according to the invention in assembled and disassembled condition.
