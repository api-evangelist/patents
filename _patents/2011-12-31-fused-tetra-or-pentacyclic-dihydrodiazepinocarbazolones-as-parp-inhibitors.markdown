{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a U.S. national stage application of International Application No. PCT\/CN2011\/085148, which was filed on Dec. 31, 2011 with the title \u201cFUSED TETRA OR PENTA-CYCLIC DIHYDRODIAZEPINOCARBAZOLONES AS PARP INHIBITORS\u201d.","Disclosed herein are fused tetra or penta-cyclic compounds which can inhibit the activity of poly (ADP-ribose)polymerases (PARPs), pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one of the compounds, and the use thereof in treating certain diseases.","Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), previously known as poly(ADP-ribose) synthases or poly(ADP-ribose) transferases, are a family of proteins that contain PARP catalytic domain (BMC Genomics, 2005 Oct. 4; 6: 139.). Approximately 17 members of PARPs have been discovered so far, including PARP-1, PARP-2, PARP-3, PARP-4 (Vault-PARP), PARP-5a (Tankyrase-1), PARP5b (Tankyrase-2), PARP-6, PARP-7 (tiPARP), PARP-8, PARP-9 (BAL1), PARP-10, PARP-11, PARP-12, PARP-13 (ZAP), PARP-14 (CoaSt6), PARP-15, and PARP-16. The catalytic activity of PARPs can be to transfer the ADP-ribose moiety from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to glutamic acid residues of a number of target proteins, and to form long branches of ADP-ribose polymers. However, some of the PARP families have been reported to catalyze only mono-ADP-ribosylation of targets while activities of others have yet to be reported (2008 Oct. 10; 32(1): 57-69.). A number of the PARP enzymes have been reported to show important functional roles in, for example, DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, mitotic progression, genomic integrity, telomere stability, cell death, and Wnt signaling pathway.","PARP-1 may be the most abundant and most well studied member of the family, and PARP-2 may be its closest relative. PARP can be activated by damaged DNA fragments and, once activated, catalyzes the attachment of poly-ADP-ribose units to a variety of nuclear proteins, including histones and PARP itself. The resultant foci of poly(ADP-ribose) has been reported to halt transcription and recruit repair enzymes to the site of DNA damage. The pivotal role of PARP in the repair of DNA strand breaks has been reported as well established. PARP-1 knockout cells can show increased sensitivity to, for example, alkylating agents, topoisomerase (topo) I inhibitors and \u03b3-irradiation. PARP inhibitors have been reported to sensitize tumor cells to radiation treatment (including ionizing radiation and other DNA damaging treatments) and anticancer drugs (including platinum drugs, temozolomide, and topoisomerase I inhibitors). PARP inhibitors have also been reported to be effective in radiosensitizing (hypoxic) tumor cells and in preventing tumor cells from recovering from potentially lethal and sublethal damages of DNA after radiation therapy, presumably by their ability to prevent broken DNA strand from rejoining and by affecting several DNA damage signaling pathways.","PARP inhibitors have been suggested to effectively destroy tumors defective in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes through the concept of synthetic lethality. While tumors with wild type BRCA genes can be insensitive to PARP inhibitors, the presence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiency leads to significantly increased sensitivity of those genes to PARP inhibitors. It can be suggested that PARP inhibitors may cause an increase in DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), which are converted during replication to toxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that cannot be repaired by homology recombination repair in BRCA1\/2 defective cells. The synthetic lethality may have also been reported for PARP inhibitors, and ATM, ATR, RAD51 deficiency, and other homology recombination repair defects. PARP inhibitors can be useful for treatment of cancers with DNA repair deficiencies.","Activation of PARP may also have a role in mediating cell death. Excessive activation of PARP may have been indicated in ischemia-reperfusion injuries, and in neurological injuries that can occur during stroke, trauma and Parkinson's disease. The overactivation of PARP may lead to rapid consumption of NAD to form ADP-ribose polymers. Because the biosynthesis of NAD can be an ATP consuming process, the cellular level of ATP could be subsequently depleted and the ischemic cells could die from necrosis. Inhibition of PARP can be expected to reduce cell death by preserving cellular NAD and ATP level and by preventing the activation of certain inflammation pathways that could have contributed to further cellular damage via an immune response.","It has been reported that PARP activation can play a key role in both NMDA- and NO-induced neurotoxicity. The reports were based on cortical cultures and hippocampal slices wherein prevention of toxicity can be directly correlated with PARP inhibition potency. The potential role of PARP inhibitors in treating neurodegenerative diseases and head trauma has been hypothesized.","Studies have reported that PARP inhibitors can be used for treatment and prevention of autoimmune disease such as Type I diabetes and diabetic complications ((2005)52: 60-71).","PARP-3 appears to be a newly characterized member of the PARP family. A recent study has reported the role of PARP-3 in genome integrity and mitotic progression (|Feb. 15, 2011|vol. 108|no. 7|2783-2788). PARP-3 deficiency can lead to reduced cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks. PARP-3 deficiency when combined with PARP-1\/2 inhibitors can result in lowered cell survival in response to x-irradiation. PARP-3 can be required for mitotic spindle integrity during mitosis and telomere stability. Therefore inhibition of PARP-3 can also potentially lead to antitumor activity.","Tankyrase-1 (TRF 1-interacting ankyrin-related ADP-ribosepolymerase 1) is initially identified as a component of the human telomeric complex. Tankyrase-2 may share overall sequence identity of 83% and sequence similarity of 90% with Tankyrase-1. Mouse genetic studies reportedly suggest substantial functional overlaps between tankyrase-1 and tankyrase-2. Tankyrase-1 has reportedly been shown to be a positive regulator of telomere length, allowing elongation of the telomeres by telomerase. Inhibition of tankyrases can sensitize cells to telomerase inhibitors. Tankyrase-1 can be also required for sister telomere dissociation during mitosis. Inhibition of Tankyrase-1 by RNAi can induce mitotic arrest. Inhibition of tankyrases potentially may lead to antitumor activity.","Tankyrases have reportedly been implicated in the regulation of Wnt pathway. Wnt pathway can be negatively regulated by proteolysis of the downstream effector \u03b2-catenin by the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex, comprising adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b1\/\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b1\/\u03b2). Inappropriate activation of the Wnt pathway has been reported in many cancers. Notably, truncating mutations of the tumor suppressor APC can be the most prevalent genetic alterations in colorectal carcinomas. APC mutation may lead to defective \u03b2-catenin destruction complex, accumulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin, and\/or active transcription of Wnt pathway-responsive genes. Tankyrase inhibitors have been reported to stabilize the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex by increasing axin levels. Axin, a key component of \u03b2-catenin destruction complex, can be degraded through PARylation and ubiquitination. Inhibition of tankyrases can lead to reduced degradation of axin and\/or increased level of axin. Tankyrase inhibitors have been reported to inhibit colony formation by APC-deficient colon cancer cells. Therefore, tankyrase inhibitors can be potentially useful for treatment of cancers with activated Wnt pathways.","Provided herein are compounds and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one of those compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and use thereof in inhibiting PARP activity for treating diseases, such as cancer. For example, the compounds and compositions as described herein can be useful in treating cancers with defective DNA repair pathways, and\/or can be useful in enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","Certain small molecules have been reported to be PARP inhibitors.

Where the compounds described herein possess two or more asymmetric centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. Enantiomers and diastereomers fall within the broader class of stereoisomers. All such possible stereoisomers as substantially pure resolved enantiomers, racemic mixtures thereof, as well as mixtures of diastereomers are intended to be included. All stereoisomers of the compounds disclosed herein and\/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are intended to be included. Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, reference to one isomer applies to any of the possible isomers. Whenever the isomeric composition is unspecified, all possible isomers are included.","The term \u201csubstantially pure\u201d as used herein means that the target stereoisomer contains no more than 35%, such as no more than 30%, further such as no more than 25%, even further such as no more than 20%, by weight of any other stereoisomer(s). In some embodiments, the term \u201csubstantially pure\u201d means that the target stereoisomer contains no more than 10%, for example, no more than 5%, such as no more than 1%, by weight of any other stereoiosomer(s).","When compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, unless specified otherwise, such double bonds are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.","Some of the compounds described herein may exist with different points of attachment of hydrogen, referred to as tautomers.

Both keto and enol forms, individually as well as mixtures thereof, are also intended to be included where applicable.","It may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (\u201cSMB\u201d) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., a substantially pure enantiomer, may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S.

For example, the effective amount can reduce the number of cancer or tumor cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit or stop tumor cell infiltration into peripheral organs including, for example, the spread of tumor into soft tissue and bone; inhibit and stop tumor metastasis; inhibit and stop tumor growth; relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer, reduce morbidity and mortality; improve quality of life; or a combination of such effects. An effective amount may be an amount sufficient to decrease the symptoms of a disease responsive to inhibition of PARP. For cancer therapy, efficacy in vivo can, for example, be measured by assessing the duration of survival, time to disease progression (TTP), the response rates (RR), duration of response, and\/or quality of life. Effective amounts may vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on route of administration, excipient usage, and co-usage with other agents.","The term \u201cinhibition\u201d indicates a decrease in the baseline activity of a biological activity or process. \u201cInhibition of PARP\u201d refers to a decrease in the activity of PARP as a direct or indirect response to the presence of at least one compound and\/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt disclosed herein, relative to the activity of PARP in the absence of the at least one compound and\/or the at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The decrease in activity is not bound by theory and may be due to the direct interaction of the at least one compound, stereoisomers thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof disclosed herein with PARP, or due to the interaction of the at least one compound and\/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt disclosed herein, with one or more other factors that in turn affect PARP activity. For example, the presence of at least one compound, stereoisomers thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof disclosed herein, may decrease PARP activity by directly binding to the PARP, by causing (directly or indirectly) another factor to decrease PARP activity, or by (directly or indirectly) decreasing the amount of PARP present in the cell or organism.","The term \u201cat least one substituent\u201d disclosed herein includes, for example, from 1 to 4, such as from 1 to 3, further as 1 or 2, substituents.

The auto-PARylation reaction was initiated by addition of 500 nM NAD and 20 ng\/ul activated DNA (Sigma) and incubated at RT for 40 min. The remaining NAD was detected by incubation with cycling assay solution containing 1% ethanol, 0.30 U\/ml alcohol dehydrogenase, 25 uM resazurin, and 0.25 U\/ml diaphorase for 50 min at RT. The concentration of NAD is proportional to the fluorescence signal at Ex 540 nm\/Em 590 nm. The ICs were calculated based on residual enzyme activity (the rate of NAD decrease) in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds.","PARP-2 and PARP-3 Enzymatic Assay","PARP-2 and PARP-3 enzymatic assays were conducted using commercial PARP-2\/PARP-3 Chemiluminescent Assay Kit (BPS Biosciences) and the protocols with the kits. Briefly, histones were coated in a high binding plate first, and incubated with PARP-2 or PARP-3, and increasing concentrations of compounds for 0.5 h. Then, biotinylated NAD and activated DNA were added to the wells. The biotinylated PARylation product was measured by adding streptavidin-HRP and HRP substrates which produce chemiluminescence. The ICs were calculated based on residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds.","Tankyrase-2 Enzymatic Assay","Tankyrase-2 enzymatic assay was conducted using commercial Tankyrase-2 Chemiluminescent Assay Kit (BPS Biosciences) and the protocol with the kit. GST-fused tankyrase-2 (recombinant protein expressed and purified from Bacluovirus) were coated on a GSH-precoated plate first, and incubated with increasing concentrations of compounds for 0.5 h. Then, biotinylated NAD was added to the wells. The biotinylated auto-PARylation product was measured by adding streptavidin-HRP and HRP substrates which produce chemiluminescence. The ICs were calculated based on residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds.","PARylation Assay.","HeLa cells were seeded into a 96-wellplate with clear bottom and black wall at an initial concentration of 5000cells\/well in culture medium (100 \u03bcL of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.1 mg\/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mML-glutamine). The plates were incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0 C. under 5% COatmosphere, and then compounds were added with serial dilutions over eight points over a 0.01 nM-10 \u03bcM final concentration range in 0.1% DMSO\/culture medium. The plate was then incubated for 18 h at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO. Then DNA damage was provoked by addition of 60 \u03bcL of HOsolution in PBS (final concentration 200 \u03bcM). As a negative control, cells untreated with HOwere used. The plate was kept at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 min. Then the medium was gently removed by plate inversion, and the cells were fixed by addition of ice-cold MeOH (100 \u03bcL\/well) and kept at \u221220\u00b0 C. for 20 min. After removal of the fixative by plate inversion and washing 10 times with PBS (120 \u03bcL), the detection buffer (50 \u03bcL\/well, containing PBS, Tween (0.1%), and BSA (1 mg\/mL)) together with the primary PAR mAb (Alexis ALX-804-220, 1:2000), the secondary anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (MolecularProbes A11029, 1:2000), and nuclear dye DAPI (Molecular Probes D3571, 150 nM) were added. Following overnight incubation at 4\u00b0 C. in the dark, removal of the solution, and washing 6 times with PBS (120 \u03bcL), the plate was read on an ArrayScan VTI (ThermoFisher). Monitoring for PAR polymer was by detection of Alexa 488 at XF10048520, exposure time of 0.05 s, and identification of the nuclei was by tracking DAPI with XF10038623, exposure time of 0.01 s. The mean of total intensity of cells was calculated by measuring the average of total intensity of nuclei over the total number of DAPI-labeled nuclei. The EC50 was determined on the basis of the residual enzyme activity in the presence of increasing PARPi concentration.","Compounds 1-69 as disclosed herein were tested and found to inhibit PARP, such
