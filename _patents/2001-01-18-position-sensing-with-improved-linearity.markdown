No. 60\/177,114, POSITION SENSING WITH IMPROVED LINEARITY, filed Jan. 20, 2000.","This invention was made with Government support under contract #DAAH01-99-C-R215 awarded by DARPA. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to an improved measuring device for open-loop and force-balanced accelerometers, and vibratory rate gyroscopes. In addition, the invention further relates to: position or velocity detection in an oscillation-sustaining feedback loop; position detection of actuators, including micro-actuators used for effecting controlled motion of a disk-drive read\/write head, or effecting controlled motion of an optically active device, such as a positionable mirror used in data communications. The invention further relates to microelectromechanical systems formed by one or more micromachining operations.","This invention utilizes charge-based sensing to attain a linear position-input to voltage-output transfer characteristic.","Accelerometers are sensors that measure acceleration. Accelerometers can be designed to measure rotational or translational acceleration. Vibratory rate gyroscopes are a type of accelerometer in which one or more proof-masses are forced into oscillation and a Coriolis acceleration is detected in response to a rate input. Accelerometers and rate gyroscopes have many uses in many commercial, military, and scientific applications including, but not limited to, inertial navigation, vehicular safety systems such as airbags, ride comfort control, platform stabilization, tilt sensing, vibration monitoring, shock and impact measurement, and weapons fusing.","The heart of a displacement-based accelerometer is a mechanical proof-mass. Under an applied acceleration, this passive mechanical device moves with respect to the substrate. For an accelerometer with a linear suspension, it may be shown that for frequencies below the proof-mass resonant frequency along the sensitive axis, \u03c9, the displacement of the proof-mass from its nominal position with respect to the substrate is given by 1\/\u03c9times the applied acceleration. By measuring the displacement of the proof-mass with an electrical interface, acceleration may be inferred.","A sense-element may be operated either open-loop, or placed into a force-feedback loop. Enclosure of a sense-element in a force-feedback loop is commonly called force-balancing or force-rebalancing. In the open-loop configuration, the accelerometer output is given by the change in relative displacement of the proof-mass multiplied by the gain of the position sense interface. Often piezoelectric materials, piezoresistive materials, or sense capacitors are used in conjunction with an electrical position-sense interface to detect proof-mass displacements.","In the force-balanced configuration the position-sense interface output is used to feed back a force in a manner that tends to restore the proof-mass to a defined nominal position. Note the accelerometer output is not a quantity representative of position, but rather is a quantity representative of the force necessary to keep the proof mass at its nominal position. Because force-balanced accelerometers maintain small displacements for acceleration inputs within the measuring range, electrostatic nonlinearities due to changes in air gap capacitance are attenuated. Closed-loop operation has been used to provide several advantages that are particularly important for miniature micromachined sensors including improved linearity, increased dynamic range, and extended bandwidth. In addition, since the output is the applied force, not displacement, the output typically is less sensitive to device dimensions, such as spring width, making the sensor typically less sensitive to variations in manufacturing. Sense capacitors or piezoelectric materials are often used to apply feedback forces to the proof mass.","Note force-feedback is not practical or even desirable for many applications, however. As full scale ranges rise above approximately 50G, it becomes increasingly difficult to force balance an accelerometer in a manner such that the feedback loop doesn't saturate, especially if electrostatic forces and low-voltage operation (i.e. 5V or less) are used to apply the restoring force feedback. Alternatively, when an application requires a low-cost, small, or simple accelerometer, the increased circuit area or added complexity may preclude usage of force-balanced topologies. Although some applications may not allow for force balancing, many of these same target applications will require good input-output linearity and a wide dynamic range that force balancing provides. Furthermore, it is often desirable that the sensor include a differential sense interface for improved rejection of undesired disturbances, such as power supply fluctuations.","A substantially parallel-plate capacitor is defined here as a capacitor having a nonlinear relationship between capacitance and displacement along an axis of sensitivity; a significant component of capacitance being described by the equation K\/g, where K is a geometrically determined constant and g is a characteristic distance between sense electrodes as measured orthogonally from the face of one sense electrode. Substantially parallel-plate capacitors may be advantageous in many applications because in addition to a typically higher sensitivity to changes in air-gap, substantially parallel-plate capacitors typically provide significantly higher air-damping than alternative configurations such as interdigitated comb fingers (see for example Tang et al U.S. Pat. No. 5,025,346 issued Jun. 18, 1991). Higher air damping is beneficial to many applications where underdamped mechanical resonances are undesirable including, but not limited to, accelerometers and open-loop actuators.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["40","41"],"br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["C\u2248\u03b5","A\/g"],"sub":"0"},"A sense capacitor is defined, within the scope of this document, as one or more substantially parallel-plate capacitors connected in parallel. Note, in certain applications, a substantially parallel-plate capacitor may have gasses between electrodes at a reduced pressure, or vacuum, for lower mechanical damping. Furthermore, substantially parallel-plate capacitors may include between the electrodes any of a number of gasses including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, helium, oxygen, or other gasses or combination of gasses.","Often a position sense interface requires a pair of sense capacitors that change oppositely in value for a displacement in the same direction. A pair of sense capacitors that change in this manner provide a degree of symmetry that may result in reduced offset and drift over temperature. Furthermore, a pair of sense capacitors may enable the use of differential circuit techniques that reject certain environmental noise sources such as power supply ripple.","The invention, roughly described, comprises a position-sense interface with improved transfer characteristics. In one embodiment of the invention, a single proof-mass includes two electrically decoupled sensing capacitors is shown. Electrical position detection circuitry, which may be substantially time-multiplexed or frequency-multiplexed, comprises a differential charge integrator with input-sensed output-driven common mode feedback. By placing the sense capacitors in the feedback loop of said differential charge integrator with input-sensed output-driven common mode feedback, improved position sensing linearity is attained.","In an alternative embodiment of the invention two or more proof-masses are connected to form two electrically decoupled sensing capacitors.","In yet another embodiment of the invention, a compensating charge is applied to the sense capacitors in a fashion that minimizes the output common mode shift of the opamp. The magnitude of the compensating charge may be set to a substantially constant level, or derived by a feedback loop that measures the shift in opamp output common mode voltage in response to an excitation signal and adjusts the magnitude of the compensating charge to drive said shift towards zero.","The invention has numerous advantages for acceleration measurement in both open-loop and force-balanced accelerometers, as well as rotation rate measurement in a vibratory rate gyroscope.

(See, for example, Kung, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,026; Montague et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,283; and Sherman, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,280, each of which is fully incorporated by reference herein).  schematically illustrates a sense element for measuring in-plane acceleration comprising two proof-masses, each proof-mass providing one sense capacitor. A sense capacitor having a value that increases for proof-mass displacements along the positive direction of the axis of sensitivity is formed by pairs of anchored electrodes and electrodes attached to a conductive proof-mass Like stationary electrodes are attached to one another via electrical interconnect forming one terminal of a sense capacitor. Proof-mass is mechanically attached to and electrically isolated from substrate  via compliant suspension and anchors Electrical interconnection to proof-mass is attained via interconnect forming a second terminal of a sense capacitor.

Proof-mass is mechanically attached to and electrically isolated from substrate  via compliant suspension and anchors Electrical interconnection to proof-mass is attained via interconnect forming a second terminal of a sense capacitor. Electrostatic shields are used to ensure that only one side of each electrode forms a capacitor with electrodes To minimize electrostatic forces, electrostatic shields may be set to a DC potential similar to the proof-mass potential, with interconnect to proof-mass electrodes being connected to the input terminals of a differential opamp in feedback thereby being kept at a substantially constant voltage. Electrostatic shields are preferably not connected to the proof-mass since this would create a large, constant parasitic capacitance in parallel with the sense-capacitor that may cause deleterious effects as described below. Often further electrical shielding , disposed above and electrically isolated from substrate , will be formed under each proof-mass to prevent, for instance, undesired electrostatic forces. In this case shielding  is also preferably not connected to the proof-mass since this would create a large, constant parasitic capacitance in parallel with the sense-capacitor. Instead, shielding  may be connected to the same DC potential as electrostatic shields ",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00039","num":"00039"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["96","91","91","95","93","93","90","94","93","91","91","94","97","90","91","93","90","92","90","91","92","92","90","91","92","95"],"i":["a ","a ","b ","a.

In this embodiment, position sense interface  comprises a differential opamp  having an ISODCMFB circuit and a negative feedback loop, the feedback loop operating in a sampled-data, i.e. time-multiplexed, fashion. Position sense interface  further comprises sense capacitors each having a nominal sense capacitance C, reference capacitors each having a capacitance of Cref, feedback coupling capacitors feedforward capacitors output terminals opamp output terminals unity-feedback switches output zeroing switches and feedforward compensation switches and Switches may be formed using, for example a NMOS transistor, a PMOS transistor, or both a NMOS and a PMOS transistor.","Position sense interface  operates over two recurring, discrete, nonoverlapping time periods Phi (\u03a6) and Phi (\u03a6). Typical period frequencies are between 1 kHz and 10 MHz. During Phi, switches are closed, placing opamp  into unity-gain feedback and setting the differential voltage at opamp input terminals to a value substantially equal to the opamp offset plus a random component due to flicker and other noise. The ISODCMFB circuit measures the input common mode voltage and drives the output common mode voltage so that the input common mode is driven towards a reference value typically midway between the opamp output common mode voltage range, defined here as V. Reference voltage Vmay be provided by any of a number of well known circuits for providing a constant voltage, and may be derived from a bandgap reference. Since switches are closed, the output common mode voltage is equal to the input common mode voltage, which is driven substantially equal to reference voltage V. Note that both the differential and common mode feedback loops are typically designed so that the loop gain is greater than 100. Switches are also closed during Phi, connecting output node to a reference voltage V. Note that while input nodes have a small voltage difference due to opamp noise and offset, output terminals are forced equal. Reference voltage Vmay be, but is not necessarily, equal to V. If Vis chosen equal to V, however, only a very small error voltage component is presented across sense capacitors during Phi; thus, undesired electrostatic attraction is minimized. Reduced electrostatic attraction during Phi  results in better linearity, especially for systems with high mechanical compliance such as a low-G accelerometer. Improved linearity is due to reduced electrostatic forces affecting the proof-mass in a manner similar to a nonlinear mechanical spring. By closing switches  and during Phi , reference capacitors and feedforward capacitors are initialized so that they may inject controlled amounts of charge during Phi.","During Phi output nodes are released by opening switches and opamp  is removed from unity-gain feedback and placed into charge-integration mode by opening switches A sense-charge pulse equal to C*Vis generated by opening switch  and closing switch , where sense voltage Vis a constant voltage typically between 0.1 and 5 Volts. A combination of differential feedback and ISODCMFB through capacitors and drive input nodes towards Vintegrating sense-charge onto the sense capacitors. The position-sense interface output, V, is equal to the voltage difference between nodes (v(ch_outm)-v(ch_outp)), and is taken during Phi after the electronics have had time to properly settle. Vas a function of the sense capacitance Cis given by the following equation:\n\n(\/()\u2212\/())\n","where C and C are sense capacitors and Cis a term representing parasitic capacitance in parallel with sense capacitors ","When parallel plates comprising either sense capacitor physically touch, sense capacitors are no longer acting as a capacitor and the position sensing interface ceases to function. Physical collision between the plates may have adverse consequences including sticking or welding, especially if the touching members, upon contact, have a voltage difference. Overrange collison may be prevented via equi-potential bumpers that stop movement before capacitor plates touch. Alternatively, the probability of sticking or welding may be reduced upon detection of an impending overrange by applying an equal voltage to electrodes about to collide. Impending collision may be detected, for instance, by periodically or continuouly comparing the position-sense interface output to a pre-determined threshold.","Note that in response to the voltage shift at input node , a large output common mode shift must occur at output terminals To minimize the amount of output common mode swing necessary at opamp outputs and enable larger values of V, switches are opened and switches are closed during Phi , applying a charge to the output terminals via feedforward capacitors Voltage Vis applied to nodes and may be a constant value that is estimated to minimize output common mode shift. Alternatively, a separate feedback loop may be used to measure shift in output common mode value in response to application of a sense-pulse and adjust Vin a fashion to drive this shift, over time, towards zero. When Vis generated using a feedback loop the feedback loop may include a switched capacitor integrator that integrates the difference in opamp output common mode voltage between before and after application of the sense pulse. Switched capacitor integrator design is well known by those skilled in the art. Injecting a feedforward charge through capacitors to output nodes , reduces output common-mode swing of opamp  and allows larger sense voltages to be used.","A further advantage of the invention is that during Phi substantially equal charges are applied to sense capacitors For the substantially parallel-plate sense capacitors used in the position sense interface, attractive force between the plates is approximately proportional to charge squared, with fringing fields and parasitic capacitance causing a slight deviation. Thus, substantially equal amounts of force are applied to both capacitors over their full range of motion, thereby greatly attenuating the effects of spring softening, electrostatic pull-in or snap-in, and nonlinear electrostatic effects inherent with constant voltage prior-art solutions.","Another advantage of the invention is that thermal noise caused by structure resistance is amplified less than prior-art position measurement interfaces. The improved noise performance arises from including the sense capacitors in the feedback loop. Prior-art interfaces amplified thermal noise by a factor dependent on the amount of parasitic capacitance","Due to manufacturing imperfections there will be a certain amount of mismatch between sense capacitors, as well as between reference capacitors. Mismatch may result in an undesired offset. Scale factor will also vary due to mismatch and variations between sense capacitors and reference capacitors. Both offset and scale factor may be trimmed using two binary weighted capacitor arrays, such as that described in (M. Lemkin, B. E. Boser, \u201cA three-axis micromachined accelerometer with a CMOS position-sense interface and digital offset-trim electronics,\u201d , April, 1999, pp 456-468), one array in parallel with each reference capacitor. Alternatively, if a large scale-factor trim range is necessary, the reference capacitors may be replaced by a pair of binary weighted capacitor arrays.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00050","num":"00050"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["199","199","190","188","187","186","184","185","182","183","180","191","181","181","180","198","187","180","198","195","196","197","195","196","198","180"],"i":["a,b, ","a,b ","a,b, ","a,b ","a,b.

Opamp  may be similar to opamp  described in the first embodiment, and includes an ISODCMFB circuit. Offset cancellation may be maintained by including the switches and However, if offset cancellation is undesired, or will be performed at a later stage, switches may be replaced by a wire and may be removed. Position sense interface  operates over two recurring, discrete, nonoverlapping time periods Phi (\u03a6) and Phi (\u03a6) Typical period frequencies are between 1 kHz and 10 MHz. During Phi, switches are closed, placing opamp  into differential unity-gain feedback and setting the differential voltage at opamp input terminals to a value substantially equal to the opamp offset plus a random component due to flicker and other noise. Since switches are closed, the output common mode voltage is equal to the input common mode voltage, which is driven substantially equal to reference voltage V. Switches are also closed (and are open) during Phi, connecting node to a reference voltage V. Note that while the input nodes have a small voltage difference due to opamp noise and offset, output terminals are forced equal. Reference voltage Vmay be, but is not necessarily, equal to V. If Vis chosen equal to V, however, only a very small error voltage component is presented across sense capacitors during Phi; thus, undesired electrostatic attraction is minimized. By closing switch , reference capacitors are initialized so that they may inject a controlled amount of charge during Phi.","During Phi Vis disconnected from the sense capacitors by opening switches and opamp  is removed from unity-gain feedback and placed into charge-integration mode by opening switches and closing switches respectively. A sense-charge pulse equal to C*Vis generated by opening switch  and closing switch , where sense voltage Vis a constant voltage typically between 0.1 and 5 Volts. Differential feedback and ISODCMFB through capacitors drive input nodes towards V, integrating sense-charge onto the sense capacitors. The output is taken as the voltage difference between output nodes Since this embodiment does not utilize feedback coupling capacitors, this embodiment typically benefits from faster settling, compared to the first embodiment. However, this embodiment does not provide for feedforward charge cancellation, and thus is limited to smaller sense-pulse voltages.","A third embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . Position sense interface  operates in the continuous-time, or frequency multiplexed, domain. Opamp  may be similar to opamp  described in the first embodiment, and includes an ISODCMFB circuit. A modulation signal, which may be a sinusoid or a square wave for example, is applied to input terminal . Typical frequencies are between 1 kHz and 10 MHz with a magnitude from 0.1 to 5V. Resistors are large valued and set the low-frequency voltage at the input terminals while minimally affecting the response of the position-sense interface at frequencies close to the modulation frequency. Resistors may be formed by a MOS transistor operating in subthreshold regime, for example. Likewise, resistors set the low-frequency voltage at the output terminals The position-sense signal is reconstructed by demodulating the differential output voltage from output terminals via a demodulator such as a synchronous demodulator synchronized to the voltage at node . To minimize an undesirably large output common mode shift at opamp output terminals a modulated feedforward charge is applied to the output terminals via feedforward capacitors Modulated voltage V, is applied to nodes and may have a constant amplitude and phase relation to the voltage at node , the amplitude and phase estimated to minimize output common mode shift. Alternatively, a separate feedback loop may be used to measure shift in output common mode value in response to modulation signal applied to node  and adjust the amplitude of modulation voltage Vin a fashion to drive this shift, over time, towards zero. When Vis generated using a feedback loop the feedback loop may include a synchronous demodulator with a continuous time integrator configured in a manner such that the difference in opamp output common-mode voltage in response to changes in the amplitude of the voltage at node  is first correlated with the modulation signal and then integrated over time.","A fourth embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . Position sense interface  operates in the continuous-time domain. Opamp  may be similar to opamp  described in the first embodiment, and includes an ISODCMFB circuit. A modulation signal, which may be a sinusoid or a square wave for example, is applied to input terminal . Typical frequencies are between 1 kHz and 10 MHz with a magnitude from 0.1 to 5V. Resistors are large valued and set the low-frequency voltage at the input terminals while minimally affecting the response of the position-sense interface at frequencies close to the modulation frequency. The position-sense signal is reconstructed by demodulating the differential output voltage from output terminals via a demodulator such as a synchronous demodulator synchronized to the voltage at node .","The present invention further provides for application of a force quasi-constant over displacement, but with a controlled variation over time. In the context of the present invention, electrostatic forces acting on plates of sense capacitors are substantially independent of proof mass position. During position-sensing, nominally equal forces are applied to the proof-mass or proof-masses due to equal amounts of charge provided by reference capacitors. However, by intentionally applying unequal charges to two sense capacitors a net force may be generated. Unequal charges may be produced, for example, by applying different sense voltages to two equal reference capacitors. Advantages of using the position sense interface in a forcing capacity include: elimination of the snap-in voltage\/displacement limitation of voltage-based forcing, and attenuation of spring softening nonlinearities that may cause undesired dynamic response. Note that while the forces are substantially independent of displacement, the forces are approximately dependent on the square of the sense-charge pulse and hence the voltage applied to the reference capacitors. If a linear voltage to force relationship is desired, a square-root function may be used to substantially cancel the square charge dependence. Square-root circuits are well known by those skilled in the art and may include in their implementation a translinear loop or a MOSFET.","Note that the present invention includes many alternate configurations. For example, feedforward capacitors may be switched into a capacitively-coupled output temporarily, for enough time to transfer a majority of the feedforward charge to the output nodes, and then disconnected from the sensing circuit. In this manner feedback-loop settling characteristics are improved because the capacitive loading due to the feedforward capacitors is removed after the feedforward capacitors have applied the feedforward charge. Alternatively, feedforward capacitors may be replaced by a voltage source which is temporarily switched to the output nodes, and then disconnected from the sensing circuit.","The invention may be co-fabricated with integrated circuitry on a single chip using many fabrication methods including, but not limited to: surface micromachining, reactive ion etching, SOI-based micromachining, epi-polysilicon micromachining, or similar fabrication methods or technologies.
