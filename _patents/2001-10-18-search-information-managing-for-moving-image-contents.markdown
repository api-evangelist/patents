title: Search information managing for moving image contents
abstract: A search information analyzing unit () separates search information () into structured search information () representing a structure of moving image contents, semantic search information () representing characteristics in semantic context of the moving image contents, and signal search information () representing physical characteristics of signals of the moving image contents, and outputs the results. A structural search information disassembling unit () extracts and outputs, from the applied structural search information, information corresponding to at least one of the semantic search information and signal search information as structural information (). A unit search information forming unit () adds, to at least one of the applied semantic search information and signal search information, to form a small unit of search information (A, A). Such a small unit of search information can be used as search information for the moving image contents, and hence, the amount of search information can be reduced.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION","First Embodiment","Second Embodiment","Third Embodiment"],"p":["The present invention relates to apparatus and method for managing information having a tree structure (hereinafter referred to as search information) for searching for moving image contents, and to a search apparatus executing a search process. More specifically, the present invention relates to search information managing apparatus and method enabling efficient storage or transmission of search information, as well as to a search apparatus executing a search process using the search information.","For moving image contents, every time point or every spatial point (image plane) of the moving image contents can be an object of search. Therefore, in order to execute an exact search, it is necessary to playback the moving image contents as a whole and to check in detail. Such a method of searching, however, is not at all efficient, and when the number of moving image contents as the target of search increases, the method would be even less practical.","Various methods have been proposed as methods enabling a user to quickly and efficiently search for desired moving image contents or a desired portion of the moving image contents, in which search information (which search information is also referred to as metadata for search) to be. added to corresponding moving image contents is prepared, a search is executed based on the search information, and the desired moving image contents or the desired portion of the moving image contents is obtained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"As can be seen from , the entire moving image is divided, along time, into a number of scenes. Here, the term scene refers to a section mainly of a semantic unity along the time axis, and scenes may include large sections such as part  and part  of a movie as well as a very small section such as a scene of \u201cA and B fighting against each other.\u201d Therefore, the actual division of the entire moving image into scenes is not limited to one stage division such as shown in , but rather proceeds gradually over a plurality of stages.","One scene is further divided into a number of shots (or into smaller scenes) along the time axis. Here, the term shot refers to one section along time consisting of continuous frame images picked-up by one operation, and in the moving images, it refers to a section between two editing points (cut points).","A shot is a kind of a scene, and the shot may further be divided into smaller shots (sub-shots). Though not shown, the shot can eventually be divided into one-by-one frame images.","In this manner, the moving image contents has a hierarchical structure divided from the entire body to small portions and further to smaller portions. Corresponding search information is added to each level of the hierarchy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10","FIG. 11"]},"The structural search information refers to information representing the hierarchical structure of the moving image contents shown in . The structural search information includes structuring information for representing the tree structure, that is, relation between various scenes or shots of the entire moving images, and structural attribute information representing attribute of each scene or shot resulting from the division.","In the tree of , the root R represents the entire moving images, and each node ND represents each scene or shot obtained by the division. A node ID or level information appended to the root R or to each node ND constitutes the structuring information, and a start time, end time information or the like appended to each scene or shot constitutes the structural attribute information.","The semantic search information refers to search information defined by semantic characteristics of the moving image contents. For example, the title of the entire moving image contents, information of a producer, and information of visual scenic description of a scene constitute the semantic search information.","The signal search information refers to search information defined by physical characteristics of signals of the moving image contents. For example, color frequency information, motion intensity information or the like for each shot (or for a representative frame image thereof) constitutes the signal search information. The semantic search information and signal search information are provided as leaves RF linked to each corresponding node ND.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11","FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},"Though the highest level (root R) is shown as representing one, entire moving image content in , it is not limited to one moving image content, and it may be considered as a set of a plurality of moving image contents. By way of example, the highest level may be video programs as a whole that are broadcast in one day on one channel. The video programs as a whole broadcast in one day on one channel are divided into programs one by one, that is, respective moving image contents, in the next level. Each of the moving image contents is divided into a plurality of scenes, and each scene is divided into a plurality of shots.","By the search information having the tree structure, it becomes possible to present the structure of the moving image contents along time in a form easily understandable by the user, associated with various pieces of search information. Therefore, the search information is well suited for operations such as editing of the corresponding moving image contents by the user with visual confirmation based on the search information, or editing of the search information itself. It is noted, however, that when the size of the moving image contents becomes large, the size of the tree representing the search information also becomes very large.","Assume an execution model in which moving image contents and search information are stored in a server apparatus, a user accesses from a client terminal to the server, obtains the search information and executes a search at the client terminal. Here, a situation is not desirable in which a formidable amount of search information must be fully obtained by the client terminal from the server before the user can start operation of the client terminal to execute a search. Specifically, it is desired that the search information having the tree structure is divided into an appropriate plurality of small units of search information and transmitted to the client terminal, and that the user can execute a search to some extent at the client terminal utilizing the received small units of search information.","By dividing the search information having the tree structure in accordance with sections along time axis into scenes or shots conventionally, it is possible to form small units  to  of search information shown in . The small units of search information  to  can be obtained by dividing the search information into a set of a node ND and its leaves RF starting from each of the lowermost nodes ND of the tree, or a set of nodes ND and their leaves RF including a lowermost node and connected higher levels nodes ND, as shown in .","The small unit of search information obtained by division in accordance with section along time holds the information of time structure of the corresponding moving image contents as it is, and therefore, it can be suitably used for transmission in synchronization with the moving image contents, to enable filtering of the moving image contents on-line, based on the search information.","As disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 8-110912, it is well known to store the search information having the tree structure divided into the tree structure and a table of appended information representing attribute information of each of the nodes ND of the tree structure. According to this approach, there are two divisible units, that is, the tree structure and the table. The appended information table, however, cannot be handled independently, and the above described division along time section is not available.","In the present specification, the above described small unit of search information obtained by the division will be referred to as \u201cunit search information.\u201d Further, node ID information or the like for uniquely identifying a node ND of the structural search information will be referred to as \u201csearch information element\u201d of the structural search information (or structural search information element), action description information or the like of the semantic search information will be referred to as \u201csearch information element\u201d of the semantic search information (or semantic search information element), and each of color frequency information, motion intensity information and the like of the signal search information will be referred to as \u201csearch information element\u201d of the signal search information (or signal search information element).","The small unit of search information conventionally obtained by dividing the search information having the tree structure is unit search information corresponding to the time section, that is, the structural element of the moving image contents such as a scene or a shot.","In such unit search information, however, search information elements of the structural search information, semantic search information and signal search information exist in a complicated manner. There may be, for example, a request that only the structural search information of the moving images is to be known (it is desired to know how the moving images are divided into scenes or shots). Alternatively, there may be a request that only the color frequency information of each shot is desired to conduct a search based on color frequency information shot by shot, or a request that only the motion intensity information is desired to conduct a search based on the motion intensity information shot by shot. Conventionally, a searcher must obtain the unit search information that includes the search information elements of the structural search information, semantic search information and signal search information existing in a complicated manner, and the searcher must analyze and use the obtained information to meet such requests.","It is efficient from the view point of a searcher that search information elements of the same type (type such as the color frequency information or motion intensity information) added to respective shots or respective scenes are obtained collectively for a plurality of shots or a plurality of scenes as the components of the moving images, and that a search can be conducted by comparing and collating the same type of information elements. For example, using the color frequency information among the signal search information elements, a shot can be searched by detecting one that has color frequency information matching to a desire among color frequency information added to the shots.","Though Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 8-110912 contains a hint to handle only the tree structure separate from the search information, it does not suggest handling of other appended information independently, or division and management based on detailed types of search information such as described above.","The search information elements of the structural search information and the signal search information are generally given in fixed formats. In contrast, the search information elements of the semantic search information often include free text data and the like of unfixed length, such as the data of action description.","Therefore, when the search information contains a plurality of search information elements in a complicated manner, it is necessary to analyze each of the structural search information, signal search information and the semantic search information even if only the search information elements of the structural search information and the signal search information of the fixed length are to be drawn out. This imposes a considerable burden on the searcher.","In contrast, when the search information is formed by collecting only the signal search information elements, the search information can be handled easily, for example, by skipping data of a fixed length.","As compared with the manner of search in which the search information is obtained containing the structural search information, semantic search information and signal search information in a complicated manner in accordance with time structure, the manner of search in which the structural search information is obtained to enable understanding of the structure of the moving images as a whole, and the signal search information or the semantic search information is added as needed to proceed with the search is very natural. The conventional method of dividing the search information, however, is not suitable for the latter manner of searching.","The unit of search information conventionally obtained by division of the search information having the tree structure holds the information of time structure of the corresponding moving image contents as it is, and therefore, it is suitable for a manner of search in which the search information is transmitted in parallel with moving image contents, to enable filtering by an on-line search. When a large amount of data of moving image contents must be searched off-line, for example, and a desired shot is to be searched for simply by using specific search information such as the color frequency information added to the entire moving image contents, it has been necessary to read and analyze all the search information, in order to draw out the specific necessary search information. Accordingly, there are many wasteful processes.","For an off-line search, it is natural to obtain only the search information of the same type added to a plurality of moving image components, such as a plurality of shots, and to compare and collate the same to conduct a search. By way of example, a server apparatus may draw out and transmit to a client terminal only the color frequency information added to each of the plurality of shots, among the signal search information elements, the client terminal receives the color frequency information, and the user detects a desired shot based on the received color frequency information and requests the server apparatus only the data of the corresponding shot.","As described above, the manner of division of the search information for moving image contents should be switched in accordance with the manner of search. Conventionally, however, such a consideration has not been made.","An object of the present invention is to provide a search information managing apparatus and a search information managing method that enable efficient use of search information having a tree structure added to moving image contents, as well as to provide a search apparatus that is capable of executing an efficient search process.","According to an aspect of the present invention, the search information managing apparatus includes a separating unit, a structural information extracting unit and a unit search information forming unit, for managing the search information having the tree structure corresponding to the moving image contents divided into small units of search information.","The separating unit separates the search information into structural search information representing the structure of the moving image contents, semantic search information representing characteristics in semantic context of the moving image contents, and signal search information representing physical characteristics of signals of the moving image contents, and outputs the same. The structural information extracting unit disassembles the structural search information output from the separating unit, and from the disassembled structural search information, extracts information that corresponds to at least one of semantic search information and signal search information. The unit search information forming unit forms a small unit of search information by adding to at least one of the semantic search information and signal search information output from the separating unit the corresponding structural information extracted by the structural information extracting unit.","Therefore, a small unit of search information provided by adding to at least one of the semantic search information and signal search information separated from the search information the corresponding structural information extracted by the structural information extracting unit can be used as the search information for the moving image contents, and hence, the amount of search information can be reduced. Accordingly, when a small unit of search information requested by a searcher at the time of searching for moving image contents is to be formed and transmitted to the source of request, the amount of search information to be transmitted can be reduced.","According to another aspect of the present invention, the search information managing apparatus includes a separating unit, a structural information extracting unit and a unit search information forming unit, for managing the search information having the tree structure corresponding to the moving image contents divided into small units of search information.","The separating unit separates and draws out from the search information, one or a plurality of search information elements given by one or a plurality of leaves of the tree structure or given by one or a plurality of sub-trees consisting of an arbitrary set of a node and leaves or nodes of lower levels linked to the node of the tree structure, representing elements of the same type included in the search information. The structural information extracting unit extracts, from the search information, structural information corresponding to the one or a plurality of search information elements drawn out by the separating unit. The unit search information forming unit forms a small unit of search information by arranging the one or a plurality of search information elements drawn out by the separating unit and the corresponding structural information extracted by the structural information extracting unit in accordance with a prescribed format.","Thus, a small unit of search information is formed by arranging the one or a plurality of search information elements drawn out from the original search information and the corresponding structural information in accordance with a prescribed format, and therefore, each of the search information elements included in the small unit of search information can easily be specified. Accordingly, the small unit of search information can easily be used at the time of executing a search for moving image contents.","In the above described search information managing apparatus, one or a plurality of search information elements drawn out by the separating unit may correspond to the signal search information representing physical characteristics of signals of the moving image contents.","As the signal search information representing physical characteristics of signals of the moving image contents is used as the small unit of search information, it becomes possible when, for example, the moving image contents are to be searched using the color frequency information only, to use only the corresponding color frequency information for transmission or search, and thus, an efficient search using only the signal search information can be realized.","In the above described search information managing apparatus, one or a plurality of search information elements drawn out by the separating unit may correspond to the semantic search information representing characteristics in semantic context of the moving image contents.","As the semantic search information representing characteristics in semantic context of the moving image contents is used as the small unit of search information, it becomes possible when, for example, the moving image contents are to be searched using characters of each scene only, to use only the information of corresponding characters for transmission or search. Thus, an efficient search using only the semantic search information can be realized.","In the above described search information managing apparatus, the prescribed format may represent an arrangement of one or a plurality of search information elements drawn out by the separating unit and the corresponding structural information extracted by the structural information extracting unit, in accordance with order of appearance of the one or a plurality of search information elements within the tree structure.","As the one or a plurality of search information elements and the corresponding structural information constituting the small unit of search information are arranged in accordance with the order of appearance in the tree structure, information representing preceding\/succeeding relation of each of the search information elements can be omitted. Accordingly, it becomes possible to reduce the signal amount of a small unit of search.","In the above described search information managing apparatus, the small unit of search information may further be formed in the following manner. Specifically, the structural information extracting unit separates the structural information into shared structural information including type information shared by the one or a plurality of search information elements drawn out by the separating unit or shared position information of the tree structure, and un-shared structural information other than the shared structural information. A small unit of search information may be formed by arranging, in addition to the arrangement of the one or a plurality of search information elements drawn out by the separating unit, the corresponding shared structural information and the corresponding unshared structural information.","Therefore, the type information representing whether the search information element represents color frequency or character information, or the position information representing at which level of the tree structure the search information element is connected, shared by the search information elements of the same type, is added to the arrangement of the one or a plurality of search information elements. Therefore, the type or the corresponding level of the tree structure can easily be known for the search information element included in the small unit of search information.","In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the search information managing apparatus includes, for forming small units of search information from search information having a tree structure corresponding to moving image contents and for managing the same, a record position information extracting unit, a structural information extracting unit and a unit search information forming unit.","The record position information extracting unit extracts, for each of one or a plurality of search information elements given by one or a plurality of leaves of the tree structure or given by one or a plurality of sub-trees consisting of an arbitrary set of a node and leaves or nodes of lower levels linked to the node of the tree structure, representing elements of the same type included in the search information, record position information representing the position where the search information element is recorded. The structural information extracting unit extracts, from the search information, structural information corresponding to the one or a plurality of search information elements. The unit search information forming unit forms a small unit of search information by arranging the record position information extracted by the record position information extracting unit and the structural information extracted by the structural information extracting unit corresponding to each of the one or a plurality of search information elements, in accordance with a prescribed format.","Therefore, the one or a plurality of search information elements represented by the small unit of search information can be specified by the record position information arranged in the small unit of search information, and the search information elements can easily be used at the time of executing a search for the moving image contents. When a small unit of search information is requested for searching for moving image contents and the small unit of search information is transmitted to the source of request, it is possible for the source of request to specify the desired search information element by the record position information in the received small unit of search information without the necessity of transmitting the search information element itself. Further, by transmitting only the desired search information element at every request to the source of request, a highly efficient search becomes possible.","In the above described search information managing apparatus, the one or a plurality of search information elements may correspond to the signal search information representing physical characteristics of the signals on the moving image contents.","As the signal search information representing physical characteristics of signals of the moving image contents is used as the search information element corresponding to the record position information, it becomes possible when, for example, a search is conducted using the color frequency information only, to use only the corresponding color frequency information for transmission or search, and thus, an efficient search using only the signal search information can be realized.","In the above described search information managing apparatus, the one or a plurality of search information elements may correspond to the semantic search information representing characteristics in semantic context of the moving image contents. As the semantic search information representing characteristics in semantic context of the moving image contents can be used as the search information element corresponding to the record position information, it becomes possible when, for example, a search is conducted using characters of each scene only, to use only the information of corresponding characters for transmission or search. Thus, an efficient search using only the semantic search information can be realized.","In the above described search information managing apparatus, the prescribed format may represent an arrangement of respective record position information in accordance with the order of appearance in the tree structure of respective ones of the corresponding one or a plurality of search information elements.","Therefore, in the small unit of search information, information representing preceding\/succeeding relation of each of the corresponding search information elements can be omitted. Accordingly, it becomes possible to reduce amount of information of the small unit of search information.","In the above described search information managing apparatus, the structural information extracting unit further separates the structural information into shared structural information and un-shared structural information other than the shared structural information. The shared structural information includes information representing type shared by the one or a plurality of search information elements, or shared position information in the tree structure.","A small unit of search information may be formed by arranging, in addition to the arrangement of the record position information corresponding to the one or a plurality of search information elements, the corresponding shared structural information and the corresponding unshared structural information, respectively.","Therefore, the type information representing whether the search information element represents color frequency or character information, or the position information representing at which level of the tree structure the search information element is connected, shared by the search information elements of the same type, is arranged added to the arrangement of the record position information. Therefore, the type or the corresponding level of the tree structure can easily be known for the search information element represented by the record position information included in the small unit of search information.","In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the search information managing apparatus includes, for managing the search information having a tree structure corresponding to moving image contents divided into small units of search information, first and second search information dividing units and a division selecting unit.","The first search information dividing unit divides the search information into structural search information representing the structure of the moving image contents, semantic search information representing characteristics in semantic context of the moving image contents, and signal search information representing physical characteristics of signals of the moving image contents, extracts, from the structural search information obtained by the division, information corresponding to the semantic search information and the signal search information, respectively, and forms small units of search information by adding the extracted structural information to the semantic search information and the signal search information obtained by the division, respectively.","The second search information dividing unit divides the search information along time section based on the tree structure, and forms, from divided search information, small units of search information.","The division selecting unit selects whether the search information is to be divided by the first search information dividing unit or the second search information dividing unit, in accordance with the desired manner of search.","Therefore, when the search information having the tree structure corresponding to the moving image contents is to be divided into small units of search information and managed, it is possible to selectively form, in accordance with the desired manner of search, a small unit of search information in accordance with one format or a small unit of search in accordance with the other format. The one format is associated with the type of the search information. Specifically, according to this format, the search information is divided into structural search information, semantic search information and signal search information, from the structural search information obtained by the division, information corresponding to the semantic search information and the signal search information are extracted respectively, and the extracted structural information is added to the semantic search information and the signal search information respectively. In the other format, the search information is divided along time section, and the unit information consists of the thus divided search information. As it is possible to select whether the small unit of search information is to be formed in accordance with the one format or the other format, the optimal small unit of search information can be selected dependent on the manner of search, such as an on-line search or an off-line search. Thus, a highly efficient search is realized.","According to a still further aspect of the present invention, the search information managing apparatus includes, for managing the search information having the tree structure corresponding to moving image contents divided into a small units of search information, first and second search information forming units and a selecting unit.","The first search information forming unit separates and draws out, from the search information, one or a plurality of search information elements given by one or a plurality of leaves of the tree structure or given by one or a plurality of sub-trees consisting of an arbitrary set of a node and leaves or nodes of lower levels linked to the node of the tree structure, representing elements of the same type included in the search information, extracts, from the search information, structural information corresponding to the drawn out one or a plurality of search information elements, and forms a small unit of search information by arranging the one or a plurality of search information elements and the extracted corresponding structural information in a prescribed format.","The second search information forming unit divides the search information along time section based on the tree structure, and forms, from the divided search information, small units of search information.","The selecting unit selects whether the small unit of search information is to be formed by the first search information forming unit or the second search information forming unit, in accordance with the desired manner of search.","Therefore, when the search information having the tree structure corresponding to the moving image contents is to be divided into small units of search information and managed, it is possible to form, in accordance with the desired manner of search, a small unit in accordance with one format or the other format.

In other words, the present embodiment may be applied with the portion of the search information that corresponds to the \u201cpartial tree\u201d of the tree structure representing the search information considered as the search information element.","In the search information managing apparatus  and the search information managing method in accordance with the present embodiment, all the search information elements (, ) included in the search information  having the tree structure are drawn out in the similar manner, all the units of search information (A, A) corresponding to the drawn out search information elements respectively are formed in parallel, and all the thus formed units of search information are managed for transmission, for storage or for a search. It is also possible, however, to draw out only the search information elements of a specific type and form only a unit of search information corresponding to the drawn out specific type of search information element.","By way of example, only the color frequency information may be drawn out among the search information elements, and only the unit search information corresponding to the drawn out color frequency information may be formed and managed by unit search information control unit . In that case, search information analyzing unit , structural search information disassembling unit , signal unit search information forming unit  and unit search information control unit  only function. Therefore, semantic unit search information forming unit  may be omitted.","The same applies to search apparatus  in accordance with the present embodiment. When a search is executed based particularly on the color frequency information among the signal search information, and the semantic search information is deemed unnecessary, only the search executing unit , signal unit search information holding unit  and search information control unit  of search apparatus  shown in  function. Therefore, semantic unit search information holding unit  may be omitted.","When part of the semantic search information elements  or signal search information elements  is drawn out and corresponding unit search information (A or A) is formed using the drawn out part of the search information elements ( or ), the remaining search information  from which the search information elements ( or ) are drawn out may be utilized while maintaining the tree structure.","Specifically, here, the tree representing the original search information  is divided into a partial tree as a part of the original tree and one or a plurality of units of search information A consisting of a plurality of semantic search information elements  or one or a plurality of units of search information A consisting of a plurality of signal search information elements . In the present invention, dependent on which search information element is selected to be drawn out, original search information  having the tree structure can be divided in various shapes.","In the present embodiment, structural information of the search information, that is, position information of a node ND or a leaf RF in the tree structure, and type information of the search information element, that is, information representing that the element is action description information (semantic search information element ) or color frequency information (signal search information element ) are described as independent pieces of information. When the search information elements forming the search information are determined in advance and the tree structure is fixed, the position of each search information element in the tree structure can be specified, and therefore, the type of the search information element can be represented simply by the structural information. In other words, the structural information and the type information are equivalent. Here, the process of adding type information as shared information B and B corresponding to search information elements  and  described with reference to the present embodiment, for example, can be realized by adding the corresponding shared structural information.","In the first embodiment, various search information elements, that is, structural search information element , semantic search information element  and signal search information element  are separated and drawn out from search information  having a tree structure, structural information  is extracted from the drawn out structural search information element , and by arranging the semantic search information elements  of the same type themselves or the signal search information elements  of the same type themselves together with the extracted structural information  in order, semantic unit search information A or signal unit search information A is formed.","In contrast, in the present embodiment, where semantic search information element  and signal search information element  are separated in advance from the search information  and recorded independently, not the semantic search information element  and signal search information element  themselves but information representing record positions of these is obtained, and the obtained record position information is arranged in order together with the structural information, to form semantic unit search information E and signal unit search information E.","By this configuration, similar effects as the first embodiment can be obtained. In the following, a search information managing apparatus A and a search apparatus A in accordance with the present embodiment will be described, focusing on the difference from the corresponding elements of the first embodiment. Therefore, details of the present embodiment are not described here, and detailed descriptions related to the search information managing apparatus  and method as well as to the search apparatus  in accordance with the first embodiment are similarly applicable.","The schematic configuration of the search information managing apparatus A in accordance with the present embodiment is shown, similar to the first embodiment, in . The function of search information managing apparatus A is slightly different from that of the first embodiment, as will be described below.","Referring to , search information managing apparatus A includes search information analyzing unit A, structural search information disassembling unit , semantic unit search information forming unit A, signal unit search information forming unit A and unit search information control unit A. Search information analyzing unit A analyzes search information  having the tree structure corresponding to moving image contents, outputs structural search information element  included in search information  to structural search information disassembling unit , specifies semantic search information element  and signal search information element , respectively, and extracts, for respective ones of the specified search information elements  and , record position information D and D. Record position information D and D represent record positions where corresponding semantic search information element  and signal search information element  are recorded, respectively. Thereafter, together with information necessary to form units of search information E and E, for example, information of the types of search information elements and level information of the tree structure, the record position information D and D of search information elements  and  respectively are output to corresponding semantic unit search information forming unit A and signal unit search information forming unit A, respectively.","Record position information D and D may include but not limited to physical position information such as a sector position of a recording medium or a bit position in a bit sequence on which the search information  is recorded in advance, or logical information such as a file name containing the data, a channel for data transmission or a packet.","Semantic search information element  and signal search information element  indicated by record position information D and D are independently read and utilized as needed at a time of a search for moving image contents, for example. Therefore, it may be convenient that the semantic search information element  and the signal search information element  are separated in advance and recorded independently. In many practical servers, structural search information element , semantic search information element  and signal search information element  of search information  having the tree structure are separated and recorded in some way or other. Therefore, record position of such divided semantic search information element  and signal search information element  can directly be utilized as record position information D and D.","When the search information  having the tree structure is recorded as it is and not separated in advance into search information elements ,  and , search information analyzing unit A separates search information elements ,  and , records search information elements  and , and generates record position information D and D thereof.","Structural search information disassembling unit  receives as an input the structural search information element  from search information analyzing unit A, draws out minimum necessary structural information  from the input search information element , and applies the same to semantic unit search information forming unit A and signal unit search information forming unit A.","Semantic unit search information forming unit A receives as inputs the minimum necessary structural information  from structural search information disassembling unit  and record position information D of each of semantic search information elements  of the same type from search information analyzing unit A, and arranges the input information type by type of the semantic search information elements , while maintaining the relation of appearance order in the tree structure of the corresponding semantic search information elements, to form the unit search information E of the semantic search information consisting of the record position information D of the semantic search information elements .","Signal unit search information forming unit A receives as inputs the minimum necessary structural information  from structural search information disassembling unit  and record position information D of each of signal search information elements  of the same type from search information analyzing unit A, and arranges the input information type by type of the signal search information elements , while maintaining the relation of appearance order in the tree structure of the corresponding signal search information elements, to form the unit search information E of the signal search information consisting of the record position information D of the signal search information elements .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0192","num":"0191"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A to 8D","FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIGS. 8C and 8D"],"b":["153","154","153","154"]},"As is apparent from the comparison between , A to C and A to C, the unit search information (E and E) formed in accordance with the present embodiment is the same as the unit search information (A and A) formed in accordance with the first embodiment, except that the elements forming the unit search information are changed from the search information elements (,) themselves to record position information (D, D).","Therefore, the types, method of extraction and the like of the shared information to be handled similar to those described in the first embodiment are also applied to the present embodiment. Thus, effects similar to those obtained by the first embodiment are also obtained in the present embodiment.","Unit search information control unit A is connected to a processing unit , and, by way of example, when processing unit  is a transmitting unit, corresponding unit search information is transmitted, in response to a request from a destination of transmission. Unit search information control unit A in accordance with the present embodiment receives a request based on record position information D or D of the semantic or signal search information element  or  included in already transmitted unit search information, draws out the semantic or signal search information element  or  that is indicated by the record position information D or D corresponding to the request, and transmits the same to the source of request.","Though not described in the present embodiment, for various pieces of structural information  drawn out from structural search information element  to be used, not the data themselves of structural information  but information representing record position may be extracted similar to that for the above described semantic search information element  and signal search information element , and the unit search information may be formed using the extracted record position information.","In this case, from the record position information of structural information  and the record position information D of semantic search information element , a semantic unit search information is formed, and from the record position information of structural information  and the record position information D of the signal search information element , a signal unit search information is formed.","The schematic configuration of the search apparatus A in accordance with the present embodiment is shown, similar to the first embodiment, in . The function of search apparatus A is slightly different from that of the first embodiment, as will be described below.","Search apparatus A in accordance with the present embodiment includes a search executing unit A, a semantic unit search information holding unit A, a signal unit search information holding unit A, and a search information control unit A. Semantic unit search information holding unit A and signal unit search information holding unit A hold units of search information E and E, respectively, and in addition they have the function of temporarily holding for every one search execution or continuously holding for a period while searches are executed, each of search information elements  and  obtained based on respective record position information D and D included in the already obtained units of search information E and E, respectively.","Search executing unit A selects one or an arbitrary combination of a plurality of various search information elements held in semantic unit search information holding unit A and signal unit search information holding unit A, obtains search information elements in accordance with the selected combination, and executes a search for the moving image contents using the obtained one or more search information elements.","When the search information elements are held only temporarily in unit search information holding units A and A, that is, when the elements are discarded at every execution of a search, search executing unit A starts a search not from a request for search information elements but from a request for unit search information to unit search information holding units A and A, as will be described in the following. For simplicity of description, here, a search will be described as an example, which starts with a request for semantic unit search information E.","The operation is the same when signal unit search information E is requested or when both semantic unit search information E and signal unit search information E are requested.","When the selected semantic search information element  is not held in the corresponding semantic unit search information holding unit A, search executing unit  A requests corresponding unit search information E from semantic unit search information holding unit A.","When the requested unit search information E can be obtained from corresponding semantic unit search information holding unit A, search executing unit A applies to search information control unit A, the obtained unit search information E together with a request for a search information element. Based on the record position information D included in the applied unit search information E, search information control unit A obtains the corresponding semantic search information element  from the transmitting unit or storing unit , and stores the obtained semantic search information element  in corresponding semantic unit search information holding unit A. Search executing unit A executes a search using semantic search information element  obtained in this manner.","When the requested unit search information E is not held in the corresponding semantic unit search information holding unit A and hence cannot be obtained, search executing unit A first issues a request for the unit search information E to search information control unit A. Receiving the request as an input, search information control unit A obtains the corresponding unit search information E in response to the input request from the transmitting unit or storing unit , and stores the obtained unit search information E in the corresponding semantic unit search information holding unit A. Thereafter, search executing unit A applies, together with a request for a search information element, the obtained unit search information E to search information control unit A. Based on the record position information D included in the applied unit search information E, search information control unit A obtains the corresponding semantic search information element  from the transmitting unit or storing unit , and stores the obtained semantic search information element  in the corresponding unit search information holding unit A. Search executing unit A executes a search for moving. image contents (data of moving image contents prepared by the transmitting unit or storing unit ), using the semantic search information element  obtained in this manner.","As will be understood from the foregoing, search apparatus A in accordance with the present embodiment differs from search apparatus  in accordance with the first embodiment in that, as regards the manner of obtaining the search information, two steps are taken. Namely, the record position information of the search information element is obtained from the unit search information, and from the obtained record position information, the corresponding search information element is obtained. Except for this point, the processes are the same. Therefore, similar effects as obtained in the first embodiment can also be obtained in the present embodiment.","According to the present embodiment that uses unit search information consisting only of the record position information, only a small amount of signals have to be recorded, as compared with the unit search information consisting of various search information elements themselves. Therefore, in such a situation that a searcher conducts a search using a client terminal such as a portable information terminal having a small storage capacity, the search method is effective, in which only the unit search information in accordance with the present embodiment is continuously held in the client terminal and only the necessary search information elements are obtained from a server apparatus (corresponding to the transmitting unit or storing unit  of ) using the unit search information at the time of executing a search. The sever apparatus has data of moving image contents and data of search information  that are separated into search information elements in advance recorded therein, and the server has a function of reading and outputting to the source of request the data of the moving image contents or the data of search information  in response to a request from the outside.","Therefore, it is possible to know, in a simple manner, what search information exists in the server apparatus from the unit search information, and efficiency of executing a search can be improved as only the necessary search information is transmitted.","In the foregoing, the timing at which the unit search information is obtained from the transmitting unit or storing unit  has been described as dependent on the request of the searcher. The description is not limiting, and, by way of example, various units of search information may only be automatically obtained by a client terminal at the start of a search. There is no limit on the timing of obtaining or discarding the unit search information.","In the foregoing, holding time of the search information element obtained based on the record position information in the unit search information has been described as temporal, that is, the element is discarded every time a search is executed, or continuous, that is, the element is held for the period of execution of searches. The description, however, is not limiting, and such a management may be possible in that the element is held for a prescribed time period and discarded if there is no access to the element in the prescribed time period. There is no limit as to the holding time of the search information element.","Though a search is executed based on the formed unit search information in the search apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment, the search information of the original tree structure (part thereof) may be recovered from the obtained unit search information, and based on the search information of the recovered tree structure, a search may be executed, dependent on the manner or search. As each of the units of search information formed by the search information managing apparatus in accordance with the present invention includes the structural information, it is possible to recover the original tree structure by using the structural information (structuring information). Specifically, by finding the position information in the tree structure from the structural information included in the unit search information, obtaining the corresponding search information element indicated by the corresponding record position information in the unit search information, and connecting the same as a leaf RF to the position of the tree structure indicated by the found position information, the tree structure is recovered. The recovery from the unit search information to the tree structure can be used not only for the search but also for transmission of the search information to other person through a narrow network, by dividing the tree into small pieces, transmitting each of the divided pieces to the destination (other person) and recovering the tree at the receiving side (other person) to be managed as the search information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0212","num":"0211"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","1","901","902","903","904","901","15","15","15"]},"When an off-line search is designated and the unit search information associated with the types of search information elements is selected as the method of dividing search information , division selecting unit  instructs first search information dividing unit  to execute division of search information .
