No. 09\/923,134 filed on Aug. 6, 2001, which in turn is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/189,626 filed on Nov. 10, 1998, and which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,323,853. Each of the above-described applications is hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a method, system and computer readable medium for name and address handling (hereinafter called \u201caddress handling\u201d), and more particularly to a touch screen, keyboard button, icon, menu, voice command device, etc. (hereinafter called \u201cbutton\u201d) provided in a computer program, such as word processing program, spreadsheet program, etc., and coupled to an information management source for providing address handling within a document created by the computer program.","2. Discussion of the Background","In recent years, with the advent of programs, such as word processors, spreadsheets, etc. (hereinafter called \u201cword processors\u201d) users may require retrieval of information, such as name and address information, etc., for insertion into a document, such a letter, fax, etc., created with the word processor. Typically, the information is retrieved by the user from an information management source external to the word processor, such as a database program, contact management program, etc., or from the word processor itself, for insertion into the document. Examples of such word processors are WORD\u2122, NOTEPAD\u2122, EXCEL\u2122, WORDPAD\u2122, WORDPERFECT\u2122, QUATROPRO\u2122, AMIPRO\u2122, etc., and examples of such information management sources are ACCESS\u2122, OUTLOOK\u2122, ORACLE\u2122, DBASE\u2122, RBASE\u2122, CARDFILE\u2122, etc.","However, the information in the database must constantly be updated by the user. This requires the user to learn how to use and have access to the database. In this case, a change in the information, such as change in address or a name, etc., requires the user of the word processor to implement this change in the database, or alternatively, the change is made to the database centrally by a database administrator.","Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method, system and computer readable medium for address handling within a computer program.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method, system and computer readable medium for address handling within a computer program, such as a word processing program, spreadsheet program, etc.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method, system and computer readable medium for address handling within a computer program, such as a word processing program, spreadsheet program, etc., using an input device provided in the computer program.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method, system and computer readable medium for address handling within a computer program, such as a word processing program, spreadsheet program, etc., using an input device, such as a touch screen, keyboard button, icon, menu, voice command device, etc., provided in the computer program and coupled to an information management source.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method, system and computer readable medium for address handling within a computer program, such as a word processing program, spreadsheet program, etc., using an input device such as a touch screen, keyboard button icon, menu, voice command device, etc., provided in the computer program and coupled to an information management source, such as a database program, contact management program, etc.","The above and other objects are achieved according to the present invention by providing a novel method, system and computer readable medium for providing a function item, such as a key, button, icon, or menu, tied to a user operation in a computer, whereby a single click on the function item in a window or program on a computer screen, or one single selection in a menu in a program, initiates retrieval of name and addresses and\/or other person or company related information, while the user works simultaneously in another program, e.g., a word processor. The click on the function item initiates a program connected to the button to search a database or file available on or through the computer, containing the person, company or address related data, in order to look up data corresponding to what the user types, or partly typed, e.g., name and\/or address in the word processor, the correct data from the database, data related to the typed data, e.g., the name of the person, company, or the traditional or electronic address, or other person, or company, or address related data, and alternatively the persons, companies, or addresses, are displayed and possibly entered into the word processor, if such related data exists.","The present invention also includes a computer readable medium storing program instructions by which the method of the invention can be performed when the stored program instructions are appropriately loaded into a computer, and a system for implementing the method of the invention.","In an embodiment of the present invention, single button addressing is a achieved by providing an input device, such as a touch screen, keyboard, icon, menu, voice command device, etc. (hereinafter called \u201cbutton\u201d), in a computer program, such as a word processing program, spreadsheet program, etc. (hereinafter called \u201cword processor\u201d), for executing address handling therein.","Accordingly, in a word processor, the button is added and a user types information, such as an addressee's name, or a part of the name, etc. in a document created with the word processor, such as a letter, fax, etc., and then clicks, selects, commands, etc. the button via the appropriate input device, such as a touch screen button, keyboard button, icon, menu choice, voice command device, etc. A program then executes and retrieves the typed information from the document, and searches an information management source, such as a database, file, database program, contact management program, etc. (hereinafter called \u201cdatabase\u201d) to determine if the information, such as the name or part of the name typed and searched by the program exists in the database. If the program does not find stored information, such as a name, corresponding to the name or part of the name typed, the user is asked by the program whether the information, such as the name that was not found, should be added to the database. In addition, the user may enter any other information besides the name, such as addresses, businesses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail address, etc., so that this other information can be stored in the database for later use.","If the program finds name(s) and address(es) corresponding to the part of the addressee's name typed, this additional information is automatically entered into the user's word processor, optionally with a confirmation from the user that this is the correct data. If the typed address information does not correspond to data already stored in the database, after clicking on the button, the program, for example, lets the user decide: (1) if this is new data (e.g., a new address) for an existing contact; (2) if the stored data should be changed to what the user just typed; (3) if this is a new contact with the same name as the one already entered into the database; or (4) if the typed address is only to be used once, and therefore not to be stored in the database at all. If, later, for example, a name with several address stored in the database is recalled all addresses for this contact will be displayed, so that the correct address can be selected by the user.","The program may be extended to also store and retrieve other information, such as telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses, etc. Once the program recalls the telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, etc., the user can command the program to send e-mails, faxes, etc. Similarly, if the user types in the name of a mailing list, the program create merge letters, group emails, etc.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to  thereof, there is illustrated flow charts of single button addressing, according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention.","In , after the user has inserted the address in the word processor, the user commands the button at step  and the program analyzes what the user has typed in the document at step . At step , the program decides what was found in the document and if the program found nothing in the document or what it found was un-interpretable the program goes to step  and outputs an appropriate message to the user and then quits at step . The program analyzes what the user has typed in the document at step , for example, by analyzing (i) paragraph\/line separations\/formatting, etc.; (ii) street, avenue, drive, lane, boulevard, city, state, zip code, country designators and abbreviations, etc.; (iii) Mr., Mrs., Sir, Madam, Jr., Sr. designators and abbreviations, etc.; (iv) Inc., Ltd., P.C., L.L.C, designators and abbreviations, etc.; and (v) a database of common male\/female names, etc.","If the program find an e-mail address mailing list\/category name telephone number or other information, at step  an appropriate action is performed by the program and then the program execution quits at step . If the program only finds a name or initials, or the like, the program looks up the name in the database at step  and at step  the program determines what was found. If the program finds more than one possible contact\/address match, at step  the program displays menu choices to the user to let him choose an appropriate answer. Then at step  the program inserts a correct address and name in the document and then at step  the program quits execution. If the program finds one match exactly, i.e., one contact with one address, the program inserts the correct address and name in the document at step  then quits and then quits execution at step . If the program does not find a name in the database, at step  the program prompts the user to specify an address and then quits execution at step . If the program at step  finds a name and an address, at step  the name is looked up in the database. Then, at step , if no match is found, at step  the program inserts an address and a name which are possibly corrected by the user into the database and then quits execution at step . If at step , the name and address is found, at step  the program either takes no action or displays the data for the user to edit. If at step , the name is found but not the address, the program prompts the user for a decision at step . If the user decides that this is another contact with a same name, the program goes to step . If the user decides that this is a one time occurrence, no action is taken and the program quits at step . If the user decides that the contact has, for example, moved and that this is a new address, at step  one of the old addresses for the contact is replaced with the new one and the program quits at step . If the user decides that this is an additional address for the contact, at step  the additional address is inserted into the database for that contact and execution quits at step .","The flowchart shown in  is similar to the flowchart in , except for some additional steps which will now be discussed. At step , if the program only finds a name or a similar name then the name is looked up in the database at step , then at step  if the program found more than one possible contact\/address match, the program displays choices to the user to let him choose an address at step . Then at step  the user decides whether to insert the selected address into the document. If the user does not decide to select the address into the document the program quits execution at step . If the user decides to insert the selected address into the document the program inserts the address and name into the document at step  and then quits at step .","If the program finds a name and address in the database at step , then at step  the program looks up the name in the database and at step  the program determines what it has found. If the program does not find the name at step , at step  the program prompts the user for a decision and review and whether to insert the contact and address. If the user does not decide to insert the contact address, the program quits at step . If the user decides to insert the contact address, at step  the program inserts the address and name which may be possibly corrected by the user for program in the database then execution quits at step .","If at step  the program finds a name and not an address, then at step  the name is looked up in the database. Then at step  the program decides whether this contact has another address. If the contact does not have another address, at step  the program prompts the user for a decision and review and whether to add the address. If the user does not want to add the address at step , the program quits at step . If the user wants to add the address at step  because this is an additional address for the contact, at step  the address is inserted in the database for the contact and execution quits at step .","At step , if the user decides that this is another contact with the same name, then the program goes to step . If at step  the user decides that this is a one time occurrence, then the program quits at step . If at step , the user decides that the contact has, for example, moved, the program goes to step . If at step , the user decides that this is an additional address for the contact, at step  the program inserts the address in the database for the contact and then quits at step .","Various exemplary screen shots which are generated during execution of the program, according to the present invention, will now be described with reference to  and examples 1-7 as follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["40","42","40","40","44","40"]},"The above example corresponds to steps , , , , ,  and  in the flow charts of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["46","42","46","46","50","52","54","56","58","60"]},"At this point, the user can cancel the operation by commanding the Cancel button , ask the program to store data in the database and return the document by commanding the OK button , or check details before storing data into the database by commanding the Details button .
