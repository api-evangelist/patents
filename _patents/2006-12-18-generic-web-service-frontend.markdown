title: Generic web service frontend
abstract: A publisher uses a toolbox to graphically define web forms, by selecting and configuring components such as buttons, text boxes, menus, etc. Underlying code for the web forms (such as Extensible Markup Language, or XML) is automatically generated. The publisher defines transforms (such as Extensible Stylesheet Markup Language Transforms, or XSLTs) that process the exchange of data between the front end and the backend web service. The transforms and the code underlying the web forms is automatically combined into a frontend to the web service. The web based frontend is published on a user site, such that users can access the backend web service through the frontend.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention pertains generally to web services, and more specifically to automatically creating web service frontends.","The recent availability of new web service tools such as SOAP, WSDL, XML-RPM etc. has enabled rapid development and roll-out of complicated web service functionality. Prior to the availability of such tools, large web service projects such as online backup, central queuing, online product pricing, image storage and retrieval and online searching took long amounts of time, large programming teams and substantial financial investments to develop. As a result of the simplified development enabled by the new tools, more web services are available to end users today.","End users benefit from the greater availability of these web services, as the services themselves provide useful functionality. However, although the available tools allow rapid development of the underlying functionality, they do not provide or automate development of an associated user interface. Therefore, although there is now a greater availability of web services, these services often lack a functional web based frontend. As the publishers of web based services have no tools for easily creating user interfaces, the publishers tend to focus on the web services themselves, and leave the frontend to other developers.","What is needed are methods, computer readable media and computer systems that provide a generic framework that greatly simplifies the task of creating a web based frontend for web services.","Generic web frontend creation tools allow publishers of web services to quickly and easily create web frontends for their backend web based services. A publisher uses a toolbox to graphically define web forms, by selecting and configuring components such as buttons, text boxes, menus, etc. Underlying code for the web forms (such as Extensible Markup Language, or XML) is automatically generated. The publisher defines transforms (such as Extensible Stylesheet Markup Language Transforms, or XSLTs) that process the exchange of data between the front end and the backend web service. The transforms and the code underlying the web forms is automatically combined into a frontend to the web service. The web based frontend is published on a user site, such that users can access the backend web service through the frontend.","The features and advantages described in this summary and in the following detailed description are not all-inclusive, and particularly, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims hereof. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter, resort to the claims being necessary to determine such inventive subject matter.","The Figures depict embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","103"]},"Various embodiments of the present invention allow publishers  of web services  to quickly create web frontends  for their backend web based services . As illustrated in , a publisher  uses a toolbox  to define web based forms . The publisher graphically selects and configures fields  of the various forms  that make up a desired web based frontend . For example, the publisher  can select desired user interface fields  from the toolbox , such as buttons, text fields, text entry prompts, checkboxes, grids, file upload selectors, etc. The publisher  can also manipulate the sizes and positions of the fields , and otherwise affect their appearance and behavior by assigning\/selecting features such as color, default value, maximum length, ID, etc. The publisher  can also use the toolbox  to specify web form\/page  behavior. Underlying code  (e.g., XML) is generated to instantiate a web form  as defined by the publisher . The underlying code  interfaces with the publisher  defined transforms  described below.","Once a web form  is defined, the publisher  typically creates a transform  (e.g., an Extensible Stylesheet Markup Language Transform, or XSLT) to process the form data (e.g., the data entered by a user accessing the web form ). This typically involves mapping the input data to parameters taken by a function call to the backend web service . Generally, the publisher provides an XSLT  that can also detect the input of bad data (e.g., a number out of range, or alphabetic input when a number is expected) and output an appropriate error message to the user of the web form . The publisher  also provides an XSL transform  to process the return value from the backend function, typically using it in the next web page\/form  of the frontend . The publisher  repeats this process of defining web forms\/pages  and associated transforms  until the desired functionality of the web based frontend  has been implemented. Once a publisher has configured a web based frontend  by defining web forms  and transforms , the transforms  and the generated code  underlying the web forms  are combined into a web based frontend .","In some embodiments of the present invention, in order to define a web based frontend , a publisher  logs onto an account on a web server  which provides the above-described frontend  creation functionality. It is to be understood that the web server  is to be one capable of executing custom programs, such as Apache or Microsoft's Internet Information Server. The web server  could also be implemented as a custom server .  illustrates the frontend  creation functionality residing on the same, single web server  as the backend web service . Of course, in other embodiments, the frontend  creation functionality and\/or the backend web service  can be distributed between multiple web servers  as desired.","It is to be further understood that the backend web service  in question is to be one with a well defined Application Programming Interface (API), so that transforms  can be easily created that map input data to function calls to the backend . For example, web services that use WSDL, SOAP, or XML-RPC (e.g., Amazon and Google web services) have well defined APIs.","As illustrated in , once a frontend  has been created, the frontend  can be published on a user accessible web site . The publisher  can choose or be assigned a name  of the site , and is also provided with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)  pointing thereto. Third party users  can then access the web service  via the frontend  by visiting the site  on which it is published. When the user  visits the web site , the user  is presented with the publisher  defined default page  of the frontend . When a user  operates the frontend , the user enters the requested data  into the web forms  of the frontend , clicks specific links, or takes other actions the publisher  defined. The associated publisher  defined transforms  of the frontend  map the user input  to the input parameters  of the appropriate web service functions . The called functions  run with the corresponding input parameters , and other transforms  processes the return values . The user  continues to be presented with dynamically generated web pages , based on publisher  settings. In this way, the user  can access the various features of the backend web service  via the published frontend .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["101","103","123","201","101","103","123","201"]},"To clarify the operation of an embodiment of the present invention, the creation of a frontend  to a web service  that prompts a user  for his or her name, and prints out \u201cHello [name]\u201d is described. The publisher  uses the toolbox  to create a web interface with the form  illustrated in . The text field has an ID of \u201cUserName.\u201d","The publisher  sets the page  as the main entry page  for their user site , and adds the XSL transform  of Table 1 to handle the entry of the name data .
