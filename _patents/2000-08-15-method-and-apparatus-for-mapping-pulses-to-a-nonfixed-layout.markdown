Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to impulse radio systems and, more particularly, to a method of applying time-hopping codes for time positioning of pulses in an impulse radio system.","2. Related Art","As the availability of communication bandwidth in the increasingly crowded frequency spectrum is becoming a scarce and valuable commodity, Time Modulated Ultra Wideband (TM-UWB) technology provides an excellent alternative for offering significant communication bandwidth, particularly, for vari ous wireless communications applications. Because TM-UWB communication systems are based on communicating extremely short-duration pulses (e.g., pico-seconds in duration), such systems are also known as impulse radio systems. Impulse radio systems were first described in a series of patents, including U.S. Pat. No. 4,641,317 (issued Feb. 3, 1987), U.S. Pat. No. 4,813,057 (issued Mar. 14, 1989), U.S. Pat. No. 4,979,186 (issued Dec. 18, 1990), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,363,057 (issued Nov. 8, 1994) to Larry W. Fullerton, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,927 (issued Oct. 14, 1997), U.S. Pat. No. 5,687,169 (issued Nov. 11, 1997), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,832,035 (issued Nov. 3, 1998) to Larry W. Fullerton, et al. These patents are incorporated herein by reference.","Multiple access impulse radio systems are radically different from conventional Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems. Unlike such systems, which use continuous sinusoidal waveforms for transmitting information, a conventional impulse radio transmitter emits a low power electromagnetic train of short pulses, which are shaped to approach a Gaussian monocycle. As a result, the impulse radio transmitter uses very little power to generate noise-like communication signals for use in multiple-access communications, radar and positioning applications, among other things. In the multi-access communication applications, the impulse radio systems depend, in part, on processing gain to achieve rejection of unwanted signals. Because of the extremely high achievable processing gains, the impulse radio systems are relatively immune to unwanted signals and interference, which limit the performance of systems that use continuous sinusoidal waveforms. The high processing gains of the impulse radio systems also provide much higher dynamic ranges than those commonly achieved by the processing gains of other known spread-spectrum systems.","Impulse radio communication systems transmit and receive the pulses at precisely controlled time intervals, in accordance with a time-hopping code. As such, the time-hopping code defines a communication channel that can be considered as a unidirectional data path for communicating information at high speed. In order to communicate the information over such channels, typical impulse radio transmitters use position modulation, which is a form of time modulation, to position the pulses in time, based on instantaneous samples of a modulating information signal. The modulating information signal may for example be a multi-state information signal, such as a binary signal. Under this arrangement, a modulator varies relative positions of a plurality of pulses on a pulse-by-pulse basis, in accordance with the modulating information signal and a specific time-hopping code that defines the communication channel.","In applications where the modulating information signal is a binary information signal, each binary state may modulate the time position of more than one pulse to generate a modulated, coded timing signal that comprises a train of identically shaped pulses that represent a single data bit. The impulse transmitter applies the generated pulses to a specified transmission medium, via a coupler, such as an antenna, which electromagnetically radiates the pulses for reception by an impulse radio receiver. The impulse radio receiver typically includes a single direct conversion stage. Using a correlator, the conversion stage coherently converts the received pulses to a baseband signal, based on a priori knowledge of the time-hopping code. Because of the correlation properties of the selected time-hopping codes, the correlator integrates the desired received pulses coherently, while the undesired noise signals are integrated non-coherently such that by comparing the coherent and non-coherent integration results, the impulse receiver can recover the communicated information.","Conventional spread-spectrum code division multiple access (SS-CDMA) techniques accommodate multiple users by permitting them to use the same frequency bandwidth at the same time. Direct sequence CDMA systems employ pseudo-noise (PN) codewords generated at a transmitter to \u201cspread\u201d the bandwidth occupied by transmitted data beyond the minimum required by the data. The conventional SS-CDMA systems employ a family of orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal spreading codes, with a pilot spreading code sequence synchronized to the family of codes. Each user is assigned one of the spreading codes as a spreading function. One such spread-spectrum system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307 entitled SPREAD-SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS by Gilhousen et al.","Unlike spread-spectrum systems, the time-hopping code for impulse radio communications is not necessary for energy spreading, because the monocycle pulses themselves have an inherently wide bandwidth. Instead, the impulse radio systems use the time-hoping codes for channelization, energy smoothing in the frequency domain, and interference suppression. The time-hoping code defines a relative position of each pulse within a group of pulses, or pulse train, such that the combination of pulse positions defines the communications channel. In order to convey information on such communication channel, each state of a multi-state information signal varies a relative pulse position by a predefined time shift such that a modulated, coded timing signal is generated comprising a train of pulses, each with timing corresponding to the combination of the time position coding and the multi-state modulation.","In one conventional binary approach, pulses are time-modulated forward or backward about a nominal position. More specifically, each pulse is time modulated by adjusting its position within a time frame to one of two or more possible times. For example, in order to send a \u201c0\u201d binary bit during the time frame, the pulse may be offset from a nominal position of the time frame by about \u221250 pico-seconds. For a \u201cI\u201d binary state, the pulse may be offset from the nominal position by about +50 pico-seconds. Conventional coders that generate the time-hoping code do so in response to a periodic timing signal that corresponds to the data-rate of the multi-state information signal. The data rate of the impulse radio transmission may for example be a fraction of a periodic timing signal that is used as a time base or time reference.","In practice, decoding errors are minimized using distinctive time-hopping codes with suitable autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties. The cross-correlation between any two time-hopping codes should be low for minimal interference between multiple users in a communications system or between multiple target reflections in radar and positioning applications. At the same time, the autocorrelation property of a time-hoping code should be steeply peaked, with small side-lobes. Maximally peaked time-hopping code autocorrelation yields optimal acquisition and synchronization properties for communications, radar and positioning applications.","Various coding schemes with known correlation characteristics are available. For example, algebraic codes, Quadratic Congruential (QC) codes, Hyperbolic Congruential (HC) codes and optical codes have been suggested in the past for coding in impulse radio systems. Generally, based on known assumptions, the coding schemes guarantee a maximum number of pulse coincidences, i.e., hits, for any defined time frame or time frame shift during which the codes are repeated. For example, HC codes are guaranteed a maximum of two hits for any sub-frame or frame shift.","McCorkle in U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,677 discloses a random number generator for generating a pseudorandom code for use with jittered pulse repetition interval radar systems. The code is generated by a random number generator that possesses certain attributes desirable for a jittered radar. As disclosed, the attributes related to a flat frequency spectrum, a nearly perfect spike for an autocorrelation function, a controllable absolute minimum and maximum interval, long sequences that do not repeat, and a reasonable average pulse rate.","One known coding technique for an impulse radio is disclosed by Barrett in U.S. Pat. No. 5,610,907, entitled \u201cUltrafast Time Hopping CDMA-RF Communications: Code-As-Carrier, Multichannel Operation, High data Rate Operation and Data Rate on Demand.\u201d According to the disclosed techniques, two levels of coding are used: major orthogonal codes are applied to provide multiple channels, and forward error correction (FEC) codes are applied to information data before transmission. The disclosed system relies on dividing time into repetitive super-frames, frames and sub-frames. As disclosed, a super-frame corresponds to a time interval of about 1 millisecond, representing one repetition of a code pattern, where as a frame is defined as a time interval of about 1 microsecond divided according to a code length. A sub-frame corresponds to a short time interval of about 1 nano second during which a pulse is time positioned.","Because of practical limitations associated with arbitrarily positioning of pulses in adjacent frames, each frame may have to be divided into allowable and non-allowable time regions for positioning a pulse. One such limitation is associated with hardware limitation on minimum pulse-to-pulse time for respective positioning of two pulses on adjacent frames arbitrarily. The system disclosed in Barrett uses a fraction of frame time for encoding and designates the remainder as a RESET period. The inventors have found that the presence of the RESET period affects the correlation properties of the codes used in Barrett.","Time-hopping code generation techniques that employ a repeating frame-based time layout, such as those disclosed in Barrett, have an inherent predictability due to the repetitive nature of the frames. Such predictability opens the possibility of undesired signal interception by third parties, and is thus a liability for certain UWB applications, such as secure communications. Accordingly, there exists a need for general coding techniques that are not limited to the frame-based approach.","The method disclosed in McCorkle, while not frame-based, is specifically tailored towards radar applications. In addition, the specific code-generation methodology presented in McCorkle imposes limitations on the resulting codes that may not be acceptable for some applications. Therefore, there exists a need for more general non-frame-based coding techniques to address these limitations.","Finally, the coding techniques in both Barrett and McCorkle are limited to determining the temporal positioning of pulses emitted by UWB transmitters. Non-temporal pulse characteristics, such as pulse amplitude and pulse width, are also important factors in UWB signaling. Consequently, there exists a need for coding techniques that can be used to determine non-temporal pulse characteristics.","Briefly, according to the present invention, a coding method specifies temporal and\/or non-temporal pulse characteristics in accordance with at least one non-fixed layout of characteristic delta value ranges and\/or discrete delta values. Temporal pulse characteristics, for example, include time position. Non-temporal pulse characteristics, for example, include pulse amplitude and pulse width and other known characteristics. A delta code is used for specifying temporal and\/or non-temporal pulse characteristics relative to the non-fixed layouts. In this way, the present invention specifies pulse characteristics relative to one or more non-fixed characteristic value references, for example, a characteristic value of a given pulse. Among others things, the given pulse may be a preceding pulse or a succeeding pulse.","According to some of the more detailed features of the present invention, allowable and non-allowable regions may be defined specifying pulse characteristics, with such regions being defined relative to the one or more non-fixed characteristic value references. Under this arrangement, the delta code may be applied to the allowable and non-allowable regions, which may be relative to one or more definable characteristic values within a layout. The one or more definable characteristic values may be relative to one or more characteristic value references.","Several embodiments are specified which incorporate specific mathematical algorithms to generate delta codes. These embodiments fall into two general categories: pseudorandom delta code generation techniques, and deterministic delta code generation techniques. Within these broad categories, numerous specific techniques are presented. Poisson Codes, Constrained Poisson Codes, and Uniform Delta Codes are exemplary embodiments of the pseudorandom delta code generation technique. The deterministic delta code generation technique incorporates two broad methodologies: sequential deterministic delta code generation, and iterative deterministic delta code generation. Exemplary embodiments of the sequential methodology include Rational Congruential Sequential Delta Codes. Exemplary embodiments of the iterative methodology include Rational Congruential Iterative Delta Codes, and Piece-wise Linear Iterative Delta Codes.","Further features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","A preferred embodiment of the invention is discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention.","I. Overview","In a time-hopping pulse transmission system, a sequence of pulses known as a pulse train is transmitted and received over a period of time. The relative positioning of the pulses in time defines a channel used by the system to transmit information. Time-hopping pulse transmission systems transmit these pulses such that they have the same non-temporal (i.e., non-time dependent) characteristics while varying the precise timing of the pulses per a time-hopping code mapped to frame-based time layout. (Non-temporal characteristics include amplitude, width, and other non-time dependent characteristics of a pulse or series of pulses.)","However, the inherent predictability of frame-based layouts makes such systems vulnerable to undesired signal interception. Although certain non-frame-based coding methods exist, such techniques are not generally applicable to a wide variety of TM-UWB applications. Consequently, it is desirable that generalized non-frame-based coding methods exist that are capable of transmitting pulses having the same or different non-temporal characteristics per non-frame-based temporal and\/or non-temporal pulse characteristic layouts. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of using one or more numerically generated delta codes to specify temporal and non-temporal characteristics of pulses within a pulse train for use in an impulse transmission system. The method (and accompanying system) includes: specifying temporal and\/or non-temporal pulse characteristics in accordance with at least one non-fixed layout of characteristic delta value ranges and\/or discrete delta values; generating at least one delta code using a numerical code generation technique; and mapping code element values to pulse characteristic values in accordance with the defined layout and code mapping approach.","II. Pulse Characteristic Delta Value Layouts","To facilitate mapping of codes to pulse characteristics, layouts of temporal and\/or non-temporal pulse characteristic delta values can be defined. Temporal pulse characteristics may include, e.g., time position. Non-temporal pulse characteristics may include, e.g., pulse amplitude and pulse width (in time). Such layouts of pulse characteristic delta values can be defined in a multitude of ways to accommodate a wide variety of pulse transmission system applications. One way to characterize a delta value layout is by specifying a layout of pulse characteristic delta value ranges relative to some reference with the delta value ranges being restricted by defined beginning and ending values. Another way to characterize a layout requires specifying discrete delta pulse characteristic values relative to some reference with the discreet delta value being defined by a single value, as opposed to a range of values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","104","106","108","108","202","204","206","208","208"],"sub":["k","k\u22121","k\u22121","k","k\u22121","k\u22121","k+1 ","k","k+1 ","k"]},"A. Delta Value Range Layout","One exemplary embodiment involves a pulse characteristic delta value range layout where various pulse characteristic delta values over some range are divided into smaller and smaller components to achieve a desired component resolution in order to facilitate mapping of a code element value to a characteristic delta value that resides within a layout component, which corresponds to some range of delta values. The below described exemplary embodiment performs this pulse characteristic delta value range layout using any of various temporal or non-temporal pulse characteristics. It should be noted that although the below described exemplary embodiments are described using particular exemplary temporal and\/or non-temporal pulse characteristics; other pulse characteristics are equally applicable. For example, an exemplary embodiment may be described in terms of a non-temporal pulse amplitude characteristic. Layouts using other non-temporal pulse characteristics such as, e.g., pulse width, etc., are also possible. The different types of temporal and non-temporal pulse characteristics are described below. However, equivalent embodiments of the invention are also inherently included as a part of this description, as will be recognized by persons having ordinary skill in the relevant art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["302","310","312","302","302","304","304","306","306","308","308"],"sub":["0 ","max "]},"The process of subdividing a delta value range layout into components is now described in detail. In particular,  depicts an exemplary embodiment of pulse characteristic delta value range layout parameters. Specifically, a pulse characteristic delta value range  is shown. As depicted in , two layout parameters, \u0394vand \u0394v, can be specified to define a pulse characteristic delta value range  bounded by a minimum delta value of \u0394vand a maximum delta value of \u0394v. A second layout parameter, N, can be specified to divide the delta value range  into one or more components  of the same size, or of different sizes, with each component  (indexed by the letter-n) having a minimum delta value, \u0394v(n), and a maximum delta value, \u0394v(n), where n=1 to N.","The number and size of components  used in a given layout can be selected for various reasons. For example, the number and size of components  can be tailored to meet, e.g., specific application requirements, to remain within system implementation limits, to achieve one or more of a variety of system characteristics in areas such as, e.g., performance (i.e., bit rate), reliability (i.e., bit error rate), system-simplicity, ease-of-use, inter alia. When different sized components  are employed, minimum and maximum values can be specified for each component  indexed by n, wherein the minimum delta value for a given component, \u0394v(n), equals the maximum delta value of the preceding component, \u0394v(n\u22121), or \u0394v, and the maximum delta value of a given component, \u0394v(n), equals the minimum delta value for the following component, \u0394v(n+1), or \u0394v. When same sized components  are employed, the delta value range is evenly divided such that \u0394v(n)\u2212\u0394v(n) is equal for each component  indexed by n.","An array of layout parameters, N(N), can be specified to subdivide each component  into sub-components  of the same size, or different sizes, with each sub-component  (indexed by m) of the component  (indexed by n) having a minimum delta value, \u0394v(n,m), and a maximum delta value, \u0394v(n,m), where n=1 to Nand m=1 to N(n). As with components , the number and size of sub-components  for a given component  used in a given delta value range layout  can also be tailored to meet, e.g., specific application requirements, to remain within system implementation limits, to achieve one or more of a variety of system characteristics in areas such as, e.g., performance (i.e., bit rate), reliability (i.e., bit error rate), system-simplicity, ease-of-use, etc., and\/or for many other reasons. When different sized sub-components  are employed, minimum and maximum delta values are specified for each sub-component  indexed by m of each component  indexed by n, wherein the minimum delta value for a given sub-component, \u0394v(n,m), equals the maximum delta value of the preceding sub-component, \u0394v(n,m\u22121), or the minimum delta value of the component in which the sub-component resides, \u0394v(n), and the maximum delta value of a given sub-component, \u0394v(n,m), equals the minimum delta value for the following sub-component, \u0394v(n,m+1), or the maximum delta value of the component in which the sub-component resides, \u0394v(n). When same sized sub-components  are employed, components are evenly divided such that \u0394v(n,m)\u2212\u0394v(n,m) is equal for each sub-component  indexed by m of a component  indexed by n or for all components such that all sub-components  of a given component  are of the same size, wherein sub-component sizes may vary from component to component or all sub-components of all components are of the same size depending on the sizes of the components and the numbers of sub-components in the components.","In a manner consistent with the subdivision of components into sub-components, additional multi-dimensional arrays of layout parameters can be used to further subdivide sub-components  into smaller components  (as shown) of the same or different sizes, ad infinitum, until a smallest desirable component resolution is attained, with components at each resolution level having a minimum delta value, \u0394v(n, m, . . . , a), and a maximum delta value, \u0394v(n, m, . . . , a), where n=1 to N, m=1 to N(n), . . . , and a=1 to N(n, m, . . . ). Such further subdivision of sub-components into smaller and smaller components enables systems with finer and finer tuning resolution and thus higher and higher fidelity, increases modulation accuracy, and can be useful for other purposes. As with components  and sub-components , the number and size of these smaller components  can also be tailored, e.g., to meet specific application requirements, to remain within system implementation limits, to achieve one or more of a variety of system characteristics in areas such as performance (i.e., bit rate), reliability (i.e., bit error rate), system-simplicity, ease-of-use, etc., and\/or for many other reasons. When different sizes of these smaller components  are employed, minimum and maximum delta values are specified for each smaller component  (indexed by a), wherein the minimum delta value for a component, \u0394v(n, m, . . . , a), equals the maximum delta value of the preceding component, \u0394v(n, m, . . . , a\u22121), or the minimum delta value of the next higher level component in which the component resides, \u0394v(n, m, . . . ), and the maximum delta value of a given component, \u0394v(n, m, . . . , a), equals the minimum delta value for the following component, \u0394v(n, m, . . . , a+1), or the maximum delta value of the next higher level component in which the component resides, \u0394v(n, m, . . . ). When same sized smaller components  are employed, the next higher level components  are evenly divided such that \u0394v(n, m, . . . , a)\u2212\u0394v(n, m, . . . , a) is equal for each smaller component  indexed by a of a given next higher level component or for all next higher level components such that all components of a given next higher level component are of the same size, wherein component sizes may vary from next higher level component to next higher level component or all components of all higher level components are of the same size depending on the sizes of the next higher level components and the numbers of components in the next higher level components.","At the top of , pulse characteristic delta value range  is depicted that is bounded by endpoints of \u0394v and \u0394v. Beneath this illustration an equivalent delta value range  is shown that has been subdivided into four components  by setting the layout parameter Nto a value of four (4), and the size of each component has been established by setting the minimum and maximum delta values of each component, \u0394v(n) and \u0394v(n), where n=1 to 4. An enlargement of the second component  is then shown where the component has been subdivided into twenty sub-components  by setting the layout parameter N(2) to a value of twenty (20), and the size of each sub-component  has been established by setting the minimum and maximum delta values of the sub-components  within component two , \u0394v(n,m) and \u0394v(n,m), where n=2 and m=1 to 20. As illustrated, there are 20 sub-components  in component , indexed by n=2, and m=1\u221220, labeled \u0394v(2,1) and \u0394v(2,20).","An enlargement of the eighth sub-component  of component two  is then shown where the sub-component  has been subdivided into ten smaller components  by setting the layout parameter N(2,8) to a value of ten (10), and the size of each smaller component  has been established by setting the minimum and maximum delta values of the smaller components within sub-component eight  of component two , \u0394v(n,m,l) and \u0394v(n,m,l), where n=, m=8, and l=1 to 10. As illustrated, there are 10 smaller components  in sub-component , indexed by n=, m=8, and l=1 to 10, labeled \u0394v(2,8,1) and \u0394v(2,8,10).","It is then shown that these smaller components  could be subdivided into x even smaller components (whose size is not shown) using another layout parameter [e.g., N(2,8,5)=x], which can be further subdivided, ad infinitum. Also not shown in , are enlargements of the other components , sub-components , and smaller components , which in an exemplary embodiment could also contain twenty sub-components , ten smaller components , and x even smaller components, respectively.","By subdividing a delta value range layout into levels of smaller and smaller components and by varying or not varying the size of components at different levels, a multitude of different layout permutations can be defined.","It should be noted, however, that although the present exemplary embodiments illustrate various layouts, the invention is not limited to the illustrative examples, and other layouts including, e.g., infinite combinations of similar and different sized components, could also be used within the scope of the present invention. It should also be noted that the pulse characteristics could include any of various temporal, non-temporal, or both temporal and non-temporal characteristics, as will also be recognized by persons skilled in the relevant arts.","B.

Non-Allowable Regions within Delta Value Range Layouts","The present invention permits the establishment of allowable and non-allowable regions within a delta value range layout.

Code Mapping Approaches","A multitude of exemplary delta code mapping embodiments can be employed in conjunction with pulse characteristic delta value layouts to accommodate pulse transmission system implementation requirements and to optimize system performance for specific applications.","In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, a code element within a delta code may be mapped relative to a characteristic value of any pulse within a pulse train including the immediately preceding pulse, any preceding pulse, the immediately succeeding pulse, or any succeeding pulse. In another embodiment of the invention a code element within a delta code may be mapped relative to some statistical quantity based on characteristic values of a subset of pulses within a pulse train (e.g., an average characteristic value).","According to the present invention, delta codes may be mapped relative to one or more reference values, a reference value may change with each code element, and reference values may change after some number of code elements (e.g., every third code element). and depict examples of temporal and non-temporal delta coding where a single code element exists per reference value.

The use of a consistent numbering scheme can allow mapping of code element values to delta values within the layout.

Deterministic Generation of Delta Codes","Several options exist for generating delta codes deterministically. Properties of the resulting delta codes are of course dependent on the deterministic methods used to construct the delays. The current invention utilizes two broad methodologies for the deterministic generation of delta codes: sequential generation and iterated generation.","1. Sequential Generation Methodology","The sequential generation methodology works by directly specifying a sequence of delay values for the delta code. To be specific, let S be some set of states, and let N be a positive integer. Let \u0192 be a mapping from {1, 2, . . . , N\u22121} into S, and let g:S\u2192[0, \u221e) be a mapping from S into the non-negative reals. The function \u0192 describes how a given sequence is generated, while the function g establishes a correspondence between the sequence values and the delay values to be used in constructing the delta code. Specifically, the difference sequence \u0394C=(\u0394T=T\u2212T, 1\u2266k\u2266N\u22121) is generated according to the relation\n\n\u0394(\u0192()),11\n\n depicts a simplified top-level flow diagram  for sequential generation of delta codes. Specifically, to determine the delta time value to the next pulse, function \u0192  receives as input pulse index k () and produces an output s that is input to function g , which produces an output \u0394T. Typically, though not always, \u0192 will be chosen to provide useful correlation or spectral properties, while g will be chosen to satisfy PRF and other timing constraints.\n","Rational Congruential delta codes are a specific embodiment of this methodology in the current invention. These codes are generated through functions \u0192 of the form\n\n\u0192()=()\n\nwhere N is a positive integer, and r is a rational function defined on Z, the set of integers modulo M. In particular, the following special cases are identified:\n","Hyperbolic Congruential delta codes: \u0192(x;a)=axmod M","Linear Congruential delta codes: \u0192(x;a)=ax mod M","Quadratic Congruential delta codes: \u0192(x;a)=axmod M","Cubic Congruential delta codes: \u0192(x;a)=axmod M","In these formulae, a is a parameter, with possible values 1, 2, . . . , M\u22121. For each possible value of a, the function \u0192 generates a sequence which can then be used to construct a delta code. Thus the parameter a provides for the possibility of families of delta codes, which can be used together to enable a multi-channel communication system. In most cases, the integer M will be prime number, but this is not always necessary. For instance, in the linear congruential case, all that is required is that a and M be relatively prime.","The processing steps for an algorithm to generate rational congruential sequential delta codes are given below.

Iterated Generation Methodology","The iterated methodology utilizes iterated function systems as the mechanism for generating delta codes deterministically. The basic methodology is as follows. Let S be some set of states, and let \u0192:S\u2192S be a mapping from S into itself. The function \u0192 describes how transitions are made from one state to another. Let g:S\u2192[0, \u221e) be a mapping from S into the non-negative real numbers. The function g establishes a correspondence between the states in S and the time delays used to generate the delta code. Given an initial state s\u03b5S, a difference sequence \u0394C=(\u0394T=T\u2212T, 1\u2266k\u2266N\u22121) can now be generated according to the following recursion:\n\n\u0394()\n\n=\u0192()\n\n\u0394()\n\ni=1,2, . . . ,N\u22122\n\n depicts a simplified top-level flow diagram  for this process. Specifically, given an initial state  as input, function \u0192  outputs a new state  which is input back into function \u0192  and is also input into function g , which outputs \u0394T.

Mapping Code Elements to Pulse Characteristic Values","After a delta code has been generated using one of the delta code generation techniques, the code element values can be mapped to specific pulse characteristic values per the defined characteristic layouts and the employed code mapping approach. Pulse characteristic values can at a minimum include pulse position, width, or amplitude.","According to the present invention, temporal and\/or non-temporal characteristics of pulses within a pulse train are specified by generating and applying one or more delta codes relative to one or more non-fixed references. One or more delta value range and\/or discrete delta value layouts may be defined relative to the one or more non-fixed references. Such layouts may include allowable and non-allowable regions.","As described previously, a temporal pulse characteristic corresponds to a pulse position in time and a non-temporal pulse characteristic corresponds to pulse width or pulse amplitude. A non-fixed reference is at least one characteristic value of at least one pulse including any preceding pulse and any succeeding pulse. A non-fixed reference may be a statistical quantity based on the characteristic values of a subset of pulses in the pulse train, e.g., an average pulse characteristic value.","Pulse characteristics may be specified using a pseudorandom delta code such as a Poisson code or a constrained Poisson code, which includes the special case uniform delta code. Alternatively, pulse characteristics may be specified using deterministic delta codes including those generated using a sequential generation methodology, e.g., a rational congruential sequential delta code. In four separate exemplary embodiments of the invention, rational congruential sequential delta codes may employ a hyberbolic congruential, linear congruential, quadratic congruential function, or cubic congruential function. In another exemplary embodiment rational congruential sequential delta codes may employ a function of the form \u0192(x;a)=axmod M.","Deterministic delta codes may also be generated using an iterative generation methodology, e.g., a rational congruential iterative delta code. In four separate exemplary embodiments of the invention rational congruential iterative delta codes may employ a hyberbolic congruential, linear congruential, quadratic congruential function, or cubic congruential function. In another exemplary embodiment rational congruential iterative delta codes may employ a function of the form \u0192(x;a)=axmod M. Furthermore, deterministic iterative delta codes may be generated using the piecewise linear iterative delta code generation methodology.","VI. Exemplary Transceiver Implementation","A. Transmitter","An exemplary embodiment of an impulse radio transmitter  of an impulse radio communication system having one subcarrier channel will now be described with reference to .","The transmitter  comprises a time base  that generates a periodic timing signal . The time base  typically comprises a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), or the like, having a high timing accuracy and low jitter, on the order of picoseconds (ps). The voltage control to adjust the VCO center frequency is set at calibration to the desired center frequency used to define the transmitter's nominal pulse repetition frequency. The periodic timing signal  is supplied to a precision timing generator .","The precision timing generator  supplies synchronizing signals  to the code source  and utilizes the code source output  together with an internally generated subcarrier signal (which is optional) and an information signal  to generate a modulated, coded timing signal .","The code source  comprises a storage device such as a random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), or the like, for storing suitable codes and for outputting the codes as a code signal . Alternatively, maximum length shift registers or other computational means can be used to generate the codes.","An information source  supplies the information signal  to the precision timing generator . The information signal  can be any type of intelligence, including digital bits representing voice, data, imagery, or the like, analog signals, or complex signals.","A pulse generator  uses the modulated, coded timing signal  as a trigger to generate output pulses. The output pulses are sent to a transmit antenna  via a transmission line  coupled thereto. The output pulses are converted into propagating electromagnetic pulses by the transmit antenna . In the present embodiment, the electromagnetic pulses are called the emitted signal, and propagate to an impulse radio receiver , such as shown in , through a propagation medium, such as air, in a radio frequency embodiment. In a preferred embodiment, the emitted signal is wide-band or ultrawide-band, approaching a monocycle pulse  as in . However, the emitted signal can be spectrally modified by filtering of the pulses. This filtering will usually cause each monocycle pulse to have more zero crossings (more cycles) in the time domain. In this case, the impulse radio receiver can use a similar waveform as the template signal in the cross correlator for efficient conversion.","B. Receiver","An exemplary embodiment of an impulse radio receiver  (hereinafter called the receiver) for the impulse radio communication system is now described with reference to . More specifically, the system illustrated in  is for reception of digital data wherein one or more pulses are transmitted for each data bit.","The receiver  comprises a receive antenna  for receiving a propagated impulse radio signal . A received signal  from the receive antenna  is coupled to a cross correlator or sampler  to produce a baseband output . The cross correlator or sampler  includes multiply and integrate functions together with any necessary filters to optimize signal to noise ratio.","The receiver  also includes a precision timing generator , which receives a periodic timing signal  from a receiver time base . This time base  is adjustable and controllable in time, frequency, or phase, as required by the lock loop in order to lock on the received signal . The precision timing generator  provides synchronizing signals  to the code source  and receives a code control signal  from the code source . The precision timing generator  utilizes the periodic timing signal  and code control signal  to produce a coded timing signal . The template generator  is triggered by this coded timing signal  and produces a train of template signal pulses  ideally having waveforms substantially equivalent to each pulse of the received signal . The code for receiving a given signal is the same code utilized by the originating transmitter  to generate the propagated signal . Thus, the timing of the template pulse train  matches the timing of the received signal pulse train , allowing the received signal  to be synchronously sampled in the correlator . The correlator  ideally comprises a multiplier followed by a short term integrator to sum the multiplier product over the pulse interval.","Further examples and details of correlation and sampling processes can be found in commonly owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,641,317, 4,743,906, 4,813,057, and 4,979,186, which are incorporated herein by reference, and commonly owned and co-pending application Ser. No. 09\/356,384, filed Jul. 16, 1999, titled: \u201cBaseband Signal Converter Device for a Wideband Impulse Radio Receiver,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The output of the correlator , also called a baseband signal , is coupled to a subcarrier demodulator , which demodulates the subcarrier information signal from the subcarrier. The purpose of the optional subcarrier process, when used, is to move the information signal away from DC (zero frequency) to improve immunity to low frequency noise and offsets. The output of the subcarrier demodulator  is then filtered or integrated in a pulse summation stage . The pulse summation stage produces an output representative of the sum of a number of pulse signals comprising a single data bit. The output of the pulse summation stage  is then compared with a nominal zero (or reference) signal output in a detector stage  to determine an output signal  representing an estimate of the original information signal .","The baseband signal  is also input to a lowpass filter  (also referred to as lock loop filter ). A control loop comprising the lowpass filter , time base , precision timing generator , template generator , and correlator  is used to generate a filtered error signal . The filtered error signal  provides adjustments to the adjustable time base  to time position the periodic timing signal  in relation to the position of the received signal .","In a transceiver embodiment, substantial economy can be achieved by sharing part or all of several of the functions of the transmitter  and receiver . Some of these include the time base , precision timing generator , code source , antenna , and the like.","VII.
