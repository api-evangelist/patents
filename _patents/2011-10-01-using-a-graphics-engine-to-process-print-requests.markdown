{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","Embodiments generally relate to processing print requests. More particularly, embodiments relate to utilizing a graphics engine to conduct print processing, imaging, and rendering activities.","2. Discussion","A challenge of designing and manufacturing printers may relate to balancing cost and capability. An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that is customized to perform particular print functionalities may be inexpensive, but may also be inflexible. On the other hand, a general purpose processor may be more flexible, but may be more expensive and lower-performing.","Embodiments may involve a computer implemented method including receiving a print request to print a document, initializing a printer execution assembly of a printer, and initiating, by a general purpose processor, a scheduling management application. The method may also provide for receiving, at the scheduling management application, an application programming interface call, directing, by the scheduling management application, an application programming interface call to a graphics engine, and directing a function call for a print imaging application on the application programming interface, the print imaging application including a print imaging application instruction. In addition, the method may include utilizing the graphics engine to process the print imaging application instruction and executing the print request at the printer execution assembly.","Embodiments may include a computer readable storage medium having a set of instructions which, if executed by a processor, cause a computer to receive a print request to print a document, initialize a printer execution assembly of a printer, and initiate, by a general purpose processor, a scheduling management application. The instructions may also cause a computer to receive, at the scheduling management application, an application programming interface call, direct, by the scheduling management application, an application programming interface call to a graphics engine, and direct a function call for a print imaging application on the application programming interface. The print imaging application may include a print imaging application instruction. In addition, the instructions may also cause a computer to utilize a graphics engine to process the print imaging instruction and execute the print request at the printer execution assembly.","In addition, embodiments may include an system having a transceiver to communicate wirelessly via a wireless communication protocol, a printer display interface to display a graphical user interface (GUI), and a printer execution assembly to execute a print request, the print execution assembly including a printer head, a supporting roller, and a document tray. The system may also include a memory device to store an application programming interface, a print imaging application including a print imaging application instruction, and a scheduling management application including a scheduling management application instruction. Also, the system may include a printer processing component including a general purpose processor to process the scheduling management application instruction, and a graphics engine to process the print imaging application instruction.","Moreover, embodiments may include an apparatus having a memory device to store an application programming interface, a print imaging application including a print imaging application instruction, and a scheduling management application including a scheduling management application instruction. The apparatus may also include a printer processing component including a general purpose processor to process the scheduling management application instruction, and a graphics engine to process the print imaging application instruction.","Turning now to , a block diagram of a printer  is shown. The printer  may include any device capable of receiving a print request and executing it. The illustrated printer  includes a printer transceiver , a printer interface , a printer scan assembly , a printer execution assembly , a printer memory , and a printer processing component .","The printer transceiver  may allow the printer  to communicate wirelessly via various wireless communication protocols with other devices, such as WiFi (e.g., IEEE 802.11, 1999 Edition, LAN\/MAN Wireless LANS), Bluetooth (e.g., IEEE 802.15.1-2005, Wireless Personal Area Networks), and WiMax (e.g., IEEE 802.16-2004, LAN\/MAN Broadband Wireless LANS). The printer interface  may include an interface that allows a user to interact with the printer . For example, the printer  may be a display screen displaying a graphical user interface (GUI).","The printer scan assembly  may be an electromechanical apparatus configured to scan documents. The printer scan assembly  may include, among other things, a document sheet support unit  and a scan unit . The document sheet support unit  may support a document during while the scan unit  scans an image of a document.","The printer execution assembly  may be an electromechanical apparatus configured to execute print requests. The printer execution assembly  may include, among other things, a printer head , a supporting roller , and a document tray .","The printer memory  may be a memory device that can be used to store data. For example, as will be discussed in greater detail, printer memory  may be utilized to store various software applications.","The printer processing component  may include at least one computer processor to execute computer-readable executable instructions. As will be discussed in greater detail, the printer processing component  may include a general purpose processor  and a graphics engine .","Turning now to , a block diagram of a printer processing component  including general purpose processor  and graphics engine  is shown. The printer processing component  may perform control and dataplane processing. Control processing may include, for example, main application and memory processing. Dataplane processing may include performance-intensive digital signal processing (DSP) functions, such as pre-video processing, post-video processing, video codec processing, image processing, protocol processing, and baseband signal processing.","The illustrated printer processing component  is coupled to an ASIC , printer memory , and a fixed function hardware element . The ASIC  may be an application-specific integrated circuit that may be customized for a particular task (e.g., image\/video capture and output). The fixed function hardware element  may be a logic component with a fixed functionality (e.g., directed to a particular aspect of a shading functionality). The printer memory  may include any memory device that may be used to store data. For example, a print imaging application , an application programming interface (API) , and a scheduling management application  may be stored on the printer memory .","The API  may be a set of rules, instructions, and specifications that software programs, such as the print imaging applications , may follow to communicate with each other. For example, an API such as OpenGL (e.g., Open Graphics Library release 4.2) may be utilized. OpenGL, is a standard specification defining a cross-language, cross-platform API to implement a print imaging application that produces 2D and 3D computer graphics. A print imaging application, such as the print imaging application , may make an API call to the OpenGL library in order to accelerate industry-standard print imaging functions (e.g., half-toning, decompression, color spacing, image rendering, gamma correction, de-skewing) on a graphics engine, such as graphics engine . The scheduling management application  may direct an issued API call to one of the general purpose processor  or the graphics engine .","The general purpose processor  may be a multi-purpose processor, such as an Intel architecture (iA, e.g., Atom 64-bit) processor, and may be configured to perform control and dataplane processing. By way of example, in the case of a scan-to-print request from a user, the general purpose processor  may implement various preparatory control processing functions to prepare hardware components to process instructions relating to the scan-to-print function. For example, these preparatory control processing functions may include initiating the scheduling management application , initializing a coupled printer scan assembly, such as printer scan assembly  () for scanning, and initializing a coupled printer execution assembly, such as printer execution assembly  (), to receive data from the printer processing component .","The graphics engine  may be a computer processor configured to compute graphical transformations. In some cases, the graphics engine  may achieve better results than the general purpose processor  with regard to dataplane processing (e.g., print rendering, print imaging), and may free up the general purpose processor  to execute other control and dataplane processing requests.","Moreover, unlike the ASIC  and the fixed function hardware element , the graphics engine  may be programmable. More specifically, the graphics engine  may be programmed utilizing print imaging applications, such as the print imaging application , in conjunction with an application programming interface (API) .","The arrangement and numbering of blocks depicted in  is not intended to imply an order of operations to the exclusion of other possibilities. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the foregoing systems and methods are susceptible of various modifications and alterations. For example, in the embodiment described in , the general purpose processor  and the graphics engine  are part of printer processing component . However, in other embodiments of the present invention, the elements illustrated in  may be assembled differently. For example, in another embodiment, the graphics engine  may be built into the general purpose processor .","Turning now to , a flowchart of an example of a method to implement a print request at a printer, such as printer  (), using a graphics engine, such as graphics engine  (), is shown. In this example, the printer executes a scan-to-print request. The method might be implemented as a set of logic instructions stored in a machine- or computer-readable storage medium such as random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), firmware, flash memory, etc., in configurable logic such as programmable logic arrays (PLAs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), in fixed-functionality logic hardware using circuit technology such as application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) or transistor-transistor logic (TTL) technology, or any combination thereof. For example, computer program code to carry out operations shown in the method may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages.","The method may begin at block . At block , a user may initiate the scan-to-print request utilizing a printer interface, such as printer interface  (). At block , a signal indicating the print-to-scan request may be received and hardware may be prepared to scan and print. In response, a general purpose processor, such as general purpose processor  (), may access various relevant software modules from a printer memory, such as printer memory  () to initialize various hardware components, such as printer scan assembly  (), for processing. The general purpose processor may also initiate a scheduling management application, such as scheduling management application  (). At block , the printer may scan the document using the printer scan assembly. At block , a scan-to-print application may be initiated for processing through the general purpose processor.","At block , the scan-to-print application may utilize the graphics engine to perform print imaging functions necessary to execute the scan-to-print request. As discussed above, this may be done by, issuing an API call to an API library, such as OpenGL, to utilize a function call for hardware processing for a desired print imaging application. The scheduling management application may direct an application programming interface call to the graphics engine. The interface call may direct a function call to execute a desired print imaging application available on OpenGL (e.g., shading, gamma and color correction, data reordering, and background detection, removal and de-skewing).","At block , the process may have the scheduling management application direct the general purpose processor to implement print imaging functions. Again, function calls may be utilized to implement the relevant print imaging functions (e.g., image segmentation, image enhancement) on the general purpose processor. At block , the process may have the scheduling management application return to the graphics engine by directing it to implement rotation, color conversion and printer correction\/compensation functions. At block , the process may have the scheduling management application return to the general purpose processor to implement half-toning. At this point, the document may be ready to be sent to a printer execution assembly, such as printer execution assembly  (). At block , the printer execution assembly may receive the document and print it. At block , the process may be terminated.","The sequence and numbering of blocks depicted in  is not intended to imply an order of operations to the exclusion of other possibilities. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the foregoing systems and methods are susceptible of various modifications and alterations. For example, in other embodiments of the present invention, individual functions such as gamma correction or background detection may not be necessary or implemented. Moreover, in other embodiments of the present invention, a graphics engine instead of a general purpose processor may implement image segmentation and enhancement functionalities. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the different processing blocks may execute concurrently.","It will be evident to persons having the benefit of this disclosure that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the embodiments described herein. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate from the foregoing description that the broad techniques of the embodiments of the present invention can be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while the embodiments of this invention have been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the embodiments of the invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, specification, and following claims.","In addition, in some of the drawings, signal conductor lines are represented with lines. Some may be thicker, to indicate more constituent signal paths, have a number label, to indicate a number of constituent signal paths, and\/or have arrows at one or more ends, to indicate primary information flow direction. This, however, should not be construed in a limiting manner. Rather, such added detail may be used in connection with one or more exemplary embodiments to facilitate easier understanding. Any represented signal lines, whether or not having additional information, may actually include one or more signals that may travel in multiple directions and may be implemented with any suitable type of signal scheme, e.g., digital or analog lines implemented with differential pairs, optical fiber lines, and\/or single-ended lines.","Example sizes\/mode may have been given, although embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the same. As manufacturing techniques (e.g., photolithography) mature over time, it is expected that devices of smaller size could be manufactured. In addition, well known power\/ground connections and other components may or may not be shown within the figures, for simplicity of illustration and discussion, and so as not to obscure certain aspects of the embodiments of the invention. Further, arrangements may be shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring embodiments of the invention, and also in view of the fact that specifics with respect to implementation of such block diagram arrangements are highly dependent upon the platform within which the embodiment is to be implemented, i.e., such specifics should be well within purview of one skilled in the art. Where specific details are set forth in order to describe example embodiments of the invention, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the invention can be practiced without, or with variation of, these specific details. The description is thus to be regarded as illustrative instead of limiting.","The term \u201ccoupled\u201d may be used herein to refer to any type of relationship, direct or indirect, between the components in question, and may apply to electrical, mechanical, fluid, optical, electromagnetic, electromechanical or other connections. In addition, the terms \u201cfirst\u201d, \u201csecond\u201d, etc. are used herein only to facilitate discussion, and carry no particular temporal or chronological significance unless otherwise indicated.","Several features and aspects of the present invention have been illustrated and described in detail with reference to particular embodiments by way of example only, and not by way of limitation.
