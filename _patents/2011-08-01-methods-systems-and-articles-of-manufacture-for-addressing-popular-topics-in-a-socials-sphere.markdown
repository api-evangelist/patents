title: Methods, systems, and articles of manufacture for addressing popular topics in a socials sphere
abstract: Disclosed are methods, systems, and articles of manufactures for addressing popular topics in a social sphere. The method or the system continuously monitors conversations in online forum(s), identifies trend(s) of interest, identifies one or more content items that match the trend(s), and delivers the one or more content items to appropriate forum(s). The method or the system may aggregates conversations in a target forum to identify a trend and automatically responds to the trend by identifying and delivering matching existing content items to a target forum. The method or the system may further catalog a newly created content item upon creation and may identify a trend by employing some third-party products or services, by executing one or more Internet bots to monitor the online conversions, or by using trending application(s) offered by forums or social network websites.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","As social networking continues to gain popularity, the functions of social network websites have evolved from connecting maintaining social relations among individuals to providing more business oriented functions such as providing discussion forums for a group of individuals or organizations sharing some common interests in or issues with products or services. Nonetheless, due to the nature of the social networks being started with social relations and thus the unique characteristics of social network websites, much of the dialog and conversations go unheard or unanswered by some real parties in interest even though a lot of dialog and conversations happen naturally in the social sphere. For example, certain online platforms or social network websites may contain a lot of conversations and responses about a particular issue of a particular product or service offered by a company. Nonetheless, the company's representatives may not even be aware of such conversations and responses and thereby miss the opportunity to improve their product or service, to maintain good customer relationship, or to keep up the goodwill or reputation of the company. On the other hand, it is not only impractical but almost impossible to have human representatives to listen in every online platform to identify such conversations or responses unless these human representatives so happen to be connected to individuals or organizations that voice their opinions in the social sphere\u2014a highly unlikely situation. Furthermore, even if these human representatives were to be connected to the right individuals or organizations, it is also unlikely for these representatives to provide seasonable responses to address these issues in the conversations. Therefore, there is a need for a method and a system for address popular topics in a social sphere.","Disclosed are various embodiments of methods, systems, and articles of manufactures for addressing popular topics in a social sphere. In some embodiments, the method or the system continuously monitors the conversations in one or more online forums (e.g., social network website(s)), identifies one or more trends of interest, identifies one or more content items that match each of the one or more trends, and delivers the one or more content items to appropriate forums. In some embodiments, the method or the system for addressing popular topics in a social sphere aggregates the trends in a social sphere and automatically responds to the trends by identifying matching existing content items and delivering the matching content items to a target forum for which the trends are identified. The method or the system may further catalog a newly created content item as the newly created content item is created. The method or the system may identify a trend either by employing some third-party products or services or by employing one or more Internet bots to monitor the online conversions to identify the trend or by using some trending applications offered by certain forums or social network websites.","In some embodiments, the method or the system may comprise the respective process or hardware module to identify a pertinent trend in conversations of a target forum and then to identify or create one or more cataloged content items that match the pertinent trend.

Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as system memory .","Common forms of computer readable storage media includes, for example, electromechanical disk drives (such as a floppy disk, a flexible disk, or a hard disk), a flash-based, RAM-based (such as SRAM, DRAM, SDRAM, DDR, MRAM, etc.), or any other solid-state drives (SSD), a magnetic tape, any other magnetic or a magneto-optical medium, CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, RAM, PROM, EPROM, FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which a computer can read. For example, the various forms of computer readable storage media may be used by the methods or the systems to store either temporarily or permanently information or data such as the one or more master regions, one or more master output layers, one or more global scratch layers, various transforms and inverse transforms, shapes, etc.","In an embodiment of the invention, execution of the sequences of instructions to practice the invention is performed by a single computer system . According to other embodiments of the invention, two or more computer systems  coupled by communication link  (e.g., LAN, PTSN, or wireless network) may perform the sequence of instructions required to practice the invention in coordination with one another.","Computer system  may transmit and receive messages, data, and instructions, including program, i.e., application code, through communication link  and communication interface . Received program code may be executed by processor  as it is received, and\/or stored in disk drive , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In an embodiment, the computer system  operates in conjunction with a data storage system , e.g., a data storage system  that contains a database  that is readily accessible by the computer system . The computer system  communicates with the data storage system  through a data interface . A data interface , which is coupled to the bus , transmits and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that include data streams representing various types of signal information, e.g., instructions, messages and data. In embodiments of the invention, the functions of the data interface  may be performed by the communication interface .","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the above-described process flows are described with reference to a particular ordering of process actions. However, the ordering of many of the described process actions may be changed without affecting the scope or operation of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["The drawings illustrate the design and utility of various embodiments.
