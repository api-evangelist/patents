title: Contextual video browsing
abstract: A method and system for contextual browsing of videos that are relevant to a current video. Browsing controls that include labels and previews are presented in a user interface. The labels represent sets of videos that are organized according to their relevancy to a current video. The previews represent videos from a set of videos that is currently in focus. If the user switches focus from one set of videos to another set of videos, the previews are updated to correspond to the videos in the second set of videos. The user can also browse through the previews in order to select another video for playback.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to video browsing, and specifically to browsing sets of videos that are contextually related to a current video.","For current video hosting websites, such as YOUTUBE, the user interface includes a video display window where a currently selected video is presented, along with various means by which one or more other videos may be selected for viewing. In interfaces that are designed for display on a computer screen, the user can select another video by selecting a hyperlink or a thumbnail image that is displayed in a sidebar or by entering a keyword search for a new video.","However, the arrangement, appearance, and behavior of these user interfaces are designed to be used by a user of a conventional computer having input devices such as a mouse, which allows the user to easily move a cursor to any point on the display device, and keyboard which allows for direct alphanumeric input. As such, these user interfaces become difficult to navigate when applied to televisions or other devices where the user input device provide very limited input controls. For instance, many televisions are controlled with a simple directional input device that has only up, down, left, and right buttons or keys, such as a directional pad (\u201cD-pad\u201d) or the \u201carrow keys\u201d on a keyboard Such devices do not provide for full, arbitrary placement control over a cursor, but instead only allow for limited vertical and horizontal movements.","The problem is compounded as the number of available videos increases. Many video hosting websites host millions of videos, thereby making it all the more important to provide a user interface by which the user can easily browse and search for content of interest. Additionally, many users can now very easily view video content from video hosting sites on televisions and other display systems operated by D-pad type controllers, rather than with a computer mouse and keyboard. Users continue to expect to have the ease of use they are familiar with from their computer experiences in the different system environment of a television or similar display device.","The present disclosure relates to computer-implemented methods, systems and computer program products for contextual browsing of videos that are related to a currently playing video. In one embodiment, a current video is displayed to a user via a user interface. To assist the user in finding another video to watch, one or more sets of videos that are related to the current video are identified, and a set of controls are displayed for navigating through the sets of related videos. The controls include labels, where each label is associated with one of the sets of related videos. In one embodiment, the labels are arranged linearly in a first direction of the user interface (e.g. along a vertical axis) according to the relevancy between the sets of videos and the current video, such that labels for less relevant video sets are displayed at increasing distances from the label for the most relevant video set.","The linear arrangement of labels allows the user to switch a focus from one label to another label to navigate between different sets of videos, using just two directional controls (e.g., up\/down) on a simple directional controller. As the user moves the focus to a label or between labels, previews for the set of videos represented by the focused label are displayed. These previews are preferably arranged linearly along a second direction of the user interface that is perpendicular to the first direction (e.g., along a horizontal axis). This allows the user to traverse through the previews again using just two directional controls (e.g., left\/right). Using the displayed previews, the user can browse through the videos in the focused set of videos and select one of the videos for playback. Through the use of these unique browsing controls that present video sets based on their relevancy to the current video, the user can quickly identify another video of interest in a short amount of time.","The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification and claims hereof.","The figures depict a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["123","100","121","100","123","100"]},"As shown in , the video hosting server  comprises a front end interface , an ingest module , a video search module , a video serving module , a video set module , a video controls module , a video access log , a user database , and a video database . Many conventional features, such as firewalls, load balancers, application servers, failover servers, site management tools and so forth are not shown so as not to obscure the features of the system.","The video hosting server  can be accessed through various means. A suitable website for implementation of the video hosting server  is the YOUTUBE\u2122 website, found at www.youtube.com; other video hosting sites are known as well, and can be adapted to operate according to the teaching disclosed herein. It will be understood that the term \u201cwebsite\u201d represents any computer system adapted to serve content using any internetworking protocols, and is not intended to be limited to content uploaded or downloaded via the Internet or the HTTP protocol. In general, functions described in one embodiment as being performed on the server  side can also be performed on the client  side in other embodiments if appropriate. In addition, the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together. The server  can also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through appropriate application programming interfaces, and thus is not limited to use in websites only.","The video hosting server  is implemented as server program executing on server-class computer comprising a CPU, memory, network interface, peripheral interfaces, and other well known components. The computers themselves run an operating system such as LINUX, Microsoft Windows, or Mac OS X, have generally high performance CPUs, 2G or more of memory, and 1TB or more of disk storage. Of course, other types of computers can be used, and it is expected that as more powerful computers are developed in the future, they can be configured in accordance with the teachings here. The functionality implemented by any of the elements can be provided from computer program products (e.g., as computer executable instructions) that are stored in tangible computer-readable storage mediums (e.g., RAM, hard disk, or optical\/magnetic media).","In one embodiment a client  executes a video player  and can connect to the video hosting server  to view media content, herein referred to as a \u201cvideo,\u201d \u201cvideo content\u201d or \u201cvideo items\u201d via a network . Network  is typically the internet, but can also be any network, including but not limited to any combination of a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a mobile, wired or wireless network, a private network, or a virtual private network. While only a two clients  and video players  are shown, it is understood that very large numbers (e.g., millions) of clients are supported and can be in communication with the video hosting server  at any time.","In one embodiment, the client  may include a variety of different computing devices, some examples of which are televisions, set top boxes, video game consoles, personal computers, digital assistants, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, mobile phones, smart phones, tablet computers and laptop computers. The client  may be adapted to work with various input devices, such examples of which are a mouse, keyboard, touch-screen, or remote control.","The video player  includes any application that is adapted for playing and browsing videos stored on the video hosting server . The player can be adapted to play videos in various formats, such as Adobe Flash\u2122, WebM, H.264, DivX, FFMPEG, and the like. In one embodiment, the video player  may be a standalone program that is specifically dedicated for video playback (e.g., a dedicated program in a set top box). In other embodiments, the video player  is a plug-in or add on to a web browser that allows users of client  to access web pages on the World Wide Web. Suitable applications are Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari or any application adapted to allow access to web pages on the World Wide Web.","The video player  allows the user of client  to search for and browse through videos hosted by the video hosting server  via a user interface provided by the front end interface , and loaded into the video player . By loading the user interface in the video player , a user can find and play a video. The user can then select the next video for playback by browsing through different sets of videos that are related to the current video. Alternatively, the user interface can be native to the video player , and then populated with its content in the manner as described below.","Users of the client devices  can also search for videos on the user interface based on keywords, tags or other metadata. In one embodiment, these requests are received as queries in the user interface provided by the front end interface  and are provided to the video search module , which searches the video database  for videos that satisfy the queries. The video search module  supports searching on any fielded data for video content, including its title, description, tags, author, category, comment, and so forth. The video serving module  retrieves videos selected by the video search module  from the video database , which is formatted into a file and transmitted to the client  for playback in the user interface.","In some embodiments, the video player  also allows users to upload videos to the video hosting server  via the user interface provided by the front end interface . In one embodiment, the uploaded videos provided by users are processed by an ingest module  at the video hosting server . The ingest module  processes the video for storage in the video database . The processing can include appropriate transformations for the video content. For example, video processing can include format conversion (transcoding), compression, metadata tagging, and other data processing. The uploaded videos can include, for example, video, audio or a combination of video and audio. The ingest module  processes the videos in order to standardize content for playback to users of client . Once uploaded videos have been formatted, the ingest module  stores the video into the database . An uploaded video is associated with the content publisher (i.e., the user that uploaded the video) and the content publisher's account record is updated in the user database  as needed.","The video database  is used to store videos. The video database  stores videos and associated metadata provided by their respective content owner who provided the videos. Each stored video is assigned a video identifier (ID) when it is processed by the ingest module . The videos have metadata associated with each video such as a video ID, artist, video title, label, genre, time length, and optionally geo-restrictions that can be used for data collection or content blocking on a geographic basis.","The user database  stores a record of all users viewing videos provided by the video hosting server . In one embodiment, the user database  stores a record of all users who have registered an account with the video hosting server . Each registered account includes at least a user name and e-mail address associated with the account. A registered account may also include information about the user associated with the account such as their name, hobbies, uploaded videos, favorite videos, and\/or playlists of videos created by the users.","For each user, the video access log  tracks the user's interactions with videos, from which relationships between videos can be determined. Each entry in the video access log  identifies a video being accessed, a time of access, a user ID if available, data identifying the type of interaction with the video. Interaction types can include any user interaction, such as playing, saving, rating, sharing, pausing, rewinding, and forwarding a video. The video access log may also maintain information on videos users choose to watch as measured by click thru rates between videos and\/or percentage of a video watched. For example, the click thru rate between a first and second video may be the rate at which users choose (e.g., via a user input selection, such as a click) to view the second video, when presented with the first video. For example, a click thru rate can be computed as the number of times users choose to view the second video divided by the number of times the users are presented with the option of playing the second video while the first video is being played. Alternatively, the click thru rate may be simply computed as the number of times a video is selected for display divided by the number of times the video is presented as available for displaying (e.g., a thumbnail or a link). This information as well as other types of information may be used to determine what videos are presented to a user.","The video set module  accesses the video access log , the user database  and\/or video database  to identify sets of videos that are related to a video that is currently being played (\u201ccurrent video\u201d) in the user interface. A set of videos refers to any grouping of videos from the video database . For example, a set of videos may include:","(1) videos sharing common metadata (e.g., artist, genre, title, etc.);","(2) videos uploaded by the same user;","(3) videos in a user-created playlist;","(4) videos having some semantic or statistical relationship with respect to the current video, such as having a high click thru or co-occurrence rate (e.g., how often two videos are watched together within some set amount of time) with the current video.","The video set module  uses the information in the video access log  to determine the contextual relevance between the current video and various set of videos. For a given set of videos, contextual relevance is a measure of the likelihood (or alternatively probability) that a user watching the current video would next watch a video in the given set of videos.","In one embodiment, individual relevancy scores are computed for each video in a video set as a function of user viewing patterns. For example, relevancy for a given video can be computed as a function of click thru rates for the current video and a given video, co-occurrence rates for the current video and the given video, how long users watch the given video for after viewing the current video, etc. An overall relevancy score is then computed for a set of videos as a function of (e.g., an average) its individual relevancy scores. In other embodiments, other factors may be considered in determining the overall relevancy score for a set of videos, such as whether the current video is also in the set of videos or whether the current video shares similar metadata with the set of videos. Sets having an overall relevancy score that is higher than some threshold are determined to be related to the current video. Sets having higher overall relevancy scores are determined to be more relevant than sets having lower overall relevancy scores.","The video controls module  manages the generation and display of contextual browsing controls for browsing of videos sets identified by the set module  as being related to a current videos, and provides the relevant instructions and data to the video player for displaying the controls on the client device. The video controls module  receives from the client  user inputs with respect to the browsing controls, and updates the labels on the controls, and the video set that is presented in conjunction with the controls, and provides the updated information to front end interface  for presentation to the client .","The browsing controls allow a user to switch between sets of videos that are related to the current video and to browse within a set of videos in order to select a new video to watch. In one embodiment, the video sets are organized according to their relevancy to the current video. The video controls module  receives user inputs from the client  via the front end interface  for switching between sets of videos, browsing within a set of videos, or selecting a video for playback. The user inputs are generally originated from a directional controller type of device, such as a D-pad controller, arrow keys on a keyboard, or the like, which have the semantics of \u201cup,\u201d \u201cdown,\u201d \u201cleft\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, and \u201cselect,\u201d though of course they can be transmitted as coded input signals. In response, the video controls module  updates the labels of controls in the user interface and the video set that is presented in conjunction with the controls in accordance with the user input. In some embodiments, the functionality of the video controls module  may be implemented in the client  instead of the server .","The contextual controls allow for a simple and intuitive method of selecting an additional video to watch. Because video sets, as represented by the labeled controls, are presented in arrangement based on their relevancy to the current video, the user is more likely to find a video that he\/she is interested in within a short amount of time. Also, because a user can interact with the controls with a simple set of inputs (e.g., up, down, left, right, select), the interface is particularly beneficial when used in conjunction with devices that have constrained inputs. The contextual controls are explained in greater detail in conjunction with , C, D, and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B-2D"],"b":["200","200","205","205","205","200","205","200","200"]},"While watching the video  the user provides an input to activate the display of the controls, for example the \u201cup\u201d key. In , contextual browsing controls  are overlaid onto the current video  in the user interface  in response to this input. Alternatively, the browsing controls may also be displayed when the video  finishes playing.","The browsing controls  include pivot controls  and set controls . The pivot controls  allow the user to switch focus between sets of videos, and the set controls  allow the user to switch focus between videos within the set of videos that is currently in focus. For example, the user may use the up or down buttons of a remote control to switch between sets of videos and the right or left buttons to switch between videos in a set. Once the user locates a video that he or she wants to watch, the user selects the video, for example with an enter button. The currently playing video  is then replaced with the selected video and the controls  are removed from the display.","The pivot controls  are comprised of individual labels (e.g., -, -, -). Each label is a visual element that represents a set of videos. The labels  are displayed along a first axis (e.g., a vertical axis) in a linear arrangement. In some embodiments, a label includes text that summarizes or explains the nature of the video set represented by the label. For example, label - represents the set of videos from a user created playlist called \u201cMy Favorites.\u201d Label - represents the set of videos uploaded by user \u201cJim2000.\u201d Label - represents the set of videos in the topic of \u201cAuto Racing.\u201d The label that has the focus is displayed in a visually distinctive manner (e.g., with highlighting, color, size, motion, outlining, etc). For example, label - has the focus and is shown with a larger and darker boarder. The user can move the focus between labels  using, for example, up and down inputs.","The set controls  are comprised of a plurality of preview cells (e.g., -, -, -, -) for the set of videos that is currently in focus, which can be referred to for convenience as the current playlist. For example, the label - for the playlist \u201cMy Favorites\u201d is in focus, and so the set controls  include previews for videos in the playlist \u201cMy Favorites\u201d to allow the user to browse among the videos in this playlist. The preview cells  are displayed in a linear arrangement along a second axis of the user interface  (e.g. a horizontal axis) that is perpendicular to the first axis.","Each preview cell is a visual element that represents a video. The preview cells can include, for example, still images or clips from the videos represented by the cell, and\/or textual information about the videos (e.g., title, length, rating, total views, user comments, other metadata) to facilitate the user's decision of which video to watch. In one embodiment, the preview cell that is in focus can include textual information about its video, whereas the preview cells that are not in focus do not include the textual information. As shown, one of the previews cells - is displayed in a visually distinctive manner to indicate the cell  having the focus, and the user can move the focus between preview cells  using left and right inputs. In one embodiment, each time the set controls  are initially displayed, the preview cell  for the current video  is given the focus. Thus, in the , preview cell -, which represents the current video , is initially given the focus.","As previously discussed, the contextual relevance between the current video  and each set of videos is determined by the video set module , and represented by a relevancy score. The labels  for the sets of videos are organized in the interface  according to the relevance of the associated video sets to the current video , for example, in order from less relevant sets to more relevant sets. For example, the set of videos in the \u201cMy Favorite\u201d playlist (label -) is more relevant than the set of videos that are uploaded by user \u201cJim2000\u201d (label -), which in turn is more relevant than the videos in the topic of \u201cAuto Racing\u201d (label -). Organizing the video sets according to their relevancy is beneficial for presenting the user with videos that he\/she is likely to be interested in watching. In one embodiment, when the controls are first displayed, the set of videos with the highest relevancy (e.g., label -) is located closest to the set controls , and less relevant sets of videos are located at increasing distances from the set controls . Focus is also placed on the set of videos that has the highest relevancy (e.g., label -).","As shown, the contextual browsing controls  are overlaid onto the current video  while the current video  continues to play in the background. This allows the user to continue watching the current video  while browsing for a new video to watch. Alternatively, the current video  may be placed in a smaller window and displayed alongside the browsing controls , the current video  may be hidden from view, and\/or the current video  may be paused while the browsing controls  are displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2C","FIGS. 2B and 2C"],"b":["220","220","2","220","3","220","2","220","3","205","215","205"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2D"],"b":["215","215","1","215","2","215","1","215","2"]},"In one embodiment, the pivot controls  scroll vertically across the user interface  as focus changes from one label to another. For example, now that label - is in focus, all the labels are shifted towards the bottom of the user interface . If label - were to be selected for focus, the labels would again scroll toward the bottom of the screen. A new label -, which previously did not fit in the user interface , is now displayed in the user interface that represents a set of videos in the genre of \u201cSports.\u201d This shifting of labels can be repeated any number of times, and with each shift a new label  is displayed that corresponds to another set of videos. Thus, the user can continue to traverse \u201cup\u201d through any number of sets of videos. In some embodiments, the pivot controls  do not scroll, and are instead relatively stationary in the user interface  as the user switches from one set to another.","The set controls  are updated to correspond to the set of videos that is currently in focus. Thus, in , the set controls  are updated to show previews for videos in the set of videos uploaded by user \u201cJim2000.\u201d Because the pivot controls  were scrolled downwards, label -, which was previously in focus, is now located directly below and adjacent to the pivot controls . Label -, which is now in focus, is located directly above and adjacent to the set controls . In other words, each time the user selects another label , the browsing controls  are updated so that the previews  are displayed between the label  with the focus and the previously focused label . As shown in , the position of the set controls  is relatively stationary as the user switches focus from one label  to another. In some embodiments, the position of the set controls  may move up or down in the user interface to track the position of the label  with focus. Keeping the set controls  adjacent to the label in focus helps the user maintain a sense of the relationship between the label that is in focus and the previews shown in the set controls .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["205","200","215","305","305","205","200","200"]},"Because the focus of the pivot controls  is on the label for video set n -, the set controls  also correspond to videos from video set n. Previews of the videos in video set n are displayed in the set controls . The previews  are distributed in a horizontal direction of the user interface along a horizontal axis . The pivot controls  are located directly beneath the label - with focus. Generally speaking, the location of the pivot controls  is linked to the location of the label with focus, which in this example is label -. The horizontal axis  and vertical axis  are perpendicular to each other. Note that the axes may or may not be located at the center of the user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["510","511","109","515","510"]},"Once the relevancy of video sets is determined , contextual browsing controls are displayed  to the user via the user interface. The user interface may be similar to that shown in , C, D or . The contextual browsing controls allow a user to switch between sets of videos and to browse videos within each set of videos. The video sets are organized in the user interface according to their relevancy to expedite the process of finding a new video to watch.","The system then waits  for a user input. If a user input is received  for changing focus from one video set to another or for changing focus within a video set, the browsing controls are updated  in the user interface  in the manner described with respect to , and the system waits  for another user input.
