title: Systems and methods for managing a print job
abstract: One example discloses a network system for managing a print job. The network system can comprise a printing system. The printing system can comprise a memory for storing computer executable instructions and a processing unit for accessing the memory and executing the computer executable instructions. The computer executable instructions can comprise a printer server to generate a print job for a printer based on a received print email message. The print job can be generated based on an email decoration in the print email message. The email decoration can include a request specifying printing parameters for the print job.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Cloud computing is location-independent computing, whereby shared servers provide resources, software, and data to computers and other devices on demand. The term \u201ccloud\u201d is used as a metaphor for the Internet, based on the cloud drawing often used to represent computer networks. Cloud computing describes a supplement, consumption, and delivery model for information technologies services based on the Internet, and can involves over-the-Internet provision of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. One key characteristic of cloud computing is that the computing is \u201cin the cloud\u201d e.g. the processing (and the related data) is not in a specified, known or static place(s). Details are abstracted from consumers, who no longer have need for expertise in, or control over, the technology infrastructure \u201cin the cloud\u201d that supports them. This is in contrast to a model in which the processing takes place in one or more specific servers that are known.","In some examples of cloud computing, one or more of the aforementioned resources can include a printer, which can be referred to as a cloud printer. In such a situation, nearly any computing device connected to the computing cloud can print to the cloud printer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","2","4","6","6","6","4","4","6","4","8","4"]},"For purposes of simplification of explanation, in the present example, different components of the network system  are illustrated and described as performing different functions. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate that the functions of the described components can be performed by different components, and the functionality of several components can be combined and executed on a single component. The components can be implemented, for example, as software (e.g., computer executable instructions), hardware (e.g., an application specific integrated circuit), or as a combination of both (e.g., firmware). In other examples, the components could be distributing among remote devices across the network  (e.g., external web services).","The printing system  can include, for example, a memory  for storing computer executable instructions. The printing system  can also include, for example, a processing unit  (e.g., a processor core) for accessing the memory  and executing computer executable instructions. The memory  can include a printer server . As described herein, the printer server  can route print jobs to the printer  based on a received email. The printer server  can send network messages to the printer . The network messages can cause a printer  to process a print job (e.g., print a file). The network messages can include a payload that provides commands to the printer  in a protocol native to the printer , which can be referred to as an instruction message. For instance, the instruction message can include printer command language (PCL) commands, portable document format (PDF) commands, HEWLETT PACKARD\u00ae Graphics Language (HPGL), commands, etc. To provide the instruction message, the printer server  can include a printer driver for the printer . In some examples, the printer driver for the printer  could be provided to printer server  from an external system (e.g. a web service).","As one example, the printer server  can receive an email message requesting that a particular file (e.g., a text document, a photograph and\/or a schematic drawing) attached to the email message be printed, which file can be referred to as an attached file and\/or a portion of the email message be printed, which email message can be referred to as a print email message. The print email message can include, for example, an email decoration that specifies printing parameters for the printer .","As one example, to send an email across the network  from a client computer  to the printer server  (which email message designates the printer  as a destination of the email message), the client computer can connect to an email server . In some examples, the email server  could be implemented as a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. In other examples, the email server  could be a proprietary email server. The email server  can respond to the client computer  with an acknowledgment message. Upon receiving the acknowledgment message, the client computer  can provide an identity message that identifies the client computer . The identity message can include, for example, a client-hostname for the client computer . The email server  can respond to the identity message with another acknowledgment message. In response, the client computer  can identify an email address of a sender of the email message (e.g., MAIL FROM:<sender address>). The email server  can respond with another acknowledgment message. In response, the client computer  can identify an address of a recipient of the email message (e.g., \u201cRCPT TO:<recipient address>\u201d), and the email server can respond with another acknowledgment message. In response, the client computer  can provide a request to start transmitting the email message (e.g., \u201cDATA\u201d), and the email server  can respond with a message that requests that the client computer  start the input for the email message, and to end the input with a specific ending identifier (e.g., a carriage return, line feed, a period and another carriage return, line feed\u201c<CRLF>.<CRLF>\u201d). In response, the client computer  can provide the email message to the email server , including the specific ending identifier. In response, the email server  can provide an acknowledgment of reception the email message, and the client computer  can disconnect from the email server .","Upon receipt of the email message, the email server  can create an envelope for the email message by employing information provided in the address of the sender and the address of the recipient provided from the client computer . The envelope can have the same or different sender and recipient email addresses as the email message. For purposes of simplification of explanation, it is to be understood that the term \u201caddress field\u201d can refer to either a field in a header of an email message, and\/or as an address included in the envelope. The email server  can provide the envelope and the email message to a delivery agent that can examine the envelope, and provide the email message in an appropriate mailbox, such as a mailbox of the printer server . The printer server  can detect the presence of the email message in the mailbox of the printer server , and retrieve the email message. In this manner, the client computer  can provide an email message that includes the printer  as a recipient of the email message, and the printer server  can receive and process such an email message.","In , only one email server  is illustrated for purposes of simplification of explanation. However, it is to be understood that the email server  could be representative of a plurality of email servers  to facilitate the delivery of an email message. For instance, in some examples, the email server  can represent one or more of a mail submission agent (MSA), a mail transfer agent (MTA), a mail exchanger (MX), a mail delivery agent (MDA), etc. employed to deliver the email message. In such a situation, the MSA can initially receive an email message from a mail user agent (MUA) of a sender of the email message. The MSA can forward the email message to an associated MTA. The MTA can provide the email message to an MX associated with a recipient of the email message. The MX can provide the email message to an MDA that stores the email message in a mailbox of the recipient of the email message. The email message can be retrieved from the mailbox by an MUA of the recipient. Moreover, in some examples, some or all of the components represented as the email server  could be integrated into the printer server . For instance, in some examples, the printer server  can include an MUA to send and receive email messages.","The email decoration can be implemented as a request identifier followed and\/or proceeded by a request. For instance, the email decoration could be implemented as an email header subject field decoration, an email address field decoration, an email header optional field decoration or as an email tag (e.g., a separate attached file or body) decoration. The email decoration can include, for example, a request that a print job be executed in a specific way. Some examples include specifying a particular size of paper to print a print job and\/or a number of copies to be printed (e.g., letter, A4, photo-sized, etc.). Other examples include specifying a print quality (e.g., draft quality, black-and-white or color) for a print job, and\/or printing photos. Still other examples include specifying that a particular portion of the print email message (e.g., a portion of a body of the print email message) be printed. Some examples include specifying that a particular portion (such as photographs) of the print email message be omitted in a print job (e.g., a lean print request). It is also considered that some email decorations can cause other email decorations to be ignored and\/or interpreted differently. Still further, in some examples, some email decorations could identify a particular network resource and\/or service (e.g., a web service) that can provide content to be printed. As yet another example, the email decoration can specify a particular method of sending a response (e.g., a confirmation or denial) email. For instance, the email decoration could specify that response emails are sent via text message to a mobile phone. Other examples can include the email decoration specifying the storing of a file that can be referenced (by another email decoration) and printed at a later time (e.g., a travel checklist).","In some examples, the email decoration can specify a user authorized to print to a particular printer, such that the user is added to a white list. Similarly, the email decoration can specify the user is not authorized to print to a particular printer, such that the user is added to a blacklist. The user can be identified, for example, by an email address included in the email decoration. In other examples, the email decoration can include a request specifying that anyone can print to the printer . Similarly, the email decoration can include a request that indicates that only users identified on a white list can print to the printer . In still other examples, the email decoration can include a request specifying that default settings of a particular printer be changed. In yet other examples, the email decoration can include a request that a list of available requests employable in an email decoration be provided. In still yet other examples, the email decoration can include a request that a list of stored print jobs be printed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["50","50","50","50","50","4","50","50","1","2"]},"In the example illustrated in , the request identifier is represented as a pound (\u201c#\u201d), but is to be understood that other request identifiers could be employed as well. Moreover, in some examples, requests can be extrapolated without the employment of a request identifier (e.g., from keywords and\/or other syntax). Thus, in some examples, the print email message may not include the request identifier. Furthermore, in the example illustrated in , an attachment identifier (square brackets \u201c[ ]\u201d) includes an ordinal number (labeled in  as \u201cFIRST\u201d) designating a particular attached file, namely the first attached file, follows a first request identifier in the email message . In other examples, the file name of the attached file could be also\/alternatively be employed. Moreover, two requests separated by a request delineator (illustrated in  as a slash \u201c\/\u201d) follow the attachment identifier, namely \u201cDUPLEX\u201d and \u201cCOLOR\u201d. Moreover, although the delineator is illustrated as being a slash (\u201c\/\u201d), it is to be understood that in other examples, other characters (a comma, a space, etc.) could be employed in replacement of and\/or in addition to the slash (\u201c\/\u201d). A subject field decoration for a second attached file is also included. Thus, the subject field decoration can request that the first attached file (labeled in  as \u201cFILE.DOC\u201d) be printed in duplex mode and in color, and the subject field decoration can request that the second attached file (labeled in  as \u201cFILE.DOC\u201d) can be printed in duplex mode, in draft form and in black and white. In the present example, the requests are comprehendible by a user. However, in other examples, the requests could be encrypted, or otherwise unintelligible by the user.","In some examples, the request included in the email decoration can include a network resource formatted as a uniform resource identifier (URI). In such a situation, the network resource could be provided in identifiers such as square brackets (\u201c[ ]\u201d), quotation marks, curly brackets (\u201c{ }\u201d), etc. to ensure compatibility with the remaining portion of the email decoration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","100","100","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["150","150","150","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["200","200","200","1","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIGS. 2-5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["250","2","1","2","3","2","3","1","250","250","200"]},"Referring back to , the printer server  can receive the print email message and process the print email message in a manner described herein. In such an example, the printer  can be assigned a unique email address, such that the printer server  can receive a print email message destined for a given unique email address of the printer . Moreover, in some examples, such as where an address field decoration is employed, the printer server  and\/or the email server  can ignore the decoration portion of the email address field decoration when determining an identification of the printer . In some examples, the email server  can facilitate processing of the print email message. For instance, if an address field decoration is employed, the email server  could be designed to process the email decoration included in the message envelope before the message is forwarded to the printer server , in a manner described herein. For instance, if an address field decoration is employed, email server  can be designed to identify a mailbox associated with the decorated address field of the message envelope before the print email message is provided to the printer server . To identify the mailbox, the email server  could, for example, examine only characters preceding a request identifier. Furthermore, in some examples, the email server  can create the message envelope with the recipient address field (of the message envelope) modified to remove the address field decoration, such that the recipient address field of the message envelope is the true email address of the recipient. In such a situation, the message envelope and the header of the email message can have different email addresses, namely an undecorated email address and a decorated email address.","By utilizing such the network system , the client computer , from which the print email message originated need not include a driver for the printer , although the client computer  is not prohibited from including such a driver. Instead, the client computer  needs only to include an email client  (e.g., an MUA) capable of sending and receiving emails from a user  of the client computer . Accordingly, the client computer  can be implemented as nearly any computer that can communicate over the network , including but not limited to a desktop or laptop personal computer, a mobile device, such as a smartphone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), etc. Furthermore, since a request for printing is sent via email, physical and logical routing distance between the client computer  and the printer  is immaterial. That is, the client computer  and the printer  can be coupled to the same local area network (LAN) or coupled by a wide area network (WAN).","The printer server  can include an email analyzer  that can process a print email message destined for the printer . The email analyzer  can parse the print email message to determine if an email decoration is present in the print email message. The email decoration can be recognized, for example, by a request identifier being present in the print email message. If no request identifier is present in the print email message, the printer server  can generate a print job for the printer  by converting a file attached to the print email message and\/or some portion of the print email message into a set of commands and providing the set of commands in an instruction message that causes the printer  to print a print job.","If an email decoration is present in the print email message, the email analyzer  can analyze a request and attempt to identify a request specified in the email decoration. In some examples, different requests can perform the same functions. For instance, a request of \u201cduplex\u201d can performed the same function as a request of \u201ctwo-sided.\u201d Moreover, the email analyzer  can be designed to accommodate common misspellings of the request (e.g., spelling \u201ctwo-sided\u201d as \u201ctow-sided\u201d). In such a situation, the email analyzer  can simply choose the most likely intended request. In other examples, if a request is not recognized, the email analyzer  can send the user  a clarification email message indicating that the request is not understood and a likely intended request. In such a situation, the user  can reply to the clarification email message indicating that the likely intended request was in fact the intended request, wherein the email analyzer  can employ the reply to the clarification to expand the available list of requests.","In some examples, the email analyzer  can execute a request based on the email decoration. For instance, in situations where the email decoration does not request that a document be printed, but instead requests a change in status of the printer  and\/or a change in a method for responding to print email messages, the email analyzer  can execute the request without generating a print job, such that execution of the request affects other (future) print jobs. Moreover, in examples where execution of the print job is desired, the email analyzer  can also determine if the printer  is capable of executing a print job generated based on the request. For instance, if the request specifies that a file attached to the print email message should be printed with A4 size paper, the email analyzer  and\/or the printer server  can analyze the capabilities of the printer  to determine, (i) if the printer  can print to A4 size paper, and (ii) if the printer  has A4 size paper loaded in a paper carriage. If the email analyzer  determines that the printer  cannot execute a print job that follows the request set forth in the print email message, the email analyzer  and\/or the printer server  can provide a denial email message to the client computer  that indicates that a requested print job cannot be completed, and the reason that the print job cannot be completed. Moreover, in some examples, the denial email message can include an actuatable feature (e.g., hyperlinks, virtual buttons, etc.) that could allow the user to initiate execution of the print job with a modified parameter (e.g., a different paper size). For instance, in a situation where the request set forth in the print email message requests that the printer  print on size A4 paper, but the printer  only supports 8.5\u00d711 inch paper, the actuatable functions could include options to execute the print job in a scaled down or reflowed format on 8.5\u00d711 inch paper. In another example, in a situation where the request set forth in the print email message requests that the printer  print in duplex mode, but the printer  can only print on one side of paper, the actuatable functions could include options to execute the print job in a one-sided format.","If the email analyzer  determines that the printer  can execute a print job that follows the request set forth in the print email message, the printer server  can convert a file attached to the print email message and\/or a portion of the print email message into a set of commands in a printing protocol, wherein the set of commands are consistent with the request included in the email decoration. The printer server  can provide an instruction message that includes the set of commands to the printer  thereby causing the printer  to process a print job and to print in accordance with the request set forth the in the email decoration. In some examples, upon completing the printing, the printer  can send a completion message to the printer server  indicating that the printing has been completed. In such a situation, the printer server  can send the user  a confirmation email message (by utilizing a sender address field of the print email message) that indicates that a print job was completed consistent with the request set forth in the email decoration. In another example, if the printer  begins to print in response to the instruction message but encounters an error before the completion of the printing (e.g., runs out of paper), the printer  can return a failure message to the printer server  that indicates that printing has not been completed, and the reason that the printer  has not completed the printing. In response to the failure message, the printer server  can provide an error message to the user  (by utilizing a sender address field of the print email message) that indicates that the file attached the print email message has failed to print, and the reason for the failure. In this manner, the user  can remedy the situation (e.g., fill a paper tray of the printer ), and the printer  can resume printing.","By utilizing the network system , the user  of the client computer  can customize print jobs that are initiated via email. Accordingly, the network system  provides a great deal of flexibility in providing customize print jobs based on individual users' needs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","8","300","302","302","300","304","302","304"]},"The printing system  can be coupled to a network  (e.g., the Internet) via a network interface , which could be implemented as a network interface card. The memory  can include a printer server  that can manage printing jobs.","The printer server  can include an on ramp  that receives an email message with an attached file to be printed, which can be referred to as a print email message. The on ramp  can provide the print email message to an email analyzer  of the printer server . The email analyzer  can evaluate the destination address field (e.g., addressee) of the print email message and retrieve a printer record from a data storage  of the printing system  associated with the destination address field of the print email message, wherein the printer can be referred to as an identified printer. The data storage  can include, for example, a database and\/or a table that can store the printer record. The data storage  can be implemented, for example as volatile memory (e.g., RAM) or non-volatile memory (e.g. a hard disk and\/or a flash drive). The printer record can include, for example, data (e.g., a white list) that identifies a list of users and\/or email addresses authorized to print to the identified printer. The printer record can also include routing information (e.g., a network address) of the identified printer. The printer record can further include data that characterizes printing capabilities of the identified printer. Moreover, in some examples, the email analyzer  can examine the sender address field of the print email message and the print record to determine if the sender of the print email has authority to print to the identified printer. The email analyzer  can parse the print email message and the file attached to the print email message and to determine if an email decoration is present in the print email message. The email decoration can include a request identifier and a request following and\/or preceding the request identifier.","In some examples, the email analyzer  can execute a request based on the request included in the email decoration, such as examples where no print job is requested and\/or examples wherein multiple email decorations are included and at least one request can be executed before generation of a print job. Moreover, in examples where the request cannot be identified, the email analyzer  can provide a clarification email to a sender of the print email message, requesting that the intent of the email decoration be clarified. If a response to the clarification email is received by the email analyzer , the email analyzer  can utilize the response to expand a set of recognizable requests.","The email analyzer  can examine the capabilities of the identified printer to determine if a print job can be executed on the identified printer consistent with the command set forth in the print email message. If the email analyzer  determines the that the print job cannot be executed by the identified printer, the email analyzer  can generate a denial email message that explains that the print job will not be executed, and the reason for not executing the print job (e.g., the identified printer cannot print in color), and provide the denial email message to a sender of the print email message. Conversely, if the identified printer can execute the print job, the email analyzer  can forward the print email message and the email decoration to an off ramp  of the printer server .","In response, the off ramp  can query the identified printer to determine if the identified printer currently has the capability of executing the print job (e.g., paper loaded at the identified printer). If the off ramp  determines that the identified printer does not have the current capability of executing the print job, the off ramp  can generate and provide a denial email message to a sender of the print email message in a manner similar to the denial message described with respect to the email analyzer . If the off ramp  determines that the identified printer does have the current capabilities to execute the print job, the off ramp  can convert a file attached to the print email message, and\/or a portion of the print email message into a set of commands in a protocol native to the identified printer (e.g., PCL, PDF, HPGL, etc.) consistent with the command set forth in the email decoration. In some examples, the off ramp  can access external systems (e.g., web services) to facilitate the generation of the set of commands. The off ramp  can send the set of commands as an instruction message to the identified printer over the network , thereby causing the identified printer to process the set of commands. The processing of the set of commands can result, for example, in an execution of the print job. The execution of the print job can include, for example, printing the file attached to the print email message and\/or a portion of the print email message in a manner consistent with the command set forth in the email decoration.","The off ramp  can receive a status message from the identified printer. The status message could be implemented, for example as a completion message or a failure message, as described herein with respect to . In response to the status message, the off ramp  can provide an update email message to the sender of the print email message. The update email message can be implemented, for example, as a confirmation email message or an error email message, as described herein. Thus, the update message provides the sender of the print email message an indication of a status of the print job corresponding to the execution of a print job requested by the print email message.","In view of the foregoing structural and functional features described above, example methods will be better appreciated with reference to . While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the example methods of  are shown and described as executing serially, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present examples are not limited by the illustrated order, as some actions could in other examples occur in different orders and\/or concurrently from that shown and described herein. Moreover, it is not necessary that all described actions be performed to implement a method.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1","FIG. 7"],"b":["400","400","2","300","410","420","430","430","400","440","400","450","440"]},"At , a command set can be generated based on the email decoration. In some examples, the command set can be employed to implement a specific print job. In such a situation, the file attached to the print email message and\/or a portion of the print email message can be converted, by the printer server, into a set of commands in a protocol native to the printer (e.g., PCL, PDF, HGPL, etc.) consistent with the request set forth in the email decoration. In other examples, the command set can be executed by a printer server (and\/or email analyzer) without and\/or in addition the execution of a print job.

The status message can indicate whether the print job has been executed. At , the printer server can provide an update email to the sender of the print email message based on information in the status message. By utilization of the method , a user of a client system (e.g., the sender of the print email message) can tailor printing preferences of a print job requested via email. Accordingly, the client system can leverage full printing capabilities of the identified printer without the need for installation of a printer driver for the identified printer at the client computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["500","510","520"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 1-8","FIG. 1","FIG. 7"],"b":["600","8","16","4","300","600","600"]},"The system  can include a system bus , a processing unit , a system memory , memory devices  and , a communication interface  (e.g., a network interface), a communication link , a display  (e.g., a video screen), and an input device  (e.g., a keyboard and\/or a mouse).
