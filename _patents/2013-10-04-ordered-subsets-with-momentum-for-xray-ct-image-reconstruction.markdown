No. 61\/728,909, filed Nov. 21, 2012, which is herein incorporated in its entirety by reference.","This invention was made with government support under 1-R01-HL-098686 awarded by National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to diagnostic imaging, and more particularly to methods and systems for fast and iterative image reconstruction.","Non-invasive imaging techniques are widely used in diagnostic imaging applications such as security screening, quality control, and medical imaging systems. Particularly, in medical imaging, non-invasive imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) are used for unobtrusive, convenient, and fast imaging of underlying tissues and organs. Some CT systems employ direct reconstruction techniques such as filtered back-projection (FBP) that allow reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) image data set in a single reconstruction step. Thus, the direct reconstruction techniques are generally fast and computationally efficient.","Alternatively, some CT systems employ iterative reconstruction techniques that iteratively update a reconstructed image volume. Typically, the iterative reconstruction techniques are employed to provide greater flexibility in imaging applications than available when using the direct reconstruction techniques. Specifically, the iterative reconstruction techniques find use in imaging applications that entail selective and\/or interactive enhancement of imaging metrics and\/or protocols based on specific requirements. For example, the iterative reconstruction techniques provide greater flexibility in configuring acquisition geometry and\/or modeling physical effects to improve one or more imaging metrics such as reducing radiation dose, noise, and\/or other imaging artifacts.","Iterative reconstruction techniques, however, involve long and complex computations that are generally much slower than the direct reconstruction techniques. Certain techniques have been proposed for reducing computational costs of iterative reconstruction, for example, using ordered subsets (OS) or relaxation factors. OS algorithms, in particular, are used in CT imaging to accelerate image reconstruction by using only a subset of measured projection data in each image update. Although, using only a subset of the measured projection data in the OS algorithms entails approximations, the OS algorithms provide dramatic initial acceleration. Such conventional OS algorithms, however, still employ a number of iterations to converge and involve long computations, thus limiting use of the OS algorithms in clinical settings.","In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, methods, systems, and non-transitory computer readable media for image reconstruction are presented. Measured data corresponding to a subject is received. A preliminary image update in a particular iteration is determined based on one or more image variables computed using at least a subset of the measured data in the particular iteration. Additionally, at least one momentum term is determined based on the one or more image variables computed in the particular iteration and\/or one or more further image variables computed in one or more iterations preceding the particular iteration. Further, a subsequent image update is determined using the preliminary image update and the momentum term. The preliminary image update and\/or the subsequent image update are iteratively computed for a plurality of iterations until one or more termination criteria are satisfied.","The following description presents systems and methods for fast and iterative image reconstruction. Particularly, certain embodiments illustrated herein describe methods and systems for faster convergence of iterative image reconstruction using OS and momentum. As used herein, the term \u201cmomentum\u201d may be used to refer to information derived from one or more previous iterations that may be used in computations corresponding to a current iteration for accelerating convergence of the iterative image reconstruction, particularly in the early iterations.","Although the following description describes embodiments for fast and iterative image reconstruction in the context of medical diagnostic imaging using a CT system, the present disclosure may be implemented in various other medical imaging systems and applications. Some of these systems may include an X-ray system, a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, a PET-CT scanner, a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanner, a SPECT-CT scanner, an X-ray tomosynthesis system, and\/or an MR-CT scanner.","In addition to medical diagnostic imaging, embodiments of the present disclosure may also be employed in other non-invasive imaging contexts to generate images with minimal processing and memory utilization. By way of example, embodiments of the present disclosure may be used in baggage screening, and\/or industrial nondestructive evaluation of manufactured parts. An exemplary environment that is suitable for practicing various implementations of the present disclosure will be discussed in the following sections with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","102","104","106","104","106","108","102","104","106"]},"In certain embodiments, the CT system  further includes an image processing unit  configured to reconstruct images of a target volume of the patient using an iterative reconstruction method. In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, the CT system  performs an OS-based iterative reconstruction using momentum to substantially accelerate the convergence of the OS-based iterative image reconstruction without any significant sacrifice to image quality. The fast and accurate image reconstruction reduces scanning time and radiation dose, while also allowing for early diagnosis and\/or treatment of the patient. Another exemplary embodiment of an imaging system that allows for faster image reconstruction using the OS-based iterative reconstruction aided by momentum will be described in greater detail with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","200","200","108","108","202","106","204","108","202","202"]},"In certain embodiments, the system  is configured to traverse different angular positions around the subject  for acquiring desired projection data. Accordingly, the gantry  and the components mounted thereon may be configured to rotate about a center of rotation  for acquiring the projection data, for example, at different energy levels. Alternatively, in embodiments where a projection angle relative to the subject  varies as a function of time, the mounted components may be configured to move along a general curve rather than along a segment of a circle.","In one embodiment, the system  includes a control mechanism  to control movement of the components such as rotation of the gantry  and the operation of the X-ray radiation source . In certain embodiments, the control mechanism  further includes an X-ray controller  configured to provide power and timing signals to the radiation source . Additionally, the control mechanism  includes a gantry motor controller  configured to control a rotational speed and\/or position of the gantry  based on imaging requirements.","In certain embodiments, the control mechanism  further includes a data acquisition system (DAS)  configured to sample analog data received from the detector elements  and convert the analog data to digital signals for subsequent processing. The data sampled and digitized by the DAS  is transmitted to a computing device . In one example, the computing device  stores the data in a storage device . The storage device , for example, may include a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a compact disk-read\/write (CD-R\/W) drive, a Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) drive, a flash drive, and\/or a solid-state storage device.","Additionally, the computing device  provides commands and parameters to one or more of the DAS , the X-ray controller , and the gantry motor controller  for controlling system operations such as data acquisition and\/or processing. In certain embodiments, the computing device  controls system operations based on operator input. The computing device  receives the operator input, for example, including commands and\/or scanning parameters via an operator console  operatively coupled to the computing device . The operator console  may include a keyboard (not shown) or a touchscreen to allow the operator to specify the commands and\/or scanning parameters.","Although  illustrates only one operator console , more than one operator console may be coupled to the system , for example, for inputting or outputting system parameters, requesting examinations and\/or viewing images. Further, in certain embodiments, the system  may be coupled to multiple displays, printers, workstations, and\/or similar devices located either locally or remotely, for example, within an institution or hospital, or in an entirely different location via one or more configurable wired and\/or wireless networks  such as the Internet and\/or virtual private networks.","In one embodiment, for example, the system  either includes, or is coupled to a picture archiving and communications system (PACS) . In an exemplary implementation, the PACS  is further coupled to a remote system such as a radiology department information system, hospital information system, and\/or to an internal or external network (not shown) to allow operators at different locations to supply commands and parameters and\/or gain access to the image data.","The computing device  uses the operator supplied and\/or system defined commands and parameters to operate a table motor controller , which in turn, may control a motorized table . Particularly, the table motor controller  moves the table  for appropriately positioning the subject  in the gantry  for acquiring projection data corresponding to the target volume of the subject .","As previously noted, the DAS  samples and digitizes the projection data acquired by the detector elements . Subsequently, an image reconstructor  uses the sampled and digitized X-ray data to perform high-speed reconstruction. Although,  illustrates the image reconstructor  as a separate entity, in certain embodiments, the image reconstructor  may form part of the computing device . Alternatively, the image reconstructor  may be absent from the system  and instead the computing device  may perform one or more functions of the image reconstructor . Moreover, the image reconstructor  may be located locally or remotely, and may be operatively connected to the system  using a wired or wireless network. Particularly, one exemplary embodiment may use computing resources in a \u201ccloud\u201d network cluster for the image reconstructor .","Typically, iterative image reconstruction algorithms are implemented by forming an objective or cost function that incorporates an accurate system model, statistical noise model, and\/or prior model. The image is then reconstructed by computing an estimate that minimizes the resulting cost function. Various algorithms may be used for minimizing the cost function. For example, sequential algorithms, such as iterative coordinate descent (ICD), may be employed as these have fast convergence rates if given a good initial estimate. However, the sequential algorithms entail column access to a system matrix and have relatively large computation cost per iteration. Simultaneous algorithms, such as gradient-based methods used with various surrogate functions may provide a higher level of parallelism. However, standard parallelizable algorithms may converge slowly and may require excessive computation to produce a useful image.","Accordingly, several approaches have been proposed to accelerate simultaneous algorithms. Particularly, in a presently contemplated embodiment, the image reconstructor  performs iterative image reconstruction using OS and momentum. An OS-based iterative image reconstruction uses only a subset of the projection data per image update or sub-iteration. Accordingly, the measured data is divided into M subsets and each sub-iteration computes an update using only one subset of the data, thereby substantially reducing the computational effort and\/or memory access involved in the iterative image reconstruction. Furthermore, use of one or more momentum terms, for example, derived using Nesterov's algorithms accelerates the OS-based iterative image reconstruction towards a desired optimum.","Particularly, in one embodiment, the image reconstructor  combines the OS-based iterative image reconstruction with momentum terms to aid in achieving a convergence rate of O(1\/(Mk)) in early iterations, where k counts the number of iterations and M denotes the number of subsets. More specifically, the convergence rate of O(1\/(Mk)) may be achieved by combining OS-based iterative image reconstruction, for example, with Nesterov's momentum terms. In contrast, the convergence rate of the conventional OS-based iterative reconstruction is only O(1\/(Mk)) in early iterations. In certain embodiments, the image reconstructor  further combines separable quadratic surrogates (SQS) and\/or a non-uniform (NU) surrogate approach with momentum terms to allow for faster convergence even with a relatively small number of subsets.","In one embodiment, the image reconstructor  stores the images reconstructed using the OS-based iterative image reconstruction with the momentum terms in the storage device . Alternatively, the image reconstructor  transmits the reconstructed images to the computing device  for generating useful patient information for diagnosis and evaluation. In certain embodiments, the computing device  transmits the reconstructed images and\/or the patient information to a display  communicatively coupled to the computing device  and\/or the image reconstructor .","In one embodiment, the display  allows the operator to evaluate the imaged anatomy. The display  may also allow the operator to select a volume of interest (VOI) and\/or request patient information, for example, via graphical user interface (GUI) for a subsequent scan or processing. Further, the system  performs the iterative image reconstruction using projection data acquired from the selected VOI using a combination of OS methods with momentum terms. In one example, the momentum terms may be similar to the terms derived by Nesterov for general optimization problems that do not employ OS. An exemplary embodiment describing a method for fast iterative image reconstruction using OS and momentum will be described in greater detail with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"Additionally, embodiments of the exemplary method may also be practiced in a distributed computing environment where optimization functions are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a wired and\/or wireless communication network. In the distributed computing environment, the computer executable instructions may be located in both local and remote computer storage media, including memory storage devices.","Further, in , the exemplary method is illustrated as a collection of blocks in a logical flow chart, which represents operations that may be implemented in hardware, software, or combinations thereof. The various operations are depicted in the blocks to illustrate the functions that are performed, for example, during preliminary image update, momentum computation, and\/or subsequent image update phases of the exemplary method. In the context of software, the blocks represent computer instructions that, when executed by one or more processing subsystems, perform the recited operations.","The order in which the exemplary method is described is not intended to be construed as a limitation, and any number of the described blocks may be combined in any order to implement the exemplary method disclosed herein, or an equivalent alternative method. Additionally, certain blocks may be deleted from the exemplary method or augmented by additional blocks with added functionality without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. For discussion purposes, the exemplary method will be described with reference to the elements of .","Embodiments of the present method allow for substantial reduction in computational costs involved in the iterative image reconstruction. To that end, the present method employs OS and momentum to accelerate the iterative image reconstruction. Particularly, embodiments of the present method use only a subset of the projection data per iteration and one or more momentum terms derived from previous iterations to allow expeditious updates to the image estimates, thereby improving the image reconstruction speed.","For clarity, the present method is described here with reference to use of momentum terms determined using Nesterov's algorithms. However, implementation of the present method is not limited to the specific iterative reconstruction algorithm discussed in this description. In particular, the present method may be used to generate momentum terms, for example, using Aitken's acceleration or Steffensen's method. Further, the present method may be used to improve the performance of several other iterative reconstruction algorithms such as the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method, the grouped coordinate descent method, and line search methods. Additionally, the present combination of OS and momentum may also be employed for rapid solving of linear systems of equations and other sub-problems arising in image reconstruction algorithms involving variable-splitting and the augmented Lagrangian.","In one embodiment, an imaging system such as the CT system  of  or the system  of  may be configured to acquire projection data corresponding to a target region of a patient or a manufactured part. An image reconstruction unit such as the image reconstructor  of  may generate measured data, for example, sinogram data corresponding to the acquired projection data for use in subsequent image reconstruction. Alternatively, the measured data may correspond to coil data in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed using a multiple coil MRI system. At step , the measured data may be received from the imaging system. An iterative image reconstruction algorithm may then use the measured data to reconstruct one or more images of the target region using iterative updates.","Iterative X-ray CT reconstruction entails reconstructing an image x\u03b5Rfrom noisy measurements y\u03b5Rby minimizing a cost function \u03a8(x):\n\n{circumflex over ()}=argmin \u03a8().\n\n0\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Equation (1) represents an example of such a cost function \u03a8(x), where {circumflex over (x)} corresponds to a global (or local) minimizer of \u03a8(x), possibly with a non-negativity constraint.","In one embodiment, the cost function \u03a8(x) for X-ray CT reconstruction may be based on a convex and continuously differentiable penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) function. The PWLS cost function may be defined, for example, using equation (2):\n\n\u03a8()=\u00bd()\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere A corresponds to a projection operator (a matrix that characterizes the imaging system), W corresponds to a diagonal matrix that provides statistical weighting, and R(x) corresponds to a regularization function that may be non-quadratic and differentiable. Further, \u03b2 corresponds to a regularization parameter that balances between the data-fitting term \u00bd\u2225y\u2212Ax\u2225and the regularizer R(x).\n","However, due to the large-scale and ill conditioning of the CT image reconstruction problem, only certain iterative algorithms are well suited to minimize the cost function \u03a8(x). Minimizing the cost function \u03a8(x) entails determining a corresponding gradient. In one embodiment, the gradient of the PWLS cost function \u03a8(x) may be determined using equation (3):\n\n\u2207\u03a8()=()+\u2207()\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere A and A\u2032 correspond to forward-projection and back-projection operators, respectively.\n","Determining the gradient \u2207\u03a8(x) of the cost function \u03a8(x) using the projection operators A and A\u2032, however, is computationally expensive. Accordingly, certain CT systems employ OS algorithms to allow for approximation of the gradient \u2207\u03a8(x) using only a subset of measured projection data and a corresponding sub-projection operator. Use of subsets in lieu of the entirety of the measured projection data provides dramatic initial acceleration to the iterative image reconstruction. By way of example, use of the OS-SQS algorithm substantially accelerates the image reconstruction by simplifying the iterative image updates and allowing for substantial parallel computing. Using an NU optimization transfer scheme may further accelerate the OS-SQS and reduce the number of iterations.","Optimization Transfer Method","An optimization transfer method (also known as a majorize-minimize method) replaces the objective function \u03a8(x) with a surrogate \u03c6(x; x) at kth iteration that is easier to minimize. An exemplary iteration of optimization transfer is presented in equation (4) representative of Method 1.","Method 1","Initialize image x","For k=0, 1, 2, . . . .","Form a surrogate function (majorizer) \u03c6(x; x)\n\nMinimize the surrogate: =argmin\u03c6()\u2003\u2003(4)\n","Generally, the cost function \u03a8(x) may be monotonically decreased by using surrogates \u03c6(x; x) that are designed to satisfy one or more determined conditions. The determined conditions, for example, include:\n\n\u03a8()=\u03c6()\u03a8()\u2266\u03c6(),\u22000\u2003\u2003(5)\n","Although, in a presently contemplated implementation, the surrogates may be designed to strictly satisfy the determined conditions defined using equation (5), in other implementations, one or more other conditions may be employed.","Further, the cost function \u03a8(x) may be majorized, for example, using the following quadratic surrogate function \u03c6(x; x):\n\n\u03a8()\u2266\u03c6()=\u03a8()+\u2207\u03a8()\u2032()+\u00bd()\u2032()\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nwhere often D is designed such that equation (6) satisfies equation (5).\n","Accordingly, an iteration in equation (4) may be represented using equation (7):\n\n\u2207\u03a8()\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nwhere a majorizing matrix D may be derived, for example, using Lipschitz constant, De Pierro's lemma in NU-SQS algorithm, or other methods that yield a matrix that is easier to invert than the Hessian matrix of the original cost function.\n","The optimization transfer method with a diagonal majorizer D, as described herein, may be shown to have a convergence rate of O(1\/k), for example using Theorem 1.","Theorem 1\u2014The sequence {x} generated by Method 1 satisfies equation (8):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03a8","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}}}},{"mi":"\u03a8","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"^"}}}],"mo":"-"},"mo":"\u2264","mfrac":{"msubsup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf605","\uf606"],"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"0"}},"mo":"-","mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"^"}}},"mi":"D","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"k"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"8"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"The NU approach may accelerate the optimization transfer method, for example, by reducing the numerator \u2225x\u2212{circumflex over (x)}\u2225in equation (8) with respect to D in Theorem 1.

Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure employ momentum techniques to accelerate the optimization transfer methods for achieving a faster convergence rate, for example, of about O(1\/k), than conventional image reconstruction methods. Specifically, the NU approach may also be used with momentum-based optimization transfer methods to reduce the number of iterations needed.","Momentum-Based Optimization Transfer Methods","Optimization transfer methods may be accelerated by use of a momentum term.

The momentum term Zdepends on previous iterations {x}, {v}and {z}, thereby allowing the iterates to converge faster. Further, the parameter \u03c4controls the balance between vand z, and may be any real number. Moreover, xmay lie in a feasible region (for example, a non-negative orthant in equation (1)) if \u03c4has values within [0 1].

However, for X-ray CT, computing the (smallest) Lipschitz constant may entail extensive computations. Accordingly, the conventional Nesterov approach is poorly suited to X-ray CT reconstruction in practical settings such as in a hospital. In contrast, in the present disclosure, a combination of optimization transfer (for example, SQS, which replaces the ill-suited Lipschitz constant with a suitable diagonal matrix D) and momentum may be used to achieve faster convergence of the conventional momentum methods such as Nesterov's methods. Furthermore, as conventional momentum-based optimization transfer methods are slow due to either a large Lipschitz constant or a large (diagonal) majorizer D for the X-ray CT cost function \u03a8(x), embodiments of the present disclosure apply OS methods to momentum-based optimization transfer to achieve faster convergence. The OS methods are briefly described in the following section.","Ordered Subsets (OS)-Based Method","The OS-based iterative image reconstruction uses only a subset of the projection data per iteration, thereby substantially reducing the computational effort and\/or memory access involved in the iterative image reconstruction. In the OS-based image reconstruction, the cost function \u03a8(x) may be written as \u03a8(x)=\u03a3\u03a8(x) where \u03a8(x) is defined in equation (22):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00010","num":"00010"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u03a8","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf605","\uf606"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["y","m"]},"mo":"-","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["A","m"]},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"x"}}},"msub":{"mi":["W","m"]},"mn":"2"}},{"mfrac":{"mi":["\u03b2","M"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"22"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["m","m ","m "]},"Although the present embodiment describes use of the OS for image reconstruction, it may be noted that, as used herein, reference to the terms \u201cordered subsets\u201d or \u201cOS\u201d is not restricted to indicate a specific ordering typically used in tomographic imaging.

Additionally, the acceleration provided by one or more momentum terms allows use of fewer subsets (smaller M) than with standard OS methods, thus providing greater stability to the OS and momentum-based optimization transfer method.","Further, at step , at least one momentum term is determined based on one or more image variables computed in the particular iteration and\/or one or more further image variables computed in one or more iterations preceding the particular iteration.

Specifically, in one embodiment, iteratively determining the linear combination may include determining linear combinations of gradients of cost functions evaluated at the one or more further image variables computed in one or more iterations preceding the particular iteration, where the cost function corresponds to at least the subset of the measured data.","For discussion purposes, three exemplary versions of the OS and momentum-based methods are described by defining an approximate surrogate function \u03c8(x; \u2022) using the approximation defined in equation (23).

The embodiments described herein allow for substantial reduction in computational costs involved in the iterative image reconstruction through use of OS and momentum.

Faster image reconstruction may circumvent a need for multiple scans and\/or surgical intervention to assess a medical condition of a patient, thereby allowing for real-time diagnoses and providing substantial savings in computational effort and\/or medical resources.

For example, Aitken's acceleration or Steffensen's method may be used to determine momentum terms for use in accelerating the convergence of an iterative image reconstruction algorithm. The momentum terms may then be used to improve the performance of several other iterative reconstruction algorithms such as the PCG method, the grouped coordinate descent method, and line search methods.
