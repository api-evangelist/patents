{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for delivering content. In particular, it relates to the receiving of said content in the form of an instruction set of a markup language and distorting said content.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,185,625 discloses a system for enhancing data access over a communication link. The system for retrieving an object over a computer network includes a network client with a browser for rendering an object to a user and a user interface enabling the user to establish an encoding preference. A remote scaling server retrieves objects and encodes them according to the user specified encoding preference. The disclosed system thus enables users to dynamically influence the trade-off between quality of content and download speed. However, this system does not in any way distort the content, but simply allows the user to achieve a faster speed of data download by the well-known principle of compression through selective scaling of the data.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,122,657 discloses an Internet computer system with methods for dynamic filtering of hypertext tags and content. The system includes one or more web clients, each operating a web browser with an Internet connection to one or more web servers. Each client includes, interposed between its browser and communication layer, a filter module that traps and processes all communication between the browser and the communication layer. Again the application relates to methods for speeding up the process of browsing web content in a computer system having an Internet or other on-line browser. The system does not in any way distort the content.","Browsers usually aim to render the content to reflect the intentions of the author. This may not suit the requirements and interest of the end user.","It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved method of and apparatus for delivering content.","According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of delivering content comprising receiving content in the form of an instruction set of a markup language, distorting said content according to predetermined parameters, and rendering said content.","According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided apparatus for delivering content comprising receiving means for receiving content in the form of an instruction set of a markup language, distorting means for distorting said content according to predetermined parameters, and rendering means for rendering said content.","Owing to the invention, it is possible to deliver content that is distorted according to predetermined parameters. In this way a user can distort the content that they receive, to suit their mood or stylistic preferences.","Preferably, the rendering is by a browser distributed amongst a set of devices, and the content comprises data to be physically rendered. The predetermined parameters may be selected by a user, advantageously from a predefined list of generic expressions. The distorting is preferably either based upon a particular stylistic form or upon a set of personal preferences.","In the FIGURE, the apparatus comprises receiving means  for receiving content in the form of an instruction set  of a markup language. The apparatus also includes distorting means  for distorting the content according to predetermined parameters , and rendering means  for rendering the content.","In this embodiment, the language used is a language that gives high level descriptions of data to be physically rendered. For example, the instruction set  may comprise <FOREST>, <AUTUMN>, <WARM WEATHER>. This information is rendered by the rendering means , which is part of a browser distributed amongst a set of devices. This set of networked devices could be, for example, a television, audio equipment, a personal computer etc. and together the set of devices combine to create the effect described in the content . Each device provides elements towards the overall environment according to its functionality.","In an alternative embodiment, the rendering means is part of a single device, and converts the instruction set  into a number of device specific commands that are then communicated to those devices to create the external environment as described in the content .","The browser is deliberately designed to deliver the content  in a distorted form. For example, the distorting means  may distort the content based upon a particular stylistic form, e.g. cartoon exaggerated, film noir etc. Alternatively, the distortion may be based upon a set of user preferences, e.g. keep the noise down, more special effects please, make it jolly I'm depressed etc.","When dealing with content  that affects the environment around a user , rather than just on a screen, it is more important that all content  is rendered in a way that fits and matches the sensibilities of the user . The predetermined parameters  for distorting the content  are selected by the user . This input from the user  is shown schematically at  in the FIGURE. The user can select the predetermined parameters  from a list of generic expressions, for example, peaceful, moody, etc.","Therefore the user  has control over certain aspects of the content  that is delivered to them. In this way, for example, when a user  is watching a film, it may be provided with augmented data in the form of an instruction set of a markup language. The user  can select distortion of the augmented effects to reflect their mood or to choose a particular style that would compliment or contrast with the film.","The browser alters the mapping according to the distortion parameters . For example, if the original instruction set  included the term <LOUD>, and the user  has selected a preference for \u201ckeep the noise down\u201d, the mapping of <LOUD> would be altered so that the original volume level of, say, 8 will be reduced to 4. Essentially the same content is realised differently depending on the mapping modifiers.","Alternative and well-known languages can be used. The markup language could be, for example, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) or VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language)."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
