At block , a digital content delivery engine connects to a CRM database. At block , the digital content delivery engine connects to a mobile service provider or an aggregator. At block , the digital content delivery engine accesses multiple customer profiles in the CRM database. At block , for each of the customer profiles, the digital content delivery engine reads the customer profile at block  and at decision , the digital content delivery engine determines if the customer has opted-in to receive digital communications. In a most preferred embodiment, the digital communications are mobile marketing messages. However, those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that a customer may opt-in for other digital communications without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. Also at decision , the digital content delivery engine determines if the customer has at least one phone number listed in the customer profile. If the customer has opted-in and has at least one phone listed in the customer profile, then at block , for each phone number, a request is sent at block  from the digital content delivery engine to a mobile service provider or an aggregator for information on the carrier and the type of mobile communication device associated with the phone number. At block , the digital content delivery engine receives the carrier and type of mobile communication device. At decision , the digital content delivery engine determines if the phone number is a mobile number. If the phone number is for a mobile number, then at block , the digital content delivery engine saves the age of the number. If the number is not a mobile number, then the digital content delivery engine inquires at decision  if there are more phone numbers in the customer profile. If there are no more numbers to analyze, then the digital content delivery engine inquires at decision  if a mobile number was found. If no, then the digital content delivery engine analyzes another customer profile. If a mobile number was found, then at block  the digital content delivery engine selects the most recent phone number based on the age of the phone number. At block , an invitation engine is initiated to produce an invitation for the customer. At block , an invitation is sent to the customer's mobile communication device, preferably as a SMS or MMS message.","Mobile communication devices utilized with the present invention ca include mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, PDAs and the like.
