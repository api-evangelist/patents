The procedure of the formal reservation or the temporary reservation involves presenting the program information of the program pertaining to the detected program advertisement to the viewer (operator), making the query about the formal reservation or the temporary reservation for recording the program (steps S, S), conducting the formal reservation or the temporary reservation according to an instruction given from the viewer (operator) (step S; Yes, S, S; Yes, S). Therefore, the viewer of the TV broadcast, when the broadcasted program advertisement contains a viewer's favorite, can reserve the recording of this program simply by giving an executing instruction about the queried reservation.","Further, the EPG normally contains the program information related to the programs of one week or two weeks ahead. Hence, even when detecting the program advertisement of a program scheduled to be broadcasted further ahead of these time-spans, only the temporary reservation is to be made. The television PC  in the embodiment collates the reservation information on the temporary reservation with the EPG information on demand, and reregisters the reservation into the formal reservation with respect to the recording with the temporary reservation (steps S-S). Hence, according to the embodiment, the recording of the program scheduled to be broadcasted subsequent to one or two weeks ahead can be reserved.","Moreover, the broadcasting schedule time and date of the program scheduled to be broadcasted by the TV broadcasting station might be changed in case of occurrences of a war, an earthquake, a conflict and a disaster and due to congratulations and condolences of the VIPs, or an election. The television PC  in the embodiment checks whether the broadcasting schedule time and date with respect to the recording with the formal reservation made is changed or not (steps S, S, S; Yes, S) and, when the broadcasting schedule time and date is changed, changes also the details of the reservation for the recording (step S; No, S). Therefore, according to the television PC  of the embodiment, after the recording of an arbitrary program has been reserved, even when the broadcasting schedule time and date of the program is changed by the TV broadcasting station, it follows that the details of the reservation for the recording are automatically changed.","<<First Modified Mode>>","Note that the television PC  in the embodiment is the personal computer with the addition of the function for receiving the TV signals transmitted by the broadcasting station and outputting\/recording the broadcasted pictures. The television PC in the embodiment is just one embodiment, and whatever type of device equipped with the recording unit for saving the content broadcasted by the broadcasting station as the moving picture data on the recording medium is available in terms of carrying out this case. Such a device can be exemplified by a video recorder such as a DVD [Digital Versatile Disk] recorder and a hard disk recorder.","<<Second Modified Mode>>","Further, the television PC  in the embodiment acquires the text data from one-frame image data (steps S, S, S, S), then specifies the CM information having the predetermined degree of coincidence with the text data from within the plural items of CM information (step S, S; Yes, S, S, S; Yes, S), and collates the specified CM information with the EPG information (step S).","The target, of which the degree of coincidence with the text data is calculated, may not be, however, limited to the CM information such as this. For example, the television PC  may accumulate the titles of the programs of which the recording was reserved in the past in an unillustrated database, acquire the text data from the one-frame data, then detect the title of the program having the predetermined or higher degree of coincidence with the text data from the unillustrated database, and collate the detected title and the date contained in the text data with the EPG information.","Moreover, the television PC  in the embodiment may also acquire the text data from the one-frame image data, specify a Web page having the predetermined or higher degree of coincidence with the text data from the Web site of the TV broadcasting station which broadcasts the content concerned, acquires the title of the program from a URL [Uniform Resource Locator] of the Web page, and collate the acquired title and the time and date contained in the text data with the EPG information.","<<Third Modified Mode>>","Further, the television PC  in the embodiment presents the program advertisement being detected to the operator, and reserves the recording of the program in accordance with the instruction given from the operator. This scheme is effective in preventing the unnecessary program from being recorded. The recording of the program may also be, however, made without conducting the presentation to the operator such as this. With this contrivance, it follows that the operator's time-consuming operation of reserving the recording is further reduced.","<<Explanations of Units>>","In the embodiment discussed above, the respective units -within the television PC  may each be constructed of a software component and a hardware component and may also be constructed of only the hardware component.","The software component can be exemplified by an interface program, a driver program, a table and data and by a combination of some of these components. These components may be stored on a readable-by-computer medium that will be explained later on and may also be firmware that is fixedly incorporated into a storage device such as a ROM [Read Only Memory] and an LSI [Large Scale Integration].","Moreover, the hardware component can be exemplified by an FPGA [Field Programmable Gate Array], an ASIC [Application Specific Integrated Circuit], a gate array, a combination of logic gates, a signal processing circuit, an analog circuit and other types of circuits.

Moreover, the signal processing circuit may include circuit elements which execute addition, multiplication, subtraction, inversion, a sum-of-products operation, differentiation and integration of signal values. Further, the analog circuit may include circuit elements which execute amplification, addition, multiplication, differentiation, integration, etc.","Note that the components building up the units -within the television PC  described above are not limited to those exemplified above but may be other components equivalent thereto.","<<Explanation about Software and Program>>","In the embodiment discussed above, the TV software  in the television PC , the respective modules -, , and the respective tables , which build up the TV software  and the software components described above, may each include a software component, a procedure-oriented language based component, an object-oriented software component, class component, a component managed as a task, a component managed as a process, and elements such as a function, an attribute, a procedure (Procedure), a subroutine (software routine), a fragment or segment of a program code, a driver, firmware, a microcode, a code, a code segment, an extra segment, a stack segment, a program area, a data area, data, a database, a data structure, a field, a record, a table, a matrix table, an array, a variable and a parameter.","Further, the TV software  in the television PC , the respective modules -, , and the respective tables , which build up the TV software  and the software components described above, may each be described in a C-language, C++, Java (trademark of Sun Microsystems in U.S.A.), Visual basic (trademark of Microsoft Corp. in U.S.A.), Perl, Ruby and other programming languages.","Moreover, the instruction, the code and the data contained in the TV software  in the television PC , the respective modules -, , and the respective tables , which build up the TV software  and the software components described above, may be transmitted to or loaded into a computer and a computer incorporated into a machine or a system via a wired network card and a wired network or via a wireless card and a wireless network.","In the transmission or loading described above, the data signals flow via the wired network or the wireless network in the way of their being carried on, e.g., carrier waves. The data signals may also be, however, transferred intact as so-called baseband signals without depending on the carrier waves described above. These carrier waves are transmitted in an electric, magnetic or electromagnetic mode, an optical mode, an acoustic mode or other modes.","Herein, the wired network or the wireless network is a network built up by, e.g., a telephone line, a network line, a cable (including an optical cable and a metallic cable), a wireless link, a mobile phone access line, a PHS [Personal Handyphone System] network, a wireless LAN [Local Area Network], Bluetooth (trademark of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group), on-vehicle wireless type communications (including DSRC [Dedicated Short Range Communication]) and a network constructed of any one of those given above.

In this case, the program (program includes instructions of Computer) for realizing the function can be provided to the computer or the computer incorporated into the machine or the system via the readable-by-computer medium. The computer or the computer incorporated into the machine or the system reads the program from the storage area on the readable-by-computer medium and executes the program, thereby enabling the function thereof to be realized.","Herein, the readable-by-computer medium connotes a recording medium capable of accumulating information such as the program and the data by electrical, magnetic, optical, chemical, physical or mechanical action, and retaining the information in a readable-by-computer status.","The electrical or magnetic action can be exemplified by writing the data to the element on the ROM [Read Only Memory] constructed by use of a fuse. The magnetic or physical action can be exemplified by a phenomenon of toners to form a latent image on a paper medium. Note that the information recorded on the paper medium can be read, e.g., optically. The optical and chemical action can be exemplified by forming a thin film or a rugged portion on a substrate. Incidentally, the information recorded in the ruggedness-utilized mode can be read, e.g., optically. The chemical action can be exemplified by oxidation-reduction reaction on the substrate or forming an oxide film or a nitride film on a semiconductor substrate, or a photo-resist phenomenon. The physical or mechanical action can be exemplified by forming a rugged portion on an emboss card or forming a punch-hole in the paper medium.","Moreover, in the readable-by-computer mediums, some mediums can be detachably attached to the computer or the computer incorporated into the machine or the system. The attachable\/detachable readable-by-computer medium can be exemplified by a DVD (including DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM), a +R\/+WR, a BD (including BD-R, BD-RE, BD-ROM), a CD [Compact Disk] (including CD-R, CD-RW, CD-ROM), an MO [Magneto Optical] disk, other optical disk mediums, a flexible disk (including a floppy disk (Floppy is a trademark of Hitachi Ltd.)), other magnetic disk mediums, a memory card (CompactFlash (trademark of SanDisk Corp. in U.S.A.), SmartMedia (trademark of Toshiba Co., Ltd.), SD card (trademark of SanDisk Corp. in U.S.A., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. and Toshiba Co., Ltd.), Memory Stick (trademark of Sony Corp.), MMC (trademark of Siemens in U.S.A. and SanDisk Corp. in U.S.A.) etc), a magnetic tape and other tape mediums, and a storage device including, as a built-in component, any one of those mediums. Some of the storage devices include a built-in DRAM [Dynamic Random Access Memory] or SRAM [Dynamic Random Access Memory].","Furthermore, some of the readable-by-computer mediums are fixedly installed in the computer or the computer incorporated into the machine or the system. This type of readable-by-computer medium can be exemplified by a hard disk, a DRAM, an SRAM, a ROM, an EEPROM [Electronically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory] and a flash memory.","As broadly known, a TV broadcasting station in a private sector broadcasts an advertisement at an interval of broadcasting programs. The advertising broadcast is called a CM [Commercial Message], a TV commercial and a CF [Commercial Film], in which details thereof are advertisements of commercial articles or services provided to consumers by general enterprises and public relations (PR) of a government etc in many cases, however, the advertising broadcast might be an advertisement of a program scheduled to be broadcasted. A viewer of the TV broadcast can, when a favorite (program) is contained in the advertisements of the broadcasted programs, view this favorite program in a way that stores a broadcast schedule time and date and a channel of broadcasting the program advertisement which are notified during the program advertisement, and manually designates the broadcast schedule time and date and the channel with the aid of a recording function of a recording device (video recorder) or a so-called television personal computer or searches for the relevant program from within a TV program guide based on EPG [Electronic Program Guide] information to thereby reserve the recording of the advertised program. The manual operation of designating the broadcast schedule time and date and the channel and the operation of searching for the relevant program from within the TV program guide are highly time-consuming to the viewers.","According to the embodiment, the computer operates to, in the case of acquiring the program information for specifying the advertised program from within the pictures (video) based on the TV signals, register the reservation information based on the program information in the reservation information management table. Therefore, it follows that the recording of the program advertised in the advertisement broadcast is simply reserved.","It may be noted that the operation related to the recording reservation program disclosed above can be realized by a recording reservation method or a recording reservation device. Namely, this case may be a recording reservation method by which the computer executes, as a plurality of steps, the same functions as those of the respective unit of the recording reservation program described above, and may also be a recording reservation device including a plurality of unit functioning in the same way as these unit function. Further, this case may also be a readable-by-computer medium stored with the recording reservation program.","From what has been described so far, this case invention enables the recording of the program advertised in the advertisement broadcast to be simply reserved without taking any time-consuming operation.","All examples and conditional language recited herein are intended for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions, nor does the organization of such examples in the specification relate to a showing of the superiority and inferiority of the invention.
