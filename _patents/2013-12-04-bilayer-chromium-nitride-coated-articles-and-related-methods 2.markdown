The particular article also consists of a first chromium nitride material layer located upon the leveling material layer and having a first thickness, a first uniform chromium concentration and a first uniform nitrogen concentration. The particular article also consists of a second chromium nitride material layer located upon the first chromium nitride material layer and having a second thickness, a second progressively graded increasing chromium concentration and a second progressively graded decreasing nitrogen concentration.","A particular method in accordance with the embodiments includes forming over a substrate a first chromium nitride material layer having a first thickness, a first uniform chromium concentration and a first uniform nitrogen concentration. The method also includes forming over the substrate and upon the first chromium nitride material layer a second chromium nitride material layer having a second thickness, a second progressively graded increasing chromium concentration and a second progressively graded decreasing nitrogen concentration.","I. General Features of Bilayer Chromium Nitride Material Layer Coated Article and Method","Bilayer chromium nitride material layer coatings in accordance with the embodiments represent a substantial improvement over current coatings which are designed and intended to replace electroplated chromium coatings. In accordance with the embodiments, an innovative aspect of such bilayer chromium nitride material layer coatings is to deposit upon or over a substrate a first chromium nitride material layer which is primarily stoichiometric chromium nitride (CrN) (although the embodiments are not limited to stoichiometric chromium nitride) instead of pure chromium. Utilizing reactive magnetron sputtering (or reactive arc evaporation), a stoichiometric chromium nitride first chromium nitride material layer may be deposited directly upon an organic polymer substrate or a metal substrate to a thickness of at least about 200 nm. First chromium nitride material layer coatings thicker than 200 nm will exhibit better abrasion resistance, but will also be more costly to produce. Therefore, a preferred thickness range of a stoichiometric first chromium nitride material layer in accordance with the embodiments is from about 200 nm to about 1000 nm, and more preferably from about 300 nm to about 700 nm. Once the desired thickness of a first chromium nitride material layer has been reached, a second chromium nitride material layer is located and formed upon the first chromium nitride material layer to provide a bilayer chromium nitride material layer. A composition of the second chromium nitride material layer is altered as a function of a thickness of the second chromium nitride material layer (i.e., which is inherently if not implicitly or explicitly understood by a person skilled in the art as an increasing perpendicular distance to the first chromium nitride material layer). To that end, a chromium content within the second chromium nitride material layer is continuously increased and a nitrogen content within the second chromium nitride material layer is continuously decreased (i.e., as a function of increasing perpendicular distance to the first chromium nitride material layer which equals the second chromium nitride material layer thickness) until the surface of the second chromium nitride material layer (i.e., opposite an interface of the first chromium nitride material layer and the second chromium nitride material layer) is reached. The very surface of the second chromium nitride material layer may be 100% chromium (Cr) metal, and may not necessarily contain any chromium nitride alloy. This gradient (of CrN to Cr) that provides the second chromium nitride material layer should extend at least 100 nm in thickness, and generally in a range from about 100 nm to about 150 nm. An abrupt change from stoichiometric chromium nitride (CrN) to pure chromium (Cr) may result in a bilayer chromium nitride material layer that is prone to thermally induced cracking.","The embodiments are believed to provide a superior bilayer chromium nitride material layer insofar as stoichiometric chromium nitride (CrN) is known to have a higher coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in comparison with chromium (Cr), thus decreasing an amount of tensile stress in a bilayer chromium nitride material layer in accordance with the embodiments during thermal variations. Stoichiometric chromium nitride (CrN) is also well known as a crack resistant PVD coating when utilized in tribological applications, such as cutting tools. Stoichiometric chromium nitride (CrN) has a silver-gray appearance, but is substantially lower in reflectivity than electroplated chromium (\u02dc55% vs \u02dc74%). Thus, a reflective coating composed of stoichiometric chromium nitride (CrN) alone will generally appear too dark for most applications (unless one is attempting to create a \u201cdark chrome\u201d or \u201csmoked chrome\u201d effect, to which this particular bilayer chromium nitride material layer coating is very well suited). In accordance with the embodiments, an innovation is to gradually transition a second chromium nitride material layer within a bilayer chromium nitride material layer from a stoichiometric chromium nitride (CrN) to pure chromium (Cr) at the surface of the second chromium nitride material layer (or alternatively to a comparatively chromium rich chromium nitride at the surface of the second chromium nitride material layer). This creates a bilayer chromium nitride material layer which is both crack-resistant as well as brightly reflective (similar to electroplated chromium).","In magnetron sputtering an inert gas (usually argon) is required for bombarding a source metal target (Cr) causing ejected (sputtered) metal atoms and related species. If one mixes a partial pressure of nitrogen with the argon gas, the metal reacts with the nitrogen to form a metal-nitride at the surface of a substrate (i.e., via reactive sputtering). Within the context of the embodiments as described herein, the metal is chromium and the metal-nitride is chromium nitride. To create the aforementioned gradient layer near the surface of the second chromium nitride material layer, a ratio of nitrogen to argon is gradually reduced from 90% nitrogen\/10% argon to 100% argon while maintaining the same flow rate (approximately 200 sccm) within a deposition apparatus. Thus, the embodiments relate to an inexpensive and environmentally friendly bilayer chromium nitride material layer which when located and formed upon or over a metal substrate or an organic polymer substrate which gives substantially the same appearance and performance as a bright electroplated chromium layer, which involves hazardous materials in production.","As well, the embodiments also relate to an inexpensive and environmentally friendly method for forming a bilayer chromium nitride material layer upon or over a metal substrate or an organic polymer substrate which gives substantially the same appearance and performance as a bright electroplated chromium layer, which involves hazardous materials in production.","In an aspect, the embodiments use a bilayer chromium nitride material layer comprising a uniform first chromium nitride material layer and a graded second chromium nitride material layer located and formed over a substrate to provide an article that is formed from the resulting bilayer chromium nitride material layer coated substrate with enhanced reflectivity and inhibited cracking. Within the embodiments, the graded second chromium nitride material layer has an increasing (i.e., generally uniformly increasing) chromium concentration and a decreasing (i.e., generally uniformly decreasing) nitrogen concentration to in a particular embodiment yield a surface of highly reflective chromium and lower portions of variable coefficient of thermal expansion chromium nitride.","As is understood by a person skilled in the art, the embodiments do not require the use of a \u201cbasecoat\u201d layer of paint (i.e., such as but not limited to a leveling material layer) under the first chromium nitride material layer, as with other PVD chromium material layer coating methods. In addition, the embodiments also do not require a protective paint \u201cclear-coat\u201d over the chromium nitride material layer, since it has high abrasion and chemical resistance on its own.","A bilayer chromium nitride material layer coating in accordance with the embodiments may be deposited using commercially available vacuum coating systems without requiring any modifications. A bilayer chromium nitride material layer coated article in accordance with the embodiments may be produced at a cost less than an electroplated chromium layer coated article, and uses no environmentally hazardous chemicals or gases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As is illustrated within , the article in a first instance comprises a substrate . The substrate  may in general comprise any of several materials that are used in any of several industrial and consumer applications. In that regard, the substrate  may comprise materials selected from the group including but not limited to ceramic materials, metallic materials, organic polymer materials and composites of ceramic materials, metallic materials and organic polymer materials. As well, the substrate  may be used in consumer and industrial product applications such as but not limited to reflective product applications and automotive product applications. The substrate  may moreover comprise any of several form factors, and although illustrated as a flat substrate within  the substrate  need not necessarily be a flat substrate, but the substrate  may rather comprise a topographic substrate such as but not limited to a curved surface substrate.","As is also illustrated in , the substrate  has located and formed thereupon and thereover a leveling material layer  (i.e., a planarizing material layer), which is typically and preferably formed to a thickness from about 1,000 nm to about 25,000 nm. The leveling material layer  may comprise a leveling material selected from the group including but not limited to organic polymer leveling materials and inorganic metal oxide leveling materials such as but not limited to sol-gel derived metal oxide leveling materials.","As is also illustrated in , the leveling material layer  has located and formed thereupon and thereover a first chromium nitride material layer . Within the context of the embodiments the first chromium nitride material layer  has a first thickness, a first uniform chromium concentration and a first uniform nitrogen concentration. Within the embodiments, the first thickness is preferably from about 200 to about 1000 nanometers. As well, the first uniform chromium concentration and the first uniform nitrogen concentration are equal in atomic concentration and intended to provide a stoichiometric chromium nitride (i.e., CrN) material layer, although the embodiments are also intended as operative when using non-stoichiometric chromium nitride materials as a starting point.","Finally,  shows a second chromium nitride material layer  located and formed upon and over the first chromium nitride material layer . Within the embodiments, the second chromium nitride material layer  has a second thickness, a second progressively increasing chromium concentration and a second progressively decreasing nitrogen concentration. Within the context of the embodiments, the second thickness is from about 100 to about 150 nm. As well, the second progressively increasing chromium concentration is intended in a particular instance to yield pure chromium for the last 10 nm to 20 nm of the second chromium nitride material layer. In an alternative, the second progressively increasing chromium concentration is intended in another particular instance to yield a chromium rich chromium nitride material at the last portion of the second chromium nitride material layer . Such a comparatively chromium rich chromium nitride material may have a chromium:nitrogen atomic ratio from about 1:0.7 to about 1:0.2.","As is described above, a bilayer chromium nitride material layer in accordance with the embodiments (i.e., including the first chromium nitride material layer  and the second chromium nitride material layer ) provides a bilayer chromium nitride material layer coated article with superior reflectivity properties and crack resistance properties.","II. Process Conditions for Forming Bilayer Chromium Nitride Material Layer Coated Article","In a first instance, the following listing enumerates manufacturing preferred guidelines for preparing a bilayer chromium nitride material layer coated article in accordance with the embodiments.\n\n","Although included in the embodiment above, the organic leveling material layer base coating may not be required if the surface condition of the substrate is sufficient to yield a desired surface quality of a finished product bilayer chromium nitride material layer coated article. Therefore, the embodiments are not intended as limited to leveling material layer base coated substrate surfaces, and thus the embodiments shall cover the application of the embodied bilayer chromium nitride material layer coating directly upon a substrate. It should also be noted that an organic polymer leveling material layer base coating applied to an organic polymer substrate may actually increase a surface hardness of the organic polymer substrate. The surface hardness of the organic polymer substrate is known to have an effect on the abrasion resistance of the entire substrate-bilayer chromium nitride material layer system. Higher surface hardness translates to improved abrasion resistance in the finished bilayer chromium nitride material layer article. Thus although not required by the embodiments, the inclusion of the organic polymer leveling material layer base coating is frequently desirable.","Further, it is also possible to practice the embodied method when an organic polymer substrate is first planarized with an inorganic leveling material layer, such as but not limited to an SiOor related inorganic metal oxide leveling material layer. Thus, a leveling material layer, if present, need not be an organic leveling material layer in composition, but can rather include any type of leveling material composition technology such as but not limited to metallic, glass, crystalline, and others, and shall not be limited to those in any particular embodiment.","It is further known that deposition of chromium in a physical vapor deposition chamber acts as a \u201cgetter\u201d for contaminant gasses. Therefore, although achieving an initial vacuum of <8\u00d710e-5 torr is preferred; the embodiments can be carried out at initial pressures substantially higher than this.","In the above embodiments, a goal is to fabricate an article comprising a bright reflective film consistent with look of an electroplated chromium layer. However, if an objective evolves to create a darker layer such as a layer with the look of \u201cplated nickel\u201d or \u201cdark chrome\u201d the color and brightness of a bilayer chromium nitride material layer in accordance with the embodiments may be altered by terminating the gradient within a second chromium nitride material layer at any ratio of nitrogen to argon. This produces a range of color and brightness from the dark chrome (\u02dc54% reflective) to full chrome brightness (\u02dc76% reflective).","Further, it is contemplated within the embodiments that the bilayer chromium nitride material layer in accordance with the embodiments may be applied to an organic polymer substrate since this particular application may have commercial value. However, the embodiments shall not be limited to organic polymer substrates. Inorganic substrates such as but not limited to glasses, ceramics, crystals and metals are also contemplated as viable substrates within the context of the embodiments.","III. Functional Performance for Bilayer Chromium Nitride Material Layer Coated Articles","In order to evaluate viability of the bilayer chromium nitride material layer in accordance with the embodiments, several functional tests were performed upon appropriately prepared samples. Particular test samples, test methods and test results are provided below.","A. Stress Cracking Test","Several polycarbonate test samples were tested to determine resistance to stress induced cracking upon fabrication. To that end, sputtered metallic layers, including bilayer chromium nitride material layers in accordance with the embodiments, were either applied directly upon the polycarbonate substrates or over polycarbonate substrates upon which were first deposited a leveling material layer. Metallic coating layers tested included: (1) a single chromium layer (Cr); (2) a second chromium (Cr) layer over a first chromium nitride (CrN) layer with a discrete interface; and (3) a second layer of graded chromium nitride\/chromium (CrN\u2014Cr) over a monolithic chromium nitride (CrN) first layer.","As illustrated in Table I, the only metallic layer coatings which remained crack-free were those consisting of a bilayer graded chromium nitride material layer coating of CrN\u2014Cr over CrN. These bilayer chromium nitride material layer coatings remained crack-free when directly deposited on polycarbonate or on base-paint leveling material layer prepared polycarbonate substrates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0049"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Substrate","Base","1st PVD",{},"Layer",{},{}]},{"entry":["Mat'l","Paint","Layer","2nd PVD Layer","interface","Top Paint","Result"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Polycarbonate","Yes","chromium","None","N\/A","no","cracking"]},{"entry":["Polycarbonate","Yes","CrN","Chromium","discrete","no","cracking"]},{"entry":["Polycarbonate","Yes","CrN","CrN\u2014Cr","graded","no","no cracking"]},{"entry":["Polycarbonate","No","chromium","None","none","no","cracking"]},{"entry":["Polycarbonate","No","CrN","Chromium","discrete","no","cracking"]},{"entry":["Polycarbonate","No","CrN","CrN\u2014Cr","graded","no","no cracking"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The crack-free samples were subjected to the following functional tests, and all of the crack-free samples remained crack-free throughout the following functional tests.","1.
