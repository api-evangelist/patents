Technical Field","The present invention relates, in general, to Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, and, more particularly, to a system and method for supporting information interoperability between medical instruments which is capable of automatically combining medical test information measured by a plurality of medical instruments for performing data communication in compliance with various data interface protocols with the medical information of an EMR system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Due to the development of information and communication technology, computer-based patient recording has become popularized in the medical field. Medical information includes not only personal text information, such as family clinical history records, past clinical history records and metal disease records, but also image information, such as X-rays. This type of medical information is being freely moved between internal and external computers and between medical institutions over communication networks.","Representative systems for processing and managing such medical information include EMR systems and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACSs). An EMR system is a system which is capable of putting medical examination and treatment records such as hospital admission records, first ambulatory examination records, second ambulatory examination records, problem lists, development records, surgery\/anesthesia records, hospital discharge summaries, consultative medical examination and treatment records and special treatment records, nursing records such as prescription and performance records, nursing histories, clinical observation records, special measurement records, nursing procedures, discharge nursing records, surgery nursing records and recovery nursing records, patients' affairs department records such as patient basic information and patient reception information, medical examination and treatment support records such as patient test results, and prescription records such as medicine\/injection prescription, test prescription and treatment\/surgery prescription records, into an integrated database and then managing all information of patients without requiring charts in an integrated manner. Accordingly, the EMR system provides advantages in that the chart management cost, the manpower cost and various types of costs for printing can be reduced because medical, nursing, patients' affairs department, prescription and patient test result data, etc. which were manually recorded in charts in relevant periods are computerized and managed without using charts, and in that medical accidents can be prevented, the efficiency of medical examination and treatment can be improved and redundant work can be reduced, and business and management based on various types of statistics can be efficiently performed because interoperability is automatically applied to various types of information about patients.","A PACS is an image storage and transmission system, and is a system which stores and manages captured medical images in the form of digital data without requiring films required by conventional analog medical imaging instruments such as X-ray machines and Computed Tomography (CT) machines. A PACS provides the advantage of avoiding expenses required for the management and purchase of films because films are not required, and the advantage of improving the efficiency of medical examination and treatment because captured medical images can be viewed and diagnoses can be made from anywhere.","However, a conventional EMR system computerizes only text-based information manually recorded by doctors, nurses, patients' affairs department staffs, etc., but has the problem of not supporting interoperability between the pieces of test information measured by a plurality of medical instruments having various data interface standards. That is, since a plurality of medical instruments have different data interface standards, they cannot operate in conjunction with an EMR system.","Furthermore, in order to manage test information measured by medical instruments using the EMR system, a problem arises in that the test information manually measured must be digitized, so that time and man power are required, and this required man power results in high expenses.","In order to solve the problem, respective medical instruments require gateway devices for digitizing measured test information, as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , the typical medical measurement data interoperability EMR system includes gateway devices  connected to a plurality of medical instruments  having various data interface standards via data interface units  corresponding to the medical instruments , and configured to convert a received measured signal into the data format required by an EMR system  and send it over a local network , a database  configured to store EMR information, and a hospital server  configured to record the resulting measured information, from the medical instruments , in the database  in association with the EMR information.

In this case, the integrated gateway device  may simultaneously send a plurality of medical measurement commands to different medical instruments. A medical measurement command includes medical instrument information and an operation command.","The medical instrument  having received the medical measurement command performs medical measurement in conformity with an operation command included in the received medical measurement command, and sends medical measurement result information based on the performed measurement to the integrated gateway device  at step S. The medical measurement result information may further include medical instrument information depending on a medical instrument.","The integrated gateway device  having received the medical measurement result information sends received medical test completion information to the hospital server  at step S. The medical test completion information, as shown in , includes medical instrument information, doctor-in-charge information, medical instrument user information, patient information, and medical measurement result information. Furthermore, the medical instrument information includes information about the unique number of a medical instrument, the name of a medical instrument, a purchase\/production year or registration year, and the number of tests.","Furthermore, when receiving the medical measurement result information, the integrated gateway device  further creates failure diagnosis information by analyzing whether an error has occurred in the state of communication with the corresponding medical instrument  and the medical measurement result data based on the medical measurement command. Thereafter, the integrated gateway device  includes the created failure diagnosis information in the medical test completion information, as shown in , and sends the resulting data to the hospital server .","The hospital server  analyzes the medical test completion information received at step S, and stores the measured data obtained by the medical instrument  in association with the EMR of a corresponding patient stored in the database .","The integrated gateway device  is configured to send the waiting lists for respective medical instruments only to the hospital server . In this case, the user terminal  logs in to the hospital server  over the wired\/wireless network  and checks the waiting lists for respective medical instruments.","Meanwhile, it will be easily understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited only to the above-described typical preferred embodiments, but the present invention may be variously modified, varied, replaced or added within the range of the gist of the present invention. As long as the performance of the modification, variation, replacement or addition pertains to the scope of the attached claims, the technical spirit thereof must be considered to pertain to the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
