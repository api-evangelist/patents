{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to and claims priority to copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/174,422, entitled \u201cVisual Group Interface for Group Connectivity,\u201d filed Jun. 18, 2002, of which the present application is a continuation-in-part, and which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all that it teaches without exclusion.","This invention relates generally to online group interactions over a network and, more particularly, relates to a system and method for capturing and exposing a history related to one or more online group interactions.","Computer technology and the Internet have taken on increasingly important roles in people's lives, and computer users are beginning to expect not only increased productivity, but also increased recreational and personal opportunities. Online group interaction applications have begun to fulfill some of these expectations. One example of such an online group interaction application is given in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/230,247, entitled System And Method For Shared Integrated Online Social Interaction, filed Aug. 28, 2002, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all that it teaches without exclusion. Typically, a user accesses the group interaction application via a desktop icon or otherwise on their computer (sometimes referred to as a \u201cmachine\u201d or other computing device). Through the application, the user has immediate interactive access to a group of online friends. Group members may engage in a number of shared activities including photograph sharing and viewing, and shared listening of audio material, such as a recitation or recording of interest. In addition, shared chatting, browsing, planning, scheduling, and so on are also desirable to some users. Many other shared activities are possible as well, and although the present description will focus primarily on certain activities, it will be understood that the disclosed principles are applicable to other types of activities, including but not limited to those described in the copending applications identified above.","During a shared activity, the group interaction application ensures that each online member sees the same representation of the shared activity as additions and changes are made. One mechanism for synchronizing the presentation to each member is a peer-to-peer network, although other connection mechanisms, including those with centralized switching or storage, are also usable.","Although such online group interaction applications have increased users' sense of connection and community when interacting via computing devices, the online experience can at times be disjointed and artificial, such as for example when members of a persistent group are not available online at a given point in time. For such occasions, as well as others as will be described, it is desirable to have a mechanism for maintaining a sense of shared history.","The present invention is directed to a technique for automatically capturing a shared history of online group interactions, wherein the shared history is synchronized and is available to each group member. In an embodiment of the invention, the display of the shared history is limited such that only a subset of past transactions is displayed. Through the group history, a user that has been away from the group online activities can catch up with what the group has been doing while the user was away or offline. Essentially, group activities and file sharing are captured to create a sense of group history. In an embodiment of the invention, the history is displayed in such a way as to provide an overview or \u201cpulse\u201d of what has happened in the past. In a further embodiment of the invention, group members can leave things behind for other \u201caway\u201d members via the group history. By automatically recording group events such as group changes, shared activities and shared files, a group can maintain a sense of shared history and build memories together.","Users have several ways of viewing what they have missed, ranging from a general overview of one's entire social network to detailed information of a specific group. For example, three possible view types include a social network pulse view, several group history graphical views, and a group history list view.","History items may be accessible by the viewing user. For example, in an iconic view, clicking on an icon can open the particular history item. Moreover, multiple events may happen within a single activity. Thus, history items can represent a combination of one or more things that happened at a given time. For example, a history item that represents a shared video experience may also include voice comments, graphical comments, etc. made during the video so that the accessing user gets a better sense of the group experience at that time.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.","The invention pertains to online group interaction over a computer network and to a novel system and method for maintaining and providing a shared group history. The invention thus operates in a computer environment. In an embodiment of the invention, the described process operates on a collection of one or more computing devices. A suitable computing device usable in implementing all or some aspects of the invention will be first described with reference to , after which a network environment according to particular embodiments of the invention will be more fully described.","Although there are many computing devices suitable for implementing the invention, several exemplary types of computing devices are discussed below with respect to . It will be appreciated that this explanation is given for ease of understanding and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","Although not required, the invention will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","Turning now to , a general purpose computing device is shown in the form of a conventional computer , including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus  comprises one or more physical busses of any of several types of bus structure including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM . The computer  further includes a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk , a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media.","The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical disk drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk , a removable magnetic disk , and a removable optical disk , it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories, read only memories, storage area networks, and the like may also be used in the exemplary operating environment. A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk , magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM  or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data .","A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB) or a network interface card. A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor, computers may include other peripheral output devices, not shown, such as speakers and printers.","The computer  operates in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be a domain controller, server, a router, a network PC, a personal computer, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the local network  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN . The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via the serial port interface . Program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device if such is present. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Herein, the invention will generally be described with reference to acts and symbolic representations of operations that are performed by one or more computers, unless indicated otherwise. As such, it will be understood that such acts and operations, which are at times referred to as being computer-executed, include the manipulation by the processing unit of the computer of electrical signals representing data in a structured form. This manipulation transforms the data or maintains it at locations in the memory system of the computer, which reconfigures or otherwise alters the operation of the computer in a manner well understood by those skilled in the art. The data structures where data is maintained are physical locations of the memory that have particular properties defined by the format of the data. However, while the invention is being described in the foregoing context, it is not meant to be limiting as those of skill in the art will appreciate that various of the acts and operations described hereinafter may also be implemented in hardware. In the following discussion, computing devices may be as described above with respect to  regarding computer  and\/or remote computer , or may alternatively have any other type of architecture, design, and\/or operation. The computer operations described herein are executed pursuant to reading of computer-readable instruction from a computer-readable medium by a computer or computing device. Computer-readable media include optical, magnetic, electrical and other types of media, as well as storage media, transmission media, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","201","2","203","3","205","4","207","5","209","201","203","205","207","209","213","203","209","213","201","203","205","207","209"]},"The computers , , , ,  are used by individual users to interact with other individual users of other ones of the computers , , , , . Typically, each computer , , , ,  will have running thereon a group interaction application usable to display a representation of a group interaction space, and to update that representation or the representations on other user machines via the network . The group interaction application also exposes elements through which the user can interact with the rest of the online group, such as by adding or modifying content, annotating content, communicating with other members, etc.","In addition to the aforementioned components, a server computer  is connected or connectable to network  in an embodiment of the invention, although it is excluded in an alternative embodiment of the invention. One purpose of the server computer , when used, is to store the state of the group, e.g., networking data, membership data, etc., and\/or to store group data, e.g., shared content, projects, etc. In the alternative embodiment of the invention wherein the server  is not used, the network  is a peer-to-peer network, with the state of the group and the group data being stored on the member machines , , , , . Note that although five machines and one server are illustrated, this configuration is simply an example, and any number of machines and\/or servers, when used, may be included. Furthermore, although the network is illustrated in a manner often associated with large switched networks, any type of networking technology may be used. Furthermore, in a peer-to-peer network, certain computers may only be able to access other computers by going through an intermediary, which may or may not be one of the group member access machines.","Referring to , the group interaction application  resides in active computer memory  with a group activity module , an operating system , and networking resources  for the computer. The group interaction application  interacts with the group activity module  to determine what content to display at any given moment to the user of the particular computer. In addition, the group interaction application  uses the networking resources  via the operating system  to communicate with other user machines, such as for sharing data, including history data or updates, and synchronizing the user views. The history maintenance, synchronization, and display steps described hereinafter are performed in an embodiment of the invention by one or both of the group interaction application  and the group activity module . The peer-to-peer infrastructure may be provided by the operating system  in an embodiment of the invention, but such is not required.","A sense of group history is important for users in enriching relationships, building memories and helping users feel connected at all times no matter how many group members are, or are not, online. In various embodiments of the invention, users are provided with different ways of viewing what they have missed from online interactions, from a general overview of one's entire social network down to detailed information regarding a specific group. Three possible views discussed below include a social network pulse view, a group history graphical view, and a list view, as well as combination views.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["401","403","405","403","407","405"]},"In the illustrated example, the cursor  has been rolled over a particular one  of the shapes in the history visualization section . The selected shape  corresponds to files received in the particular example, and thus a pop-up box  shows the exact number (e.g., 8) of received files for a particular period, such as since the user was last online. Note that in an embodiment of the invention, the size, shape, and\/or extent of each shape is modified to reflect the number of transactions in the associated category. For example, in the illustrated interface , the shapes are waveforms. In an embodiment of the invention, the height, length and\/or area of a wave may be increased or decreased proportionately relative to the other waves to reflect a greater or lesser number of transactions of the type associated with the wave. Thus, the illustrated overview or \u201cpulse\u201d view allows the user to quickly get a general sense of the type and quantity of missed transactions so that they can decide whether to check the group history, or whether to spend more or less time online. In addition, the overview provides a quick measure of popularity, in that a greater number of missed transactions would indicate a greater degree of interest in the other group members in getting in touch with the particular user. Mechanisms for tracking missed transactions are discussed below with reference to . In an embodiment of the invention, the history visualization portion  of the bar  can be \u201cundocked\u201d from the bar and expanded to show in greater detail what the user has missed over a longer period such as the past several days or weeks.","Before discussing further embodiments of the invention, other features of the user interface  will be briefly discussed for ease of understanding and later reference. In particular, the user interface  further comprises in an embodiment of the invention a menu bar , a user area , a contacts area , a \u201ccircle\u201d or groups area , and a \u201ccommunities\u201d area . The user area  is usable to display and control the status of the user, e.g., \u201conline,\u201d \u201coffline,\u201d etc. The particular user may be online with respect to a network generally without being \u201conline\u201d with respect to one or more groups. The contacts area  displays the names and icons of one or more currently online contacts, i.e. individual entities, and the \u201ccircle\u201d or groups area  displays the names and icons of one or more currently online groups, i.e. small (around 5-10 members) distinct groups of individuals, at least one of whom is online currently. Finally, the \u201ccommunities\u201d area  displays the name and icon associated with any currently online community, i.e., a large distinct groups of individuals, at least one of whom is online currently. While the terms \u201cgroup\u201d and \u201ccircle\u201d are synonymous herein, whereas the term \u201ccommunity\u201d implies a larger collection, the distinction between groups (or circles) and communities is not important herein, and the term \u201cgroup\u201d when used will refer to any of the above. In the illustrated example, any group icon may be associated with specific status icons such as elements , , . Of particular interest herein is an icon such as icon  which indicates that the associated group has recent history for the user to view.","Although the pulse view is a quick and convenient way for the user to get an overview of their social situation, the user may wish to view specific transactions associated with specific groups or contacts rather than to just get an overview of how much activity has occurred generally. In an embodiment of the invention, the user clicks on (e.g., right-clicks a mouse with cursor suitably positioned) the group icon and selects a \u201chistory\u201d option from a menu to access and view more information. Group history encompasses information like changes to the group (who has joined or left the group), snapshots of shared activities like photo sharing and shared listening activities, messages etc. sent to the group and any files being shared.","In an embodiment of the invention, all such items related to group activity are automatically recorded and saved as group history via mechanisms such as those discussed below with reference to . Over time, items may expire according to an embodiment of the invention, or users may be able to delete items as needed according to another embodiment of the invention. If a user has been away or offline, they will get a notification that a new item has been recorded in the group's history in an embodiment of the invention. Double clicking any item shown in the group history will open the file in the appropriate group activity according to an embodiment of the invention. For example, photographs are automatically opened in the photo sharing module or application in which they originally were shared.","There are a number of ways in which to display the group history information according to various embodiments of the invention. There are both graphical and textual formats. One graphical format for presenting the group history information according to an embodiment of the invention displays a visual snapshot of the most recent events and files that the group has shared in either a timeline view or in a collage manner similar to a corkboard in a dormitory room. An exemplary timeline view according to an embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the user interface of . In particular, the interface  includes a timeline  representing a period of time. In the illustrated example, the timeline includes the present time. User selectable actuators ,  are usable to scroll the timeline to view a different time frame. A number of icons such as those labeled  are tied to the timeline  via lead lines so that the user can see when the particular items arose or were shared. In an embodiment of the invention, the icons include both sent and received transactions. For example, a file that the user has shared and a file that the user received will both be represented by icons in the interface . In an embodiment of the invention, the icon  itself is adapted to convey the nature of the history item. For example, photographs may be represented by thumbnails of the actual picture, and text documents may be represented by the icon associated with a text editor, such as the Word\u00ae program produced by Microsoft\u00ae Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","Note that in the illustrated embodiment of the invention, the group history is accessed via a tab  in a group manager interface for a particular one of the user's groups. Other tabs available within the manager, if any, may include such things as general group information (tab ), available shared files (tab ), and a listing of group members (tab ).","An alternative \u201ccollage\u201d view of history items for the group is shown in . In the collage view, the user interface  has a space  within which various icons such as those labeled  are displayed. As with the timeline view, the icons represent items of group history and the aspects and embodiments discussed with respect to  apply as well to . The icons  may appear in time order, or may be generally but not precisely time-ordered. As with the interface , several tabs , , ,  may be available to access various types of information regarding the group. In addition, selectable actuators ,  similarly facilitate user access to different time frames.","In an embodiment of the invention, items shown in the interfaces ,  are filterable by type or number. In addition, tool tips may be displayed in an embodiment of the invention whenever the user rolls over an item ,  to provide additional information such as file type, date\/time sent and group member. By having a graphical view of items, the experience is more tangible and enjoyable since users can quickly see how much they have missed.","While having a graphical presentation of recent events and items shared is a fun experience, over time users may need a more efficient and precise way of managing the group history. To meet this need, a list view of all events and shared files gives users a familiar management tool. In particular, the list view organizes items in the list by properties such as filename, type, date\/time, and user. By clicking on the name of an item in the list view, the item is expanded to display to the user additional information and\/or to display user tools for acting on the items with such operations as save, view, or delete.","In an embodiment of the invention, a user can select which type of view, graphical or list, they desire. A user-selectable actuator is provided for this purpose in an embodiment of the invention. However, in a further embodiment of the invention, a graphical view is combined with a list view in a single screen. Such an embodiment of the invention is shown in . In particular, the user interface  comprises a graphical view area  and a list view area . The graphical view area  appears and functions as described above with respect to either of  or otherwise. The list view area  appears and functions in the same manner as described above for the stand-alone list view. Note that the group history may, in this embodiment of the invention as well, be available via a tab  in the group manager interface, with other tabs , ,  being selectable as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["801","803"]},"In addition, the expiration date\/time of each record is set via the functions supplied for this purpose in the peernet or other peer-to-peer infrastructure technology. With respect to the particular expiration data\/time, this is a matter of application policy. For example, greetings and other minor and\/or common occurrences may be given a shorter lifetime than major interactions such as media sharing sessions. With respect to peernet, an absolute expiration date\/time for each history item is calculated by adding the desired time-to-live to the current date\/time.","All such records are synchronized between online group member machines during the session. In an embodiment of the invention, the group history file is also updated at a central server if such is used.","Note that as discussed above some group members may not be online at the time that the transaction occurs. Thus, at step , a previously offline group member goes online, and at step  the peer-to-peer or other infrastructure is used to update and synchronize the group history file (e.g., record) on the newly online member's machine. For example, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, peernet provides functions specifically for updating records when a member comes online (e.g. PeerGraphUpdateRecord), and such are preferably used to perform this step. The update information may originate from another member machine in the peer-to-peer architecture, or from a central server if such is used. In the latter embodiment of the invention, a particular user may receive a history update even when no other member is online.","At step , the process terminates. As a result, a synchronized group history related to online group transactions is maintained and is accessible. The group history information so maintained is available to users, e.g., via a user interface as discussed above. Note however, that for a given user some history items may not be displayed. For example, even though each member has on his or her machine the same group history file once synchronization for each member has occurred, it may be desirable to limit some or all members' access to certain information. For example, it may be desirable as a matter of policy to show only those non-expired items that occurred after the particular user became a member. This limitation is enforced locally by the group interaction application or other application when presenting the group history.","With respect to the \u201cpulse\u201d view of missed transactions, the local group interaction application or other application determines which events represented in the synchronized peer records (e.g. group history file) were missed by the particular user. In order to do this, the indications of member identity that have been placed in the records as discussed above are examined. If the particular user's identification is not represented in a given record, then this indicates the user was not a participant in the particular activity represented by the record.","Through the group history, members who were offline when an online group interaction transaction occurred can maintain a sense of belonging and community. Moreover, members who were present during the transaction(s) in question can also use the group history to relive the online group activity or to review items of interest. In an embodiment of the invention, the group history is exposed and treated as a \u201cGroup Space,\u201d e.g. a shared online corkboard. In this embodiment of the invention, the group space is not only readable by users, but is also writable by users. That is, in addition to the automatic population of the group history data as discussed above, users can also directly place items into the group history for others to see now or later, much like a corkboard. The interface for such interaction is as described above in an embodiment of the invention, with the additional understanding that files may also be placed in the history, such as by dragging and dropping into the space (e.g., , , , ). Thus, for example, group members can use the group history in order to leave each other artifacts. Members can add a sticky note, magnetic poetry, stickers, or browse their files to share tools attached to the corkboard. Members can drag and drop any type of document or file onto the \u201ccorkboard\u201d (group history user interface) including photos, text documents, memory cubes, sound files, etc. and determine actual placement and rotation on the board. Files appear as a default file type icon in an embodiment of the invention, or as thumbnails in an alternative embodiment of the invention.","It will be appreciated that an improved system and method for maintaining and accessing a shared group history for an online group interaction application have been described. In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of this invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the embodiments described herein with respect to the drawing figures are meant to be illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of invention. For example, those of skill in the art will recognize that some elements of the illustrated embodiments shown in software may be implemented in hardware and vice versa or that the illustrated embodiments can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from the spirit of the invention.
