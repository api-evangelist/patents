title: Allocation strategies for storage device sets
abstract: A storage device set may allocate capacity for spaces (e.g., logical volumes) according to an allocation strategy, e.g., allocating capacity from the storage device having the greatest available capacity, or maximizing the distribution of allocated capacity across the storage devices. However, such allocation strategies may be inefficient (e.g., limiting the capability of the storage device set to satisfy subsequent requests with constraints such as a minimum distribution of capacity across several storage devices). The techniques presented herein achieve efficient allocation by first allocating capacity on storage devices having ample available capacity using a round-robin technique, and if such storage devices do not satisfy the capacity request, allocating capacity on storage devices having limited available capacity. Additionally, the techniques presented herein facilitate thin provisioning through capacity reservations, wherein storage devices withhold unallocated storage for particular spaces that may be utilized as a reserve if unreserved capacity is exhausted.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Within the field of computing, many scenarios involve a storage device set comprising a set of storage devices that are configured to store data sets on behalf of various processes. The storage capacity of the storage devices may be manifested on computer systems as a set of logical volumes, and the interoperation of the storage devices may enable more variations than independently operating storage devices; e.g., the entire storage capacity may be manifested a single logical volume, regardless of which storage device contains a particular data set, or a set of logical volumes may be generated with an arbitrary relationship with the storage devices upon which the capacity for a particular logical volume is physically located. The interoperation of the storage devices may also provide additional features, such as automated storage redundancy that may provide data recovery and availability in case a storage device of the storage device set becomes inaccessible; error detection and\/or correction through automated checksum calculation that may enable recoveries from data corruption or reconstruction of lost data; and parallel access to a data set through a plurality of storage devices that may provide greater throughput to a storage device set than access through a single storage device.","In some of these scenarios, access to the storage device set may be provided as a set of spaces (respectively representing, e.g., a logical volume, a storage journal, or a metadata set facilitating the maintenance of the storage device set), for which a set of extents have been physically allocated on the storage devices. For example, the capacity of each storage device may be apportioned into extents of a consistent or variable size, and when capacity is requested for a space, one or more extents may be physically allocated on one or more storage devices, and each extent may be bound to a logical address range for the space. An access to a location within the logical address range may be satisfied by reference to an extent that has been physically allocated for the space and bound to a logical address range including the location of the access.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In computing scenarios involving a storage device set, requests for allocations of capacity (e.g., the allocation of extents for respective spaces) may be fulfilled by selecting one or more storage devices and physically allocating one or more areas. However, the particular selection of storage devices may vary among implementations. For example, a storage controller may arbitrarily select a storage device for the allocation; may simply allocate a suitably sized area on the storage device having the greatest available capacity; may utilize a best-fit technique; or may select allocations of an equal size on all storage devices of the storage device set. These strategies may present respective advantages; e.g., a best-fit technique may reduce data fragmentation, while a distribution across all storage devices may improve the access rate to a data set stored in the distributed allocation.","In more complex storage scenarios, data sets may be the storage devices according to a constraint. For example, storage for a first data set, comprising valuable or high-demand data, may be requested with a maximum distribution across the storage devices (e.g., a mirroring of data on several storage devices to provide improved redundancy, or an automated calculation and storage of checksums for the data set that enable error detection and\/or error correction). Storage for a second data set may requested with the constraint of a contiguous block of data, e.g., in order to improve sequential access to the data set through the use of read-ahead and burst access features of the storage devices. Conversely, storage for a third data set may not specify any constraint, and may be stored in any location of the storage device set. Additional features may also be provided by the storage device set, such as delayed capacity allocation (e.g., a request to provision capacity for a space may not promptly allocate all of the extents to satisfy the capacity of the space, but may simply record the provisioned size and bind extents to the space on a just-in-time basis) and thin provisioning (e.g., spaces may be created with provisioned capacity exceeding the physical capacity of the storage device set, and as the available capacity of the storage device set nears exhaustion, the storage device set may advise an administrator to provide additional storage devices to extend the physical capacity of the storage device set).","However, in view of these features, comparatively simple allocation strategies may inefficiently allocate the capacity of the storage device set in view of these requests, and may later have to reorganize the storage device set in order to satisfy the constraints of new data sets. As a first example, some storage strategies may lead to uneven allocation of the storage capacities the respective storage devices; e.g., a greater proportion of storage device sets may be allocated on a particular storage device than other storage devices, thereby consuming its capacity at a greater rate and resulting in an earlier exhaustion of the capacity of that storage device as the storage device set nears capacity. This early exhaustion may present a problem if a subsequent write request specifies that a data set is to be maximally allocated over the storage devices of the storage device set. In this case, the storage device set may have plenty of storage capacity to satisfy the request, but may have to relocate some data from the exhausted storage device in order to satisfy the distribution constraint. As a second example, if the storage devices present different available capacities (e.g., due to different physical capacities or other, uneven allocations of capacity), an even allocation of capacity across the storage devices may exhaust a storage device having less available capacity before a storage device having greater available capacity. As a third example, it may be desirable to utilize thin provisioning to enable spaces to grow to a provisioned capacity, but when the capacity of the storage device set is exhausted, additional capacity becomes unavailable for all overprovisioned spaces. However, some spaces may have higher priority than other spaces, and it may be undesirable to enable an overprovisioned but lower-priority space to consume capacity to the point of exhaustion, thereby causing an unavailability of capacity for an overprovisioned and higher-priority space. If the storage device set does not provide any features for avoiding this result, the only viable option may be to reduce or avoid thin provisioning of the storage device set in order to ensure that capacity is available when needed.","Presented herein are techniques for configuring storage device sets to fulfill requests to allocate capacity that may reduce or avoid some of these problems. In accordance with these techniques, when a request to allocate capacity is received, the storage device set may examine the storage devices to identify a subset of storage devices having ample available capacity, i.e., storage devices having available capacity above an available capacity minimum threshold, and may first allocate capacity on the storage devices of this spacious storage device subset. If this allocation is insufficient to satisfy the allocation request (e.g., if the allocation request specifies an allocation of capacity on four storage device, but only two storage devices have ample storage capacity, then the storage device set may next identify a subset of storage devices having less than the available capacity minimum threshold, but that still have available capacity (i.e., those that are not yet exhausted), and may allocate capacity on these storage devices. This technique may provide a comparatively simple technique for selecting storage devices to allocate capacity, while also preserving capacity on storage devices for which available capacity is becoming limited. As a second example, among the storage devices of the selected storage device subset, various strategies may be utilized to distribute the allocations of capacity (e.g., the allocation of extents) across the storage devices of the subset, such as a round-robin allocation strategy that distributes the allocation over the storage devices; a capacity utilization allocation strategy that maximizes the allocation of the storage device having the greatest available capacity; and an access rate allocation that distributes allocations to storage devices that have exhibited less frequent accesses, which may more evenly distribute the access load and improve the throughput of the storage device set.","An additional feature that may be utilized with these techniques involves capacity reservations. For a particular space, a specified amount of capacity may be reserved on the storage devices; even though capacity is not allocated for the space, respective storage devices may set aside some available capacity for the space, and may thereby withhold the reserved capacity from other capacity requests. For example, if a storage device comprises 1,000 extents (e.g., 1 GB extents for a storage device having 1 TB of capacity), a space may be created with a capacity reservation resulting in a reservation of 100 extents on the storage device. The storage device may therefore indicate only 900 extents of capacity available for other capacity requests, and even though no particular extents have been allocated for the space having the capacity reservation, 100 extents remain available for the space even if the available capacity is exhausted. The use of capacity reservations may enable the reservation of capacity for spaces even in the event of capacity exhaustion; e.g., even if another overprovisioned and low-priority space (not having a capacity reservation) exhausts the available capacity of the storage device set (and can no longer request allocations of capacity), capacity may remain available for an overprovisioned and higher-priority space for which a capacity reservation has been created, even if such capacity is not yet allocated in the form of extents.","Moreover, these variations may be combined to present an even more adept allocation strategy. For example, while determining whether the available capacity of particular storage device is ample or limited (e.g., whether the available capacity of a storage device is above or below an available capacity minimum threshold), an embodiment of these techniques may include in this determination the capacity reservations of the storage device. For example, a storage device having an available capacity of 1,000 extents may comprise 500 extents that are currently in use, and might therefore be considered spacious in view of an available capacity minimum threshold of 250 extents, but may be considered of limited capacity if comprising capacity reservations totaling 400 extents. These and other variations of the techniques presented therein may be included in an allocation strategy that utilizes the capacity of the storage device set in a flexible and efficient manner.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A. Introduction","Within the field of computing, many scenarios involve a storage device set comprising a set of storage devices, such as hard disk drives, solid-state storage devices, tape backup archives, and volatile or non-volatile memory circuits. The storage devices may be of homogenous or heterogeneous types; may present similar or varying characteristics such as capacity, volatility; may be tightly or loosely aggregated through hardware or software (e.g., a set of hard disk drives inserted in a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) controller, or a software process interacting with a variety of storage devices); and may be present in the same location, in a local area (e.g., a set of network-attached storage (NAS) devices), and\/or in a wide area (e.g., a geographically distributed set of storage devices accessed over the internet).","The storage device set may be configured to fulfill requests to allocate storage capacity on behalf of various processes executing on one or more devices. In many such scenarios, the storage device set manifests one or more logical volumes, each of which may be formatted in a particular manner (e.g., a file store formatted according to a file system or a database formatted according to a database storage system). In earlier storage device sets, each logical volume was limited to a particular storage device; however, in contemporary storage device sets, two or more storage devices may interoperate as a pool of capacity for a single logical volume. For example, two or more storage devices may pool some or all physical capacity as a single logical volume. Therefore, the storage device set may exhibit a set of logical volumes having an arbitrary relationship with the physical capacity of the storage devices of the storage device set; e.g., a logical volume may seamlessly aggregate capacity from several storage devices, and may store data represented at a particular logical location at any physical location within the allocated capacities of the storage devices participating in the pool.","The storage device set may satisfy requests to allocate capacity in various ways. In earlier storage device sets, a request to create a logical volume was fulfilled by allocating a block of physical capacity on a storage device (e.g., a large, contiguous block of space within a partition). However, contemporary storage device sets may provide a large amount of capacity (e.g., an entire petabytes of storage), and may be allocated into a large number of logical volumes (e.g., respective logical volumes for the operating environments of a large number of virtual machines). Moreover, such requests may be initiated at different times, and may involve requests to expand, reduce, or relocate the capacity. In order to support this type of dynamic environment, it may be desirable to configure the storage device set to allocate capacity in a more flexible manner. As one such example, the storage device set may be organized as a set of spaces representing various area of data storage (e.g., a logical volume; a checksum area; a storage journal where changes to another space may be recorded; or a maintenance area that stores metadata about other spaces), and as a set of extents, comprising small physical allocations that may be associated with a space. The storage device may fulfill a request to create capacity for a space by allocating one or more extents and binding each extent to a logical address range of the space. Requests to access a location within the space are then fulfilled by identifying the extent bound to a logical address range including the location and accessing the extent at the corresponding offset. It is to be appreciated that although the present disclosure presents concepts in the context of a space and extent allocation model, the present techniques may be applicable to storage devices using many organization models.","In addition, the storage device set may provide many features that improve the performance and\/or reliability of the storage device set. As a first example, the storage device set may be configured to store one or more data sets in a redundant manner on the same or different storage devices; e.g., in a RAID 1 array, a logical volume is identically replicated over several storage devices. This replication may improve the reliability of the logical volume; e.g., if a storage device becomes corrupt, inaccessible, or unavailable, no data is lost, and the data remains accessible on other storage devices. Additionally, the replication may improve the access rate of the replicated data set by combining the input\/output capacities of multiple storage devices. As a second example, the storage device set may be configured to calculate and store checksums for stored data sets. For example, in a RAID 4 array, some storage capacity is allocated not for user data, but to store checksums for user data in other portions of the array; e.g., for each set of four words written to four sequential logical addresses, the storage device set may automatically compute a checksum and store the checksum in the checksum area. This checksum may be used to verify the integrity of the data; to identify the location in the four-word set of an error (e.g., an inadvertently changed bit, or a bit incorrectly read from the physical medium), and optionally to correct the error; and\/or to reconstruct data that becomes inaccessible or missing (e.g., the four words may be distributed across four storage devices and the checksums may be written to a fifth storage device, and if any storage device becomes corrupted, fails to respond, or is removed, the data that was stored on the storage device may be reconstructed using the corresponding words and the checksum stored on the other storage devices of the storage device set).","Additional variations of the storage device set involve a decoupling of the provisioning of capacity (e.g., the creation of a space with a provisioned size) and the allocation of capacity, i.e., the selection, reservation, and initialization of portions of the physical media for particular uses. As an example in the context of storage organized as extents bound to spaces, instead of allocating the entire capacity for a space upon creation of the space, which may take a while (particularly for large spaces involving a large number of extents), the storage device set may delay the binding of extents to the space. The storage device set may initially create the space with a provisioned capacity but few or no bound extents. Upon receiving a request to access a location of the space, the storage device set may determine whether any extent is bound to a logical address range including the location, and if not, may promptly allocate an extent on a storage device and bind the extent to a logical address range including the location. This just-in-time allocation may therefore accelerate the creation and size adjustments of the space. Moreover, in such scenarios, the storage device set may be \u201cthinly provisioned,\u201d i.e., by creating spaces that together have a provisioned capacity that is greater than the available capacity of the storage device set. As the spaces are accessed, the storage device set may allocate extents for the spaces from the available capacity of the storage devices; and as the available capacity approaches exhaustion, the storage device set may advise an administrator to add one or more storage devices to the storage device set in order to provide additional capacity to satisfy the overprovisioned spaces. Such techniques may be advantageous, e.g., where a large storage device set comprises a large number of spaces that are incrementally filled with data and\/or that remain partially unused, such as a storage array with a petabyte capacity storing logical volumes for a large number of virtual machines; in such scenarios, rather than acquiring and allocating capacity devices for the entire provisioned capacity that remain partially unused, and\/or initially creating spaces with little provisioned capacities and repeatedly expanding the spaces and allocating extents to provide additional capacity, the administrator may simply overprovision the spaces, may monitor the available capacity of the storage device set, and add storage devices to avoid capacity exhaustion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","100","104","106","106","108","104","108","110","102","108","102","102","106","108","106","110","1","2","5","102","106","106","106","108","106","108","3","4","110","108","106","108","102","106","108","110","108","106","104","102","108","110","106","104","106","102","102","102","104","108","102","108","102","102","102"]},"Thus, in these and other scenarios, a storage device set  may be configured to allocate capacity in response to various requests (e.g., organize the physical capacity of the storage devices  in order to provide logical capacity for spaces  or other manifestations of logical volumes). Thus, in many scenarios, the physical locations of the allocated capacity may be insignificant; e.g., on the storage devices  of a RAID 4 array, the physical location of a data set may be arbitrarily allocated anywhere on any storage device . However, in some such scenarios, the manner of selecting physical locations to satisfy requests to allocate capacity may have practical consequences. As a first example, in some RAID schemes, respective data sets are distributed across the storage devices , and each capacity request is satisfied by allocating a portion of the requested capacity on each storage device . As a second example, in scenarios involving highly dynamic data (e.g., data sets that are frequently created, deleted, and\/or resized), the compaction of the data set may degrade as the storage device set  nears exhaustion; e.g., available capacity may be physically fragmented into small portions throughout the storage device set . Thus, even if the total available capacity of the storage device set  is sufficient for a capacity request specifying a large block of data, the storage device set  may be unable to locate a contiguous block of free capacity to satisfy the request, and may have to allocate the capacity in a fragmented manner and\/or rearrange other data in order to compact the used capacity and aggregate the available capacity in order to fulfill the capacity allocation request.","As further illustrated in the exemplary scenario  of , some spaces  may specify a constraint  that affects the placement of extents  to fulfill a request to allocate capacity of the space . For example, a constraint  for the first space  may specify that the space  is configured according to a RAID 1 scheme, wherein a data set is automatically mirrored on two or more storage devices , and that the extents  allocated therefor are to span two storage devices . Accordingly, a pool  of extents  may be allocated across the first storage device  and the second storage device  (and may advantageously be selected at the same physical locations each storage device ), thereby enabling a parallel access to the extents  of the space . As a second example, the second space  may include a constraint  specifying the allocation of a contiguous block of extents , e.g., for a data set that is primarily accessed in a streaming manner. As a third example, the fifth space  may be formatted according to a RAID 4 scheme, and may therefore include a constraint  that extents  allocated for the capacity of this space  are to be distributed across four storage devices  (e.g., comprising three areas for user data and a checksum area), and the storage device set  may allocate a pool  of extents  spanning all four storage device . In this manner, the storage device set  may provide options for allocating particular types of capacity and features for respective spaces , and may allocate extents  on the storage devices  in a manner that satisfies the constraints  of the spaces .","In view of these considerations, it may be appreciated that while many scenarios may satisfactorily utilize any strategy for allocating capacity in response to a request, some allocation strategies may more efficiently allocate storage than other allocation strategies. As a first exemplary allocation strategy, requested capacity may be allocated on the storage device  having the largest amount of available capacity. This example may distribute successive storage requests over the storage devices  in view of the changing available capacity thereof, thus reducing the exhaustion of capacity on one storage device  while other storage devices  contain plentiful capacity. However, this allocation strategy fulfills each capacity request by allocating capacity on one storage device , and may therefore be incompatible with pooled storage or some features of RAID arrays. As a second exemplary allocation strategy, each storage request may be fulfilled by equally allocating the requested capacity across all available storage devices . If this technique is used to fulfill all capacity requests for a set of storage devices  having the same capacity, this strategy may consume the capacity of all storage devices  in an approximately uniform manner. However, this allocation strategy may be incompatible with storage device sets  having storage devices  of varying available capacity, such as storage device sets  featuring storage devices  with different physical capacities, or where some allocation requests are satisfied using different allocation strategies (e.g., allocating a block of capacity from one storage device); in these scenarios, an even distribution of capacity allocations across all storage devices  exhausts those having less available capacity before those having greater available capacity.","Further complications may be caused by capacity requests specifying one or more constraints regarding the selected storage devices . For example, a first capacity request may specify that the capacity is to be distributed and\/or mirrored across a particular number of storage devices  in order to improve throughput or reliability; a second capacity request may specify that the capacity is to be allocated as a contiguous block of one storage device  (e.g., in order to promote efficiently streaming of the data set of the capacity from one storage device , particularly utilizing read-ahead and burst features of the storage device ); and a third capacity request may specify no constraint, and may therefore be allocated from the available capacity of any storage device . Thus, allocation strategies may be designed to select capacity in a manner that results in available capacity with greater variety, in order to provide the capability to fulfill subsequent capacity requests with variable constraints. For example, the allocation strategies may be designed to compact allocated capacity and aggregate available capacity (e.g., using a best-fit selection of allocations), and\/or to distribute available capacity across all storage devices , such that capacity is available on all storage devices  in order to satisfy subsequent requests specifying a constraint of multiple storage devices .","In view of these considerations, it may be appreciated that the design of an allocation strategy for selecting a particular storage device  and physical location to satisfy a capacity request may significantly affect the performance of the storage device set . Conversely, it may be appreciated that a poorly designed allocation strategy may select allocations in a manner that limits the constraints  that may be satisfied by the remaining available capacity of the storage devices  in response to subsequent capacity requests. That is, even if the available capacity of the storage device set  is sufficient to satisfy the size of a capacity request, it may be difficult to allocate capacity that satisfies the constraint  of the request. The storage device set  may therefore have to relocate some data in order to arrange the available capacity to satisfy the constraint  of the request, which may delay the fulfillment of the request (possibly blocking the requesting process or thread for an extended period of time). Indeed, in some scenarios, it may not be possible to fulfill the request despite a sufficient available amount of physical capacity, because other processes may be actively utilizing the other data sets of the storage device set , and\/or it may not be possible to relocate other data sets without (temporarily or even permanently) violating the constraints  associated therewith. Thus, the problems resulting from a poorly designed allocation strategy may have a significant impact on the storage device set .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","102","104","202","108","106","106","104","112","108","106","204","106","108","102","106","104","112","108","104","104","206","102","106","108","114","106","104","104","102","114","104","102","106","104","104","104","104","104","104","104","104","104"]},"Another problem that may arise within storage device sets  involves the exhaustion of available capacity in a storage device set  comprising spaces  that have been overprovisioned. In particular, a variety of spaces , each having a particular usage, may be overprovisioned, and monitored by an administrator to avoid capacity exhaustion. However, in many such scenarios, capacity remains available for all overprovisioned spaces  until capacity exhaustion is reached, at which point capacity becomes unavailable for all overprovisioned spaces . This result may be undesirable, e.g., if spaces  have different priorities, then an overprovisioned, higher-priority space  may be denied capacity after an overprovisioned, lower-priority space  consumes all remaining available capacity. However, it may be undesirable to reallocate capacity from the lower-priority space  to the higher-priority space  if such capacity is in use, thereby resulting in data loss.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","102","104","106","108","110","304","106","108","108","302","300","102","108","60","106","102","40","108","108","108","104","102","106","108","108","106","110","108","108"]},"As further illustrated in the exemplary scenario  of , the available capacity of the storage device set  may be consumed over time and eventually exhausted. For example, at a first time point , the storage device set  may be only partially utilized with only five extents  allocated per space , thereby presenting ample available capacity for additional requests. At a second time point , the capacity may be more heavily utilized, and in particular, the low-priority space  may rapidly consume the available capacity of the storage device set  (while restricting utilization within the provisioned capacity ). At a third time point , the capacity of the storage device set  may be dwindling, and the storage device set  may generate an alert  for an administrator  of the storage device set  to indicate the imminent exhaustion of available capacity. However, the administrator  may not provide storage devices  or otherwise address the imminent exhaustion, and at a fourth time point , the available capacity of the storage device set  may be exhausted. However, as a result of this configuration, this condition applies equally to all spaces ; e.g., additional capacity becomes unavailable for all spaces , regardless of priority . The administrator  may not have perceived this result, particularly for the high-priority space , which was created with a provisioned capacity  at a time when the storage device set  had ample available capacity. Indeed, the administrator  may not even have perceived the first space  as overprovisioned; e.g., the space  was created with a comparatively small provisioned capacity  at a time point when the storage device set  had ample available capacity. Rather, the exhaustion of the available capacity of the first space  arises from configuration of the storage device set  to delay the allocation of extents  for any space , and as a result, the consumption of available capacity by the low-priority third space  results in the unavailability of extents  and the exhaustion of capacity for the first and second spaces . Avoiding this result may involve reducing or altogether avoiding the use of overprovisioning of the storage device set  (e.g., reducing the provisioned capacity  of the low-priority space ), selectively or generally or disabling delayed capacity allocation (thereby resulting in reduced performance, such as protracted response time, for the allocation or adjustment of spaces , and\/or the allocation of extents  for a space  in the absence of an imminent use of the capacity of the space ). However, these features are generally advantageous, and the inability to utilize such features may diminish the capabilities of the storage device set .","B. Presented Techniques","Presented herein are allocation strategies for storage device sets  that may reduce or avoid some of the problems of less efficient allocation strategies, including those depicted in the exemplary scenarios of . In accordance with these techniques, capacity may be allocated on respective storage devices  of a storage device set  in view of particular properties of the storage devices . For example, when selecting a location within the storage device set  to allocate capacity in order to fulfill a capacity request for a space , an embodiment of these techniques may examine the storage devices  to identify those that have spacious capacity, and may select these storage devices  as a spacious storage device subset of the storage device set . In particular, an embodiment may define an available capacity minimum threshold (e.g., a minimum number of extents  that remain available for allocation), and may select storage devices  for this subset having at least this minimum number of available extents . Capacity for the space  may first be allocated on the storage devices  of the spacious storage device subset in various ways (e.g., a round-robin allocation strategy that maximizes the distribution of the allocated capacity across the storage devices; a capacity utilization allocation strategy that allocates capacity on the storage devices of the spacious storage device subset having the greatest available capacity; or an access rate strategy that allocates capacity on the storage devices  according to the frequency of accesses to the extents  allocated for each such storage device ). However, in some cases, this allocation may be inadequate to satisfy the capacity request; e.g., the capacity request may specify a minimum distribution, such as a minimum number, type, or location of storage devices  across which the capacity is to be allocated, and the minimum distribution may exceed the number of storage devices  comprising the spacious storage device subset. Therefore, an embodiment of these techniques may next identify a limited storage device subset, comprising the storage devices  of the storage device set  for which available capacity is limited (e.g., available capacity has not been exhausted, but is below the available capacity minimum threshold). The embodiment may therefore fulfill the remainder of the capacity request by allocating extents  for the space  on the storage devices  of the limited storage device subset (again, utilizing any or several allocation strategies such as round-robin, capacity utilization, and access rate). In this manner, an embodiment of these techniques may fulfill the capacity request for the space  from the storage devices  of the storage device set  using a comparatively simple evaluation while also preserving the capacity of limited storage devices , and also using various allocation strategies that may advantageously distribute the allocated capacity within the selected subsets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","102","400","104","108","106","104","108","402","108","108","104","106","104","102","102","404","104","102","106","400","106","102","104","104","106","104","106","104"]},"As further illustrated in the exemplary scenario  of , at a second time point , a second capacity request may be received that requests an allocation of extents  on three storage devices . The storage device set  may again identify a spacious storage device subset (now comprising only the third and fourth storage devices ), and may allocate an extent  on each storage device . However, this allocation does not fully satisfy the capacity request, so the embodiment may next select a limited storage device subset , comprising the storage devices  having less than the available capacity minimum threshold but having more than zero available extents  (i.e., the first and second storage devices ). The storage device set  may therefore allocate the third extent  on one of the storage devices  of this subset (using any suitable allocation strategy), and may therefore exhaust the capacity of the first storage device  but fulfilling the second capacity request. At a third time point , a third capacity request may be received that against requests an allocation of extents  on three storage devices . The storage device set  may again identify a spacious storage device subset (again comprising only the third and fourth storage devices ), and may allocate an extent  on each storage device . In order to allocate the third extent  on a different storage device  in compliance with the constraint of the capacity request, the embodiment may next select a limited storage device subset , comprising the storage devices  having less than the available capacity minimum threshold but having more than zero available extents  (now comprising only the second storage device ) and allocate the third extent  on the second storage device . In this manner, the storage device set  may efficiently fulfill capacity requests according to the techniques presented herein.","Additional techniques presented herein relate to the scenario depicted in the exemplary scenario  of , involving the effects of an exhaustion of available capacity on spaces  that have not been fully allocated (including those that an administrator  has overprovisioned, but also including those for which allocation has simply been delayed). In these scenarios, it may be advantageous to provide a mechanism for reserving capacity for a space  in the event of exhaustion of the available capacity of the storage device set . That is, without allocating capacity for a space  that is not in use, the storage device set  may nevertheless hold some capacity in reserve for the space  in case available capacity is exhausted. Moreover, such capacity may be reserved on several storage devices  of the storage device set , e.g., in compliance with a constraint associated with the space . Therefore, an additional feature that may be included in embodiments of the techniques presented herein is the reservation of a capacity reservation for one or more spaces , wherein the capacity reservation may be achieved by reserving a capacity reservation portion on respective storage devices  of the storage device set . The respective storage devices  may therefore report an available capacity as the unallocated capacity minus the capacity reservation portions reserved on the storage device  for respective spaces . As a space  requests capacity, the capacity reservation may be reduced, thereby resulting in a reduction of the capacity reservation for the space , but not the available capacity of the storage device . Alternatively, the capacity reservation for the space  may be maintained up to a maximum of the remaining provisioned capacity of the space  (e.g., it may not be advantageous to hold capacity in reserve that exceeds the provisioned capacity  of the space ). This variation results in a reduction of the available capacity of the storage device , but not of the capacity reservation for the space . These techniques may enable the delayed allocation of capacity for a space  without risking the exhaustion of capacity for the space , thereby enabling devices to continue using (and expanding) the space  in the event of an exhaustion of available capacity of the storage device set .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["500","500","104","106","108","302","110","300","500","108","504","106","108","302","504","110","10","106","108","108","302","504","6","106","110","30","504","108","108","106","108","504","106","104","104","502","102","40","106","102","24","106","16","106","504","108","104","506","104"]},"As further illustrated in the exemplary scenario  of , at a second time point , some extents  have been allocated on the storage devices  for each of the spaces . For example, for the third space ,  extents  have been allocated, and for the second space ,  extents have been allocated, while  extents are still held in reserve by the storage device set  for the second space . Accordingly, the available capacity of the storage device set  has been reduced by  extents . However, for the first space , eight extents  have been allocated; however, because rather than reducing the available capacity, the storage device set  reduces the capacity reservation  for the space  so that the capacity reservation  does not exceed the remaining provisioned capacity  of the first space . At a third time point , the continued expansion of the allocated capacity of the second space  and the third space  results in the exhaustion of the available capacity of the storage device set . However, some capacity remains available for the first space  (sufficient to satisfy the remainder of its provisioned capacity ) and for the second space  (e.g.,  extents , which may be sufficient to satisfy the volume of data stored in the second space  until additional capacity may be added). Accordingly, at a fourth time point , the first and second spaces  have been able to request and receive additional allocated capacity by consuming the capacity reservations  of each space . In this manner, and in contrast with the exemplary scenario  of , capacity reservations  may enable some spaces  to continue to request and receive allocations of capacity even after the exhaustion of the available capacity of the storage device set .","It may be particularly advantageous to implement both the allocation strategies and the capability of capacity reservations in an embodiment of these techniques. For example, the determinations of whether a particular storage device  has ample available capacity (and therefore may be included in the spacious storage device subset ), and whether a particular storage device  has limited but nonzero available capacity (and therefore may be included in the limited storage device subset ), may include the consideration of the capacity reservation portions  for each storage device . That is, the number of extents  available for allocation may exclude the capacity reserved as capacity reservations  for the spaces , even if such capacity reservations are not yet allocated for any space . Indeed, among the unallocated areas of a storage device , the characterization of areas as available extents  or as capacity reservations may be indeterminate; i.e., the reserved capacity is determined by the unallocated areas remaining after all available capacity has been allocated. This combination of these techniques may further facilitate the allocation of capacity of a storage device set  for respective spaces  in accordance with the techniques presented herein.","C.

Variations","The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects, and some variations may present additional advantages and\/or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover, some variations may be implemented in combination, and some combinations may feature additional advantages and\/or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments (e.g., the exemplary methods ,  of ) in order to confer individual and\/or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.","D1. Scenarios","A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized. As a first variation of this first aspect, these techniques may be used with many types of storage devices , including hard disk drives, solid-state storage devices, nonvolatile memory circuits, tape-based storage devices, and magnetic and optical discs. Such storage devices  may also be directly connected to a device  (such as a computer) implementing these techniques; may be accessible through a wired or wireless local area network (e.g., an 802.11 WiFi network or ad-hoc connection, or an infrared connection); and\/or may be accessible through a wired or wireless wide-area network (e.g., a cellular network or the internet). As a second variation of this first aspect, the storage device set  may loosely aggregate the storage devices  (e.g., storage devices  that operate independently but that are informed of and may communicate with the other storage devices  sharing the storage device set) or may operate the storage devices  with tight interoperation (e.g., a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) controller managing several storage devices  as components of a storage system). As a third variation of this first aspect, the storage devices  may sore many types of data sets, including binary storage systems storing various types of binary objects; file systems storing files; media libraries storing media objects; object systems storing many types of objects; databases storing records; and email systems storing email messages. As a fourth variation of this first aspect, portions or all of these techniques may be implemented within one or more components within the computing environment, such as a set of software instructions stored in a volatile or nonvolatile of a computer or device having access to the storage devices  (e.g., an operating system process or a hardware driver); by a storage system configured to interface with the storage devices  (e.g., a RAID controller); or in respective storage devices  of the storage device set . As a fifth variation of this first aspect, the storage devices  may be organized to allocate capacity in various ways. Although the examples presented herein involve storage devices  configured to allocate extents  for spaces , it may be appreciated that the techniques presented herein may be adapted for use with other allocation schemes, such as the allocation of partitions representing logical volumes, and the formation of a pool  of two or more partitions to generate a dynamic partition spanning multiple basic partitions on one or more storage devices . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be utilized.","D2. Allocation Strategies","A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of techniques relates to the allocation strategies utilized to select the particular storage devices  and locations of the allocation of capacity (such as extents ) in response to a capacity request. As a first variation of this second aspect, after selecting storage devices  of a storage device subset (e.g., a spacious storage device subset  or a limited storage device subset ), an embodiment of these techniques may arbitrarily select among the storage devices  of the storage device subset for the allocations of capacity to satisfy the capacity request. Alternatively, an embodiment may be configured to apply an allocation strategy to select where the allocations of extents  are to be made on such storage devices .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3","FIG. 9"],"b":["900","900","102","104","106","108","106","106","404","104","106","102","106","900","902","106","106","104","104","106","104","108","106","104","106","104","104","104","104","902","106","104","404"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["904","104","404","104","104","104","106","104"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["906","104","104","104","102","102","104","106","104","106","104","102","104","900","104","404","104","106","908","104","106","104","106","104","104","106","104","104","106"]},"As a second variation of this second aspect, an embodiment of these techniques may enable a request to specify a storage device distribution constraint for the allocation of capacity. For example, the constraints may be selected from a storage device distribution constraint set comprising a minimum and\/or maximum number of different storage devices  upon which the allocated capacity is to be distributed; a minimum and\/or maximum number of different storage device types (e.g., a homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture of storage devices ); and a minimum and\/or maximum number of different locations of the storage devices  (e.g., storage devices  located in the same or different racks, buildings, facilities, or geographic areas). Such constraints may be selected in view of various factors of the storage device set . For example, it may be desirable to choose homogenous storage devices  having similar properties and located in the same general area in order to allocate capacity capable of high throughput for a data set that is likely to be heavily utilized. Conversely, for a data set that is heavily utilized throughout a geographic area, it may be desirable to distribute the data set across a wide geographic area, and therefore to allocate capacity for a mirrored version of the data set on several storage devices  located in different geographic regions (such that any consuming device or process may access the mirrored version of the data set on the geographically closest storage device ). An embodiment of these techniques may therefore accept the specification of storage device distribution constraints with capacity requests, and to utilize such constraints while selecting storage devices  in fulfillment of the capacity request. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such allocation strategies in accordance with the techniques presented herein.","D3. Delayed Allocation and Capacity Reserves","A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to a delayed allocation of capacity. For example, upon receiving a request to create a space , a storage device set  may promptly allocate the entire provisioned capacity  of the space  on one or more storage devices . However, this allocation may take a while, particularly if the provisioned capacity  is large and a large number of extents  have to be selected and located, and such prompt allocation may significantly delay the fulfillment of the request to create the space. Additionally, this allocation may be inefficient if the capacity of the space  is not promptly thereafter, since extents  that have been allocated for the space  may remain empty, and yet may be unavailable for allocation to other spaces , or even to alleviate an exhaustion of the available capacity of the storage device set . Moreover, in a thin provisioning scenario, the provisioned capacity for the space  may not be available for allocation at the time that the space  is created. In view of these and other considerations, it may be advantageous to configure the storage device set  not to allocate the entire provisioned capacity  for the space  upon creating the space, but to delay the allocation until the physical capacity is to be utilized. For example, the storage device set  may initially allocate a small number of extents  to the space  in order to provide starting physical capacity (or may refrain from doing so), and may wait to allocate additional physical capacity until demand for the physical capacity arises.","A first variation of this third aspect involves the manner of achieving the delayed allocation of capacity. As a first example, the storage device set  may monitor the available physical capacity allocated to a space , and when the available physical capacity nears exhaustion (while provisioned capacity  remains), the storage device set  may automatically allocate one or more new extents  and associate such extents  with the space , thereby avoiding exhaustion of the physical capacity of the space . This variation may therefore opaquely handle the allocation of capacity for a space , and may not even indicate that less than all capacity has been allocated for the space . As a second example, the storage device set  may expose the incomplete allocation of physical capacity to an administrator  or process, and may accept and fulfill requests from the administrator and\/or process to expand the physical capacity allocated for the space . As a third example, respective extents  may be bound to a logical address range of the space. A request to access data may specify a location in the space, and the storage device set  may determine whether any extent  associated with the space  is bound to an address range including the location of the request. If not, the storage device set  may bind an unbound extent  to a logical address space the space , where the logical address range includes the location of the access, in order to provide the physical capacity for the access. The unbound extent  may be newly allocated for the space  on a storage device  in order to fulfill the request. Alternatively, the unbound extent  may have been allocated for the space  before the access, but may not yet have been bound to a logical address range for the space . For example, when a space  is created, it may be difficult to predict the locations within the space  that are to be used first. Therefore, a number of extents  may be allocated for and associated with the space , but may not be bound to any logical address range until the first access requests are received specifying logical locations within the space . In this manner, the allocation of unbound extents  may provide readily available physical capacity for any portion of the space , even though only a portion of the provisioned capacity  has been physically allocated, and even though the locations within the space  that are to be used cannot be predicted. In accordance with the techniques presented herein, the allocation of extents  may be achieved through the allocation strategies presented herein.","As a second variation of this third aspect (and as illustrated in the exemplary scenario  of ), the storage device set  may enable the use of capacity reservations  for respective spaces  in order to provide physical capacity for the space  in the event of an exhaustion of available capacity of the storage device set . For example, when a capacity reservation  is requested for a space , the storage device set  may calculate, for respective storage devices , a capacity reservation size comprising a lesser of the remaining provisioned capacity  of the space  and a capacity reservation portion  of the capacity reservation  for the space  on the storage device . (This comparison enables the capacity reservation  to extend up to the remaining provisioned capacity  of the space  without exceeding the remaining provisioned capacity  of the space .) The storage device  may therefore reduce the available capacity by the capacity reservation size. The capacity reservation may be specified with the request to create the space  or may be added after the space is created , and may be adjusted to variable capacity reservation sizes after creation by adjusting the reserved capacity portions  on respective storage devices .","As a third variation of this second aspect, for a space  having a capacity reservation , the storage device set  may consume the capacity reservation  for the space  in various ways while the storage device set  has available physical capacity. For example, requests to expand the physical capacity for the space  may be achieved by maintaining the capacity reservation  and reducing the available capacity of the storage device set  (e.g., satisfying such capacity allocations from the general pool of available capacity); by maintaining the available capacity of the storage device set  and reducing the capacity reservation  of the space  (e.g., satisfying such capacity allocations from the capacity reservation  for the space ); or a combination thereof (e.g., a request may specify a capacity reservation  of 50% of the remaining provisioned capacity  of a space , and capacity allocations may be satisfied by reducing both the available capacity of the storage device set  and the capacity reservation  for the space ). Alternatively or additionally, the storage device set  may (or may not) restrict the size of a capacity reservation  to the remaining provisioned capacity  for the space . For example, the storage device set  may always satisfy capacity requests from the capacity reservation  of a space  (instead of from the available capacity of the storage device set ) if the remaining provisioned capacity  for the space  otherwise exceeds the size of the capacity reservation . Alternatively, for particularly high-priority spaces , the storage device set  may allow the capacity reservation  to exceed the remaining provisioned capacity  of the space  in case a request to expand the space  is received while the available capacity of the storage device set  is exhausted.","As a fourth variation of this third aspect, the storage device set  may take various actions upon reaching exhausting the available capacity of the storage devices , or upon approaching exhaustion (e.g., upon reducing the available capacity of the storage devices  below an available capacity minimum threshold). For example, the storage device set  may notify an administrator  or other user of the current or imminent exhaustion; may recommend the addition of one or more storage devices  to expand the capacity of the storage device set ; or may, in some scenarios, automatically place an order for additional storage. The storage device set  may also identify one or more spaces  that may be reduced in order to provide capacity to alleviate the exhaustion, and may, e.g., recommend switching a fully allocated space  to an overprovisioned space . For example, a space  may be bound to extents  that are not in use (e.g., extents  for a fully allocated space  that is only partially filled, or extents  that were bound to an extent  but have since not been used), and may recommend a deallocation of such extents  or a reallocation to a space  having higher priority . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many variations in the delayed allocation and thin provisioning of the storage device set  in accordance with the techniques presented herein.","D4. Additional Features","A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to additional features that may be provided by such embodiments. As a first variation of this fourth aspect, the available capacity minimum threshold may be selected in various ways, e.g., according to a heuristic based on the characteristics of the storage device set  or the data stored therein; may be specified as an absolute number (e.g., a total number of remaining extents ) or as a relative number (e.g., at least 10% of the total physical capacity remaining available); and may be specified as one value for all storage devices  or may be particularly selected for each storage device . Additionally, the available capacity minimum threshold may be adjusted over time, e.g., according to the available capacities of the storage devices  of the storage device set .","As a second variation of this fourth aspect, the allocation of capacity may encounter difficulty if a storage device  is temporarily unavailable, e.g., if the storage device  is accessible over a network connection that is temporarily disconnected, or if the storage device  has failed and is being replaced. While the temporary nature of the unavailability may preclude removing the storage device  from the representation, the allocation techniques may have to be adjusted in response. For example, the instructions may simply exclude the storage device  from any storage device subset selected for the allocation of capacity. Alternatively, even though the storage device  is unavailable, it may nevertheless be selected for capacity allocation if the storage device set  redundantly stores the data over multiple storage devices . As a first example, if the allocation is requested for a pool  of capacity comprising a mirror, the unavailable storage device  may be included in the pool, and the redundant data may simply be copied onto it once the unavailable storage device  is reconnected. As a second example, if the storage device set  provides redundancy in the form of a checksum, the data on the unavailable storage device  may be reconstructed through the use of data on the other storage devices . However, this data may include not only data that existed on the unavailable storage device , but data that was requested to be written to the storage device  after it became unavailable. That is, the storage device set  may select an unavailable storage device  for allocation, and may even operate as if storing new data on the unavailable storage device , but may simply update the other information of the storage device set  accordingly (e.g., updating a checksum stored in a checksum area to indicate the data that is to be stored on the storage device  when reconnected). Data may similarly be \u201cread\u201d from the unavailable storage device by using the corresponding data on the other storage devices . When the unavailable storage device  becomes available (either as a reconnection of the storage device  or a replacement with a new but empty storage device ), a resynchronization or reconstruction of the data therefore yields ensures that this storage device  contains not only the data that was stored on the storage device  at the time of disconnection, but the data that was requested to be written to the storage device  after disconnection. In this manner, even unavailable storage devices  may be included in the allocation strategies presented herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many additional features that are compatible with the techniques presented herein.","E.
