With the need for reducing costs or times associated with business trips, more companies are moving towards such videoconference systems. The videoconference systems allow transmission of contents data such as image data and\/or voice data among a plurality of videoconference terminals that are remotely located from one another through the communication network to facilitate communication among the plurality of videoconference terminals.","Some videoconference systems allow a user to use videoconference services only when the user pays a usage fee to a service provider who provides the videoconference services. In addition to the videoconference services, the service provider may provide the user with various other services such as weather forecast information, regional news distribution, educational services, etc. In case the usage fee is not paid by the user, the service provider may prohibit the user from connecting to the communication network through the user's terminal until the usage fee is paid, for example, as described in Japanese Patent Application Patent No. 3446202 (Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 200017493).","While disconnecting the terminal from the network may encourage the user to pay the usage fee, it may be inconvenient to some users as the user is not able to connect the terminal to the network even when the user wants to have services that should be provided free. For instance, if the service provider is supposed to provide the user with software for updating screens or functions of the terminal at no cost in spite of whether or not the usage fee is paid, the service provider should allow the user to connect to the network through the user's terminal for that purpose of updating while still prohibiting the unpaid user from using other services.","The accompanying drawings are intended to depict example embodiments of the present invention and should not be interpreted to limit the scope thereof. The accompanying drawings are not to be considered as drawn to scale unless explicitly noted.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present invention.

In this example, these four contents data sessions may be referred to as image and\/or voice data sessions.","Referring now to , various image data having different resolution levels, which are respectively transmitted by the terminal  of the transmission system , are explained. Referring to , the low-level resolution image data, which functions as a base image, has 160 pixels in the horizontal direction and 120 pixels in the vertical direction. Referring to , the medium-level resolution image data has 320 pixels in the horizontal direction and 240 pixels in the vertical direction.
