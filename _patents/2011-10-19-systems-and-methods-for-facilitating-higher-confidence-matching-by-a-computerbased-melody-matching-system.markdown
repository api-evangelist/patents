{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to facilitation of higher confidence melody matching by a computer-based melody matching system.","In today's world, multimedia is prolific and users can experience multimedia in a number of ways. Of particular popularity among users, especially those seeking professional singing careers, is the ability to create an audio or a combination video and audio recording of oneself performing (e.g., singing or playing) a composition previously-recorded by a professional artist. Users then post the performance online for other users, e.g., a coach or professional contact, to view. Systems facilitating posting of such content typically match the composition performed by the user with a composition previously recorded by the professional artist. Such matching can facilitate proper attribution to content owners for example.","One type of matching is based on matching the melodies in a performance with the melodies in a previously recorded composition. Systems of such type are typically referred to as melody matching systems. In some cases, matching is particularly challenging due to differences in melodies in the compositions being analyzed. For example, in some cases, the melodies in the performance may be somewhat distinct from those in the previously-recorded composition. Distinctions can arise due to skill level of a user performing a composition, extensive improvisation by the user or for any number of other reasons. False positives occur when the system erroneously determines that the user performance and the previously-recorded composition are the same composition. False positives decrease the reliability of melody matching systems and, as such, are ideally minimized. Accordingly, systems and methods that reduce false positives, thereby enhancing the confidence of melody matching systems are desirable.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","In one or more embodiments, the disclosed subject matter relates to a melody matching system. The computer-implemented system can include a metadata matching component configured to determine a metadata match level between metadata of a plurality of files, and a thresholding component. The thresholding component can be configured to: compare the metadata match level with a metadata threshold; and output a signal configured to cause a decrease in a melody matching strength threshold from a first value to a second value based at least on the metadata match level being greater than the metadata threshold.","In another embodiment, the disclosed subject matter also relates to a method of facilitating high-confidence melody matching by a computer-based melody matching system. The method can include employing a microprocessor to execute computer executable components stored within a memory to perform various acts. The acts can include: determining a first metadata match level between metadata of video channels; and comparing one or more metadata match levels with a metadata threshold. The one or more metadata match levels can include the first metadata match level. The method can also include decreasing a melody matching strength threshold from a first value to a second value based on at least one of the one or more metadata match levels being greater than the metadata threshold.","In another embodiment, the disclosed subject matter also relates to another method of facilitating high-confidence melody matching by a computer-based melody matching system. The method can include employing a microprocessor to execute computer executable components stored within a memory to perform various acts. The acts can include: receiving a media file embodying a user performance of a composition; and comparing metadata associated with the media file with metadata associated with a media file embodying a second performance. The method can also include: determining a metadata match level between the metadata associated with the media file and the metadata associated with the media file embodying the second performance; and determining whether the metadata match level is greater than a metadata threshold. Additionally, the method can also include decreasing a melody matching strength threshold from a first value a second value based, at least, on the metadata match level being greater than the metadata threshold. Further, the method can include classifying the media file embodying the user performance as a valid match with media file embodying the second performance based, at least, on strength of matching melodies between the media files being greater than the melody matching strength threshold. In some embodiments, the method can include maintaining the melody matching strength threshold at the first value based, at least, on the metadata match level being less than the metadata threshold.","Toward the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more embodiments include the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth herein detail certain illustrative aspects of the one or more embodiments. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various embodiments can be employed, and the described embodiments are intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.","Various embodiments are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of one or more embodiments. It is be evident, however, that such embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more embodiments.","Systems and methods disclosed herein relate to high-confidence melody matching. In particular, melody-based matches are made between user-submitted files on which users are performing compositions, and files embodying professional renditions of the compositions, by professional artists. The melody-based matches can be assigned an associated melody matching strength, and can be deemed to be valid matches if the associated melody matching strength of a particular match is greater than a determined threshold. In some embodiments, a valid match is deemed to exist if the associated melody matching strength of the particular match is equal to the determined threshold. The threshold is determined based on a desire to yield a minimum number of false positives (or to yield a desired precision) for the melody-matching system. To enhance the number of matches deemed valid, while maintaining the desired system precision, metadata of the user-submitted files and the professional files can be compared for similarity. As such, the metadata can be an independent indicator dictating a level of confidence in the melody-based match based on the level of match between the title or artist metadata in the two files. The level of match between the metadata can be compared to a metadata threshold. Further, the melody matching strength threshold can be reduced if the metadata match level of the metadata is above the metadata threshold. The reduction from the first value of the melody matching strength threshold to the second value can be according to a continuous function or a step function, in various embodiments.","Because the melody matching strength threshold can be reduced from a first value to a second value, the systems and methods described herein can provide an increased number of matches deemed valid, while maintaining a desired precision. Thus, metadata information can be employed herein to provide higher confidence melody matching. In other embodiments, similar to metadata information, video channel information can be evaluated, and the melody matching strength threshold adjusted, e.g., to maintain a desired melody-matching precision level.","Turning now to the drawings,  is an illustration of a block diagram of an exemplary non-limiting computer-based melody matching system configured for higher confidence melody matching. In various embodiments, the computer-based melody matching system  can be employed in systems that perform fingerprinting of music and\/or video works.","The computer-based melody matching system  can include a melody match component , a melody match strength estimation component , a confidence enhancement component , a microprocessor  and a memory . The components can be electrically and\/or communicatively coupled to one another to perform the functions of the computer-based melody matching system .","The computer-based melody matching system  can receive new media file information ,  and\/or process previously-stored media file information ,  for performing melody matching and confidence enhancement of melody matches. In various embodiments, the media file information  can include audio or a combination of audio and video from a user. For example, the media file information  can be received from a user and can include audio or a combination of video and audio of the user performing a composition.","The media file information  can also include metadata (not shown) describing the composition. By way of example, but not limitation, the metadata can describe the title of the composition, the title of the media file and\/or the name of a professional artist that also performs the composition. For example, if a user performs the composition, \u201cGeorgia on My Mind,\u201d the official state song of Georgia made famous by a professional recording by Ray Charles, the media file information  can be the composition performed by the amateur singer and transmitted to the computer-based melody matching system , and can be associated with or include metadata describing the title of the media file, \u201cGeorgia on My Mind,\u201d and metadata describing the artist name, Ray Charles. The original composition, performed by Ray Charles, can be represented by media file information . Matching can be performed between the melodies associated with media file information  and media file information .","In some embodiments, the media file information ,  can be or can include a melody fingerprint indicative of one or more fingerprints or signatures from the audio signal representative of the composition. As such, the melody fingerprint can be computed or derived based on the audio component of the composition. In some embodiments, the melody fingerprint can be stored in connection with unique identifiers identifying the composition, and can be accessed by the computer-based melody matching system  from a database (not shown) containing melody fingerprints for a number of different compositions.","Accordingly, as described above, the computer-based melody matching system  can perform its functions on the melody fingerprint, the metadata and\/or other information associated with the media files.","Now turning back to the computer-based melody matching system , the melody match component  can be configured to receive the media file information ,  and perform an algorithm to match media file information  from a user to the media file information  for the composition as performed by the professional artist. In one embodiment, when the media file information ,  includes a melody fingerprint, the melody match component  can match a composition submitted by a user with the professionally recorded composition based on a similarity in fingerprints. Such matching can be performed independent of the metadata included with the media file information . As such, the metadata can be an additional and independent component by which matching can be performed.","The computer-based melody matching system  can also include the melody match strength estimation component (MMSEC) . The MMSEC  can estimate and associate a melody matching strength with the match identified by melody match component . The melody matching strength can be a value indicative of the strength of the match, and the strength can correlate to the confidence in the validity of the match. Accordingly, a greater melody matching strength value can be associated with a presumption of greater confidence that the match is a valid match.","Matches for which the associated melody matching strength is less than a particular threshold can be discarded to maintain a particular level of precision in matching. As used herein, the term \u201cprecision\u201d can mean a rate of false positives. A \u201cfalse positive\u201d can mean an inaccurate identification of media file information ,  (including melody fingerprints) as a valid match when the media file information ,  does not match one another. By way of example, but not limitation, a false positive can occur if the melody match component  determines that media file information  and media file information  represent the same composition and, in fact, media file information  and media file information  represent different compositions by different artists, for example.","Turning briefly to , a graph depicting parameters and regions of interest for facilitating high-confidence melody matching by the computer-based melody matching system  is shown. As depicted, the melody matching strength and the metadata match level for metadata are parameters of interest. The melody matching strength can be based on a match between melody information (and\/or melody fingerprints) for compositions associated with the media file information , . If two renditions of the compositions are the same, the melody fingerprints can match, for example.","The metadata match level, and corresponding metadata threshold for the metadata match level, can be independent of the melody matching strength as the metadata threshold and the metadata match level are not affected by the melody matching strength for a particular set of matched media file information , .","In one embodiment, the melody matching strength can be set at one of two thresholds, depending on the level of confidence in a match between media file information , . The confidence in the match can be indicated by whether the metadata match level for metadata associated with the media file information  matches metadata associated with the media file information  at a level that is greater than the metadata threshold. Algorithms for matching text of the metadata can be utilized for determining the metadata match level.","Matches that are higher on the graph of  and further to the right denote matches having a higher confidence level. Rules for handling the corresponding media file information ,  can be applied based on the level of confidence. For example, attribution to an artist, composer, and\/or the content owner can be made if a level of confidence is sufficiently high.","Region R illustrates the region for matches based only on melody. R can be lower-bounded by the first value melody matching strength threshold. However, upon analysis of the metadata associated with the compositions being matched, if the metadata match level of the metadata is greater than the metadata threshold, the melody matching strength threshold can be reduced from the first value to the second value and, additional matches in region R can also be added to the total set of those with which a high-level of confidence is had. Accordingly, an increase in matches results while maintaining a certain level of precision. Precision decreases with false positives. In some embodiments, a false positive rate of approximately 1\/1000 on average can be typical of high-confidence while a false positive rate greater than or equal to 5% is not indicative of high-confidence melody matching.","Without metadata-based matching, the melody matching strength threshold could be reduced from the first value to the second value but more false positives may result because there is a reduction in the strength based on the melody while no additional factors are considered (such as metadata matching) to increase the likelihood of valid matches.","Considering , the melody matching strength can be set at a first value melody matching strength threshold when melody matching is performed via the melody match component . Accordingly, without the use of metadata, matches having a melody matching strength in the region R can be considered to meet a desired level of precision, and computer-based melody match system  can therefore proceed with identifying the compositions indicated by media file information ,  as matches.","The confidence enhancement component  can increase the number of matches determined to be valid matches. As such, the regions of matches yielding a desired level of precision in computer-based melody matching system  can be increased from region R to combined regions R and R.","Specifically, the confidence enhancement component  can receive and\/or extract metadata associated with the media file information  received from a user, and metadata for the media file information  for the previously-recorded composition performed by the professional artist. The confidence enhancement component  can process the metadata and perform matching based on matches between metadata information. By way of example, but not limitation, the confidence enhancement component  can evaluate metadata indicative of a title of a media file embodying a composition performed and submitted by a user, and match the title with the media file information  if the media file information  includes the same title as the title in the metadata for media file information . A metadata threshold can be trained independent of the melody matching strength.","A metadata match level between the metadata of the media file information ,  can be obtained by the confidence enhancement component . The metadata match level can be compared with a metadata threshold value.","If the metadata match level between the metadata for the media file information ,  is greater than the metadata threshold, the melody matching strength threshold can be decreased from the first value to the second value. Accordingly, the melody match component  can identify matches that have a melody matching strength that is greater than the second value (as opposed to limiting the melody matching strength to be only greater than the first value).","Therefore, the number of valid matches identified can increase to those in regions R and R (instead of only region R). Essentially, the melody matching strength threshold can be decreased due to confidence that valid matches will be made for the media file information , . The confidence in a valid match can be based on a sufficiently high metadata match level between the metadata of the media file information , .","In various embodiments, the melody matching strength threshold can be reduced from the first value to the second value according to a discontinuous function, such as that characterized by a step function. The computer-based melody matching system  generally, or the MMSEC  in particular, can reduce the melody matching strength threshold in various embodiments. In other embodiments, the change in value from the first value to the second value can be according to a continuous function (e.g., the function characterized by the line, L, in .","As such, the computer-based melody matching system  can simultaneously or concurrently utilize metadata and melody information (including, but not limited to, melody fingerprints, or signatures) to increase the number of valid matches while substantially maintaining precision in matching.","In various embodiments, the confidence enhancement component  can utilize video information associated with the media file information , . For example, the media file information ,  can be or include a video channel. In some embodiments, a video channel can include a channel over which videos are distributed. In various embodiments, the videos can relate to user performances of a particular previously-recorded composition, for example. In another example, the videos can relate to renditions of one or more previously-recorded compositions performed by a particular artist (e.g., Ray Charles). Metadata about the video channel can be compared with one or more metadata for videos associated with the previously-recorded composition. The metadata match level between the metadata for the videos can be compared to the metadata threshold value.","If the metadata match level between the metadata associated with the videos is greater than the metadata threshold, the melody matching strength threshold can be decreased from a first value to a second value for the compositions associated with the videos. Accordingly, the melody match component  can identify matches that have a melody matching strength that is greater than the second value (as opposed to requiring that the melody matching strength be greater than the first value).","In other embodiments, the decision as to whether a match is valid can be a function of the metadata match level and the melody matching strength. For example, with reference to the , the metadata match level and melody matching strength can be determined, and the matches having metadata match level and melody matching strength values placing the matches in the regions R or R can be determined to be valid matches.","Microprocessor  can perform one or more of the functions described herein with reference to any of the systems and\/or methods disclosed. The memory  can be a computer-readable storage medium storing computer-executable instructions and\/or information for performing the functions described herein with reference to any of the systems and\/or methods disclosed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"The confidence enhancement component \u2032 can include a metadata matching component , a thresholding component , a microprocessor  and a memory . One or more of the metadata matching component , thresholding component , microprocessor  and\/or memory  can be electrically and\/or communicatively coupled to one another to perform one or more of the functions described for the confidence enhancement component \u2032. In some embodiments, the confidence enhancement component \u2032 can have the structure and\/or perform one or more of the functions described above with reference to the confidence enhancement component  of  (and similarly, the confidence enhancement component  can have the structure and\/or perform one or more of the functions of confidence enhancement component \u2032).","As shown in , the confidence enhancement component \u2032 can receive metadata , . The metadata ,  can be associated with two respective media files (and\/or fingerprints representative of compositions) from a user (e.g., a user performance) and for a previously-recorded composition (e.g., a Ray Charles performance).","The metadata matching component  can receive and\/or extract the metadata , . The metadata matching component  can process the metadata ,  and perform matching based on matches between the metadata , . By way of example, but not limitation, the metadata ,  can be indicative of a title of a composition, a name of a professional artist that performs the composition, the title of a file associated with the composition or the like.","The thresholding component  can train metadata match levels of metadata to determine an appropriate metadata threshold. The thresholding component  can compare the metadata match level of the metadata ,  to the metadata threshold.","If the metadata match level between the metadata ,  is greater than the metadata threshold, the thresholding component  (or the confidence enhancement component \u2032, generally) can output a signal that can be received by the computer-based melody matching system  of . The signal can cause the computer-based melody matching system  to decrease a melody matching strength threshold from a first value to a second value based at least on the metadata match level being greater than the metadata threshold.","With reference to ,  and , accordingly, the melody match component  can regard as valid, matches that have a melody matching strength that is greater than a second value (as opposed to requiring that the melody matching strength be greater than a first value). Therefore, the number of valid matches identified can increase to those in regions R and R (instead of only region R). Essentially, the threshold for melody matching, the melody matching strength threshold, can be decreased in certain circumstances due to increased confidence, by or using the confidence enhancement component , that valid matches will be made for the media file information , . The confidence can be based on a sufficiently high metadata match level between the corresponding respective metadata ,  (e.g., title, name, fingerprints, signatures, and\/or video channel).","In various embodiments, the melody matching strength threshold can be reduced from the first value to the second value according to a discontinuous function, such as that characterized by a step function.
