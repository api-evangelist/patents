No. 61\/228230 filed on Jul. 24, 2009.","[Not Applicable].","[Not Applicable].","Certain embodiments of the invention relate to device management. More specifically, certain embodiments of the invention relate to a method and system for PVR on Internet enabled televisions (TVs).","Audiovisual display devices are utilized to play broadcast media streams received from broadcast head-ends. Broadcast media streams are received via the Internet and\/or via TV broadcasts. For example, Television (TV) broadcasts are generally transmitted by television head-ends over broadcast channels, via RF carriers. The TV head-ends may comprise terrestrial TV head-ends, Cable-Television (CATV), and\/or satellite TV head-ends. The TV head-ends may utilize, for example, a set of broadcast channels to facilitate TV broadcast. The TV broadcasts comprise transmission of video and\/or audio information, wherein the video and\/or audio information may be encoded into the broadcast channels via one of plurality of available modulation schemes. The TV Broadcasts may utilize analog and\/or digital modulation format. In analog television systems, picture and sound information are encoded into, and transmitted via analog signals, wherein the audio\/video information may be conveyed via broadcast signals, via amplitude and\/or frequency modulation on the television signal, based on analog television encoding standard. Analog television broadcasters may, for example, encode their signals using NTSC, PAL and\/or SECAM analog encoding and then modulate these signals onto a VHF or UHF RF carriers, for example.","In digital television (DTV) systems, television broadcasts may be communicated by terrestrial, cable, and\/or satellite head-ends via discrete (digital) signals, utilizing one or more of available digital modulation schemes, which may comprise, for example, QAM, VSB, QPSK, and\/or OFDM. The use of digital signals generally requires less bandwidth than analog signals to convey the same amount of information. Accordingly, DTV systems may enable broadcasters to provide more digital channels within the same space otherwise available to analog television systems. In addition, the use of digital television signals may enable broadcasters to provide high-definition television (HDTV) broadcasting and\/or to provide other non-television related service via the digital system. Available digital television systems comprise, for example, ATSC, DVB, and\/or VSB based systems. Video and\/or audio information may be encoded into digital television signals utilizing various video and\/or audio encoding and\/or compression algorithms, which may comprise, for example, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC, MP3, AC-3, AAC, and\/or HE-AAC.","Media streams are sometimes broadcast via the Internet. Internet head-ends are utilized, for example, to communicate multimedia streaming data, which may correspond to TV broadcasts, via the Internet based on one or more applicable networking standards, including TCP\/IP.","Televisions (TVs) and\/or other audiovisual playback devices are utilized to play received TV and\/or media broadcasts. The received TV and\/or media broadcasts are inputted directly into the playback devices, and the playback devices are enabled to perform, for example, necessary tuning and\/or processing operations to extract the audio\/video information. Alternately, specialized devices referred to as set-top boxes are utilized to provide necessary processing operations that convert TV and\/or Internet based media broadcasts to signals suitable for play via the playback devices.","Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with some aspects of the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.","A system and\/or method is provided for PVR on Internet enabled TVs, substantially as shown in and\/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.","These and other advantages, aspects and novel features of the present invention, as well as details of an illustrated embodiment thereof, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings.","Certain embodiments of the invention may be found in a method and system for personal video recording (PVR) on Internet enabled TVs.

The broadcast sources may comprise satellite head-ends, cable head-ends, and\/or broadcast media head-ends, accessible, for example, via the Internet. At least some of the replacement media content may then be retrieved when personal video recording (PVR) operations are requested during play of the received broadcast media stream, to enable seamless performance of the requested PVR operations using at least a portion of the retrieved replacement media content. Exemplary PVR operations may comprise pausing, fast forwarding, and\/or rewinding. Play of the received broadcast media stream may be delayed to accommodate for the determination of availability of the replacement media content and\/or retrieval of at least some of the replacement media content. The delay may be effectuated by, for example, buffering the received broadcast media stream during reception. The playback of received broadcast media streams may also be delayed in instances where availability and\/or location of sources of replacement media content may be determined prior to any request of PVR operations wherein such delay may be due to, for example, buffering requirements in the media playback device. The replacement media content may be retrieved from a plurality of local and\/or remote replacement servers. Where multiple replacement media streams are available at varying transmission rates, the lower rate streams may first be utilized to start off or pre-buffer during playback of broadcast media stream, and then switch to higher rate streams when the PVR operations are actually initiated. Availability of replacement media content, from remote replacement servers, may be determined based on programming data in the broadcast media stream, routing information provided by a broadcast source, and\/or by inquiry via one or more cataloguing servers. The programming data may comprise program-specific metadata and\/or broadcast guide data included in the broadcast media stream, which may be used to generate broadcast program guide information.

Additionally, because most satellite-TV downlink feeds may be securely encoded and\/or scrambled, the satellite-TV receiver  may also comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces, and\/or code that may enable decoding, descrambling, and\/or deciphering of received satellite-TV feeds.","The Internet broadcast head-end  may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces, and\/or code that may enable media\/TV broadcasts via the Internet . The Internet  may comprise a system of interconnected networks, which enables exchange of information and\/or data among a plurality of nodes, based on one or more networking standards, including, for example, TCP\/IP. For example, the Internet  may enable connectivity among a plurality of private and public, academic, business, and\/or government nodes and networks, wherein the physical connectivity may be provided via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), via copper wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless interfaces, and\/or other standards-based interfaces.","The set-top box  may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces, and\/or code that may enable processing of TV and\/or media streams\/signals transmitted by one or more head-ends, for example the terrestrial-TV head-end , the CATV head-end , the satellite-TV head-end , and\/or the Internet broadcast head-end .

The replacement media server  may communicate the replacement data, if available, via the Internet , for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","200"]},"In step , broadcast data reception is initiated. For example, the media processing system  initiates reception of media broadcast via the broadcast media communication interface . In step , availability of replacement data for PVR operations may be determined. For example, during media broadcast reception via the media processing system , PVR operations, which may comprise fast-forward, rewind, and\/or pause, may be requested via the media playback device . Accordingly, and to facilitate performing such PVR operations, the media processing system  may be operable to search for one or more instances of the replacement media server , which may comprise replacement data. The replacement data management module  may be operable to determine, via the replacement media communication interface , whether the replacement media server  is accessible, via the Internet  for example. The determination may be performed directly via the media processing system , and\/or via the cataloguing server . In instances where it is determined that the replacement media server  is inaccessible, the exemplary steps may terminate.","Returning to step , in instances where it is determined that the replacement media server  is accessible; the exemplary steps may proceed to step . In step , a determination of needed replacement data may be performed. For example, the current elapsed time may be determined, accounting for advertising time for example, via the media processing system  and\/or via the cataloguing server , and a request for replacement data may then be communicated to the replacement media server . In step , the replacement data may be retrieved from the replacement media server . For example, the media processing system  may be operable to receive, via the replacement media communication interface , replacement data communicated by the replacement media server  via the Internet . In step , the replacement data may be utilized to perform requested PVR operations seamlessly via the media playback device . In other words, the media playback device  may utilize the received replacement data such that it may appear to the user\/viewer that the PVR operations are performed directly on broadcast streams. The replacement data may be processed via the processing circuitry , wherein the replacement data management module  may be operable to manage extraction of audio\/video information of the retrieved data, which may be decoded via the audio\/video decoding module , and queued and\/or buffered utilizing the queue management module  and the memory . The extracted data which need be used during PVR operations may then be processed via the audio\/video processing module  to enable generation of corresponding streams for playback via the media playback device .","Various embodiments of the invention may comprise a method and system for PVR on Internet enabled TVs. The media processing system  may be operable to determine availability of replacement media content corresponding to at least a portion of broadcast media streams received, via the broadcast media communication interface , from the satellite infrastructure , the cable-fiber infrastructure , and\/or the Internet media infrastructure . The replacement media content may be retrieved from, for example, one or more of the remote replacement media server . At least some of the replacement media content may be retrieved, via the replacement media communication interface , when personal video recording (PVR) operations are requested during play of received broadcast media streams, to enable seamless performance of the requested PVR operations using at least a portion of the retrieved replacement media content. Exemplary PVR operations may comprise pausing, fast forwarding, and\/or rewinding. The replacement data management module  may be operable to manage performing PVR operations using replacement data content, including controlling, locating and\/or retrieving replacement data to facilitate PVR operations during reception of broadcast media streams via the media processing system . Play of the received broadcast media stream may be delayed, during processing of the processing circuitry , to accommodate for the determination of availability of the replacement media content, via the remote replacement media server , and\/or retrieval of at least some of the replacement media content, for example. The delay may be effectuated by, for exampling, buffering the received broadcast media stream, via the memory , during reception. The delay may also be introduced during processing via the audio\/video processing module . The playback of received broadcast media streams may also be delayed even where availability and\/or location of sources of replacement media content may be determined prior to any request of PVR operations wherein such delay may be due to, for example, buffering requirements in the media processing system . In addition, where multiple replacement media streams are available at varying transmission rates, the lower rate streams may first be utilized to start off or pre-buffer during playback of broadcast media stream, and then switch to higher rate streams when the PVR operations are actually initiated. Also, where replacement media content may be available from a plurality of sources, the media processing system  may be operable to transition between sources during PVR operations. For example, the media processing system  may initially use a first source that may provide necessary replacement content at desirable transmission rate and\/or delay, and may then switch to another source if the first source used initially comprises only part of the required content and\/or becomes unavailable. Availability of replacement media content, from remote replacement media server , may be determined, via the replacement data management module , based on programming data in the broadcast media stream, routing information provided by a broadcast source, and\/or by inquiry via one or more cataloguing servers . The programming data may comprise program-specific metadata and\/or broadcast guide data included in the broadcast media stream, which may be used to generate broadcast program guide information. The media processing system  may also be operable to communicate matching information to the cataloguing server  to enabling offload performance of the determination of availability of replacement media content to the cataloguing server . The matching information comprise location, time, program, and\/or provider information, which may be utilized to match current broadcast media streams with replacement media content available via remote replacement servers. The media processing system  may return to playing the broadcast media stream based on, for example, user input, completion of PVR operations, and\/or after all available replacement media content is used. The media processing system  may be operable to perform the return to playback of broadcast media stream seamlessly.","Another embodiment of the invention may provide a machine and\/or computer readable storage and\/or medium, having stored thereon, a machine code and\/or a computer program having at least one code section executable by a machine and\/or a computer, thereby causing the machine and\/or computer to perform the steps as described herein for PVR on Internet enabled TVs.","Accordingly, the present invention may be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.
