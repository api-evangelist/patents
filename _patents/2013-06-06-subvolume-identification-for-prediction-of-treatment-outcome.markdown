title: Subvolume identification for prediction of treatment outcome
abstract: Physiological imaging-defined subvolumes of tissues/disease are identified to yield spatially-defined prognostic and/or predictive indicators and/or focal therapy targets within such tissues, in particular tumors, for evaluation over time, for example, prior to and after a therapy treatment. Medical image data is analyzed to delineate subvolumes of tissue based upon multiple physiological, metabolic, and biological imaging properties, where those subvolumes are extracted and analyzed in a probabilistic manner to associate with one or more abnormal or disease phenotype conditions.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF DETAILED EXAMPLES"],"p":["This application claims benefit to U.S. Patent Application No. 61\/656,323, filed on Jun. 6, 2012, and entitled \u201cSUBVOLUME IDENTIFICATION FOR PREDICTION OF TREATMENT OUTCOME,\u201d the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","This invention was made with government support under Contract Nos. RO1 NS064973, R21 CA113699, and 3P01 CA59827 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to a method to identify physiological, metabolic, molecular, and\/or biological imaging-defined abnormalities (phenotypes) of diseases for diagnosis, prognosis or prediction of therapy response and\/or for intensified local treatment.","When treating tumors, the effectiveness of a treatment is determined by analyzing tumor size, comparing the size pre-treatment and post-treatment. Typically, tumor size is measured through an analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other image data. Such techniques have been used for years and are relatively effective. However, unfortunately, a tumor size change often occurs late, and therefore the patient loses the time window for optimal treatment.","In recent years, physiological, metabolic and molecular imaging has been developed and tested for early prediction of tumor treatment response and outcome with a promise that a biological change in the tumor could occur prior to its size change. Analysis of physiological, metabolic and molecular imaging in the tumor is often done by averaging the values of the relevant physiological imaging parameter in the tumor and then comparing the mean values between pre and post therapy. This is a simple but not effective approach due to neglecting the heterogeneous distribution of the physiological parameter in the tumor, particularly in large tumors. An average value of a physiological imaging parameter in the tumor can wash out the sensitivity of the parameter to a change in the tumor. Indeed, this sensitivity problem is a direct result of the inability of existing techniques to effectively discriminate the information within a tumor image. Tumor image data may reflect numerous different phenotypes\/conditions within a tissue mass, but without an ability to properly discriminate between these different phenotypes\/conditions, from a medical image data, effective analysis and diagnosis is limited.","A voxel-by-voxel analysis of a change in the physiological, metabolic or molecular imaging parameter of the tumor pre and post therapy is an improvement but requires an accurate registration of a pair of images obtained pre and post therapy. When there is tumor growth and shrinkage from pre to post therapy, the results of the voxel-by-voxel analysis of the physiological imaging are often incorrect or, at a minimum, misleading. The reasons for this are numerous, but the primary culprit is mis-registration of image data at the voxel level. As a tumor changes in size, it is difficult to register with satisfactory certainty a first image of a tumor, taken at one point, e.g., pre-treatment, with the second image of that same tumor, now changed, taken at a second point, e.g., post treatment. This image registration problem commonly requires complex image analysis to correct and still limits the effectiveness of practitioners to use physiological, metabolic and molecular imaging for proper tumor treatment assessment.","To derive a physiological imaging parameter from dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data or other dynamic PET\/SPECT data involves time-consuming pharmacokinetic modeling. Trying to diagnose physiological conditions from that image parameter is prone to error, poor reproducibility and lack of accuracy. For example, in analyzing a physiological imaging parameter of a tumor for therapy response, a parameter such as Gd-DTPA (gadopentetic acid) transfer constant (K) derived from DCE-MRI by a pharmacokinetic model is sensitive to noise in the DCE-MRI, and has a reproducibility of approximately 20%, which reduces the minimum change that can be detected post therapy compared to pre therapy. Ultimately, medical imaging is used in tumor treatment to determine which treatments are more effective and where to direct those treatments within the patient. For example, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) seeks to deliver high-precision nonuniform dose patterns through \u2018painting\u2019 and \u2018sculpting\u2019 doses in a radiation target volume in order to improve the therapeutic ratio and treatment outcome. The conventional IMRT attempts to optimize and deliver a treatment plan having a uniform dose distribution within a target volume delineated primarily based upon anatomic images of computed tomography (CT) and\/or MRI. Geometrically conforming high doses within the target volume by IMRT can reduce dose-spread into normal tissue and organs at risk. However, target volume delineation based upon anatomic information provided by CT images and MRI images is limited. Also, considering spatially-heterogeneous biological properties of a tumor, a uniform dose distribution within a target volume might not lead to an optimal treatment outcome.","In any event, voxel-by-voxel image analyses, while effective to an extent, are limiting. A more useful approach is desired.","The present techniques address the foregoing problems by providing techniques for assessing imaging-defined abnormalities (phenotypes) of diseases in regions of interests, through physiological, metabolic, biologic, and\/or molecular imaging, to identify abnormality probabilities of a tumor or other disease, and more specifically multiple biological subvolumes that may be analyzed against any number of disease conditions. In this way, not only are diagnostic determinations possible, but prognostic or predictive determinations can be made for predicting a therapy response and outcome of treatment on an identified subvolume. From here, the techniques may be used to provide a biological-imaging defined target for intensive treatments, e.g., for more effective \u2018painting\u2019 and \u2018sculpting\u2019 of radiation dosage treatments or any number of tumor treatment optimizations.","In some examples, the present techniques are built upon the development of a functional image analysis framework to integrate physiological, metabolic, molecular, and\/or biological information from a variety of functional imaging sources, to delineate imaging-defined \u201cphenotype\u201d subvolumes of a tumor and to relate them to treatment response and outcome.","The techniques are designed to delineate subvolumes of a tumor based upon its heterogeneous distributions of physiological, metabolic, and\/or biological imaging parameters. For example, the techniques may assign each voxel a probabilistic membership function belonging to the physiological parameter classes defined in a sample of tumors and then calculates the related subvolumes in each tumor. In some examples, the present techniques were used to delineate tumor subvolumes from regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and Gd-DTPA (gadopentetic acid) transfer constant (K) from blood plasma to tissue in patients who have had brain metastases and who received whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). A subvolume analysis of the tumor, and in particular in changes to the subvolume after starting therapy, was used to assess and predict treatment response from pre-treatment to post-RT. Changes in the rCBV (or K)-defined subvolumes of the tumors after starting RT were evaluated for differentiating responsive, stable and non-responsive tumors using, from which performance metrics for predicting tumor response to WBRT was developed, with suitable results from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The ROC analysis showed that this new metric was significantly better than the decrease in the gross tumor volume (GTV) observed during the same time interval for predicting post-therapy response, suggesting that physiological imaging adds discriminatory information compared to the volumetric change.","Other techniques herein include developing a diffusion abnormality index (DAI) to quantify the extent of abnormality of the tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram compared to normal tissue. A normal tissue ADC histogram, H(ADC), is obtained in a normal brain volume of 3-4 cc with the peak normalized to 1. The tumor ADC histogram that usually spreads beyond H(ADC) is divided by H(ADC) into 3 categories: low (high cellularity), normal, and high (edema and necrosis) ADC. An abnormal diffusion probability function (DAProF) of the tumor is then defined by 1-H(ADC) and band-pass filtered to reduce noise influence at the two tails of the histogram. Given that changes in low and high ADCs could have different roles in response assessment, a factor (0<\u03b1<1) is used to weight the low ADC contribution to the DAProF related to high ADC's. As a result, a DAI is defined as an integral of the DAProF-weighted tumor ADC histogram. The performance of DAI for predicting the post-treatment radiographic response was also evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis and compared with changes in gross tumor volume (GTV) observed during the same time interval. The performance of DAI worsened for the radioresistant lesions treated by WBRT combined with Bortezomib but still better than changes in the GTV, suggesting that the physiological change occurs prior to the volumetric change.","In accordance with an embodiment, a method of analyzing medical image data of a region of interest in a sample tissue, the method comprises: obtaining, at a computer system, the medical image data of the region of interest, the medical image data containing image segments; identifying, at the computer system, one or more candidate physiological, metabolic, molecular and\/or biologic parameters that may indicate an abnormal or disease phenotype condition within the region of interest; analyzing, in a subvolume analysis engine, each of the image segments using an algorithm to determine, for each image segment, a probability function for each of the identified one or more candidate physiological, metabolic, and\/or biologic parameters; and modeling the image segments, in the subvolume analysis engine, and analyzing the resulting model to identify the abnormal or disease phenotype condition within the region of interest, where the identification produces a diagnostic determination of the region of interest, a prognostic determination of the target tissue, or a predictive determination of the target tissue.","In accordance with another embodiment, an apparatus for analyzing medical image data of a region of interest in a sample tissue, the apparatus comprises: a computer system having a processor executing instructions that, when executed, (i) obtain the medical image data of the region of interest, the medical image data containing image segments, and (ii) identify one or more candidate physiological, metabolic, molecular and\/or biologic parameters that may indicate an abnormal or disease phenotype condition within the region of interest; and the computer system further comprising a subvolume analysis engine to (i) analyze each of the image segments using an algorithm to determine, for each image segment, a probability function for each of the identified one or more candidate physiological, metabolic, and\/or biologic parameters, (ii) model the image segments, in the subvolume analysis engine, and (iii) analyze the resulting model to identify the abnormal or disease phenotype condition within the region of interest, where the identification produces a diagnostic determination of the region of interest, a prognostic determination of the target tissue, or a predictive determination of the target tissue.","The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined in yet other embodiments.","The present techniques provide image analysis of the heterogeneous distribution of one or more candidate physiological, metabolic, molecular and\/or biologic imaging parameters in the tumor to determine the abnormality probability map and a quantitative abnormality metric. The abnormality metric and a change during the course of therapy are designed for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of tumor response to treatment. When assessing a tumor response to treatment, this technique does not require co-registration of images acquired at two different points in time. Furthermore, the techniques do not use hard thresholding to analyze the heterogeneous distribution of the physiological imaging parameters in the tumor. The techniques may be applied to physiological, metabolic, molecular and\/or biologic imaging parameters (e.g., vascular parameters or features, cellular parameters or features, etc.) as well as to the dynamic contrast agent\/tracer uptake images directly, e.g., DCE-MRI, dynamic PET\/SPECT, with or without pharmacokinetic modeling. And the techniques can be used to analyze multiple physiological, metabolic, molecular and\/or biologic parameters for testing discriminatory or redundant information, and to combine them into a single metric.","The techniques herein differ from methods that generate parametric response maps (PRMs). In the PRM method, after co-registration of a pair of images acquired at two different time points over therapy, a difference of the image intensities before and after therapy at each voxel is analyzed; and a response value is assigned to each voxel according to its change above or below a cutoff threshold. Although analyzing a voxel-wise change in a tumor is an interesting approach, mis-registration of the image voxels, particularly in the region where a tumor shrinks or grows during the time interval, could compromise the result. The techniques also differ from using a hard threshold to segment the abnormal value of the heterogeneously-distributed physiological imaging parameter. While using a threshold value to segment a tumor volume is simple, the binary decision discards the parameter continuity at the threshold value. Furthermore, finding an adequate threshold value is always a challenge, and often done empirically and sometimes arbitrarily.","The present techniques overcome these challenges, by using a smart algorithm, e.g., fuzzy logic, a genetic algorithm, or Gaussian mixture models, to analyze physiological, metabolic, molecular, and\/or biologic imaging-parameters or features of voxels from a sample of tumors. The algorithm may be globally-initiated in a training state from a collective sample and provide localized assessment of individual tumors or regions in an analysis state. A probability density function or histogram of the imaging-parameters or features from all the voxels of the sample of the tumors is created, and analyzed by a fuzzy logic algorithm or other discrimination algorithm for determining the abnormality classifications and related probability functions. For a new tumor, after measuring and deriving the imaging parameters or features, the abnormality classifications determined from the sample of the tumors are applied in order to assign each voxel of the new tumor a probability function of belonging to those image-defined abnormality classes. Then, an abnormality probability map of the tumor can be created as an output for visualization and\/or a target for focal therapy, e.g., radiation boost target. Finally, a quantitative abnormality metric of the tumor is created according to its abnormality probability functions for diagnosis and prognosis of the tumor. A change in the abnormality metric during the course of therapy or post therapy, reflecting a change in the physiological, metabolic, molecular or biologic imaging-parameters in the tumor\u2014note such changes often occur before a volumetric change is achieved for prediction of tumor response to therapy. As mentioned before, the present techniques do not depend upon voxel-wise accuracy of registration of a pair of images acquired pre and during or post therapy or use any hard threshold to determine the abnormality level of the tumor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"]},"The techniques of  may be utilized on different properties of the subvolumes of a tumor, such as the vascularity of subvolumes of the tumor, the cellularity of subvolumes of the tumor, etc. For example, the method may utilize vascular properties, such as blood flow, blood volume, etc. in predicting treatment outcome. On the other hand, the method may also examine cellularity properties (i.e., the water mobility in tissue) to determine an abnormal diffusion coefficient in predicting treatment outcome. The prediction results from the both properties may be combined or added together to provide a more refined, accurate overall prediction for treatment outcome.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15"]},"I. Subvolume Analysis of a Tumor","The technique of subvolume analysis of a tumor, as illustrated in , is designed to delineate subvolumes of a tumor based upon its heterogeneous distributions of physiological imaging-derived parameters or features. Furthermore, this subvolume analysis method may accept one or more different imaging-derived parameters as inputs. For instance, one of type of physiological imaging-derived parameter may include one or more parameters generated from a pharmacokinetics (PK) modeling technique. Using inputs from this PK modeling technique, the subvolume analysis technique assigns each image voxel a probabilistic membership function belonging to the physiological parameter classes defined in a sample of tumors, and then calculates the related subvolumes in each tumor. Furthermore, this technique may define or model subvolumes of volume-weighted physiological parameters using probabilistic classification of image voxels for features predictive of poor treatment outcome combined with clustering methods, for example.","The subvolume analysis technique of  may also use principal component (PC) features derived from a principal component analysis (PCA) as inputs as opposed to using the PK modeling inputs. This PCA is a pharmacokinetic model free framework that analyzes the dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data. This PCA technique further utilizes DCE-MRI data from image voxels of a sample of brain tumors to construct a DCE matrix. PCA may then be applied to generate the PCs and subsequent projection coefficient maps. Next, a modeling technique, such as a pattern recognition based upon fuzzy-c-means clustering, may be used to delineate the tumor subvolumes relating to the value of the projection coefficients. The relationship between changes in different tumor subvolumes and treatment response may be evaluated to differentiate responsive from stable and progressive tumors.","A. Pharmacokinetics Modeling in Subvolume Analysis","There is an understanding that high mean or rCBV or Kin the brain tumor prior to therapy is correlated with a high tumor grade and worse outcome. A reduction in the high rCBV and\/or Kin brain tumors during radiation therapy is associated with better outcome. All these suggest that high-rCBV and\/or Kin the brain tumor, as an imaging-defined tumor \u201cphenotype\u201d and the related changes during therapy, are important prognostic and predictive indictors. Based upon these observations in the brain tumors, the techniques herein were evaluated to delineate the high rCBV (abnormality) probability map of the tumor and\/or the abnormality subvolumes defined by rCBV, K, or combinations of the two parameters in the brain metastases. As discussed above, it was found that the early change in the high rCBV-defined subvolume of the tumor is a better predictor for the post-therapy tumor volumetric change, and has the potential to be used for selecting the lesion and defining the target for intensified treatment. The results also indicated that K, although a different physiological parameter in the tumor compared to rCBV, does not add significant discriminatory information for assessment of brain metastases response to WBRT. However, the techniques herein can be used to test whether including other physiological imaging parameters in analyses, e.g., apparent diffusion coefficient or 11 C-MET positron emission tomography (PET), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, etc. can improve prediction for treatment response. This type of analysis can help determine whether multiple candidate physiological, metabolic, molecular, and\/or biologic imaging parameters provide complementary or redundant information. Also, the analysis can be adapted to specific tumor types and treatment modalities.","Experiment 1","Patient Sample:","In an example implementation of the techniques described herein, twenty patients (11 women and 9 men, ages 41-76 years) diagnosed with brain metastases were enrolled in a prospective MRI study approved by the institutional review board (Table 1). The histology included melanoma (11), non-small cell lung cancer (6), renal cell carcinoma (1), breast cancer (1), and head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (1). All patients received WBRT with a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions (13 patients) or 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions (7 patients). In addition, thirteen patients received Bortezomib during WBRT as a radiation sensitizer. If a patient had three brain metastatic lesions or less, all lesions were included in this analysis. If a patient had more than three lesions, only the three largest lesions were included. If a patient had more than three lesions larger than 1 cm, the lesions greater than 1 cmwere also included. As a total, 45 lesions with a median volume of 1.65 cmand a range of 0.1-17.6 cmwere analyzed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Patients Characteristics - Example 1"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Total","Concurrent"]},{"entry":["Pt.","Gender\/Age",{},"No. of","Volume range","accumulated","drug"]},{"entry":["No.","(Y)","Histology","lesions","(cm)","dose\/Fx (Gy)","treatment"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","F\/54","BC","3","\u20034.23-11.78","37.5\/2.5","None"]},{"entry":["2","M\/63","RCC","2","\u200213.23-14.67","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["3","M\/41","M","3","0.150-1.24","37.5\/2.5","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["4","F\/60","NSCLC","1","0.518","37.5\/2.5","None"]},{"entry":["5","F\/52","M","1","2.74\u2002","37.5\/2.5","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["6","F\/45","M","1","2.07\u2002","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["7","M\/49","M","2","0.171-4.09","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["8","F\/51","NSCLC","3","0.503-4.55","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["9","M\/61","M","4","\u20036.64-17.67","37.5\/2.5","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["10","M\/52","NSCLC","1","0.479","30\/3","None"]},{"entry":["11","F\/55","M","2","\u20020.421-0.545","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["12","M\/76","M","1","0.680","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["13","F\/46","M","6","\u20021.25-1.95","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["14","F\/57","M","2","0.941-1.58","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["15","F\/64","NSCLC","1","0.108","37.5\/2.5","None"]},{"entry":["16","M\/60","M","3","0.179-1.31","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["17","F\/74","M","4","0.690-5.81","30\/3","Bortezomib"]},{"entry":["18","M\/43","H&N SCC","1","0.601","30\/3","None"]},{"entry":["19","M\/58","NSCLC","3","\u20032.38-10.69","30\/3","None"]},{"entry":["20","F\/66","NSCLC","1","0.954","37.5\/2.5","None"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Abbreviation:"},{"entry":"Pt.

Also, previous studies indicated that brain metastases exhibit little pseudo-response and pseudo-progression one month after RT. Therefore, a percentage change was used in the GTV from Pre-RT to 1 month post RT, {circumflex over (\u0394)}GTV, as a measure of tumor response to therapy. From Pre-RT to 1 M Post-RT, 16 tumors had a decrease in the GTV at least 25%, defined as responsive, 11 tumors had an increase at least 25%, defined as non-responsive, and the remaining 18 were defined as stable.

Next, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the significant metrics identified in the previous test for predicting responsive tumors using software package ROCKIT although any ROC software analysis tool may be used, e.g., any of ROCFIT, LABROC4, PROPROC, CORROC, INDROC, ROCKIT and LABMRMC. Also, these newly developed metrics were compared with the conventional ones, including a percentage change in the GTV from Pre-RT to 2 W, {circumflex over (\u0394)}GTV, and a change in the mean rCBV values of a tumor from pre-RT to 2 W, {circumflex over (\u0394)}\u03bc(rCBV), for predicting post treatment response.

Finally, the predictive value of {circumflex over (\u0394)}\u03bcwas slightly but not significantly better than {circumflex over (\u0394)}GTV(p>0.41).","Thus, the present techniques propose new approaches to delineating the abnormality subvolumes of a tumor defined from physiological, metabolic, and\/or biological imaging parameters and relating their early changes to treatment response in the patients who have had brain metastases treated by WBRT. The approaches analyze the heterogeneous distributions of physiological, metabolic, and\/or biological imaging parameters of the tumors, then assigns each voxel of the tumor a probabilistic membership function belonging to the various physiological, metabolic, or biological classes defined in a sample of tumors, and finally calculates the related subvolumes in each tumor.","The framework presented herein can be applied to other physiological, metabolic or molecular images, including but not limited to apparent diffusion coefficient and 11 C-Methinion positron emission tomography (PET), to delineate a different physiological-parameter defined subvolume of a tumor. A subvolume of the tumor defined in such way could be a candidate for a radiation boost target volume, for example.","Experiment 2","In another example implementation the present techniques were applied to dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI image data. The implementation used global initiated regularized local fuzzy clustering (GRELFC), similar to the techniques outlined above, to identify abnormal subvolumes of head and neck cancers (HNC) from heterogeneous distributions of tumor blood volume (BV) and blood flow (BF), i.e., from functional image data for assessment of therapy response.","In operation, BV and BF images, derived from DCE-MRI, of 14 patients with advanced HNC were obtained before chemo-radiation therapy (chemo-RT) and 2 weeks after start of 7-week chemo-RT. The delineated subvolumes of tumors with low BV or BF before and during treatment were evaluated for their associations with local failure. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess performance of the method for prediction of local failure of HNC. As discussed further, the results showed that the sizes of the subvolumes of primary tumors with low BV before and during treatment were significantly greater in the patients with local failure (LF) than with local control (LC) (p=0.02 and 0.01, respectively). While the total tumor volume reductions during treatment were similar for the patients with LF and LC, the reduction rate of the size of the subvolumes of the primary tumor with low BV in response to 2 weeks of chemo-RT was significantly slower for the patients with LF than those with LC. The subvolumes of the tumor with low BV before and during treatment have greater specificity for prediction of local failure, with a given sensitivity, than the pre-treatment total tumor volume, the percentage change in the tumor volume during treatment, or the change in the mean value of BV over the whole tumor during chemo-RT.","Standard care for advanced head-and-neck cancers (HNC) includes aggressive concurrent chemo-radiation therapy (chemo-RT). Intensifying this regimen has resulted in improved control rates as well as increased rates and severity of late toxicity. Despite improvements, failure rates are 20-50% in patients who are negative for human papillomavirus and failures are predominantly local-regional. The present techniques provide a means for prognostic or predictive valuation to facilitate identification of subvolumes of the tumors likely to be resistant to conventional radiation doses in the patients who are at high-risk for local-regional failure and who thus may benefit from intensifying local treatment. Recently, functional imaging that assesses tumor hypoxia or perfusion prior to therapy in HNC has been described. In patients with HNC treated by RT, low tumor perfusion prior to RT and T-stage classification were identified as independent predictors for local failure, suggesting that poorly perfused HN tumors respond poorly to RT, and that pre-RT tumor perfusion provides prognostic value for local control even when accounting for established clinical prognostic factors. Another recent study showed that high pre-therapy tumor blood volume and perfusion were associated with large decreases in tumor volumes in response to induction chemotherapy. By characterizing tumor properties of blood volume (BV) and blood flow (BF) derived from DCE-MRI images, the present techniques showed that an increase of blood volume in the primary tumor volume during the early course of chemo-RT was associated with local control, which indicates that poorly perfused tumors may be resistant to conventional doses of radiation therapy.","In these previous studies, the average BV and BF in the entire tumor volume were investigated for their association with treatment outcome. However, many advanced head-and-neck cancers have quite inhomogeneous perfusion characteristics within the tumor volume, particularly in large tumors. Thus averaging BV and BF values over the entire tumor may not result in optimal parameters for prediction of outcomes. A change in the total tumor volume during the course of chemo-RT, although the total tumor volume in HNC is a clinical prognostic factor, has a poor predictive value for outcomes. The subvolume of the tumor that is resistant to chemo-RT might provide better prediction for outcomes. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the large poorly perfused subvolume of the head-and-neck tumor pre-therapy and persisting during the early course of definitive chemo-RT could be a better indicator for local-regional treatment failure than the tumor size or the average perfusion parameters over the entire tumors.","Identification of Subvolumes of the Tumor:","the technique implemented in this example was designed to globally initiate training to identify fuzzy clusters of the physiological imaging parameters in the feature space, and then classify each tumor volume with local regularization to subvolumes according to the global feature clusters. The technique is designed not only to identify the subvolumes of individual tumors based upon the heterogeneous distributions of physiological imaging parameters but also to be able to compare the classified subvolumes of the tumors across patients and over multiple time points. The fuzzy clustering method, specifically fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM), chosen in the GRELFC method aims to deal with (1) intrinsic variations of the physiological parameters in the tumors, (2) partial volume effects due to the limited resolution of imaging sources, and (3) uncertainty due to noise. FCM clustering is a method of unsupervised learning to assign a set of observations to belong to subsets (clusters) with probability memberships.

To avoid a bias from large tumors in training data, each of the tumor volumes is up-sampled or down-sampled to have an equal number of voxels contributing to the training data while maintaining the initial distribution of the physiological imaging parameters from the original into the re-sampled tumor. To do so, a histogram of the physiological imaging parameters of each tumor is generated, and re-sampled to create a new tumor volume with the same size. The re-created tumor volume, while preserving the original distribution (histogram) of the imaging parameters, cannot maintain the original spatial relationship between voxels, which is not critical for training data to determine prototype vectors of global clusters. To partition individual tumors in the second data set, fuzzy membership of each voxel of each tumor is classified using the prototype vectors found in analysis of the training data by Eq. 9, where spatial constraint is used to improve spatial continuity. Finally, the highest probability of fuzzy membership of each voxel is used to assign the voxel to a discreet class. As a result, the tumor is partitioned into spatial subvolumes based upon the similarity of the physiological parameters of interest. The temporal changes in partitioned subvolumes of the tumor are evaluated for their association with outcomes. To evaluate this method to identify significant subvolumes of the tumor related to outcomes, the method to BV and BF images derived from DCE-MRI of patients with advanced head and neck cancer was applied.","Patients and Treatment:","14 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas were enrolled in a prospective MRI study that was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Michigan.

Each of the pre-RT primary GTVs was re-sampled to create 10,000 voxels according to the distribution of BV values within the original GTV. This experience suggested that 10,000 voxels per tumor were sufficient to maintain the distribution of BV in the tumor. As a result, the training data consisted of 100\u00d7100\u00d714 voxels (14 is the number of patients), and then was partitioned into 2, 3, or 4 feature clusters using the above described clustering method. The resulting prototype vectors {v} were adopted to partition each individual GTV before and during therapy to obtain the fuzzy membership of each voxel belonging to the feature classes. The subvolumes of the primary GTVs defined by the clusters with low BV before and during RT were tested for their association with local failure using the Mann-Whitney U test. A two-tailed p-value<0.05 was considered significant. The same analysis was applied to BF data.","To evaluate the discriminatory value of BF combined with BV, {x} in Eq. 8 was formed to have two components, BV and BF, which were weighted equally for their contributions. The two-component dataset {x} was analyzed similar to the single parameter.  illustrates the process of classification of the whole GTV into subvolumes based upon their characteristic physiological features and the analysis in the two-component feature space defined by the two parameter maps, BV and BF. The white contour depicts the GTV, and the two-dimensional feature space is depicted with each voxel from the two parameter maps is projected based upon their values. As shown in , the voxels are partitioned into three clusters (e.g., triangles, circles, and squares) using FCM clustering analysis which optimizes homogeneity of the parameters within the cluster and separation between the clusters.","Two representative examples of the subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV, pre-RT, and at week 2 are illustrated in .

When the primary GTVs pre-treatment were partitioned into two classes based upon the BV distribution, the subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV in the patients with LC, ranging from 2.4 to 26.6 mL with a median of 9.9 mL, were significantly smaller than those in the patients with LF (p<0.02), from 15.0 to 46.0 mL with a median of 31.9 mL in the patients with LF as shown in Table 4 and in . After receiving 2 weeks of the 7-week chemo-RT treatment course, the subvolumes of the GTVs with low BV decreased to 0.3 to 17.4 mL with a median of 3.7 mL in the patients with LC, and changed to 7.7 to 49.9 mL with a median of 23.8 mL in the patients with LF. The persistence of large subvolumes of the GTVs with low BV during-treatment differentiated LF from LC tumors significantly (p<0.01) (Table 4), suggesting that a large subvolume of poorly perfused tumor both initially prior to therapy and persisting during the early course of chemo-RT may be an indicator for local failure.  depicts the correlation of the subvolumes with low BV at the two time-points (i.e., pre-RT vs. during-RT) and shows that the subvolumes at these two time-points are highly correlated (e.g., p=0.96).

While analyzing BF with BV together, there was no improvement in the differentiation of the LF from the LC tumors, compared to analysis of BV alone (Table 4).","Predictive Value of the Subvolumes of the Primary GTVs with Low BV for Local Failure:","the predictive value of the subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV pre and during treatment for local failure was explored using ROC analysis, and its performance was compared with other conventional metrics, such as the pre-treatment tumor volume, the percentage change in tumor volume during-treatment, and the change in a mean BV value over the whole tumor during-treatment. The areas under the ROC curves (Az), a measure of overall performance of a metric for prediction of an event (e.g., local failure), indicate that all BV-related (function-based) metrics have better performance than the tumor volume metrics (anatomy-based).  depicts a comparison of fitted ROC curves of five metrics for prediction of local failure. Specifically, the areas under the ROC curves were 0.872\u00b10.098 for the pre-treatment tumor volume and 0.723\u00b10.158 for the 305 percentage tumor volume change during-treatment. However, the change in the mean of tumor BV values during-treatment, a valuable functional parameter for prediction of local failure reported previously, had an area under the ROC curve 0.903\u00b10.084.

The ROC analysis indicates that 85% sensitivity in predicting local failure resulted in 87.5% and 91.0% specificity by the subvolumes of the GTVs with low BV before and during RT, respectively, compared with 83.0% specificity by the change in the mean BV values over the entire GTV during-treatment and 75.5% specificity by the pre-treatment GTV.","Subvolumes of the Nodal GTVs with Low BV:","the subvolumes of the nodal GTVs with low BV were explored.

Prior to treatment, the subvolumes of the nodal GTVs with low BV were 35.5 and 120.1 mL in the two patients with regional failure, which were greater than those with regional control, ranging from 4.0 to 29.5 mL with a median of 15.6 mL. After 2 weeks of chemo-RT, the subvolumes of the nodal GTVs with low BV changed to 11.6 and 132.5 mL in the patients with regional failure, and to a median of 9.9 mL with a range from 3.3 to 24.5 mL in those with regional control. It is worthwhile to point out that the patient who had local-regional failure had the largest subvolume of the nodal GTV with low BV (\u02dc120 mL) and the smallest subvolume of the primary GTV with low BV among the LF cases (\u02dc15 mL as shown in ), and also the primary and nodal GTVs were anatomically adjacent or connected, which might explain why this case deviated from other local failure cases as shown .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1002","1004","1006","1000","1008","1010","1012","1000","1014"]},"In this example, a method was developed and investigated to identify subvolumes of the tumors by characterizing the heterogeneous tumor blood volume and blood flow before and during treatment using DCE-MRI in patients who had advanced HNC and were treated with concurrent chemo-RT. The subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV or BF were related to the outcomes. Also, the predictive value of the subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low BV was explored for local failure and compared these with other quantitative metrics derived from anatomic or functional imaging. It was discovered that the large subvolumes of the primary GTVs with low blood volume pre-treatment and persisting during the early course of chemo-RT are associated with high probability of local failure. For a given sensitivity for prediction of local failure, the tumor subvolume with low blood volume has higher specificity compared to the change in the mean of blood volume values over the whole tumor during-RT, the percentage change of tumor volumes during-RT, or the pre-RT GTV volume. The tumor subvolume with low blood volume might be a better biomarker for identifying the patients with advanced HNC at high-risk for local failure and for defining a radiation boost target to intensify local treatment.","Many large tumors manifest intra-tumor heterogeneity, e.g., multiple phenotypes within a single tumor, which is possibly responsible for heterogeneous treatment response within the tumor. It is plausible that a portion of the tumor is more aggressive or more resistant to treatment, and thereby, might ultimately determine the treatment outcome. However, the mean value or the change in the mean value of a functional imaging parameter over a heterogeneous tumor has generally been used to correlate with treatment outcome in most previous imaging studies, which could compromise the predictive power of the parameter. In this example, in aiming to assess the tumor heterogeneous perfusion and blood volume, and it was found the poorly perfused subvolumes prior to and during chemo-RT have greater specificity for prediction of local failure for a given sensitivity than considering the tumor as a whole ().","It is a challenge to characterize tumor heterogeneity and heterogeneous changes over a longitudinal study. One approach to address the problem is to analyze statistical differences at each voxel over time. This requires a reliable and accurate voxel-to-voxel alignment of images acquired at different time points. The volume, shape and image intensity of the tumors may change over weeks and months. For head-and-neck cancers, the patient position changes due to the neck flexibility over scans can result in additional difficulty for voxel-level image alignment, even with highly sophisticated deformable image registration tools. In addition, voxel-level analyses show large uncertainty and poor reproducibility, which impact on the correlation with response and outcome. Therefore, in this study, a robust technique (clustering analysis) was developed to characterize heterogeneous vascular and perfusion parameters of head-and-neck tumors as well as their changes over time. This technique can map functional images from different time points into a feature space, and then analyzes the intrinsic properties of the parameter of interest by statistically grouping and splitting the voxels into feature classes (e.g., the voxels with low or high blood volume) based upon their similarities and differences. This technique can be applied to imaging data from longitudinal studies without the requirement of voxel-size accuracy of image registration. The technique can be generalized to other tumors and other imaging parameters. Also, fuzzy clustering used in the method allows the system to manage the continuous distribution of the physiological imaging parameters in the tumor as well as noise in images. Through this work, it was demonstrated that the potential value of the feature class (the subvolume of the tumor with low blood volume) delineated by this method for prediction of outcome and definition of potential radiation boost target volumes.","Several methods have been proposed to automatically segment tumor volumes (binary segmentation) as well as for identification of inhomogeneous tumor subvolumes (multiple classes) from metabolic PET images, e.g., watershed and fuzzy local adapted Bayesian (FLAB) segmentation methods. These methods have focused on how to deal with the influence of object (tumor) size on radioactivity detected by PET due to limited spatial resolution, by iterative segmentation using phantom scans for guidance. Recently, FLAB segmentation has been extended to identify multiple classes in the inhomogeneous FDG distribution in the tumors. However, this method needs to pre-define the fuzzy level, and becomes complicated when dealing with 3 or more classes and various object sizes, especially for small objects (<2 cm). Most importantly, these methods cannot handle the longitudinal data. The questions that these methods attempt to address are generally not major concerns in MRI. In this example, it was discovered that the large poorly perfused subvolume of the HNC both before and during the early course of chemo-RT were associated with local failure. Also, these large subvolumes of tumors with low BV had a slow reduction rate in response to early treatment, suggesting local intensification of treatment may be needed to sufficiently reduce this persisting and aggressive portion of the tumors. Information provided by the early-course scans confirmatively support the findings prior to therapy, which could increase the confidence of clinical decision-making based upon the pre-treatment scans alone. Also, a large reduction in the subvolume of tumor with low blood volume during the early course of chemo-RT could be used as an indicator for a decreased-intensity treatment in the patients who have good outcomes in order to reduce normal tissue toxicity. These findings and reproducibility of test and retest of DCE-MRI without therapy will be further investigated in a large cohort study.","B. Principal Component Analysis in Subvolume Analysis","The subvolume analysis method of  may also use PC features derived from PCA as another input. The PCA may include a pharmacokinetic model free framework that analyzes the DCE-MRI data. This PCA technique may also utilize DCE-MRI data from image voxels of a sample of brain tumors to construct a DCE matrix. PCA is then applied to generate the PCs and subsequent projection coefficient maps. Next, a modeling technique, such as a pattern recognition based upon fuzzy-c-means clustering, may be used to delineate the tumor subvolumes relating to the value of the projection coefficients. The relationship between changes in different tumor subvolumes and treatment response may be evaluated to differentiate responsive from stable and progressive tumors.","This PCA technique may use a general framework to derive a response-predictor from DCE-MRI data without using the PK modeling techniques and a general framework to include a semi-automated or fully automated tool for response assessment and therapy guidance in radiation therapy of brain metastases. In this PCA technique, the system may transfer the DCE curves into an N-dimensional feature space using principle component analysis, may identify the most response-related features using a FCM-based technique, and may combine the features to define the tumor subvolumes.","In some examples, this PCA technique contains two phases: a development phase and a usage phase. In the development phase, a sample of the DCE data from brain metastases is processed and analyzed to develop the model and the predictive metric. In the usage phase, the PCA technique determines if the predictive metric could be extracted rapidly from the DCE data of a new patient scan.","Experiment 3","Using the data gathered from Experiment 1, the following steps of the PCA technique were employed.","Pre-Processing; DCE Curves Normalization:","the dynamic curve at each voxel represents the temporal changes in signal intensity after the contrast injection.

Thus, the DCE curves were expanded using a set of basis functions, by which the coefficients of the projection vectors for each DCE curve is a unique representation in a new space. In the development stage, using DCE data from a sample of brain metastases (e.g., pre-therapy DCE data), the matrix C (N\u00d7T) was constructed in which each row represents a DCE curve from one voxel in the tumors. N is the total number of voxels in all tumors and T is the number of time points in each curve. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to C to obtain a complete set of a total of T orthonormal principal components (PC). The Karhumen-Loeve transformation of each DCE curve was performed, S, in each voxel of the tumor to:\n\n\u0394=\u03a3PC\u2261()\u2003\u2003(15)\n\nwhere ais the projection coefficient (cPC) corresponding to the ith principal component. Each DCE curve in a tumor volume is represented uniquely by {\u03b1} in a T-dimensional coefficient space. However, Eq. (15) can be truncated at the first M principal components which contain 99% of energy of the original DCE curves.\n","Projection Coefficient Defined Tumor Subvolumes; Probability Density Function of a Projection Coefficient in a Tumor:","each PC depicts a feature of the tumor DCE curve. Each voxel in a tumor has a unique projection coefficient on each PC. For each PC, the projection coefficients of the voxels in a tumor, which can be presented as a volumetric map of a lesion, have a distinct role in predicting the treatment response and outcome. The distribution of the projection coefficients in a large tumor is heterogeneous, similar to the physiological parameters. Similar to what has been done previously for the physiological parameters, the distribution patterns of a projection coefficient, a, in the lesions were analyzed, and subsequent changes during treatment. A PDF or histogram of aof a lesion is generated using a non-parametric PDF estimator. The PDF consists of 150 evenly-spaced points to cover the range of afor all the lesions of interest. A value of the PDF at a point x, H(a=x), of a lesion is calculated as:\n\n(\u03b1)\u2261\u2003\u2003(16)\n\nwhere nis the number of voxels within |\u03b1\u2212x|<\u03b5, and \u03b5 is a smooth factor of H and set as \u03b5=\u03c3\/4 where \u03c3 denotes a standard deviation of the \u03b1distribution in the tumor. For each lesion, PDFs are calculated for scans at baseline (e.g. pre-therapy as H(x)) and after starting therapy (e.g. at week-2 during therapy as H(x)). After H(x) is normalized to have an area under the PDF curve equal to one (\u222bH(x)dx=1), the H(x)s of all the lesions are summed to generate a pooled PDF (cPDF), in which each lesion has an equal contribution regardless of its size.\n","Probabilistic Membership Functions of Projection Coefficients:","Previous studies have suggested that the rCBV (or K) distribution in a brain tumor is abnormal compared to normal cerebral tissue, as elevated rCBV in a subvolume of the tumor and low rCBV in another one. A renormalization of tumor vasculature, such as decreasing the elevated rCBV and increasing the low one, could be an indicator of a tumor response to treatment. The DCE-derived physiological parameters (e.g., rCBV and K) and projection coefficients, (\u03b1, \u03b1. . . , \u03b1), are two representations of the DCE curves. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that \u03b1in the brain metastases could also distribute abnormally in contrast to normal tissue, and changes during treatment could predict tumor response to therapy. Hence, similar to what has been done for rCBV previously, the pooled distribution of H(\u03b1) to three classes were classified as high, intermediate and low \u03b1classes using fuzzy-c-means (FCM) clustering analysis by minimizing the objective function J:\n\n=\u03a3\u03a3(\u03b1)\u2225\u03b1\u2225, 1\u2266\u2003\u2003(17)\n\nwhere cis a prototype vector of the jth class, P(a) is a probabilistic membership of a avalue belonging to the jth class, and m is a fuzzy exponent and chosen as 2.

Finally, a change of the subvolume from pre-therapy to during or post therapy is determined.","Evaluation; Endpoint: a percentage change in the gross tumor volume (GTV) from pre to post RT was used as an endpoint for response assessment. Several patients did not have 3 or 6 months post treatment imaging follow-ups. For the patients in whom 3 and 6 months post-RT images were available, there were good correlations in the GTV changes between 1 and 3 months post RT and between 3 and 6 months post RT. Also, previous studies indicate that brain metastases exhibit little pseudo-response and pseudo-progression one month after RT. Therefore, a percentage change in the GTV from Pre-RT to 1 month post RT was used, {circumflex over (\u0394)}GTV, as a measure of tumor response to therapy. From Pre-RT to 1 M Post-RT, 16 tumors had a decrease in the GTV at least 25%, defined as responsive, 11 tumors had an increase at least 25%, defined as progressive, and the remaining 18 were defined as stable. It was noticed that there were heterogeneous responses of multiple lesions from a single patient. Thus, each lesion was considered independently.","Parameter Selection and Evaluation: First, the priority of the candidate parameters and subvolumes were ranked by testing if the changes in {circumflex over (\u0394)}SV(\u03b1) significantly differentiated responsive tumors from combined stable and progressive ones using Mann-Whitney U Test. Considering M principal components and two independent subvolumes (only two of the three are independent) for each component, a p-value<(0.05\/2 M) with Bonferroni correction was considered as a significant cutoff to select the parameters. The conventional metrics, such as a percentage change in the GTV from Pre-RT to 2 W ({circumflex over (\u0394)}GTV) and a change in the mean rCBV values of a tumor from pre-RT to 2 W ({circumflex over (\u0394)}\u03bc(rCBV)), were not considered as the candidate parameters in the model, and thus not used for multiple comparison justification. Next, univariate analysis was performed to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the selected significant metrics identified in the previous test for predicting responsive tumors using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis (software package ROCKIT). Also, these newly developed metrics were compared with the conventional metrics including a percentage change in the GTV from Pre-RT to 2 W, {circumflex over (\u0394)}GTV, and a change in the mean rCBV values of a tumor from pre-RT to 2 W, {circumflex over (\u0394)}\u03bc(rCBV), for predicting post treatment response. The significant difference of the area under ROC curves (AUC) between the metrics were compared by t-test, for which the standard error and the difference between the two AUCs were calculated by the method proposed by DeLong et al. To create the tumor subvolume defined by combining more than one cPC, the maximum AUC were used to determine the {\u03b2}.","Results; Principal Components: PCA revealed that the first three principal components (PCs) comprised more than 99.99% of the energy of the DCE curves of brain metastases, of which the first component contributed approximately 99.8% while the second and third components had 0.08% and 0.02% contributions, respectively, as shown in . Further investigation revealed that the first component is related to the area under each DCE curve, while the second and third ones were associated with the enhancement rate of a DCE curve and its derivative, respectively. Therefore, the analysis described in the method section was applied to the histograms of the first three cPCs in a tumor to determine the subvolume of the tumor with a given class.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0158"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"357pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

cPC-Defined Tumor Subvolumes with Response: associations of the changes in the first three cPC-defined brain metastases subvolumes with high, intermediate or low coefficients from pre-RT to 2 W with the tumor response to treatment are given in Table 5. Since the first three components were only compared, a p-value<0.01 was considered as significance to select the candidate parameters. It was found that for the responsive group, a percentage decrease in the high-a1 subvolumes of the tumors from Pre-RT to 2 W differed significantly from the group combining progressive and stable tumors (p<0.0017), Table 5. It was observed a similar but weaker trend for the high-a2 subvolume (p<0.07). Furthermore, a percentage decrease in the low-a3 subvolume of the tumor was associated with tumor response (p<0.01). A percentage decrease in the subvolumes defined by combining the high-a1 and low-a3 classes from pre-RT to 2 W revealed that adding a3 improved the statistical significance for differentiating the responsive tumor from the group of stable and progressive lesions compared to either coefficient alone but a2 did not add discriminatory information. As a post analysis, the comparisons between other lesion groups are also given in Table 5.","Predictive Values of the cPC-Defined Tumor Subvolumes: it was explored that the predictive value of the decrease in the subvolumes of the brain metastases defined by the cPCs from Pre-RT to 2 W for predicting responsive tumors post-RT, and compared their performance with the decrease in subvolumes of the tumors defined by the high rCBV and high Ktrans and two conventional metrics. The ROC analysis showed that the AUCs were 0.83\u00b10.06 (\u00b1SEM), 0.77\u00b10.07, 0.80\u00b10.07, 0.70\u00b10.08, 0.67\u00b10.08 and 0.56\u00b10.09 for {circumflex over (\u0394)}SV(\u03b1), {circumflex over (\u0394)}SV(\u03b1), {circumflex over (\u0394)}SV(rCBV), {circumflex over (\u0394)}\u03bc(rCBV), {circumflex over (\u0394)}GTVand {circumflex over (\u0394)}SV(K), respectively, as shown in , indicating the high-a1 defined subvolume of the tumor had the best performance among the tested variables for predicting responsive tumor. The subvolumes defined by the high-a1 and low-a3 classes with the weighting factor=0.3, determined by empirical evaluation of the AUCs as shown in , resulted in the largest AUC, 0.88\u00b100.5. The subvolumes defined by the high-rCBV and high-Ktrans classes with the weighting factor=0.6 resulted in the AUC of 0.86\u00b10.06.","C. Apparent Diffusion Coefficients in Subvolume Analysis","While the techniques discussed above (i.e., the PK modeling techniques and the PCA techniques) measure the vascular properties of the tumor, other techniques that measure cellularity may be used in conjunction with the subvolume analysis of . Cellularity may be determined by obtaining imaging-derived cellularity feature data that measures the water mobility in the tissue of the tumor via a diffusion weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MRI). Similar to vascularity subvolume analysis inputs (i.e., the PK modeling technique and PCA technique), as discussed above, the cellularity features of subvolumes of tumors may be utilized to predict treatment outcome as well as shown in .","II. Diffusion Abnormality Index Analysis","The DAI technique herein is similar to the subvolume analysis technique, as discussed above, in that it uses the imaging-derived data to predict tumor response to therapy. However, this DAI technique develops a DAI to quantify the extent of abnormality of the tumor ADC histogram compared to normal tissue. A normal tissue ADC histogram, HNT (ADC), may be obtained in a normal brain volume of 3-4 cc with the peak normalized to 1. The tumor ADC histogram that usually spreads beyond HNT (ADC) is divided by HNT (ADC) into 3 categories: low (high cellularity), normal, and high (edema and necrosis) ADC. An abnormal diffusion probability function (DAProF) of the tumor may be then defined by 1-HNT (ADC) and band-pass filtered to reduce noise influence at the two tails of the histogram. Given that changes in low and high ADCs could have different roles in response assessment, a factor (0<\u03b1<1) may be used to weight the low ADC contribution to the DAProF related to high ADC's. As a result, an integral of the DAProF-weighted tumor ADC histogram may be calculated and used to define the DAI.","In an example, the DAI changes were evaluated to differentiate responsive, stable and progressive lesions in 24 patients who had brain metastases and were treated by either whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT, 28 mostly radiosensitive lesions) alone or combined with Bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer (39 radioresistant lesions). The performance of DAI for predicting the post-treatment radiographic response was also evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis and compared with changes in gross tumor volume (GTV) observed during the same time interval. In lesions treated by WBRT alone, the responsive tumors showed a greater decrease in DAI at week 2 after starting the radiation than stable and progressive lesions (p<0.00004). The performance of DAI worsened for the radioresistant lesions treated by WBRT combined with Bortezomib but still better than changes in the GTV, suggesting that the physiological change occurs prior to the volumetric change.","To determine cellularity, the DW-MRI is used and has been shown to be an imaging biomarker for assessing tumor aggressiveness and early response to therapy in various cancers. The DW-MRI acquisition is rapid and noninvasive, and uses neither exogenous contrast agent nor ionizing radiation. The apparent diffusion coefficient, quantified from DW-MRI, measures water mobility in tissue, and is sensitive to cellular density, extracellular space tortuosity, and intactness of cellular membranes. However, quantification of an ADC change in the tumor is still a challenge and affects sensitivity and specificity of diffusion indices for early prediction of tumor response to therapy, mainly because the ADCs in a tumor manifest a heterogeneous distribution pattern, due to spatial variation in cellular density, cell structure and water content. In a high cellular region, mobility of water molecules is restricted, and thus the ADC is low; while in a region with necrosis or edema, water molecules move more freely and hence the ADC is high. Animal studies have shown that the ADC in a tumor is inversely correlated with the tumor cellularity. When a tumor responds to treatment, the ADC in the high cellular region could increase due to cell shrinkage followed by phagocytosis or necrosis. Also, the ADC in the edema region could decrease due to drainage of water. Thus, the direction of the change depends on the measurement location of the ADC and the original value of the ADC. Therefore, the heterogeneity in the tumor ADCs and the complex changes that occur after treatment suggest that a change in the mean ADC of a tumor may be a poor indicator for therapy response.","Thus far, several methodologies have been proposed to quantify the ADC changes in tumors, beyond a change in the mean ADC of a tumor, for response assessment. The functional diffusion map (fDM), probably the most common approach, measures the voxel-to-voxel interval changes in a pair of the co-registered ADC images acquired pre and post the start of therapy. The voxels with an ADC change above a threshold are considered as a measure of response. Despite the promising results of the fDM-based approach and its modifications, again, the issue of voxel-to-voxel misregistration, particularly in the region where a tumor volume shrinks or grows during the interval of measurements, is problematic. Also, since the decrease\/increase in regions of high cellularity or edema could have different interpretations, it is important to consider the initial ADC values to interpret subsequent changes correctly. Alternatively, analysis of the tumor ADC histogram has been proposed. A bi-normal distribution mixture model has shown that the mean value of the low-ADC distribution can predict therapy response in gliomas. Also, changes in mean, skewness and kurtosis of the ADC histogram or the minimum value of the ADC in tumors have been related to survival and the treatment outcome. However, these methods have not considered changes in the whole ADC histogram, including both regions with high cellularity and edema, in each of which a change could reflect a part of the process of a tumor response to therapy and therefore may lead to losing information from the analyses. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop a new methodology for quantifying the tumor ADCs to improve the performance of DW-MRI for therapy assessment.","Experiment 4","The techniques herein use the DAI to quantify the extent of diffusion abnormality of brain metastases for early prediction of tumor response to therapy. For instance, brain metastases, which are the most prevalent form of intracranial cancer, exceed the number of primary brain tumors by at least ten times and occur in approximately 25% of all cancer patients. In a DAI-based approach, an abnormal diffusion probability was assigned to each voxel of the tumor based upon its ADC value relating to the normal tissue ADC distribution. Then, a DAI of the tumor was obtained by summing all the abnormal probabilities within the lesion. It was tested whether an early change in the DAI could predict response of brain metastases in the patients who were treated by either whole brain radiation therapy alone or in combination with Bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer.","Histogram of ADCs in a Tumor: to analyze the ADC distribution in a tumor and a subsequent change during treatment, a histogram of ADCs in a lesion measured at each time point was generated with 150 evenly-spaced bins that cover the ADCs of all lesions of interest. The ADC histogram, H(ADC=x), of a lesion is calculated as:\n\n(ADC=)\u2261\u2212\u03b5\u2266ADC\u2003\u2003(21)\n\nwhere nis the number of voxels within |ADC\u2212x|<\u03b5, and\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0171","num":"0170"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00016","num":"00016"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u025b","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":"\u03c3","mn":"4"}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["NT","NT"],"figref":["FIG. 11A","FIG. 11A","FIG. 11B"]},"Diffusion Abnormality Probability Function:","next, a diffusion abnormality probability function (DAProF) was developed to characterize the whole tumor ADC histogram based upon the normal tissue ADC distribution of each patient. The HNT(ADC) divides the tumor ADC histogram into three segments with low, normal, and high ADCs (). The first and latter are related to high cellular density and edema, respectively. Therefore, for each patient, a DAProF can be defined as 1\u2212HNT(ADC), and filtered by Kaiser band-pass filter (BPF) centered at the peak of HNT(ADC) to reduce noise influence in the computation at two tails where the ADC approaches to positive or negative infinite (or zero) as:\n\nDAProF=BPF\u00b7(1(ADC))\u2003\u2003(22)\n","Eq.

The histology included melanoma (14), non-small cell lung cancer (6), renal cell carcinoma (1), breast cancer (2), and head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (1). All patients received WBRT with a total dose of 30 Gy (16 patients) or 37.5 Gy (8 patients). Thirteen patients, with radioresistant metastases, also received Bortezomib during WBRT as a radiation sensitizer.

MRI scans included pre and post Gd-DTPA volumetric T1-weighted images, 2D T2-weighted images, and diffusion-sensitive images. The diffusion weighted images were acquired using a spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence (TR\/TE=2636\/46 msec) with b0=0, and diffusion weighting along three orthogonal directions and b1=1,000 sec\/mm2 to calculate the ADC images.","Using an in-house software package, all ADC images were co-registered to pre-RT post-Gd T1-weighted images by rigid transformation and mutual information to have a voxel size of 0.94\u00d70.94\u00d73 (mm3). After each lesion of interest was contoured on the post-Gd T1 weighed images obtained pre-RT, 2 W and 1 M post-RT by a physician, the tumor volumes were transferred onto the ADC maps obtained at the same time point. For each patient, a volume of 3-4 cc of normal white matter or cerebellum tissue, depending upon the location of the tumor of interest, was contoured on the pre-RT post-Gd T1-weighed images and transferred onto the pre-RT ADC map to obtain a distribution of normal ADCs.","DAI for Prediction of Response:","given that previous studies indicate that brain metastases exhibit little pseudo-response and pseudo-progression one month after RT, a percentage change in the gross tumor volume (GTV) from Pre-RT to 1 month post RT, {circumflex over (\u0394)}GTV, was used as a measure of tumor response to therapy. Data was used to verify that there was little pseudo-response or pseudo-progression in brain metastases treated by either WBRT alone or WBRT with Bortezomib. From Pre-RT to 1 M Post-RT, of the 27 lesions treated with radiation therapy alone, 14 had a decrease in the GTV of at least 25%, defined as responsive, 7 had an increase of at least 25%, defined as progressive, and the remaining 6 were defined as stable. For the 39 lesions treated by radiation therapy in combination with Bortezomib, 10 lesions were responsive, 13 lesions were progressive and 17 lesions were stable.","Predictive Model:","\u03b1(<1) in {circumflex over (\u0394)}DAiwas optimized in each treatment group by maximizing the group difference between the responsive and progressive lesions using Mann-Whitney U Test. Using the optimal value of \u03b1, it was further tested if {circumflex over (\u0394)}DAicould differentiate responsive from stable tumors, and stable from progressive tumors in both treatment groups. A p-value<0.05 was considered as significant. Next, sensitivity and specificity of {circumflex over (\u0394)}DAifor predicting non-responsive tumors was tested, including both progressive and stable tumors by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis (software package ROCKIT). Also, the performance of {circumflex over (\u0394)}DAI for predicting post-treatment response was compared with the ADC metrics previously published by others, such as a mean of the low ADC distribution from the bi-normal ADC distribution mixture model, and skewness and kurtosis of tumor ADC histograms, and conventional metrics, such as a percentage change in the GTV, pre-treatment minimum ADC, a minimum ADC change and a change in the mean of tumor ADCs from pre-RT to 2 W. The significant difference of the area under ROC curves (AUC) between the metrics were compared by t-test, for which the standard errors and the difference between the two AUCs were calculated by the method proposed by DeLong et al. The leave-one-out technique was used to measure the prediction risk of {circumflex over (\u0394)}DAI. Considering that melanoma metastasis is more radiation therapy resistant than the metastases from NSC Lung and breast cancers, the two patients with melanoma metastases from the analysis of the first treatment group were excluded to verify whether including melanoma metastases in this group alters the results.","Association of DAI with Response:","the best separation of the group difference between the responsive and progressive tumors resulted in \u03b1 values of 0.7 and 0.2 for lesions treated with radiation therapy alone and in combination with Bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer, respectively, suggesting that decreases in abnormality associated with high-ADCs (edema\/necrosis) may have different roles in response assessment, depending on the treatment regimen and tumor type.","For lesions treated with radiation therapy alone, as anticipated, the DAI showed a significantly greater decrease from Pre-RT to 2 W in the responsive tumors than the progressive ones (p<0.0003), but also the stable lesions (p<0.0035) or the non-responsive tumors (including both progressive and stable ones) (p<0.00004) revealed a decrease as well, as shown in Table 7. For the volumetric change observed during the same period, the percentage decrease in the GTV in the responsive group differed significantly from the stable group (p<0.03), the progressive group (p<0.0004), and the group of combining the progressive and stable tumors (p<0.0003). For the metrics that are often found in literature, their performances for differentiation of responsive, stable and progressive lesions are summarized in Table 7. As seen, skewness was able to differentiate between the responsive and progressive lesions, but worse than the percentage changes in the GTV and DAI for the radiation therapy-alone group. The mean of the low ADC distribution determined from the bi-normal Gaussian mixture model could not differentiate the responsive tumors from progressive or stable ones.","For the radiation resistant lesions treated with radiation therapy combined with Bortezomib, the DAI change from Pre-RT to 2 W was able to differentiate between the responsive and progressive lesions (p<0.01), but not between the responsive and stable lesions (see Table 8).

The DAI weights the abnormal ADC contributions from high cellularity and edema differently for predication of therapy response. The performance of DAI in patients who had brain metastases were evaluated and were treated by either WBRT alone (mostly radiation sensitive lesions) or in combination with Bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer (radiation resistant lesions). Compared to other ADC metric published previously and conventional metrics, the DAI performed better in predicting volumetric response of brain metastases to radiation therapy. Also, the results indicate that the diffusion-related physiological change in the tumor occurs earlier than the morphological change in response to radiation therapy. The DAI may be applied to other tumor types and treatment regimens after recalibration, e.g., glioblastoma and head and neck cancers, and anti-angiogenesis therapy. The DAI may be used as a robust imaging biomarker for early assessment of tumor response and outcome.","In the development of the DAI, the weighting factor, \u03b1, was found to be different for different treatments and\/or tumor types. For instance, when brain metastases were treated with WBRT alone, the changes in abnormality associating with high-ADCs contributed substantially to response assessment. In this case, both a decrease in cellularity and a decrease in edema could indicate treatment response. However, in the treatment of melanoma metastases to the brain, it was realized that a decrease in abnormality associated with high-ADCs is less important for response assessment. Also, the performance of all tested ADC metrics, including the DAI, was found to be worse for patients with melanoma metastases than for the metastases that were not from melanoma. This could be due to the nature of melanoma, high vascularity, edema and hemorrhage, or, the effect of Bortezomib on the lesion. Because Bortezomib could alter vascular properties of the tumor, a change in vascular characteristics of the tumor may be an important part of tumor response to therapy, and hence a perfusion change could be added into the DAI to improve the response assessment. The findings also suggest that the DAI could be used to assess a specific treatment effect on a specific tumor. For an anti-angiogenesis treatment to brain tumor, e.g., glioblastoma, a high ADC abnormality reduction indicates the treatment effect on the abnormal leaky vasculature but a low ADC abnormality decrease suggest the effect on the tumor.","The DAI may have several advantages in comparison with functional diffusion map, the most common approach in study of the ADC map. The DAI need not rely on voxel-to-voxel image registration accuracy, which the fDM-based analysis solely depends upon. Hence, anatomical alteration of a tumor after starting therapy, e.g., a change in edema, or surgical cavity, and\/or tumor growth or shrinkage, does not have an adverse effect on the DAI. In addition, the tumor volume is incorporated into the DAI, and thus a change in DAI represents both physiological and morphological changes in a tumor, which may increase the sensitivity of the DAI for tumor response to therapy. Furthermore, the fDM-based analysis only considers an absolute change in the ADC, regardless of the origin of the ADC, whereas an increase or a decrease in the low or high ADC region has a very different underlying implication. Further, an ADC increase in the region with abnormal low diffusion and a decrease in the region with abnormal high diffusion both are positive indications for a tumor response to therapy. Also, it is important to point out that although a change in the DAI of a tumor does not depend upon voxel-level accuracy of registration of images acquired pre and after the start of therapy, spatial information of diffusion abnormality of a tumor is available at any given measurement, as shown in , which could be used for visualization or provide guidance for intensified treatment.","The DAI may offer several advantages in comparison with other histogram-based approaches. In some of these techniques, only the low-ADC portion of the tumor histogram is used for therapy assessment; yet, a reduction in the abnormal high ADC in the edema region may be also an important indicator for response prediction. Thus, combining the changes in both abnormal low and high ADC regions has the potential to produce a better predictor for assessing response to various treatments. The indices based upon the skewness and kurtosis of the tumor ADC histogram neglect diffusion physiology in a tumor and may not be able to capture the complex change patterns in a heterogeneous tumor for response assessment.","The DAI may be used as a biomarker for assessment of brain metastasis response to WBRT. Currently, WBRT and stereotactic radio-surgery (SRS) are two routine treatments for brain metastases and prolonging patient survival. However, a recent study has shown that WBRT produces a decrease in neurocognitive status compared to SRS. Therefore, more and more patients are receiving focal treatment for brain metastases. As WBRT is being done less, more patients are developing new lesions after treatment of the initial lesions, and thus are being treated to new lesions over time. Also, the DAI could be extended to other tumor types, e.g., glioblastoma, for early assessment of tumor response to therapy.","The techniques disclosed herein may combine the different properties of the subvolumes of a tumor, such as the vascularity of subvolumes of the tumor, the cellularity of subvolumes of the tumor, etc. to calculate a more precise prediction in treatment outcome. For example, the method may utilize vascular properties, such as blood flow, blood volume, etc. in predicting one treatment outcome and also may examine the cellularity properties (i.e., the water mobility in tissue) to determine an abnormal diffusion coefficient in predicting treatment outcome. The prediction results from the both properties may be combined together to provide a more refined, accurate overall prediction for treatment outcome.","In the example embodiment illustrated in , a computer system for performing subvolume analysis of a target tissue is provides.

The computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media such as a hard disk drive, a magnetic disk drive that reads from or writes to a magnetic disk, and an optical disk drive that reads from or writes to an optical disk.","A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not illustrated) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to a system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device may also be connected to the processor  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","Generally, the techniques herein may be coded any computing language for execution on computer . Image data may be obtained from the remote computers -, -, . . . -and stored loaded on to any of the computer storage devices of computer . Once the image data, including image segments, is obtained, a user may input or select the condition parameters through an input mechanism as described. Although, in other examples, the condition parameters may be pre-selected or automatically determined, for example, based on a particular type of analysis that is to be performed. The output of the executable program may be displayed on a display (e.g., a monitor ), sent to a printer , stored for later use by the computer , or offloaded to another system, such as one of the remote computers . The output may be in the form of a graph or table indicating the explanation audit. Operations of the system may be recorded in an log database for future reference as shown. This log database may be accessed at subsequent times when a post-RT image is to be obtained, for example. In any event, a subvolume processing engine implementing the processes of  is implemented on the computer , in the illustrated example.","More generally, the various blocks, operations, and techniques described above may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination of hardware, firmware, and\/or software. When implemented in hardware, some or all of the blocks, operations, techniques, etc. may be implemented in, for example, a custom integrated circuit (IC), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable logic array (FPGA), a programmable logic array (PLA), etc.","When implemented in software, the software may be stored in any computer readable memory such as on a magnetic disk, an optical disk, or other storage medium, in a RAM or ROM or flash memory of a computer, processor, hard disk drive, optical disk drive, tape drive, etc. Likewise, the software may be delivered to a user or a system via any known or desired delivery method including, for example, on a computer readable disk or other transportable computer storage mechanism or via communication media. Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, radio frequency, infrared and other wireless media. Thus, the software may be delivered to a user or a system via a communication channel such as a telephone line, a DSL line, a cable television line, a wireless communication channel, the Internet, etc. (which are viewed as being the same as or interchangeable with providing such software via a transportable storage medium).","Moreover, while the present invention has been described with reference to specific examples, which are intended to be illustrative only and not to be limiting of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that changes, additions and\/or deletions may be made to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","Thus, although certain apparatus constructed in accordance with the teachings of the invention have been described herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is not limited thereto.
