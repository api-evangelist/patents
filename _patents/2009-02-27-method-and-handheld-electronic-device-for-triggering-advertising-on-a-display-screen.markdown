{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to mechanisms for triggering the display of content on the display screen of a handheld electronic device, and more particularly to a method and handheld electronic device for triggering advertising on a display screen.","Content displayed on the display screen of a handheld electronic device may require or benefit from the attention of the user. However, existing solutions do not provide adequate mechanisms for ensuring or increasing the likelihood that the user's attention will be focussed on the display screen of the handheld electronic device at any time during the display of content. Thus, there remains a need for improved mechanisms for triggering the display of content on the display screen of a handheld electronic device.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","The embodiments described herein generally relate to portable electronic devices. Examples of portable electronic devices include mobile (wireless) communication devices such as pagers, cellular phones, Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation devices and other satellite navigation devices, smartphones, wireless organizers, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and wireless-enabled notebook computers. At least some of these portable electronic devices may be handheld electronic devices. The portable electronic device may be a portable electronic device without wireless communication capabilities such as a PDA, handheld electronic game device, digital photograph album or picture frame, digital camera, and digital video recorder such as a camcorder. The portable electronic devices may have a touchscreen display or conventional non-touchscreen display. The portable electronic devices could have a touchscreen display as well as a mechanical keyboard. These examples are intended to be non-limiting.","The present disclosure provides a method and handheld electronic device which detects the occurrence of one or more trigger conditions (also referred to as trigger events) which are suitable for displaying an advertisement, and then displays an advertisement on the display of the handheld electronic device. The trigger conditions may be changes in the screen orientation of the handheld electronic device, changes in the orientation of the handheld electronic device itself, or a change in the mode of the handheld electronic device (e.g., when starting a new application or switching between applications on the handheld electronic device). To further increase the likelihood that the user will view the advertisement, a termination condition such as a delay or predetermined input may be required in order to end the display of the advertisement and to resume normal operation of the handheld electronic device. Prior to the occurrence of the termination condition, depending on the embodiment, the handheld electronic device may be placed in a locked mode in which user input is limited.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of triggering the display of content on a display screen of a handheld electronic device, the method comprising: monitoring for the occurrence of trigger conditions comprising one or more of: inputs to change an operational mode of the handheld electronic device, changes in orientation of the handheld electronic device, or changes in a screen orientation of a graphical user interface (GUI) displayed on the display screen; and reproducing content on the handheld electronic device in response to detection of one of the trigger conditions.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a handheld electronic device, comprising: a controller for controlling the operation of the device; one or more input devices connected to the controller; a display screen connected to the controller; and the controller being configured to: monitor for the occurrence of trigger conditions comprising one or more of: inputs to change an operational mode of the handheld electronic device, changes in orientation of the handheld electronic device, or changes in a screen orientation of a graphical user interface (GUI) displayed on the display screen; and reproduce content on the handheld electronic device in response to detection of one of the trigger conditions.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium having stored thereon computer program instructions for implementing a method on a handheld electronic device for triggering the display of content on a display screen, the computer executable instructions comprising instructions for performing the method(s) set forth above.","Communication System Configuration","In order to facilitate an understanding of one possible environment in which example embodiments described herein can operate, reference is first made to  which shows in block diagram form a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system  comprises a number of mobile communication devices  which may be connected to the remainder of system  in any of several different ways. Accordingly, several instances of mobile communication devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices  are connected to a wireless network  which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments, the mobile communication devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments, the wireless network  may comprise multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further comprise a wireless network gateway  which connects the mobile communication devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines, the public Internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system  may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments, the network  may be realised using the Internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the mobile communication devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the mobile communication devices .","The WLAN  comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an Internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) interface  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be required). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email communications, to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the mobile communication devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a messaging server  (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email server), a content server  for providing content such as Internet content or content from an organization's internal servers and application servers  for implementing server-based applications such as instant messaging (IM) applications to mobile communication devices , and to an advertising server  which maintains and optionally selects advertisements for display on the mobile communication devices . An advertising content database  is maintained by or accessible to the advertising server  of the wireless network . The advertising server  could be omitted in other embodiments, for example if the content is stored on the device  and the content selection decision is made by the device , or if the content is provided by other components of the wireless network  (e.g., respective servers maintaining and\/or accessing the respective content) such as the content server .","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g., email messages, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the mobile communication devices  are encrypted. In some embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile communication device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server , content server  or application servers . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the messaging server , content server  or application servers  to the wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile communication device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the mobile communication device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the messaging server , content server  and application server .","The network  may comprise a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public Internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination.","A mobile communication device  may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system  using a computer , such as desktop or notebook computer, via the network . A link  may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile communication device  and computer  connected to the wireless connector system . The link  may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile communication device  and computer . The short-range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network (PAN) interface. A personal area network is a wireless point-to-point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short-range wireless communication interface may comprise one or a combination of an infrared (IR) connection such as an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) connection, a short-range radio frequency (RF) connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth\u2122 special interest group, or IEEE 802.15.3a, also referred to as UltraWideband (UWB), or other PAN connection.","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Mobile Communication Device","Reference is now made to  which illustrates a mobile communication device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile communication device  is a two-way communication device having at least data and possibly also voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile communication device , in various embodiments the device may be a data communication device, a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile communication device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the mobile communication device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems including a communication subsystem  which performs communication functions and exchanges radio frequency signals with the wireless network , a display (screen)  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen which defines a viewing area, and a touch-sensitive input surface or overlay  connected to an electronic controller  that together make up a touchscreen display . The touch-sensitive input surface\/overlay  may comprise a protective lens or transparent protective material. The touch-sensitive overlay  and the electronic controller  provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay  via the electronic controller .","The processor  also interacts with other device subsystems including flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port (for example, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port), speaker , microphone , control keys , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile communication device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which mobile communication device  is intended to operate.","The mobile communication device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . The software modules  comprise operating system software , software applications , a user interface module , dynamic event module , and a virtual keyboard module . The user interface module  renders and displays the GUI of the device  in accordance with instructions of the operating system  and applications  (as applicable). The virtual keyboard module  implements a virtual keyboard on the touchscreen display .","The dynamic event module  is a device application which renders\/reproduces content such as an advertisement on the touchscreen display . In at least some embodiments, the device application is an advertising player which renders advertisements comprising video, animation, (e.g. Flash), a digital image, text document, audio, or other multimedia format comprising visual and audio content on the touchscreen display . The dynamic event module , in at least some embodiments, also enables the mobile communication device  to communicate with advertising server .","The user interface module , dynamic event module , and virtual keyboard module  may, among other things, be implemented through a stand-alone software application, or combined together in one or more of the operating system  and applications . In some example embodiments, the functions performed by each of the user interface module , dynamic event module , and virtual keyboard module  may be realized as a plurality of independent elements, rather than single integrated elements, and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications . Furthermore, in some embodiments, at least some of the functions performed by any one of the user interface module , dynamic event module , and virtual keyboard module  may be implemented in firmware of the device .","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely an example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The software applications  may include a range of applications, including, for example, an address book application, a messaging application, a calendar application, and\/or a notepad application. In some embodiments, the software applications  includes one or more of a Web browser application (i.e., for a Web-enabled mobile communication device), an email message application, a push content viewing application, a voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, a map application, and a media player application. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display ) according to the application.","Referring now to , the mobile communication device  includes a rigid case  for housing the components of the device  that is configured to be held in a user's hand while the device  is in use. The touchscreen display  is mounted within a front face  of the case . The case  has opposed top and bottom ends designated by references ,  respectively, and left and right sides designated by references ,  respectively which extend transverse to the top and bottom ends , . In the shown embodiments of , the case  (and device ) is elongate having a length defined between the top and bottom ends ,  longer than a width defined between the left and right sides , . Other device dimensions are also possible.","Although the case  is shown as a single unit it could, among other possible configurations, include two or more case members hinged together (such as a flip-phone configuration or a clam shell-style lap top computer, for example), or could be a \u201cslider phone\u201d in which the keyboard is located in a first body which is slide-ably connected to a second body which houses the display screen, the device being configured so that the first body which houses the keyboard can slide out from the second body for use. In other embodiments, the mobile communication device  could have a mechanical keyboard in addition to the touchscreen display .","Referring again to , in some embodiments, the auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile communication device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a navigational tool such as a clickable\/depressible trackball or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device  such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback.","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  also includes a removable memory card or module  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile communication device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile communication device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile communication device  stores data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile communication device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile communication device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile communication device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The serial data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The serial data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile communication device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile communication device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile communication device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile communication device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the mobile communication device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The mobile communication device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface  such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile communication device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile communication device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile communication device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile communication device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem , such as other wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device .","The mobile communication device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email message application and output to the display . A user of the mobile communication device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the touch-sensitive overlay  in conjunction with the display device  and possibly the control buttons  and\/or the auxiliary I\/O subsystems . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile communication device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display device  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The touchscreen display  can be any suitable touchscreen display such as a capacitive touchscreen display. A capacitive touchscreen display  includes the display device  and the touch-sensitive overlay , in the form of a capacitive touch-sensitive overlay . It will be appreciated that the capacitive touch-sensitive overlay  includes a number of layers in a stack and is fixed to the display device  via a suitable optically clear adhesive. The layers can include, for example a substrate fixed to the display device  (e.g. LCD display) by a suitable adhesive, a ground shield layer, a barrier layer, a pair of capacitive touch sensor layers separated by a substrate or other barrier layer, and a cover layer fixed to the second capacitive touch sensor layer by a suitable adhesive. The capacitive touch sensor layers can be any suitable material such as patterned indium tin oxide (ITO).","Each of the touch sensor layers comprises an electrode layer each having a number of spaced apart transparent electrodes. The electrodes may be a patterned vapour-deposited ITO layer or ITO elements. The electrodes may be, for example, arranged in an array of spaced apart rows and columns. As shown in , the touch sensor layers\/electrode layers are each associated with a coordinate (e.g., x or y) in a coordinate system used to map locations on the touchscreen display , for example, in Cartesian coordinates (e.g., x and y-axis coordinates). The intersection of the rows and columns of the electrodes may represent pixel elements defined in terms of an (x, y) location value which can form the basis for the coordinate system. Each of the touch sensor layers provide a signal to the controller  which represent the respective x and y coordinates of the touchscreen display . That is, x locations are provided by a signal generated by one of the touch sensor layers and y locations are provided by a signal generated by the other of the touch sensor layers.","The electrodes in the touch sensor layers\/electrode layers respond to changes in the electric field caused by conductive objects in the proximity of the electrodes. When a conductive object is near or contacts the touch-sensitive overlay , the object draws away some of the charge of the electrodes and reduces its capacitance. The controller  receives signals from the touch sensor layers of the touch-sensitive overlay , detects touch inputs by determining changes in capacitance which exceed a predetermined threshold, and determines the centroid of a contact area defined by electrodes having a change in capacitance which exceeds the predetermined threshold, typically in x, y (Cartesian) coordinates.","The controller  sends the centroid of the contact area to the processor  of the device  as the location of the touch input detected by the touchscreen display . Depending on the touch-sensitive overlay  and\/or configuration of the touchscreen display , the change in capacitance which results from the presence of a conductive object near the touch-sensitive overlay  but not contacting the touch-sensitive overlay , may exceed the predetermined threshold in which case the corresponding electrode would be included in the contact area. The detection of the presence of a conductive object such as a user's finger or a conductive stylus is sometimes referred to as finger presence\/stylus presence.","It will be appreciated that other attributes of a touch input on the touchscreen display  can be determined. For example, the size and the shape (or profile) of the touch input on the touchscreen display  can be determined in addition to the location based on the signals received at the controller  from the touch sensor layers. For example, the touchscreen display  may be used to create a pixel image of the contact area created by a touch input. The pixel image is defined by the pixel elements represented by the intersection of electrodes in the touch sensor layers\/electrode layers. The pixel image may be used, for example, to determine a shape or profile of the contact area.","The centroid of the contact area is calculated by the controller  based on raw location and magnitude (e.g., capacitance) data obtained from the contact area. The centroid is defined in Cartesian coordinates by the value (X, Y). The centroid of the contact area is the weighted averaged of the pixels in the contact area and represents the central coordinate of the contact area. By way of example, the centroid may be found using the following equations:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["X","c"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["Z","i"]},{"mi":["x","i"]}],"mo":"*"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["Z","i"]}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Y","c"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["Z","i"]},{"mi":["y","i"]}],"mo":"*"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["Z","i"]}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}]}}},"br":{},"sub":["c ","c "]},"The controller  of the touchscreen display  is typically connected using both interpret and serial interface ports to the processor . In this way, an interrupt signal which indicates a touch input has been detected, the centroid of the contact area, as well as raw data regarding the location and magnitude of the activated electrodes in the contact area are passed to the processor . However, in other example embodiments only an interrupt signal which indicates a touch input has been detected and the centroid of the contact area are passed to the processor . In embodiments where the raw data is passed to the processor , the detection of a touch input and\/or the determination of the centroid of the contact area may be performed by the processor  of the device  rather than the controller  of the touchscreen display .","In other embodiments, the touchscreen display  may be a display device, such as an LCD screen, having the touch-sensitive input surface (overlay)  integrated therein. One example of such a touchscreen is described in commonly owned U.S. patent publication no. 2004\/0155991, published Aug. 12, 2004 (also identified as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/717,877, filed Nov. 20, 2003) which is incorporated herein by reference.","While a specific embodiment of the touchscreen display  has been described, any suitable type of touchscreen in the handheld electronic device of the present disclosure including, but not limited to, a capacitive touchscreen, a resistive touchscreen, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) touchscreen, an embedded photo cell touchscreen, an infrared (IR) touchscreen, a strain gauge-based touchscreen, an optical imaging touchscreen, a dispersive signal technology touchscreen, an acoustic pulse recognition touchscreen or a frustrated total internal reflection touchscreen. The type of touchscreen technology used in any given embodiment will depend on the handheld electronic device and its particular application and demands.","Referring again to , a Cartesian (two dimensional) coordinate system used to map locations of the touchscreen display  in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. The touchscreen display  defines a Cartesian coordinate system defined by x and y-axes in the input plane of the touchscreen display . Each touch input on the touchscreen display  returns a touch point defined in terms of an (x, y) value. The returned touch point is typically the centroid of the contact area.","In the shown embodiment, the touchscreen display  has a rectangular touch-sensitive overlay ; however, in other embodiments, the touch-sensitive overlay  could have a different shape such as a square shape. The rectangular touch-sensitive overlay  results in a screen which is divided into a rectangular array of pixels with positional values ranging from 0 to the maximum in each of the x and y-axes (x max. and y max. respectively). The x-axis extends in the same direction as the width of the device  and the touch-sensitive overlay . The y-axis extends in the same direction as the length of the device  and the touch-sensitive overlay . In the shown embodiment, the touchscreen  has a square shaped touch-sensitive input surface  and an 8-bit resolution which results in a screen which is divided into a 256\u00d7256 pixel square with positional values ranging from 0 to 255 in each of the x and y-axes. However, it will be appreciated that in other embodiments a resolution greater than or less than 8-bits could be used.","The coordinate system has an origin (0, 0) which is located at the top left-hand side of the touchscreen display . For purposes of convenience, the origin (0, 0) of the Cartesian coordinate system is located at this position in all of the embodiments described in the present disclosure. However, it will be appreciated that in other embodiments the origin (0, 0) could be located elsewhere such as at the bottom left-hand side of the touchscreen display , the top right-hand side of the touchscreen display , or the bottom right-hand side of the touchscreen display . The location of the origin (0, 0) could be configurable in other embodiments.","During operation, a graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling the operation of the device  is displaying on the touchscreen display . The GUI is rendered prior to display by the operating system  or an application  which causes the processor  to display content on the touchscreen display . The GUI of the device  has a screen orientation in which the text and user interface elements of the GUI are oriented for normal viewing. It will be appreciated that the screen orientation for normal viewing is independent of the language supported, that is the screen orientation for normal viewing is the same regardless of whether a row-oriented language or column-oriented language (such as Asian languages) is displayed within the GUI. Direction references in relation to the GUI, such as top, bottom, left, and right, are relative to the current screen orientation of the GUI rather than the device  or its case .","In embodiments in which the display screen is rectangular in shape, such as that shown in , the screen orientation is either portrait (vertical) or landscape (horizontal). A portrait screen orientation is a screen orientation in which the text and other user interface elements extend in a direction transverse (typically perpendicular) to the length (y-axis) of the display screen. A landscape screen orientation is a screen orientation in which the text and other user interface elements extend in a direction transverse (typically perpendicular) to the width (x-axis) of the display screen. In some embodiments, the GUI of the device  may change its screen orientation between a portrait screen orientation and landscape screen orientation in accordance with changes in device orientation, depending on the settings and\/or operational mode of the device . In other embodiments, the screen orientation of the device  may be fixed. In yet other embodiments in which the display screen is relatively square in shape, the screen orientation changes based on device orientation so that is oriented for normal viewing for the user, however, the aspect ratio does not change since the dimensions of the screen are substantially symmetrical.","The mobile communication device  also comprises a device orientation subsystem  (shown in ) comprising at least one sensor which is connected to the processor  and which is controlled by one or a combination of a monitoring circuit and operating software. The sensor detects the orientation of the device  or information from which the orientation of the device  can be determined, such as acceleration. In some embodiments, the sensor is a three-axis accelerometer. In other embodiments, an orientation sensor other than an accelerometer could be used such as a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a tilt sensor, an electronic compass or other suitable sensor, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the device orientation subsystem  may comprise two or more sensors such as an accelerometer and an electronic compass.","As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, an accelerometer is a sensor which converts acceleration from motion (e.g. movement of the device  or a portion thereof due to the strike force) and gravity which are detected by a sensing element into an electrical signal (producing a corresponding change in output) and is available in one, two or three axis configurations. Accelerometers may produce digital or analog output signals depending on the type of accelerometer. Generally, two types of outputs are available depending on whether an analog or digital accelerometer used: (1) an analog output requiring buffering and analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion; and (2) a digital output which is typically available in an industry standard interface such as an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) or I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface. The output of an accelerometer is typically measured in terms of the gravitational acceleration constant at the Earth's surface, denoted g, which is approximately 9.81 m\/s(32.2 ft\/s) as the standard average. The accelerometer may be of almost any type including, but not limited to, a capacitive, piezoelectric, piezoresistive, or gas-based accelerometer. The range of accelerometers vary up to the thousands of g's, however for portable electronic devices \u201clow-g\u201d accelerometers may be used. Example low-g accelerometers which may be used are MEMS digital accelerometers from Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (Freescale) and STMicroelectronics N.V. of Geneva, Switzerland.","Referring briefly to , a device orientation subsystem  in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. The circuit  comprises a digital 3-axis accelerometer  connected to the interrupt and serial interface of a controller (MCU) . The controller  could be the processor  of the device . The operation of the controller  is controlled by software, which may be stored in internal memory of the controller . The operational settings of the accelerometer  are controlled by the controller  using control signals sent from the controller  to the accelerometer  via the serial interface. The controller  may determine the device orientation in accordance with the acceleration measured by the accelerometer , or raw acceleration data measured by the accelerometer  may be sent to the processor  of the device  via its serial interface where device orientation is determined by the operating system , or other software module . In other embodiments, a different digital accelerometer configuration could be used, or a suitable analog accelerometer and control circuit could be used.","Referring now to , the assignment of pitch and roll vectors of a three-axis accelerometer in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be briefly described. Each measurement axis is aligned with an axis of the mobile communication device . The x-axis and y-axis are typically aligned with the input plane of the touchscreen display . The z-axis is perpendicular to the horizontal plane and detects when the mobile communication device  is moved vertically.","As shown in , pitch (\u03c6) is the angle of the x-axis relative to the ground. \u03b8 is the angle of the z-axis relative to gravity. As shown in , roll (\u03c1) is the angle of the y-axis relative to the ground. It will be appreciated that rotation may occur about any combination of sensing axes. The concepts and methodology described herein can be applied to any axis orientation and any combination of pitch (\u03c6) angle, roll (\u03c1) angle and \u03b8 (the angle of the z-axis relative to gravity). Pitch (\u03c6), roll (\u03c1) and the angle of the z-axis relative to gravity (\u03b8) of a three-axis accelerometer may be calculated using equations (3) (4) and (5):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c6","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"arctan","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["x","sensor"]},"msqrt":{"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["y","sensor"],"mn":"2"},{"mi":["z","sensor"],"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c1","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"arctan","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["y","sensor"]},"msqrt":{"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":"sensor","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},"mn":"2"},{"mi":["z","sensor"],"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b8","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"arctan","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"msqrt":{"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["x","sensor"],"mn":"2"},{"mi":["y","sensor"],"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"}},"msub":{"mi":["z","sensor"]}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}]}}},"br":[{},{}],"sub":["sensor","sensor ","sensor "]},"Reference is now made to  which illustrates example operations  for triggering the display of content such as advertising on the touchscreen display  of the mobile communication device  in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure. The operations  are carried out by the processor  of the mobile communication device  under the instruction of the dynamic event module . The operations  are used in combination with a graphical user interface (GUI) displayed on the touchscreen display . The GUI comprises a plurality of selectable user interface elements each having an area of the touch-sensitive input surface  associated therewith and each generating a respective input signal in response to selection thereof, such as a virtual keyboard  (see ) or icon selection menu  (see ), for example.","In the first step , the processor  monitors for and detects the occurrence of one or more trigger conditions for the display of content such as advertising. In some embodiments, the trigger conditions may comprise (i) a change in the screen orientation of the GUI displayed on the touchscreen display , (ii) a change in orientation of the device  itself, (iii) a change in a mode of the device  (e.g., when starting a new application or function, or switching between applications and functions on the handheld electronic device), or (iv) any combination thereof.","The trigger condition comprising a change in the screen orientation of the GUI displayed on the touchscreen display  may be a change from a portrait screen orientation in a first mode of the device  to a landscape screen orientation in the first mode or other mode of the device . Conversely, the trigger condition may be a change from a landscape screen orientation in a first mode of the device  to a portrait screen orientation in the first mode or other mode of the device . User interface screen orientations other than a portrait screen orientation and landscape screen orientation are also possible. Thus, the trigger condition could be a change from a particular one of a multiple of user interface screen orientations to a different one of the multiple user interface screen orientations.","The trigger conditions (i) and (ii) are similar in that the trigger conditions both relate to orientation aspects of the mobile communication device ; however trigger condition (i) relates to a change in the orientation of the screen orientation of the GUI whereas trigger condition (ii) relates to a change in the orientation of the mobile communication device  itself. Thus, the trigger conditions (i) and (ii) are not coterminous in at least some embodiments.","It will be appreciated that, depending on the device capabilities, settings and\/or operational mode of the device , it may or may not change the user interface screen orientation of the GUI in response to changes in the orientation of the device . For example, some operational modes of the device  have only one user interface screen orientation (e.g., either a portrait or landscape user interface screen orientation) or possibly no user interface screen. The use of these two different but similar triggers may be advantageous to accommodate circumstances in which the screen orientation does not change, and to accommodate circumstances in which the screen orientation does change but does so based on factors other than a change in the orientation of the device . Moreover, it is possible that the device orientation (or a change in the device orientation) may be advantageous for triggering the display of content which requires a user's attention but may not be advantageous for triggering a change in the screen orientation. An example of such a change in device orientation is changing the device from a face up to a face down orientation, for example, if the user is using the device  while lying on his or her back.","As noted above, changes in screen orientation may or may not be triggered by device orientation. In some embodiments, screen orientation changes may be based on triggers other than changes in the orientation of the mobile communication device  instead of, or in addition to, automatic changes based on device orientation and\/or changes in device orientation. For example, screen orientation could be changed by an application running on the device  (e.g., application triggered) or could be changed manually (e.g., manually triggered). A manual change in screen orientation may be triggered via a corresponding change in a respective option from an options menu in the GUI of the device .","It will be appreciated that other trigger conditions in addition to, or instead of, those described above could also be used. Other suitable trigger conditions include other GUI transition or mode changes of the mobile communication device . GUI transitions or mode changes may be effective trigger conditions since the user is typically attentive at this point either because the user has just moved the device or requested an alternate mode, function or application be used on the mobile communication device . Any device event associated with a high degree of user attention could be used as a trigger condition.","The start or launch of an application or function on the device , or switching between applications and functions on the device  is typically associated with a GUI transition, the transition ending with a user interface screen of the application or function which is started or switched to being displayed on the touchscreen display .","One example of a GUI transition or mode change which may be a trigger condition is entry into, or exiting from, a text entry mode, such a mode change\/GUI transition being associated with the display of a text entry mode user interface such as a message composition window  () and possibly a virtual keyboard  if the device  is a touchscreen device and the virtual keyboard  is not already displayed on the touchscreen display . The display of the message composition window  may correspond closely in time to a change in the screen orientation in many instances, as users often read messages in the portrait screen orientation, and flip the device  (or otherwise change the screen orientation) to the landscape screen orientation when typing a reply message. The user is typically very attentive at this point (e.g., anxious to start typing) and so displaying content such as an advertisement at this time may increase the likelihood that the user's attention will be focussed on the display screen during the display of content (e.g., advertisement). Another example of a GUI transition or mode change which may be a trigger condition is entry into, or exiting from, an icon selection menu  ().","Another example of a GUI transition or mode change which may be a trigger condition is the launch of, or closing of, a media player application or the start of media (e.g. audio or video) playback. As when composing a message, the start of media playback may correspond closely in time to a change in the screen orientation in many instances, as users often select media for playback in the portrait screen orientation (e.g., file or track from a playlist), and flip the device  (or otherwise change the screen orientation) to the landscape screen orientation during playback. Again, the user is typically very attentive at this point (e.g., anxious to review the media) and so displaying content such as an advertisement at this time may increase the likelihood that the user's attention will be focussed on the display screen during the display of content (e.g., advertisement).","The trigger condition (ii) comprising of a change in orientation of the mobile communication device  may comprise monitoring for and detecting changes in the orientation of the mobile communication device . The changes in the orientation may be determined by the processor  of the device  based on positional\/orientation information from the position detection system , rather than by the position detection system  itself. Example methods of determining the orientation (position) of the device  using the position detection system  are described below.","Other examples of possible trigger conditions to trigger the display of advertisements on the touchscreen display  include, but are not limited to: powering the device  on or off; entering or exiting a locked mode of the device ; enabling or disabling a screensaver mode of the device ; opening or \u201csliding\u201d out\/down the keyboard of a slider phone; opening of a flip phone; receipt of an incoming message by the device  (email message, IM message, short message service (SMS) message, multimedia messaging service (MMS) message, voicemail message); display of a notification such as a reminder notification on the device ; and receipt of an incoming phone call by the device .","In some embodiments in which the trigger condition is a change in device orientation, device orientation (change) event notifications are sent to the operating system  by either the device orientation subsystem  or processor , depending on how device orientation is determined. Corresponding notifications are then sent from the operating system  to the dynamic event module  where such notifications are processed in determining whether a trigger condition for the display of content has been detected. Upon receiving a device orientation event notification, the dynamic event module  determines that a trigger condition has been detected. In other embodiments, the dynamic event module  may be part of the operating system  or the active application .","In some embodiments in which the trigger condition is a change in screen orientation, device orientation (change) event notifications are sent to the operating system  by either the device orientation subsystem  or processor , depending on how device orientation is determined. Corresponding notifications are then sent from the operating system  to the user interface module  so that it can determine whether a change in the screen orientation of the GUI is required. Screen orientation (change) event notifications are sent by the user interface module  to the dynamic event module  when a change in the screen orientation of the GUI is required. These notifications are processed by the dynamic event module  in determining whether a trigger condition for the display of content has been detected. Upon receiving a screen orientation event notification, the dynamic event module  determines that a trigger condition has been detected. In other embodiments, the dynamic event module  may be part of the user interface module  (which could, in turn, be part of the operating system ) or the active application .","In some embodiments in which the trigger condition is a change in the operational mode of the device , mode (change) event notifications are sent from the operating system  to the dynamic event module  where such notifications are processed in determining whether a trigger condition for the display of content has been detected. Upon receiving a mode event notification, the dynamic event module  determines that a trigger condition has been detected. In other embodiments, the dynamic event module  may be part of the operating system  or the active application .","Next, in step  the content (e.g. advertisement) to be displayed is selected in accordance with predetermined advertising parameters. The predetermined advertising parameters, in at least some embodiments, are based on user information and\/or device information, and the content is selected in accordance with whether the user information and\/or device information matches with one or more predetermined advertising parameters. The user information used in selecting content comprises information describing one or more attributes about the respective device user. The device information comprises information describing one or more attributes about respective mobile communication device . The advertisements in the advertising content database  may have an associated \u201cpriority list\u201d stored in the database  which provides a list of advertisements, for example, based on contractual agreement between the respective mobile network service providers and advertisers. Advertisements are selected from the priority list in order upon the detection of a trigger condition. Selection starts at the top of the priority list and proceeds until the bottom of the priority list is reached. Once the bottom of the priority list is reached, processing loops back and re-starts at the top of the priority list. The priority list may be used in combination with the predetermined advertising parameters and user information and\/or device information.","The user information may comprise personal information, demographic information relating to the user, location information concerning the geographic location of mobile communication device , or any combination of the above. The demographic information may comprise: user-defined preferences, learned preferences (for example, from past behaviour or purchases) and any other demographic information which can be attributed to the user. The demographic information is chosen to aid in the targeting of advertisements to users who will have a greater likelihood of being interested in the product, service or information being advertised. The device information may comprise the mobile network service provider associated with the device , device information about the technical capabilities of the device , the detected trigger event, or any combination of the above.","The user information and possibly device information, in compliance with privacy laws may require the consent of the device user before the advertisement or other content can be displayed on the device . User consent may be obtained, for example, at the time the user creates a mobile data service plan (contract) with their respective mobile data service provider or subsequently, for example, upon registering for new wireless services or subscriptions. If the user does not consent, the operations  will not be performed on the device . In some cases, layers of consent may be required in that the user may be required to consent to the display of advertisements and other content on the device , and may be required to consent separately to the use of user information and\/or device information in selecting the advertisement or other content that can be displayed on the device . Thus, a user could consent to the display of advertisements but not the use or tracking of user information and\/or device information for the purpose of selecting content in which case the advertisement selected would be less targeted (if based on only one of user information and device information) or untargeted (if neither user information or device information are used). A financial reward associated with advertising content, described below, may be lower if the user does not consent to the user information and\/or device information, or consents to less than full use of user information and\/or device information.","In some embodiments, the advertisement is selected from an advertising content database  maintained by or accessible to the advertising server  of the wireless network . In such cases, the mobile communication device  notifies the advertising server  when a trigger event has been detected and requests from the advertising server  the advertisement which is to be displayed or otherwise reproduced on the device . The advertising server , in response to the request, selects the advertisement from advertising content database  in accordance with predetermined advertising parameters associated with the advertisements in the advertising content database  and user information and\/or device information provided by one or both of the mobile network service provider (also referred to as a wireless carrier) and mobile communication device . The advertising server  then sends the selected advertisement content to the mobile communication device . When the selection of content is based at least in part on information associated with the mobile communication device  and\/or its respective user(s), the device  sends the relevant information stored on the device  to the advertising server  with the request for the advertisement.","If the advertising content database  is not maintained by the advertising server , the advertising server  may interface with other network elements to access the advertising content. For example, advertising content could be maintained by advertisers in a private database, in which case the advertising server  accesses the private databases, possibly in a secure fashion, to retrieve the advertising content.","The geographic location may be based on a GPS transceiver of the auxiliary I\/O subsystems  of the device , location information provided by location services and\/or presence information, triangulation from location information from base stations  in the wireless network  when connected via cellular to the WWAN , the location of network access points  when connected via Wi-Fi to the WLAN , or the location of the computer  when connected via the computer  using USB or Bluetooth.","Demographic information may come from shared sources such as social networking sites (such as Facebook\u2122, MySpace\u2122, LinkedIN\u2122, etc.) where information about an individual is collected to use for the specific purpose of targeting of advertisements. Other shared sources of demographic information about individuals may be used, including but not limited to, those used for targeted advertising by online advertisers, for example by online search engines or other Internet sites implementing targeted advertising when selecting advertisements for sponsored links, pop-up advertisements, banner advertisements, email-based advertisements or other types of online advertisements. The demographic information could be derived, at least in part, from presence information.","The advertising server  may maintain statistics about the advertisements in the advertising content database , such as the number of times each advertisement has been reviewed or otherwise reproduced, and possibly by which users and\/or devices  and possibly the duration of each advertisement viewed or otherwise reproduced on the device .","In some embodiments, the advertising server  may interface with a financial (reward) system (not shown) of the mobile network service provider which comprises a financial (reward) system database. The financial database may be part of the accounting database of the mobile network service provider, a shared accounting database, or a separate database. The advertising server  calculates a financial reward at predetermined periods, typically in accordance with the user's normal billing period for his or her mobile data service by his or her mobile network service provider.","The financial reward may be based on the number of advertisements viewed and a monetary amount associated with each advertisement viewed or otherwise reproduced, the duration of the advertisement and a monetary amount per time (e.g. cents or fractional cents per second or millisecond), the duration of a delay associated with the advertisement and a monetary amount per time (e.g. cents or fractional cents per second or millisecond), or combinations of the above. To calculate the reward in accordance, the advertising server  stores at least the number of advertisements displayed on the devices . As the rates per view, and the rates for duration and delay may differ between advertisement, it may be necessary to record the particular advertisement viewed, the number of times each was viewed, and possibly any duration and\/or delay associated therewith. At the relevant time, the reward will then be calculated in accordance with the stored number of advertisements displayed on the devices , and possibly a time parameter comprising the duration and\/or delay associated with each advertisement.","The advertising server  then instructs that a credit in the amount of the calculated monetary reward be posted to the financial database. The credit to the financial database will be reflected on the balance of the user's next wireless services bill (invoice), e.g. his or her monthly bill of the period in which the advertisements were viewed or otherwise reproduced, as a credit applied against the monthly changes incurred by the user in that period in accordance with the terms of the service contract with the mobile network service provider. The credit provides the user with a subsidy of his or her mobile data service in exchange for viewing advertisements. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the subsidy of the mobile data service is directly proportional to the amount of time the user has spent viewing or listening to advertisements, and possibly compensates the user for a loss of privacy if the user consents to the use of targeting advertising based on one or more of user information and device information.","The mobile network service provider may, in turn, be compensated by advertisers in accordance with the advertiser's advertisements which are viewed or otherwise reproduced, typically a premium to the financial reward given to device users. In other embodiments, rather that a credit against monthly wireless services, the user may be directly compensated by advertisers rather than his or her mobile network service provider, for example in the form of predetermined monetary amounts or predetermined value coupons. In some embodiments, rather than monetary rewards, the user may be awarded points for redemption at the user's request. The points may be part of a \u201cpoints network\u201d such as Air Miles\u2122, or the points could be applied against wireless services provided by mobile network service provider or against products or services provided by the advertisers.","In other embodiments, the advertising server  communicates the number of advertisements viewed or otherwise reproduced on the device , possibly the duration of each advertisement viewed or otherwise reproduced on the device , and possibly the delay associated with each advertisement viewed or otherwise reproduced on the device , to a server maintained by the mobile network service provider. The mobile network service provider then calculates the financial reward, for example, using the normal accounting application of the mobile network service provider.","The advertising server , in some embodiments, may provide an advertiser portal (not shown) which allows advertisers to upload advertising content to the advertising content database . An advertiser may view statistics and information regarding the advertisement via the advertiser portal and may optionally modify advertising campaign parameters such as the predetermined advertising parameters used in selecting content for display on devices .","In other embodiments, the content (e.g. one or more advertisements) could be stored locally on the device , and the selection decision is made by the device  based on locally stored advertising parameter data. The advertisement could be downloaded wirelessly in advance and stored on the device . For example, advertising content may be pushed transparently to the device  in a manner which is invisible to the device user. The advertising content stored locally on the device  may be small compared with that maintained by or accessible to the advertising server  of the wireless network . For example, a single advertisement or a small number of advertisements may be stored on the device  for selecting upon the detection of a trigger condition. Alternatively, the advertising content may be downloaded in advance when connected to the user's computer , for example, via USB or Bluetooth. Handheld electronic devices without wireless communications capabilities can utilise USB or Bluetooth connectivity in order to apply the teachings of the present disclosure. In addition, electronic devices with and without wireless communications capabilities could have advertising content pre-loaded (installed) on the device , for example, upon delivery of the device  to its user.","Next, in step  the processor  displays the selected advertisement on the touchscreen display  in response to the detection of a trigger condition. The advertisement may be a video, animation, (e.g. Flash), a digital image, text document, or other multimedia format comprising visual and audio content. The advertisement typically comprises at least visual content and possibly audio content; however in other embodiments an advertisement having only audio content could be used.","The visual content is typically displayed so as to occupy the full display area of the touchscreen display  (i.e., full screen) thereby obscuring the user interface screen of the operating system  or application  which was previously displayed, or other visual content which would otherwise be displayed. In other embodiments, a portion of the touchscreen display  less than the full screen could be used. Visual content less than the full screen typically occupies a majority of the touchscreen display  as opposed to ticker ads or banners ads which occupy only a small portion of the display screen, and are typically limited to a designated area of the display screen. It will be appreciated that the advertisement, when displayed, may have matting which surrounds the advertising content, for example, to accommodate differences between the aspect ratios of the advertising content and the touchscreen display . Moreover, the advertisement may be presented within a frame or window on the touchscreen display  which may include user interface elements associated with a player or rendering application associated with the advertising player provided by the dynamic event module .","Next, in step  the processor  implements a locked mode in response to the display of the advertisement on the touchscreen display . The locked mode limits the inputs accepted by the user input devices (e.g. touchscreen display , control buttons , etc.) of the mobile communication device . This prevents usage of the device  until a predetermined termination condition has occurred.","Next, at step  the processor  monitors for and detects the occurrence of a predetermined termination condition to exit the locked mode and release the limits on the inputs accepted by the user input devices. In some embodiments, the termination condition is the expiry of a predetermined duration from the display of the advertisement on the display screen (e.g., until n seconds have elapsed). If the advertisement has a duration, for example when the advertisement is a video, audio clip or animation, the predetermined duration may be the duration of the advertisement itself. In some embodiments, the advertisement may be a rapid Flash advertisement of several seconds or less (e.g. 2 to 3 seconds or less).","When the advertisement does not have a duration, for example when the advertisement is a digital image or text, the predetermined duration is a predetermined value. The predetermined value may be, for example, between 5 and 10 seconds, or 5 seconds or less. Example predetermined values which could be used in some embodiments are 10 seconds, 5 seconds, 3 seconds, 2 seconds and 1 second. These example durations are long enough to provide some assurance that the user has viewed and\/or heard the advertisement, but are sufficiently short such that the durations may not be considered overly intrusive by at least some users.","The duration may be configurable to user preferences, either by device settings stored on the device  or by settings maintained or accessible by the advertising server . The duration may be part of advertising parameters which are defined, for example, at the time the user creates a mobile data service plan (contract) with their respective mobile data service provider. In such cases, the duration may be stored by the mobile data service provider in a database and transmitted to the advertising server  as required, or the duration may be stored by the advertising server . Device settings stored on the device  may be transmitted and stored on the advertising server  when created or changed, or could be transmitted upon detection of a trigger condition and a request for advertisement to be displayed.","As noted above, the duration of the delay may be associated with a financial reward. That is, users may be compensated for per unit of time of the delay (e.g., per second or millisecond) so the user can benefit financially from longer delays in some cases. Thus, a user can choose the desired trade-off between the financial reward and the inconvenience of the advertisements in accordance with individual preferences. Where the user can set the duration of the delay on the device , the duration is transmitted back to the advertising server  either when the setting is first made on the device  or subsequently changed, or after the display of each advertisement, so that the financial reward may be calculated. In embodiments where there is no financial reward, the user may still be given the option to choose the length of the delay, if any.","In other embodiments, the termination condition is the detection of a touch at a specific area of the touch-sensitive input surface . The specific area of the touch-sensitive input surface  may be a predetermined area, or a randomly generated area determined when the advertisement is displayed on the touchscreen display . The use of a randomly generated area rather than a predetermined area prevents users from advancing through the advertisement without viewing any or viewing only a small portion of the advertisement by learning the location of the predetermined area and pressing that area immediately after a trigger condition and\/or immediately after the advertisement is displayed.","In other embodiments, the termination condition is a predetermined combination of inputs using the input devices of the mobile communication device  (e.g., one or more specific inputs using the touchscreen  or control buttons ). In embodiments having a mechanical keyboard, the predetermined combination of inputs may be a predetermined key combination, or could be a predetermined combination of keys and one or more specific inputs using the control buttons .","Next, in step  when the occurrence of a termination condition is detected, the locked mode is terminated and the mobile communication device  is returned to normal (full) functionality. That is, the limits on the inputs accepted by the user input devices are removed. The mobile communication device  will remain in the locked mode until a termination condition is detected. A notification that the advertisement was successfully displayed or otherwise reproduced on the device  may be transmitted to the advertising server , for example, for use in calculating the financial reward. Where a delay is the termination condition, the duration of the delay may be transmitted to the advertising server  for the purpose of calculating the financial reward when the duration of the delay is not already known to the advertising server .","While the operations  have been described as occurring in a particular order, it will be appreciated to persons skilled in the art that some of the steps may be performed in a different order provided that the result of the changed order of any given step will not prevent or impair the occurrence of subsequent steps. Furthermore, some of the steps described above may be combined in other embodiments, and some of the steps described above may be separated into a number of sub-steps in other embodiments. For example, the duration of the delay could be transmitted to the advertising server  at any time after it is known, and need not be transmitted after the device  is unlocked. In addition, the notification that the advertisement was successfully displayed or otherwise reproduced on the device  may be transmitted to the advertising server  at any time after it is displayed or otherwise reproduced rather than after the device  is unlocked.","The teachings of the present disclosure, while described primarily in the context of advertisements, could also be applied to the reproduction of content other than advertisements on the device , particularly content for which user attention is sought or is desirable. The content could be stored locally on the device in memory , locally on a removable memory card such as an SD\u2122 or MicroSD\u2122 card received in a removable memory card interface (not shown) of the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , or remotely by the content server , for example, in a content database (not shown). In some embodiments, the content may comprise one or any combination of visual content, audio content, and audio and visual content (e.g., multimedia content). The content may comprise an electronic message (e.g., SMS, MMS, IM message, email message, etc.), audio, video, animation, (e.g. Flash), a digital image, or text document. These examples are intended to be non-limiting.","The content could be selected based on user information about the device user. The user information used in the selection of content may comprise personal information, demographic information, location information concerning the geographic location of mobile communication device , or any combination of the above. The demographic information may comprise: user-defined preferences, learned preferences (for example, from past behaviour or purchases) and any other demographic information which can be attributed to the user.","The content could be selected from a personal media library\/collection on the device  or content server . The personal media collection may comprise one or any combination of digital images, audio and video. The personal media collection may comprise one or any combination of favourite digital images (e.g., family photos, vacation photos, etc.), favourite audio (e.g. favourite songs), and favourite video (e.g. favourite video clips). Favourites may be stored in one or more predetermined media databases (which, in some embodiments, could comprise a separate media database for each media type, e.g. audio, video and digital images) and may be identified as a favourite by its location in a predetermined media database, or may be identified based on a favourite flag associated with the respective media content. The content could be selected from the personal media collection: (i) randomly; or (ii) based on user information about the device user. Thus, in some embodiments the detection of a trigger condition could cause the display of a favourite digital image, favourite song, or favourite video clip. A user configurable device settings or server settings may be provided which allow the device user to select the type of media, whether it is limited to favourites, and\/or the basis for selection (e.g. random or based on user information).","In addition to or instead of the foregoing criteria, the content may be selected based on user information about a person with whom the device user is communicating (e.g., via a telephone call, chat, or other communication session) or user information about a person with whom the device user is attempting to initiate communications with, for example a person with whom the device user is composing an electronic message (e.g., SMS, MMS, IM message, email message, etc.). Information about the person with whom the device user is communicating or attempting to initiate communications with can only be used in some instances, that is, when an indication of the person with whom the device user is communicating or attempting to communicate with is available. Typically, this is indentifying information about the person (e.g., name, phone number, email address, IM name or other identifier) but could be a hint about the identity of the person. For example, information from an active voice call or an electronic communication (e.g., message) being viewed\/displayed on the device  may be used to identify the person whom the user is communicating (e.g., an email being read by the device user). An email address or other contact identifier in an address field (e.g., \u201cTo\u201d field) of a message composition window (for email, IM or other electronic messages) may be used to identify the person whom the user is communicating, or may be used to identify the person with whom the device user is attempting to initiate communications with. The information about the identified person used in the selection of content may comprise personal information, demographic information, location information concerning the geographic location of the person, the current date and a date associated with personal information (such as birthdays and anniversaries), or any combination of the above.","Thus, in some embodiments the detection of a trigger condition could cause the display of information concerning the person with whom the device user is communicating or attempting to initiate communications with, such as a birthday, family information, or other personal information on the display screen of the device . The display of personal information may allow, for example, the device user to provide a personal message to the person with whom they are speaking to on the telephone, or to compose a more personal message.","In other embodiments, the content could be notifications. The notifications could be device notifications relating to the device such as a low battery, loss of connection with the wireless network , device hardware failure, identification of a device hardware defect, a \u201cgeneral\u201d emergency such as the occurrence of a natural disaster or other local emergency such as a transit strike or other suspension of transit services, a reminder notification relating to calendar events or other electronic events, or a notification relating to the receipt of a new electronic message (e.g., an email message, an SMS or text message, MMS message, IM message, voicemail messages, etc.) from one of the applications  on the device .","Device Orientation Determination","Referring now to , predefined device orientations detected by the device orientation subsystem  in some embodiments of the present disclosure will be described. The device orientation subsystem  or processor , depending on the embodiment, uses measurements of the device orientation subsystem  (e.g., the accelerometer ) to determine the device orientation to be one of six possible device orientations comprising: (1) a \u201ctop up\u201d device orientation (as shown in ); (2) a \u201cbottom up\u201d device orientation (as shown in ); (3) a \u201cleft up\u201d device orientation (as shown in ); (4) a \u201cright up\u201d device orientation (as shown in ); (5) a \u201cfront up\u201d (or \u201cface up\u201d) device orientation (as shown in ); and (6) a \u201cback up\u201d device orientation (as shown in ). Other device orientations are possible and could be used in other embodiments.","It will be appreciated that the predefined device orientations are defined by which particular one of the top , bottom , left-hand side , right-hand side , front face , and back face  of the device  is directed generally upwards. Moreover, it will be appreciated that the device  need not be orientated precisely in one the illustrated device orientations for the determination of the device orientation. Instead, the predefined device orientations act as reference positions. The device orientation is determined by selecting the reference position (e.g., which of the six predefined device orientations shown in ) is closest to the actual device orientation. Each of the predefined device orientations may be mapped to orientation values measured by the orientation sensor or derived from its measurements in order to determine the reference position which is closest to the actual device orientation. The orientation values may be used to construct an orientation profile of each of the six predefined device orientations. The orientation values which are mapped to the predefined device orientations, in some embodiments, may be defined, directly or indirectly, in terms of pitch (\u03c6), roll (\u03c1) and the angle of the z-axis relative to gravity (\u03b8) measured by a three-axis accelerometer, which may calculated using equations (3), (4) and (5) described above.","In some embodiments in which the touchscreen display  is rectangular in shape, the processor , in some operational modes, may change the screen orientation of the GUI to a landscape screen orientation when the mobile communication device  is (re)positioned in a generally horizontal direction in accordance with the instructions of the user interface module , and may change the screen orientation of the GUI to a portrait screen orientation when the mobile communication device  is (re)positioned in a generally vertical direction in accordance with the instructions of the user interface module . The processor  may invert or \u201cflip\u201d the screen orientation of the GUI horizontally or vertically if the mobile communication device  is flipped horizontally or vertically. In other operational modes of the processor  or in other embodiments, the screen orientation may be fixed.","Referring again to the , in some embodiments the screen orientation of the GUI is selected in accordance with mappings of screen orientation to device orientation as set forth below in Table 1 (subject to application overrides as described below):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Device Orientation vs. Screen Orientation"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Device Orientation","Screen Orientation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["\u201ctop up\u201d device orientation (FIG. 8A)","portrait (up) screen orientation"]},{"entry":["\u201cbottom up\u201d device orientation (FIG. 8B)","portrait (down) screen"]},{"entry":[{},"orientation"]},{"entry":["\u201cleft up\u201d device orientation (FIG. 8C)","landscape (left) screen"]},{"entry":[{},"orientation"]},{"entry":["\u201cright up\u201d device orientation (FIG. 8D)","landscape (right) screen"]},{"entry":[{},"orientation"]},{"entry":["\u201cfront up\u201d device orientation (FIG. 8E)","default\/previous screen"]},{"entry":[{},"orientation"]},{"entry":["\u201cback up\u201d device orientation (FIG. 8F)","default\/previous screen"]},{"entry":[{},"orientation (or display"]},{"entry":[{},"screen disabled\/off)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Having regard to the above-described screen orientations (also referred to as aspect ratios), it will be appreciated that the screen orientation is portrait in both the \u201ctop up\u201d and \u201cbottom up\u201d device orientations shown in  and , respectively, and that the screen orientation is landscape in both the \u201cleft up\u201d and \u201cright up\u201d device orientations shown in  and , respectively. To differentiate between the variants of the portrait screen orientation in the \u201ctop up\u201d and \u201cbottom up\u201d device orientations and landscape screen orientation in the \u201cleft up\u201d and \u201cright up\u201d device orientations, a direction of the screen orientation is defined. The direction is relative to a fixed position on the device , which is the top  of the device  in the present embodiment. A different directional reference could be used in other embodiments. Thus, the screen orientation in the \u201ctop up\u201d device orientation () is the portrait (up) screen orientation because the top  of the device  is directed upwards relative to the ground and force of gravity. The screen orientation in the \u201cbottom up\u201d device orientation () is the portrait (down) screen orientation because the top  of the device  is directed downwards relative to the ground and force of gravity. Otherwise stated, in the \u201cbottom up\u201d device orientation of , the bottom  of the device  is directed upwards relative to the ground and force of gravity.","The screen orientation in the \u201cleft up\u201d device orientation () is landscape (left) screen orientation because the top  of the device  is rotated in the vertical plane towards the left side  of the device . The screen orientation in the \u201cright up\u201d device orientation () is landscape (right) screen orientation because the top  of the device  is rotated in the vertical plane towards the right side  of the device .","In some embodiments, the \u201cfront up\u201d () and \u201cback up\u201d () device orientations are not associated with a particular screen orientation, except for a default screen orientation. The default screen orientation is typically the portrait (up) orientation of the \u201ctop up\u201d device orientation as this is typically considered the \u201cnormal\u201d operating position of the device . In the \u201cfront up\u201d and \u201cback up\u201d device orientations, the screen orientation is the previous screen orientation of the device  when it was last in the \u201ctop up\u201d, \u201cbottom up\u201d, \u201cleft up\u201d or \u201cright up\u201d device orientation. The previous screen orientation of the device  is stored in memory  by the user interface module .","As described in more detail below, some of the applications  may have a screen orientation of the GUI which varies in accordance with the orientation of the device ; however, one or more of the applications , such as the phone application, may have a fixed screen orientation which is unaffected by the device orientation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["334","229","201","334","336","338","340","342","344","346","240","210"]},"In the portrait screen orientation, the virtual keyboard  is displayed between the left and right sides ,  of the device  in the lower portion of the touch-sensitive input surface  towards the bottom  of the device . A virtual keyboard  in a portrait screen orientation scrolls horizontally across the face  of the device  in the same general direction as its width. In other embodiments, the virtual keyboard  may be located elsewhere (e.g. towards the top of touch-sensitive input surface ) and may occupy a larger or smaller portion of the touchscreen  than that shown in . In some embodiments, the virtual keyboard  in the portrait screen orientation may occupy a majority of the touch-sensitive input surface  of touchscreen .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0133"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["334","334","322","324","201","334","305","201","334","210","210","334","210"]},"In both the portrait screen orientation and landscape screen orientation in the shown embodiments, the virtual keyboard  is located in a lower portion of the GUI relative to the screen orientation (and typically the current device orientation) so that it may be more easily touched (or actuated) using the thumbs or other fingers of the user while the user is holding the device . In some embodiments, the device components may be configured and dimensioned so that user may hold the device  in such a manner to enable two-thumb typing on the virtual keyboard  of the device  (typically using both hands). In other embodiments, the device components may be configured and dimensioned so that the device  can be cradled in the palm of a user's hand and the virtual keyboard  may be touch with the thumb of the hand of the user in which the device  is being held. A user may use a stylus instead of fingers (e.g., thumbs) if desired. It will be appreciated that, if a capacitive touchscreen is used, fingers or a conductive device (such as a stylus having a conductive tip) should be used to register a touch input.","In the example embodiments illustrated in , the virtual keyboard  comprises a plurality of substantially similarly sized alphanumeric keys or buttons  and a larger elongated space bar key or button . The alphanumeric keys  are arranged in a plurality of rows across the touchscreen  with the elongate space bar key  located centrally below the last row of alphanumeric keys . In an example embodiment, at least one of the virtual keys  has one or more displayable character associated therewith. The virtual keyboard  also comprises non-alphanumeric command and\/or control buttons or keys, such as a line feed or \u201cENTER\u201d key , a \u201cCAP\u201d key  for capitalizing letters, an \u201cALT\u201d key  for selecting an alternative input or command, and a \u201cBACKSPACE\u201d key  which backs up the cursor when the device is in a text input mode and removes the previous character input. Additional virtual control keys such as \u201cSHIFT\u201d and \u201cCTRL\u201d keys may be provided in other embodiments. Alternatively, one or more mechanical control keys may be provided to invoke the secondary or alternate input of the virtual keys . The mechanical control keys could be the \u201cSHIFT\u201d and\/or \u201cCTRL\u201d keys, or possibly an \u201cALT\u201d key replaying that in the virtual keyboard  of the illustrated embodiment. The control buttons or keys can be pressed (pressed once or continually pressed down, depending on the key and device configuration) to provide an alternative input of the keys  or other input component when pressed. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, keys that give alternative meaning to other input components enable expanded input capability.","The virtual keyboard  may also comprise one or more specialized keys (not shown) such as a menu key which invokes context-sensitive menus comprising a list of context-sensitive options, a back key which cancels action or reverses (\u201cbacks up\u201d) through previous user interface screens or menus displayed on the touchscreen , a hang up key to end a voice call, and\/or an answer key to answer an incoming voice call.","In the above described embodiments, the virtual keyboard  comprises a full keyboard comprising a plurality of keys  each having an alphabetic letter associated with the key on one letter per key basis. This one-to-one pairing between letters and keys will be understood to persons of ordinary skill in the art and will not be described in detail herein. In order to facilitate user input, the alphabetic letters are typically configured in a familiar QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY, or Dvorak layout known in the art. In other embodiments, a reduced keyboard is provided comprising a plurality of keys  each having an alphabetic letter associated with the key on multiple letter per key basis.","While example virtual keyboard layouts and configurations have been described, it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that alternative full or reduced keyboard layouts and configurations may be used in other embodiments of device .","In the device screen of , the GUI also provides within the touchscreen  a status bar  and icon selection menu . The status bar  displays information such as the current date and time, icon-based notifications, device status and\/or device state. The icon selection menu  displays a plurality of pictorial icon menu items (icons) . The icon selection menu  provides the device user with choices of applications or functions that may be run on the mobile communication device . The icon menu items  are each selectable to link to, or launch, an associated application or function, or open an associated folder. The icon menu items  may, for example, be used to select an email manager application, a calendar application, a note pad application, or other application. The user can select an application to be launched by highlighting or focusing the icon menu item  associated with the respective application through movement of an on-screen position indicator  commonly referred to as a caret or cursor. The\u2014on-screen position indicator  may be moved through the icon menu items  using navigational inputs via the touchscreen  or a supplemental navigation tool such as a clickable\/depressible scroll wheel or trackball (for example, by rotating a scroll wheel or trackball). When an icon menu item  is highlighted or focussed by the on-screen indicator , the focussed item  may be activated or \u201cselected\u201d via corresponding selecting input via the touchscreen  or other input. If the icon menu item  represents an application, activating the menu icon item  causes the processor  to launch the application logically associated with the icon , for example, the email manager application. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, the activation input is translated by the GUI into a request to launch or invoke the application or function, or open the folder associated with the icon .","In the device screen of , a text entry mode user interface frame or window  is displayed above the virtual keyboard . The text entry mode user interface window  comprises a number of navigable and editable input fields and is used in a text input or entry mode. Several device applications  typically have an associated text entry mode such as, for example, email messaging applications, instant messaging applications, task list applications, calendar applications and notepad applications. In the shown embodiment, the window  is a message composition window associated with an email messaging application. The message composition window  comprises a header portion  including an address field (e.g., \u201cTo\u201d field) and a subject field, and a body portion . The text entry mode user interface of the window  includes a cursor or on-screen position indicator  which provides visual feedback as to the current input location (e.g., current field and possibly current location in the respective field depending on the current field).","The teachings of the present disclosure, while described primarily in the context of mobile communication devices, can be applied to electronic devices with and without wireless communications capabilities. For electronic devices without wireless communications capabilities, the content to be displayed must be stored on the device.
