title: Tool-less chain coupling link
abstract: A tool-less chain coupling link has first and second body members releasably joined together. A first hinge pin is movably positioned within corresponding openings in the first and second body members. A first hinge pin keeper member is pivotally attached to the first body member and movably attached to the first hinge pin. A second hinge pin is movably positioned within other corresponding openings in the first and second body members. A second hinge pin keeper member is pivotally attached to the second body member and movably attached to the second hinge pin. The first and second hinge pin keeper members can be pivoted in a first direction to withdraw the first and second hinge pins, respectively, a sufficient distance to allow the first and second body members to be released from each other. The first and second hinge pin keeper members can be pivoted in an opposite, second direction so as to position the first and second hinge pins within their corresponding openings in the first and second body members so that the first and second body members are releasably joined together.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION:","REFERENCE NUMBER LIST"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the U.S. Government for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","The present invention generally relates to a tool-less chain coupling link.","In helicopter sling loading, sling leg length is partially controlled by adding or removing pre-designated lengths of chains. A coupling link is used to connect the additional chains. One example of a prior art chain coupling link is the Columbus McKinnon Hammerlok Model No. 664241. A major disadvantage of the aforesaid prior art coupling link is that a hammer and punch are needed to separate the coupling link sections. During testing, it is common to repeatedly change the chains from one test item to the next or even while on a single item. This is usually done outdoors with no work bench nearby. The test requires two people to perform the change. One person holds the coupling link steady while the other person lines up the punch with the hinge pin. The second person then drives the punch through with the hammer. This also requires clearance below the coupling link to permit hinge pin movement. Often, the first person is trying to hold the link off the ground. Other situations have occurred where the sling sets have been taken to the load already positioned for flight only to find that the additional chains have not been connected. This requires a return trip to the work shop to retrieve the hammer and punch thereby resulting in expenditure of even more time.","Other prior art chain coupling links are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,353,940, 3,132,395, 3,974,640, 4,063,413, 4,123,900, 4,134,256, 4,280,728, 4,418,526, 4,590,758, 5,732,545, 5,775,754, 5,851,040 and 7,269,937.","What is needed is an improved chain coupling link.","The present invention is directed to a tool-less chain coupling link that eliminates the problems and disadvantages of prior art chain coupling links. The tool-less chain coupling link of the present invention significantly reduces the time for installing and removing additional chain sets.","The tool-less chain coupling link of the present invention comprises two coupling link body members that are removably joined together by two hinge pins. Each hinge pin is movably secured to both coupling link body members so as to hold the coupling link body members together as a single unit. Each coupling link body member has a movable hinge pin keeper member that, when in a first position, retains each respective hinge pin in a locked position. Each hinge pin keeper member may be moved to a second position to withdraw the corresponding hinge pin. Each hinge pin is sized so it survives the shear loading produced by the chain's axial loads. Each hinge pin has a predetermined length to enable the hinge pin to be withdrawn a sufficient distanced to allow the coupling link body members to be separated.","Thus, in aspect, the present invention is directed to a tool-less chain coupling link comprising a first generally U-shaped body member having a first end portion and a second forked end portion having a pair of sections separated by a space. The first end portion has an opening and each section of the second forked end portion has an opening, wherein the openings of the sections are substantially coaxial. The tool-less chain coupling link further includes a second generally U-shaped body member releasably joined to the first generally U-shaped body member. The second generally U-shaped body member has a first end portion and a second forked end portion having a pair of sections separated by a space. The first end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member has an opening and each section of the second forked end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member has an opening. The openings in the sections of the second forked end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member are substantially coaxial. The first end portion of the first generally U-shaped body member is positioned in the space between the sections of the second forked end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member such that the openings in the first end portion of the first generally U-shaped body member are substantially aligned with the openings in the sections of the second forked end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member. The first end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member is positioned in the space between the sections of the second forked end portion of the first generally U-shaped body member such that the openings in the first end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member are substantially aligned with the openings in the sections of the second forked end portion of the first generally U-shaped body member. A first hinge pin is removably inserted into the openings of the sections of the second forked end portion of the first generally U-shaped body member and into the opening in the first end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member. A first hinge pin keeper member is pivotally attached to the first generally U-shaped body member and is movably connected to the first hinge pin. The first hinge pin keeper member is pivotal to a first position to withdraw the first hinge pin from the opening in the first end section of the second generally U-shaped body member and to a second position that retains the first hinge pin within the opening of the first end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member and within the openings in the sections of the second forked end portion of the first generally U-shaped member. A second hinge pin member is removably inserted into the openings of the sections of the second forked end portion of the second generally U-shaped body member and the opening in the first end portion of the first generally U-shaped body member. A second hinge pin keeper member is pivotally attached to the second generally U-shaped body member and movably connected to the second hinge pin. The second hinge pin keeper member is pivotal to a first position to withdraw the second hinge pin from the opening in the first end portion of the first generally U-shaped body member and to a second position that retains the second hinge pin within the opening of the first end portion of the first generally U-shaped body member and within the openings in the sections of the second forked end portion of the second generally U-shaped member. When the first and second hinge pin keeper members are both pivoted to the first position, the first and second hinge pins are withdrawn a sufficient distance from the openings in the first and second body members to allow the first and second U-shaped body members to be separated from each other.","Advantages and further features of the present invention are described in the ensuing description.","Referring to , there is shown tool-less chain coupling link  of the present invention.
