The products (5) and (7)\u2014after work up\u2014were isolated as solids in 72 and 52% yields respectively. Their structures were established unambiguously with single crystal X-ray crystallography.","All melting points were recorded by a capillary melting point apparatus and uncorrected. The IR spectra were determined on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR Spectrum-2000 spectrometer. H and C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with CDCland acetone-dsolvents. The chemical shift values were reported in 8 units (part per million) relative to TMS as an internal standard.","Azidoacetyl pentanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (3): A mixture of pentanitro-hexaazaisowurtzitane (1.0 gm, 2.54 mmol) and chloroacetyl chloride (5 ml, excess) was heated in a sealed tube at 100\u00b0 C. for 48 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and evaporated to dryness. The residue was treated with ether, filtered, washed the solid with ether and air dried at room temperature to obtain 3 as a white solid.

Thus, the chloroacetyl substrate 5 (238 mg, 0.50 mmol) in acetone (5 mL) was treated with sodium azide (0.65 gm, 10 mmol) and the resulting heterogeneous mixture was refluxed for 12 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated and the residue was column chromatographed with si-gel (10% ethyl acetate:hexane as eluting solvent) to afford the product as a white solid.

To this resulting suspension was added drop-wise triazidoalcohol (597 mg, 3.03 mmol) in dry THF (5 mL) via syringe. The mixture was stirred in a preheated (80\u00b0 C.) oil bath for 3 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and was then added in portions cyanuric chloride (184 mg, 1.0 mmol). After complete addition of cyanuric chloride, the reaction mixture was subjected to reflux for 7 days. Reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured over crushed ice and extracted with ethylacetate (3\u00d725 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with water (1\u00d730 mL), brine (1\u00d730 mL) and dried (NaSO). Evaporation of the solvent followed by Si-gel column chromatography (5% EtOAc-Hexane) afforded the pure product as a white solid in 72% (480 mg) yield. m.p.: 74-75\u00b0 C.; density: 1.473 g\/cc (measured by gas pycnometer); IR (KBr): 2933 (s), 2866 (m), 2551 (m), 2527 (m), 2103 (vs), 1731 (m), 1563 (vs), 1448 (vs), 1331 (vs), 1129 (vs) cm; H-NMR (CDCl): 3.91 (s, 18H, 9xCH); C-NMR (CDCl): \u03b40.76, 85.58, and 170.90.","Bis-triazidomethylmethyloxytetrazine (7): Reaction was carried out following the reaction conditions as mentioned above using dichlorotetrazine (150 mg, 1.0 mmol), triazidoalcohol (396 mg, 2.01 mmol) and sodium hydride (49 mg, 95%, 2.01 mmol) in THF (15 mL) under reflux for 4 days.
