title: Information processing apparatus for setting a printing attribute to a hot folder
abstract: According to an information processing method of generating print data to be processed by a printing apparatus, when data is stored in a storage area, the data is transmitted to the printing apparatus by applying a printing attribute corresponding to the storage area. The printing attribute corresponding to the storage area is set, and status information representing the status of the printing apparatus is obtained. The printing attribute is changed to adapt the printing attribute to the obtained status information.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information processing technique of processing print data.","2. Description of the Related Art","A printer driver and a hot folder are used for inputting a print job to a printing apparatus. In the use of the hot folder, the user creates a hot folder on the desktop of a host computer or the like. At this time, the user sets desired printing attributes. When the user drags and drops a file to be printed into the folder, the hot folder executes print processing in accordance with the printing attributes set in advance. The hot folder can permanently use printing attributes set once and thus can repeat printing at the same settings (e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-115568).","Even the printer driver can perform processing similar to that using the hot folder. For example, the user sets printing attributes on the printer driver, and saves the printing attribute settings as \u201cfavorite settings\u201d. In printing, the printer driver reads out the printing attributes and can print with the printing attributes set by the user.","Inputting a print job using the printer driver or hot folder allows saving printing attributes set once and repetitively executing jobs at the same settings.","However, the above-mentioned prior art cannot cope with a change of the device status because printing attributes are fixed. Compared to a case of setting printing attributes for a hot folder or the like, the prior art cannot flexibly cope with a change of the paper type prepared in the paper feed cassette, replacement\/demounting of a finisher, or a change of resources in the ICC profile or the like.","The present invention has been made to overcome the conventional drawbacks, and has as its object to provide an information processing technique capable of flexibly coping with a change of the device status (addition\/change of settings, demounting of a device, or the like), which is impossible by the conventional hot folder technique and driver technique.","In order to achieve the above object, an information processing apparatus and information processing method according to the present invention mainly have the following arrangements.","According to the present invention, the foregoing object is attained by providing an information processing apparatus which generates print data to be processed by a printing apparatus from input data in accordance with a set printing attribute, comprising:","a first transmission unit which, when storing data in a storage area, transmits the data to the printing apparatus by applying a printing attribute corresponding to the storage area;","a setting unit which sets the printing attribute corresponding to the storage area;","an obtaining unit which obtains status information representing a status of the printing apparatus; and","a change unit which changes the printing attribute so as to adapt the printing attribute corresponding to the storage area to the status information obtained by the obtaining unit.","According to another aspect of the present invention, the foregoing object is attained by providing an information processing method of generating print data to be processed by a printing apparatus from input data in accordance with a set printing attribute, comprising:","a first transmission step of, when storing data in a storage area, transmitting the data to the printing apparatus by applying a printing attribute corresponding to the storage area;","a setting step of setting the printing attribute corresponding to the storage area;","an obtaining step of obtaining status information representing a status of the printing apparatus; and","a change step of changing the printing attribute so as to adapt the printing attribute corresponding to the storage area to the status information obtained in the obtaining step.","The present invention can dynamically treat a change of the device status and a change of resources, prevent an output result not intended by the user, and achieve information processing for efficient printing.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments (with reference to the attached drawings).","(Outline of Printing System Using Hot Folder)","An example of a printing system using a hot folder will be explained.  is a block diagram schematically showing the configuration of a system which prints using a hot folder.
