{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is related to concurrently-filed, co-pending, and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/690,980, entitled, \u201cCONTENT-RESTRICTED EDITING,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/690,214, entitled, \u201cWEB SITE MANAGEMENT LIFECYCLE,\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/689,870, entitled, \u201cAUTOMATIC SET UP FOR EDITING A WEB SITE,\u201d the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates, in general, to Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and, more specifically, to a cross-protocol URL mapping scheme.","Companies typically use the World Wide Web to disseminate information both internally, to employees and contractors, and externally, to customers and business partners. This information is usually generated by subject matter experts (SMEs), who are typically people with expertise in the information domain, but who are not usually technically skilled. In order to publish this information to the Web, or edit the existing information already on a company Internet or Intranet Web site, SMEs typically work with technically skilled Web developers, who generally combine Web coding or computer programming skills and graphics design skills. Skilled Web developers are an expensive resource. Moreover, Web developers may divide the coding and graphics arts expertise into multiple people.","Web sites generally comprise a Web server, that serves the visual and data content to the user's browser many times in a format, such as hypertext markup language (HTML), and a file transfer server, that provides read and write-access to the files that make up the visual and data content of the Web sites. While Web servers and file transfer servers are conceptualized as separate and independent machines, Web servers and file transfer servers are typically software applications, often times running on the same computer. The underlying Web files are usually stored on the computer, and the Web server and file transfer server interact with those files in different ways. Web servers typically allow read-only access to the files through HTML browsers, compared to the read\/write-access allowed by the file transfer servers. Because the file transfer server allows read\/write-access to Web files, general users are not typically given access to the file transfer server because changing files through the file transfer server will usually change how the Web pages are served through the Web server to the accessing browsers. Instead, file transfer server access is generally limited to Web developers or those who have some authority over the Web content. The file transfer server is typically run using a specific transfer protocol, such as file transfer protocol (FTP), secure FTP (SFTP), or the like. Additionally, the file transfer server may be set up on a local area network (LAN) or the like. While the Web server delivers HTML content, it uses hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) to transfer the requests and the resulting HTML content between the user's browser and the Web server. Even though both FTP and HTTP are transfer protocols, they are designed for different purposes and are not necessarily compatible.","For example, the file management system for HTTP will generally be different than that of FTP. HTTP is designed for more open access than FTP. HTTP communications revolve around establishing communication between a browser and a Web server in which HTML documents and any supporting documents that correspond to an HTTP request are transmitted from the Web server (sometimes called an HTTP server) to the browser to be rendered to the user. An example HTTP request is: http:\/\/www.macromedia.com\/index.html. The example request would likely be entered by a user into a Web browser. The http:\/\/ indicates the request is an HTTP request. The www.macromedia.com indicates the specific Web server domain to which the request is directed. Index.html is the specific file requested for display.","In contrast, FTP includes functions for logging onto the network, listing directories, copying files, and the like. An example FTP command is: ftp:\/\/ftp.macromedia.com. When entered in a browser, the ftp:\/\/ indicates that the request is an FTP request. The ftp.macromedia.com is the name of the domain that the user wishes to log onto. Login and password information would still generally be required for the user to actually log on to the ftp.macromedia.com FTP server. Once logged on, the user can download and store files, see directories of the files on the FTP server and the like, depending, in general, on the level of authorization the particular user has for that particular FTP server. However, if the user were looking for the index.html file from the HTTP example, it would likely not be found if the user attempted to access www.macromedia.com\/index.html. The user would need to obtain the FTP path that corresponds to that particular Web site.","General users are not typically given access to the file transfer server for any particular Web site because manipulating files in the file transfer server will usually change how the Web pages are seen or not seen by the accessing browsers. File transfer server access is generally limited to Web developers or those who have some authority over the Web content. Web development environments and development tools exist to assist the developers both retrieve and edit the underlying files that make up the Web pages. In order to access the FTP server, a Web designer or developer is generally prompted by the server access application to provide the FTP host name, the FTP login, the FTP password, and the FTP path. While the FTP host name, login, and password are usually the pieces of information that will get the user onto the FTP server, without the FTP root path name, a user will not likely find the location on the FTP server where the underlying Web files are located. For most experienced designers or developers all of this information is relatively easy to know and\/or obtain. A novice or non-technical user may know the FTP host name, login, and password, but would generally not know the FTP root path; and, without the root path, the FTP server will generally not allow access to the appropriate file locations. One solution for such novice or non-technical persons is to track down an information technology (IT) professional or other computer professional to obtain that information. Another solution is to simply hire an experienced designer to make the desired changes to the Web site. However, each of these current solutions comes at a cost of considerable time and money; sometimes just to make a few minor changes or revisions to the Web site.","The present invention is directed to a system and method for converting the URL for a file stored in a first protocol server to a URL of that file stored in a second protocol server. A first embodiment of the present invention allows mapping of a URL for a Web file stored according to an HTTP server file system to the URL of that file as it is stored according to a file transfer server file system, such as an FTP server. This process is useful in maintain and editing Web sites, and thus may be included as a feature in a Web development environment. The process begins with two pieces of information: the base URL of the underlying Web site; and the base root directory name of that Web site on the FTP server. Both the base URL and the base root directory name may be obtained by a user, but preferred embodiments of the present invention may obtain the base URL from a user and the base root directory name automatically from a Web development environment.","As the user of the Web development environment enters the specific URL of the Web page desired to be edited, the mapping method compares the base Web site URL to the exact URL of the Web page. Any address elements that extend beyond that of the base Web site URL are stripped off as the relative address of that Web file. The address is then mapped into the file transfer URL by adding the relative address to the FTP base root directory associated with the Web site. The new address is the complete file transfer URL for the Web page file to be edited. The Web development environment may then use that file transfer URL to retrieve the appropriate file from the FTP server. Thus, the file transfer URL is determined automatically, without the user needing to have that specific information.","The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention.","Web site maintenance is typically a time consuming and costly process. Even where small changes to the content of Web pages are made, development professionals typically are required to implement the changes due to their specific knowledge of the Web server\/FTP server systems and, in the interest of preserving the format and design of the Web sites that they have spent considerable effort designing and implementing. A new technology developed by MACROMEDIA, INC., and described in concurrently-filed, commonly-owned patent application Ser. No. 10\/690,214, entitled, \u201cWEB SITE MANAGEMENT LIFECYCLE,\u201d allows non-technical users to browse to a particular Web site or Web page in which the content is to be edited\/deleted\/added, click on a button to edit that Web page, after which the system seamlessly presents the editable file in the same visual window to the user who may then edit the Web file in the same screen, and then click on a publish button, after which the system seamlessly stores the underlying, now-edited, Web file back onto the computer or storage devices holding the Web files along with the necessary dependent files in the appropriate places according to the filing system of the FTP server. This process generally occurs without the necessity that the user know the correct FTP server file transfer root directory name or the relationship between the Web server and the FTP server file systems.","One problem in implementing this Web site management lifecycle is the mapping of the uniform resource locators (URLs) between the Web transfer protocol, such as HTTP, and the transfer protocol, such as FTP. Providing the ability to present the editable Web file, from the FTP server, to the user having only the Web page URL, creates a mapping problem that is addressed by the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","100","104","102","101","100","102","103","102","103"]},"HTTP formatted requests may request a specific file, such as in http:\/\/www.site.com\/orders.html , which specifically requests the orders.html file from Web server , or may request a directory, such as in http:\/\/www.macromedia.com\/106. When a directory is requested, Web server  typically attempts to retrieve the index page for that directory. In many implementations, the index page for a Web site is that site's home or main page. Thus, on the request of , Web server  would likely retrieve the main\/index page at macromedia.com.","The mapped addresses of each of the files requested from the HTTP formatted requests may be quite different for FTP server . For example, request  may translate to an FTP path of ftp:\/\/www.site.com\/var\/www\/site docs\/107. Therefore, request  for the orders.html file may then translate to an FTP path of ftp:\/\/www.site.com\/var\/wwvv\/site docs\/orders.html . Similarly, directory request  may translate into an FTP path of ftp:\/\/www.macromedia.com\/foo\/bar\/mm\/index.html . In order to create a more efficient management process, many developers try to follow some kind of regular addressing scheme for Web server  and FTP server . If they were to use an elaborate naming convention, it would likely be very difficult to perform maintenance on the Web site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["20","200","102","103","102","103","201","200","203","200","200"]},"The base FTP root directory may either be provided by the user or may be provided automatically by the Web development environment. Because the base FTP root directory name is information that is not typically easily available to non-technical individuals, an automatic method for obtaining it is beneficial. A new technology developed by MACROMEDIA, INC., and described in concurrently-filed, commonly-owned patent application Ser. No. 10\/311,290, entitled, \u201cAUTOMATIC SET UP FOR EDITING A WEB SITE,\u201d provides an automated process for finding the base root directory in the FTP server that represents that Web site. Therefore, the mapping module  may obtain the base root directory in the FTP server through operation of the automatic set up technology described in the above-styled commonly-owned patent application. Once the base FTP root directory is obtained, mapping module  places it in FTP root .","In operation, as a user on computer  enters a particular Web page to edit, mapping scheme module  compares the address of the Web page to the base Web site address in URL . A relative page address is thereafter obtained by stripping off the portion of the Web page address beyond the base Web site address in URL . Converter module  creates the direct file transfer path by adding the relative page address obtained by mapping scheme module  to FTP root . Thus, the development environment running on computer  may thereafter access FTP server  directly through Internet  to obtain the target file asset using the file transfer path created by converter module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","301","302","300","303","302","303","301","304","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","401","402","403","404"]},"Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the invention as defined by the appended claims.
