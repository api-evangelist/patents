title: Synthesis of combretastatin A-2 prodrugs
abstract: The original synthesis of combretastatin A-2 (1a) was modified to provide an efficient scale-up procedure for obtaining this antineoplastic stilbene. Subsequent conversion to a useful prodrug was accomplished by phosphorylation employing in situ formation of dibenzylchlorophosphite followed by cleavage of the benzyl ester protective groups with bromotrimethylsilane to afford phosphoric acid intermediate 11. The latter was immediately treated with sodium methoxide to complete a practical route to the disodium phosphate prodrug (2a). The phosphoric acid precursor (11) of phosphate 2a was employed in a parallel series of reactions to produce a selection of metal and ammonium cation prodrug candidates. Each of the phosphate salts (2aâ€“q) was evaluated with respect to relative solubility behavior, cancer cell growth inhibition, and antimicrobial activity.

An exceptionally promising approach to improving human cancer treatment involves the discovery and application of new cancer antiangiogenesis drugs. Such approaches to cancer treatment may cause avascular tumors to remain dormant or eventually to undergo necrosis and shrinkage. Further, appropriate combination of antiangiogenesis with cytotoxic drugs should lead to complete elimination of the neoplastic disease.","Applicant has obtained numerous United States patents relating to the compounds of the combretastatin family. These patents are incorporated herein by reference, and are believed to be as listed, most recent first, as follows: 1. U.S. Pat.

No. 4,940,726 Cell growth inhibitory macrocyclic lactones denominated Combretastatin D-1 and Combretastatin D-2.","Eighteen years ago applicant reported (Pettit et al., 1982) isolation from the South African tree (Eckl. Zeyk.) Kuntze the first member of a series of cancer cell growth inhibitory constituents designated the combretastatins. Subsequently, applicant lead the discovery (Pettit and Singh, 1987) of combretastatin A-2 (1a) and more recently applicant has focused on improving the original synthesis of this potent inhibitor of microtubule assembly and mitosis (Lin et al., 1988 and 1989) as well as converting it to a useful phosphate prodrug (2). Those objectives form the basis of this contribution and are considered very important owing to the powerful vascular targeting (Grosior et al., 1999; Tozer et al., 1999) and anticancer properties of the closely related combretastatin A-4 (1b, Pettit et al, 1989) and its sodium phosphate prodrug (Pettit and Rhodes, 1998). The latter has led to promising results in current Phase I human cancer clinical trials (Remick et al., 1999; Rustin et al., 1999).","The original synthesis of combretastatin A-2 (1a) was modified to provide an efficient scale-up procedure for obtaining this antineoplastic stilbene. Subsequent conversion to a useful prodrug was accomplished by phosphorylation employing in situ formation of dibenzylchlorophosphite 10 followed by cleavage of the benzyl ester protective groups with bromotrimethylsilane to afford phosphoric acid intermediate 11. The latter was immediately treated with sodium methoxide to complete a practical route to the disodium phosphate prodrug (2a). The phosphoric acid precursor (11) of phosphate 2a was employed in a parallel series of reactions to produce a selection of metal and ammonium cation prodrug candidates. Each of the phosphate salts (2a\u2013q) was evaluated with respect to relative solubility behavior, cancer cell growth inhibition, and antimicrobial activity.","Accordingly a primary object of the present invention is to provide a combretastatin A-2 prodrug.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of synthesizing combretastatin A-2.","A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of synthesizing combretastatin A-2 prodrugs.","These and still further objects as shall hereinafter appear are readily fulfilled by the present invention in a remarkably unexpected manner as will be readily discerned from the following detailed description of an exemplary embodiment thereof especially when read in conjunction with the accompanying formulae, tables, and schemes in which like parts, and compounds, bear like numerals throughout.","In order to obtain both combretastatin A-2 (1a) and its sodium phosphate prodrug (2a) the original synthesis (Pettit and Singh, 1987) of stilbene 1a was modified. Three major improvements were employed for this purpose. Firstly, the phosphonium bromide salt and the benzaldehyde precursors used in the Wittig reaction were reversed from the original synthesis to synthetic intermediates 7 and 8, which eliminated problems associated with the formation of the triphenylphosphonium bromide derived from isovanillin. Secondly, the Wittig reaction base used to treat phosphonium bromide 7 was changed from n-butyllithium to potassium hexamethylsilylamide (KHMDS). Current evidence suggested that the presence of lithium salts favors production of the trans isomer (Reitz, 1996). Pettit and Singh, (1987), reported a Z\/E ratio of 1:16 in the original Wittig sequence leading to cis-stilbene 1a. Upon substituting KHMDS and otherwise similar reaction conditions, a Z\/E ratio of 1:2 was obtained. Thirdly, separation of the stilbene silyl ether protected isomers (9a and 9b) proved difficult. However, separation was readily achieved following cleavage of the silyl ether protecting group with tetrabutylammonium fluoride.","Once a practical scale-up synthesis of combretastatin A-2 (1a) and combretastatin A-2 dibenzyl phosphate ester (10) was achieved, various metal cation and ammonium salts (2a\u2013q) of the derived phosphoric acid intermediate (11) were investigated. The various phosphate salts were synthesized to investigate the effects of different cations on both the anticancer activity of the prodrug (Table 1) and its solubility characteristics (Table II). The quinine and related ammonium cations were of interest with respect to the possibility of obtaining a stable, water-soluble drug with the ability to reverse multidrug resistance through interference with the p-glycoprotein mechanism (Chen et al., 1993; Williams & Jacobs, 1993; Kang & Perry, 1994; Adams & Knich, 1995; Genne et al., 1995; Sata et al., 1995; Watanaabe et al., 1997). The alkali metal salts (2a\u2013d) prepared are of a dibasic nature, owing to their formation in slightly basic media (pH\u02dc9). The alkaline earth metal salts (2e\u2013h) are of course monobasic, as are the ammonium salts (2i\u2013q).","Combretastatin A-2 (1a) is very sparingly soluble in water (<1 mg\/ml). However, as the metal phosphate salts 2a\u2013q, the water solubility in general increased dramatically. The monovalent metal cation prodrug salts, sodium (2a, 18 mg\/ml), lithium (2b, 21 mg\/ml), potassium (2c,>50 mg\/ml), and rubidium (2d, 40 mg\/ml), all displayed good solubility in water while the divalent metal cation salts derived from zinc, calcium, magnesium, and manganese were progressively more insoluble owing perhaps to the formation of oligomers. Of the ammonium cation salts both the morpholine (2m, 41 mg\/ml) and ammonium (2p, 34 mg\/ml) derivatives showed good water solubility. The remaining ammonium cation salts showed low water solubility (0\u20131 mg\/ml).","The cancer cell growth inhibitory activities (Table I) of the cation prodrugs 2a\u2013q remained strong and corresponded closely to that of combretastatin A-2 (1a) (Table I). As expected, the colchicine salt 2n exhibited enhanced potency contributed by the cation.","Contemporaneous testing of 1a and 2a in the NCI 60-cell screen (Boyd, 1997) yielded mean-panel GIvalues (10\u00b1SE) of 8.33\u00b11.73 and 16.5\u00b13.07, respectively. Compare correlation analyses (Boyd & Paull, 1995) confirmed that the mean-graph profiles of combretastatin A-2 (1) and its disodium 3\u2032-0-phosphate prodrug (2a) were essentially indistinguishable.","The combretastatins are moderately antimicrobial (Pettit et al., 1998; Pettit et al., 1995; Pettit et al., 2000; Pettit & Lippert; 2000). Combretastatin A-2 (1a) is no exception (Table III). Of the compounds screened in the present report, the parent compound (1a) and the hydroquinine salt (21) exhibited the broadest antimicrobial spectra (Table III).","Compounds were screened against the bacteria and the fungi and according to established broth microdilution susceptibility assays (NCCLS approved standard M7-A4, 1997; NCCLS approved standard M27-A, 1997). The minimum inhibitory concentration was defined as the lowest concentration of compound that inhibited all visible growth of the test organism (optically clear). Assays were repeated on separate days.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

Synthesis of the sodium phosphate (2a) and other prodrugs (2b\u2013q) resulted from treating phenol 1a with dibenzyl phosphite (Silverberg et al., 1996) to yield the corresponding bis(benzyl) phosphate. Cleavage of the benzyl protecting groups with bromotrimethylsilane (Lazar and Guillaumet, 1992) and subsequent treatment of the phosphoric acid with the appropriate cation precursor (sodium methoxide in the case of 2a) readily afforded prodrugs 2a\u2013q.","The phosphate derivatives were chosen for three reasons. Firstly, the phosphate salts enjoy enhanced solubility characteristics (Bundgaard, 1991). Secondly, once administered, phosphate prodrugs are believed to be primarily dephosphorylated in the tumor to yield the parent compound via non-specific phosphatases and are then transported intracellularly (Pettit et al., 1995a; Pettit and Rhodes, 1998). Thirdly, as the phosphate salt, the parent compound should be less susceptible to isomerization to the less active E-stilbene. The E-isomer of combretastatin A-2 shows considerably less antimitotic activity (Lin et al., 1988) than the Z-isomer (1a).
