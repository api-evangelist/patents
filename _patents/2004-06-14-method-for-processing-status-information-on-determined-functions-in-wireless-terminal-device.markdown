{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention relates to dynamic status information, particularly to processing status information on determined functions in a wireless terminal device.","The number of procedures to be carried out by a wireless terminal device, such as a mobile station, has increased considerably as a result of advances in mobile communication technology. A mobile station is no longer used for calls exclusively, but the mobile station enables information to be processed and presented in a more and more versatile manner. Generally, the display of a mobile station is so small that it restricts the amount and illustrative power of the information to be displayed.","Generally, the display of a wireless terminal device may be divided into a front and a background. According to the prior art, a user of a terminal device receives information only through the front, such as text shown on the display. Since the display is very small and the text to be shown thereon should, however, be large enough to enable the text to be read, the user is provided with only a very small amount of information at once. The display may, however, provide more information e.g. such that the display has to be browsed on, or a procedure has to be selected first on the display. On many occasions, however, it is difficult to browse the display and, typically, selecting a procedure is a separate and often also an additional step in the operating sequence.","According to the prior art, various effects, such as bold characters and icons and colours thereof, are commonly employed on larger displays in particular, such as computer monitors. The icons of Yahoo!\u00ae Messenger, for instance, enable e.g. the status of a contact to be presented such that an available person is designated by a smiling smiley while an unavailable person is designated by a sad smiley. In a mobile station also, it would often be useful to receive information e.g. on the status of a contact person in a phonebook. Many effects used on monitors are not, however, directly applicable to the display of mobile stations or, due to the physical smallness of the display, they are not illustrative enough.","An object of the invention is thus to provide a procedure so as to enable drawbacks of the above-mentioned problems to be reduced in a wireless mobile station. The object of the invention is achieved by a method, a device and a software product which are characterized by what has been disclosed in the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.","In the present application, status information refers to information to be registered in a terminal device, e.g. in \u201cstatus tables\u201d of the terminal device, and to be determined from functional information on the particular terminal device or on an external terminal device. A status server refers to any server which processes status information e.g. by storing status information on terminal devices in \u201cprofiles\u201d of the terminal devices, from which the status information may be forwarded e.g. to other terminal devices. A selection element, in turn, refers to any element, such as a cursor or a selection bar generally used for browsing on a display of a mobile station, which enables a desired target to be pointed on a graphical display. In addition to the actual pointing carried out by the above-mentioned element, pointing also refers to opening a page, such as a contact card or an electric business card, in a terminal device, or using a background element of a display in connection with a target.","The idea underlying the invention is that status information on determined functions is processed in a wireless terminal device, such as a mobile station. Reference information on the appearance, such as colour, shape, pattern or a manner of animation, of at least one element of a display, such as a selection or a background element, and the status of the status information is determined in the terminal device e.g. such that red means that a contact residing in a phonebook application is unavailable, and green that the contact is available. The status of the status information on a pointable target, such as a contact in a phonebook, residing in a terminal device application, is determined e.g. such that through a mobile communication network and base transceiver stations, the terminal device receives information indicating whether the terminal device of a contact is connected to the network. When a user of the terminal device points a target, the appearance of an element of the display, such as a selection element or a background element, is selected according to the reference information and the status of the status information in response to pointing the target.","According to a preferred embodiment, the status of the status information on a pointable target is determined such that when a target, such as a contact, is pointed, the terminal device receives status information on a contact from a status server, the status information having been transmitted in advance to the status server by a contact person in order to be stored therein.","The arrangement of the invention provides considerable advantages. An advantage is that a user of a wireless terminal may be provided with a larger amount of and more illustrative status information on a target being pointed. Another advantage is that the user may be provided with information on the status of the target without selecting additional procedures, because e.g. in the phonebook application, the user may see the availability of a contact by simply focusing a selection element on the contact. A yet further advantage is that the arrangement of the invention can be implemented quickly and easily in terminal devices. A still further advantage is that the arrangement of the invention can be used together with known techniques, such as icons generally known by users. Another further advantage is that statuses are determined dynamically, which enables the user to be quickly informed of a change in the statuses during different steps of operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","104","106","108","106","102"]},"In the following, the invention is described by means of a typical platform. The platform may be e.g. a Series 60 Platform; however, the invention is not restricted to that platform exclusively but may be utilized together with any other corresponding system.","Intelligent wireless terminal devices usually employ a platform to enable software of a terminal device to be created thereon and to enable various mobile station applications and services. Typically, a platform comprises a graphical user interface and applications and technologies, such as an MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) scanning and Java, built e.g. on a Symbian operating system. The platform enables software developers, operators and hardware manufacturers to create applications of their own thereon to operate between different devices and networks.","Typically, the platform further comprises ready-to-use applications that device manufacturers may insert in the devices they have manufactured. Such ready-to-use applications may provide e.g. public application programming interfaces (API) that enable access to the services of these applications from other applications. A platform may comprise e.g. the application of the invention for processing status information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","208","210","202","204","206","208","202","210","212"]},"A dynamic phonebook is a terminal device application enabling a user to receive status information on other users at his or her terminal device through e.g. an Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS). An Instant Messaging (IMS) service provides users of terminal devices with means for high-rate, interactive, mainly text-based data transfer. The advantage provided by instant messaging may be increased by adding a \u201cpresence service\u201d thereto to monitor the status information on contacts, such as availability, mood, location or communication preferences. Several users of terminal devices may be combined e.g. through a mobile communication network and possibly one or more intermediate networks to an IMPS status server. Typically, the Internet is used as an intermediate network. As far as presence services are concerned, the IMPS status server may be functionally divided into a publisher server, which is a home service element for a client possessing presence information, and a subscriber server, which is a home to a subscribing or requesting client. Consequently, the user of a terminal device is served by both servers. The users may also update the status information to the status server or the status information is automatically updated when e.g. a user changes his or her profile.","A user of terminal device A may check the dynamic phonebook e.g. for the availability of a user of terminal device B. The user of terminal device B has in advance transmitted information to a status server, indicating that he or she is at a meeting, so the user of terminal device A sees this status information on his or her own terminal device. In such a case, the user of terminal device A may e.g. activate a watch service of the dynamic phonebook such that terminal device A gives a voice signal when the status of the status information on terminal device B changes. In another embodiment, no voice signal occurs.","Typically, a display of a wireless terminal device is an LCD display, i.e. a \u201cLiquid Crystal Display\u201d. LCD displays may be further divided into passive and active matrix displays. Today, passive matrix displays are seldom used, mainly in special applications, due to their slowness. An active matrix display is also called a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) display.","The display of a wireless terminal device may be functionally divided into a front and a background. According to the prior art, a user of a terminal device receives information only through the front, such as text shown on the display. Typically, a selection element of the display is only used for selecting a desired procedure on the display. Since mobile stations are physically small, the size of a display cannot be increased considerably. Elements of the display, such as a selection and a background element, may, however, be utilized more efficiently according to the present invention such that the elements of the display are not merely static elements but \u201cintelligent\u201d elements whose appearance is determined by the status of the status information on a target to be pointed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIGS. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["a","b","c ","d ","a","b","c ","d","a","b","c","d"],"b":["4","4","4","400","400","402","402","4","4","4","402","402","402","402","402"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIGS. 4","FIGS. 5"],"i":["a","b ","c ","a","b","c ","d","a","b ","c"],"b":["5","5","500","4","4","4","500","500","502","502","502","5","5","506","504","500","508","504","500","504","500"]},"According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the colours of the elements used for indicating different information, such as different telephone numbers, fax, direct communication, a multimedia message, a text message and a game session, e.g. on a contact card or an electric business card, are selected separately on the basis of status information such that e.g. the colour selected to be the colour of the element for an e-mail address is green but the colour of the element for a mobile phone number is red. This enables a user of a terminal device to see, e.g. directly in an opened contact card or by browsing different contact alternatives, how a user of another terminal device is available at the particular moment.","According to a preferred embodiment, a contact list is browsed e.g. only after opening an application, such as a game. The status information on contacts are automatically updated in a terminal device, so that a user of the terminal device may have somebody to play with from among the contacts of the contact list, the colour of the element indicating such contacts being e.g. green, which in this case means availability.","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the appearance of an element of a display and prior art effects, such as icons, can be used together.","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, status information on pointable messages of a text message application of a wireless terminal device is processed. Reference information on the colour of a selection element and the status of the status information, such as whether or not a message has been read or whether or not a message has been replied to, is determined such that red means that a text message has not been read, green that a text message has been read and replied to, and blue that a text message has been read but not replied to. The status information on the messages in the text message application can be determined e.g. on the basis of functional information, such as reading or transmitting a text message, stored in the memory of a terminal device. When a user of the terminal device focuses a selection element on a target, the colour of the selection element of a display is selected in a predetermined manner in accordance with the status of the status information on the message. The method thus makes it easier for the user of the terminal device to detect the messages that require some action to be taken by the user.","The method of the invention can be implemented e.g. by the wireless terminal device of , comprising means for pointing at least one target on a display of the terminal device.","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the wireless terminal device comprises means for determining reference information on the appearance of at least one element of a display and the status of status information, means for determining the status of at least one piece of status information on at least one pointable target, means for pointing at least one target on the display of the terminal device, and means for selecting the appearance of an element of the display in accordance with the reference information and the status of the status information in response to pointing the target.","A status information processing functionality may also be achieved by means of a software product arrangeable in a wireless terminal device for implementing the method of the invention, such as the method according to a preferred embodiment of the invention shown in the flow diagram of .","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the software product comprises a software code for determining reference information on the appearance of at least one element of a display and the status of status information, a software code for determining the status of at least one piece of status information on at least one pointable target, a software code for pointing at least one target, and a software code for selecting the appearance of an element of the display in accordance with the reference information and the status of the status information in response to pointing the target.","It is obvious to one skilled in the art that as technology advances, the basic idea of the invention may be implemented in many different ways. The invention and its embodiments are thus not restricted to the above-described examples but may vary within the scope of the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention is now described in closer detail in connection with the preferred embodiments and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 4","i":["a","b","c ","d "],"b":["4","4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 5","i":["a","b ","c "],"b":["5","5"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
