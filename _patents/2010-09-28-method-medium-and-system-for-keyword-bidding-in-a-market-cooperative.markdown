No. 61\/257,632, filed on Nov. 3, 2009, entitled, \u201cCOMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR KEYWORD BIDDING IN A MARKET COOPERATIVE\u201d, and assigned to the same assignee as the present patent application.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to methods and systems supporting keyword advertising associated with Internet search engine usage and keyword query submittal by a user. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to keyword bidding in a market cooperative.","2. Related Art","An increasingly popular way of delivering Internet advertisements is to tie the advertisement to search query results triggered by the entry of particular keywords (e.g. search queries) by a user. In order to target advertising accurately, advertisers or vendors pay to have their advertisements presented in response to certain kinds of queries\u2014that is, their advertisements are presented when particular keyword combinations are supplied by the user of the search engine.","For example, when a user searches for \u201cbaseball cards,\u201d using a search engine such as Google or other well-known search engines, in addition to the usual query results, the user can also be shown a number of sponsored results. These can be paid advertisements for businesses, generally offering related goods and\/or services. In this example, the advertisements may therefore be directed to such things as baseball card vendors, collectibles shops, sports memorabilia, or even sporting goods or event tickets. Of course, the advertisements may be directed to seemingly less related subject matter. While the presentation varies somewhat between search engines, these sponsored results are usually shown a few lines above, or on the right hand margin of the regular results. Although, the sponsored results may also be placed anywhere in conjunction with the regular results.","Keyword advertising is growing as other types of web advertising are generally declining. It is believed there are at least several features that contribute to its success. First, sponsored results are piggybacked on regular results, so they are delivered in connection with a valuable, seemingly objective, service to the user. By contrast, search engines that are built primarily on sponsored results have not been as popular. Second, the precision of the targeting of the advertising means the user is more likely to find the advertisements useful, and consequently can perceive the advertisements as more of a part of the service than as an unwanted intrusion. Unlike banners and pop-up advertisements, which are routinely ignored or dismissed, users appear more likely to click through these sponsored results (e.g., keyword advertisements). Third, the targeting is based entirely on the current query, and not on demographic data developed over longer periods of time. This kind of targeting is timelier and more palatable to users with privacy concerns. Fourth, these advertisements reach users when they are searching, and therefore when they are more open to visiting new web sites.","Companies, such as Google of Mountain View, Calif, which offers a search engine and Overture of Pasadena, Calif. (now Yahoo Search), which aggregates advertising for search engines as well as offering its own search engine, use an auction mechanism combined with a pay-per-click (PPC) pricing strategy to sell advertising. This model is appealing in its simplicity. Advertisers bid in auctions for placement of their advertisements in connection with particular keywords or keyword combinations. The amount they bid (e.g., cost-per-click (CPC)) is the amount that they are willing to pay for a click-through on their link. For example, in one PPC pricing strategy, if company A bids $1.10 for the keyword combination \u201cbaseball cards\u201d, then its advertisement can be placed above a company bidding $0.95 for the same keyword combination. Only a selected number of bidders' advertisements can be shown. The simplicity of the model makes it easy for an advertiser to understand why an advertisement is shown, and what bid is necessary to have an advertisement shown. It also means that advertisers are charged only for positive click-through responses.","Both Google and Overture offer tools to help users manage their bids. Google uses click-through rate and PPC to estimate an expected rate of return which is then used to dynamically rank the advertisements. Overture uses the PPC pricing strategy to rank advertisements, but monitors the click-through rate for significantly under performing advertisements.","Because Google dynamically ranks the advertisements based on click-through and PPC, advertisers cannot control their exact advertisement position with a fixed PPC. To insure a top position, the advertiser must be willing to pay a different price that is determined by their own click through rate as well as the competitors click-though rates and PPC. Overture uses a fixed price model, which insures fixed position for fixed price.","A number of third parties provide services to Overture customers to identify and select keywords and track and rank bids. For example, BidRank, Dynamic Keyword Bid Maximizer, Epic Sky, GoToast, PPC BidTracker, PPC Pro, Send Traffic, and Sure Hits. There are a small number of pay-per-bid systems. For example, Kanoodle is a traditional pay-per-bid system like Overture. Other examples, include Sprinks and FindWhat.","In the process of bidding in keyword auctions, advertisers may compete in ways that are mutually detrimental. There may be better joint strategies that are less costly, or involve alternative keywords, but the individual bidders do not easily discover these joint strategies. Even when the individual bidders know good joint strategies, the individual bidders may not have a strong incentive to pursue these strategies without some assurance of cooperation.","Conventional keyword bidding is primarily focused on click-through rate and PPC to estimate an expected rate of return for a particular keyword\/advertisement combination. However, these keyword bidding systems have not considered the value of driving traffic to a particular host site and the subsequent activity that may be produced at the host site by that traffic. As a result, keyword bids by some seller\/advertisers may have unrecognized value to the host site.","Thus, a computer-implemented method and system for keyword bidding in a market cooperative are needed.","A computer-implemented method and system for keyword bidding in a market cooperative are disclosed. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known processes, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the clarity of this description.","An example embodiment of a computer-implemented method and system may also be used to manage keyword bidding prices from a market perspective. Initially, a host may develop and maintain a portfolio of keywords for which users can bid. Additionally, a host can search and select desired keywords for the portfolio and cluster the keywords into logical groups based on a variety of dimensional metrics. A data mining process is used to implement keyword affinity scoring. Clustering combines keywords into logical groups or clusters that share a similar behavior with respect to a considered dimension. Keywords from an appropriate cluster can be used to modify an advertising creative. A creative can be a template advertisement or message into which a keyword can be inserted. Sources for clustering techniques include: (1) \u201cex ante\u201d information about a keyword (linguistic similarity, number of words in the keyword phrase, supply-side categorization etc.); (2) performance metrics (costs, clicks, return on investment (ROI), competitor activity, use of item level metrics, etc.); (3) internal sources (e.g., host search query history, host catalogues, host listings parsings, host affiliate query, catalog, and listing information, international search strings, paid search queries, etc.); and (4) external sources (e.g. Googspy, Yahoo buzz, etc.).","The computer-implemented method and system may also determine and use a correlation between different search queries in a single session. The correlation uses information based on the proximity of the different search queries and the subject matter searched in each query. For example, if a user submits a first search query (e.g. \u201cJohn\u201d) and then subsequently in the same session submits a second search query (e.g. \u201cJohn Smith\u201d), a correlation can be drawn between those two keywords. This correlation can be used to form reasonable inferences related to the user behavior; because two related search queries appeared in sequence.","The performance metrics for a particular keyword or keyword cluster include a calculation of the value of user action based on keywords. The effective use of advertising or messaging as related to keyword search queries enables the host to attract user action as a result of keyword based advertising. The effectiveness of a particular keyword or keyword cluster to attract user action is a key performance metric. One measure of this effectiveness is a Revenue per Click (RPC) scoring. If a particular keyword or keyword cluster and a related advertisement or message causes a user to perform an action, e.g., click a link or icon, a certain value for that click through user action can be calculated using and RPC scoring. RPC scoring is based on a predicted value for a given keyword. The keyword scoring concept includes calculating the value of a new user brought in by a specific keyword or keyword cluster. In an example embodiment, as described below, additional data can be used to actually project a value forward in time. For example, a particular click-through might be worth $10 a click yesterday. However, there may be strong evidence the click-through is going to be worth $12 a click tomorrow, because of certain consumer variables that were observed (e.g., the volume of related listings may have skyrocketed, conversion rates may be skyrocketing, and actual sales prices\u2014ASP's) are staying flat). Conversion is the act of a user clicking, responding, or otherwise taking action related to an advertisement or message. These consumer variables suggest that the keyword is going to be worth more tomorrow and into the future. In the example computer-implemented method and system, this forward looking analysis is done with the use of data mining and statistical analysis.","Revenue per Click Prediction Model","Revenue Per Click (RPC) prediction is one building block for keyword scoring and value prediction. For this reason, it is desirable that the model be as accurate as possible. At its core, the example RPC prediction process described herein is a statistical approach to ascribing the likely future revenue for a given click for a given keyword. There can be a large number of potential inputs to this RPC prediction, including: past revenue and past click volumes, COFA (Category of First Activity) for users who have converted on a given word, or the Bid Density by Category for a keyword historically. In the end, a large number of x-variables can be used as inputs to the model while only a few inputs may actually be part of the calculation. However, because the relative weighting of the various variables (and even the variables themselves) is likely to change over time, the example computer-implemented method and system provide an extensible and flexible approach towards the RPC calculations.","To best use the example RPC model, the input data to the RPC model may be updated on a periodic basis, thus incorporating the newest information. This periodic update can be implemented by interfacing the RPC model with the Keyword Selection Module and the Keyword Datamart (KWDM) described herein. The efficiency of the RPC model can also be improved if the RPC model receives warning alerts as soon as possible if there is a problem with the periodic retrieval of RPC model input data.","One theme of the RPC modeling is global scalability, which includes international country-specific models using the same methodology as has been implemented for the RPC model in the US. This implies that the RPC model may be based on readily available data sources in every country. Country-specific RPC models are implemented for individual countries and for individual search engines to improve the regional accuracy of the RPC modeling.","Data Sourcing","As part of the periodic (e.g. daily) input data gathering process, the RPC Predictive Model may pull in keyword\/user\/category data from various internal and external sources that have been identified as potential predictors of a host's keywords' RPC and number of clicks. Various sources for this keyword data can originate. Specifically, the keyword data can originate through the Keyword Testing Complex.","The Keyword Testing Complex is a shorthand name for the sourcing, selecting, adding, reporting, and deleting keywords cycle. The principal aim of this functionality, as described in detail below, is to facilitate the adding of good keywords and deleting of bad ones, provide control and reporting so users can easily run tests to determine the heuristics that matter in keyword selection and retention, and enable the automation of as much of the keyword testing, selection, and retention cycle as possible.","Referring to , a diagram illustrates the main components of the keyword test complex, according to an example embodiment. The keyword test complex  includes a keyword datamart, , a keyword selection module , and a keyword pruning module . The keyword data mart,  includes a sourcing module , a pre-aggregation scrubber , an aggregator , and keyword storage . The components of one embodiment of keyword datamart  are described in detail below.","Sourcing Module","The Keyword Sourcing Module  regularly pulls in keyword data from various internal and external sources that have been identified as potential sources of potentially revenue-generating keywords. Because each data source may have different dimensions and attributes, a generic and extensible data model is required. It is unlikely that many configurations settings or controls may be required to support keyword sourcing. A user of the technology described herein, denoted as a host, can use the Keyword Sourcing Module  to collect an initial unfiltered set of keywords from various sources. The following are some examples of important keyword sources that can be used. It can be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other sources of keywords can similarly be used. Also note that there may likely be additional keyword sources that are important to various companies, organizations, countries or regions.\n\n","As related to RPC modeling, keyword data can be sourced using the Keyword Testing Complex and the Sourcing Module . In addition, other keyword data sources include the following.","Metrics (By Date\/By Keyword):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":["Cost","Revenue","Retention Bidders","Retention Bids","Acquisition Bidders","Acquisition Bids","ACRU's","Clicks","Average Position\n\nKeyword Categorization: (Bid Categorization for Top n categories)\n","Category Percentage Weighting","Site ID","Meta Category","Level 2","Level 3","Level 4","Level 5","Level 6\n\nSearch Categorization for Top n categories\n","Category Percentage Weighting","Site ID","Meta Category","Level 2","Level 3","Level 4","Level 5","Level 6\n\nPrior Month by Category\n","ASP\u2014Actual Sales Price","Conversion Rate","Success Item Count","Revenue\n\nCategory Data\n","External Category Clustering\n\nUser Level:\n","Sets\u2014Retained Bidders, Acquired Users","User","Value","RFM","Zip","CoFA\u2014(Category of First Activity)","Mosaic","Demographic\n\nKeyword Data Aggregation Module (Aggregator)\n"]}}}},"Keywords in the KWDM  may contain various levels of dimension data. For example: 1) global dimensions (e.g. linguistic dimensions), 2) traffic dimensions (internal and external data), 3) clustering dimensions, and 4) source specific metrics. These dimensions are described in more detail below. Because many of these dimensions change from day to day, the aggregator  defines a time period of measurement for each metric. It may not be necessary to repopulate all of these metrics every day for every keyword. A weekly, monthly or quarterly refresh may be sufficient in some cases. A mechanism to track the source (and number of occurrences per source) by keyword is also a desired feature. As examples of dimensions (non-exhaustive):","a. Global Dimensions\n\n","b. Traffic Dimensions\n\n","c. Clustering Dimensions\n\n","d. Source-Specific Dimensions (extensible)\n\n","Referring to , an example of the metrics processed by aggregator  is illustrated. Because many of these statistics change from day to day, the aggregator  documents from what period of time the statistic is taken. It may not be necessary to repopulate all of these statistics every day. A monthly or quarterly refresh may be sufficient. For statistics involving the actual cost and revenue for the trafficked word for the host, the aggregator  incorporates new data with the old data. If a keyword comes in more than once from the same source, the aggregator  can increment the number in the appropriate source column. If the keyword is seen from a new source, the aggregator  increments the relevant source column.","Keyword Selection Module (Selector)","The Keyword Selection Module  is shown in . In one embodiment, there are two ways to select keywords to be added: manually and automatically.","Manual Method\n\n","Automatic Method\n\n","The computer-implemented method and system for keyword bidding disclosed herein provide a set of data-driven controls that allow users to manage keyword bidding prices at the keyword level and at a large scale. The computer-implemented method and system include a rules engine to manage the spend associated with purchasing and managing a keyword portfolio. The data-driven controls include controls to manage spend and high-volume. A few of the features of an example embodiment include the following:\n\n","CPC Bid Optimization of example embodiments described herein is an element to trafficking keywords and ensuring a host is maximizing its return on investment (ROI) on each keyword purchase. Because different search engines have different interfaces, policies, and rules associated with keywords and paid search opportunities, an automated bid optimization system may have to take these search engine-specific differences into account. Below are example considerations for search engine-specific bidding methodologies (e.g. Google and Yahoo!). Based on each search engine's current bidding methodology, specific business rules and a customized RPC Predictive Model has been created as part of the computer-implemented method and system described herein that can enable more efficient CPC bid optimization.","Example Yahoo! Search Marketing Bidding Strategy","Sample Components:\n\n","Input A:\n\n","Input B:\n\n","Input C:\n\n","Based on a current scaled TPC (target per click) value, use the Competitor Bid Landscape to determine a Bid value, Deviation=abs[TPC\u2212CPC] ($), and the position\u00b11,\u00b12 relative to our current position. The TPC is a desired bid value the advertiser is willing to pay. Clearly, the advertiser seeks to optimize the TPC so the lowest value is paid while retaining an acceptable level of user click-throughs. The current position corresponds to a location on a search results page relative to the position of other advertiser's (competitors) on the same page in relation to the same keyword. Typically, a search engine can position a highest bidder's advertisement at the top (or in the position most likely to attract user click-throughs) of the search results page. The next highest bidder's advertisement is positioned just below the highest bidder's advertisement. This ranking continues until there is no space left on the search results page or the number of advertisements exceeds a search engine's maximum. In this manner, the search engine's advertisement placement corresponds to keyword bid values and the corresponding number of expected user click-throughs. As is well known, a search engine is paid the bid value by the advertiser for each user click-through.","For example, take the keyword example \u201cmaple wood\u201d. The bid landscape tells us that we are currently paying $0.27 for position 3. \u201cPosition \u22121\u201d places us in position 2 (a better position than position 3 in terms of the number of expected user click-throughs) with a maximum bid of $0.27 and the deviation of \u02dc$0.03 from our scaled TPC of \u02dc$0.25. \u201cPosition \u22122\u201d places us in position 1 (a better position than position 2 in terms of the number of expected user click-throughs) with a maximum bid of $0.28 and the deviation of $0.04 from our scaled TPC.","Using the bidding logic shown above, these metrics are determined for the two positions above and below the current position. From there, the minimum deviation is selected from the four surrounding positions. Once the optimal gap is determined, a new maximum CPC is determined based on the following:","If the Minimum Deviation lands the keyword between position 1 and 2, [new CPC=scaled TPC]","If the Minimum Deviation lands the keyword between positions>2, [new CPC=CPC\u2212$0.01] or the default minimum of $0.10.","In all cases, the [CPC=CPC+$0.01] and [CPC=TPC*(1+X)], where X=scalable margin.  illustrates an example of the parameters generated as a result of the process described above for a sample Yahoo bidding strategy.","Output:","Using the process described above, parameters are generated for a sample Yahoo bidding strategy. These parameters can be used to create the XML syntax to make the appropriate CPC changes through the API.","Example Google Bidding Strategy","Sample Components:\n\n","Input A:\n\n","Input B:\n\n","Input C:\n\n","Based on a current scaled TPC (target per click) value, use the previous day's CPCand previous day's keyword-level data to calculate:\n\n[$ Deviation]=[TPC\u2212CPC]\u2003\u2003A.\n\n[% Deviation]=[$ Deviation]\/TPC\u2003\u2003B.\n\nCalculated CPC=(1+% Deviation)\u00d7[previous day's CPC]\u2003\u2003C.\n\nCPC=TPC*(1)], where =scalable margin\u2003\u2003D.\n","The new CPCmay be calculated based on the following logic:\n\nIf (),CPC\n\nOtherwise, If (previous day's CPC)>1.5,CPC=min()\n\nElse If (previous day's CPC)\u22661.5,CPC,previous day's CPC\n","New CPCmay be bounded by the following rules:\n\n","For example, take the keyword example \u201clongaberger pottery\u201d and the corresponding sample parameters below.\n\n","Based on the bidding logic above, since (A\u2260n\/a) and [(previous day's CPC)\u22661.5] is true, then:\n\nCPC=min(,previous day's CPC)=min(0.85,0.77)=0.77\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0257"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"Output:","Using the process described above, parameters are generated for a sample Google bidding strategy. These parameters, including the new CPC, can be used to execute the corresponding bid changes through Google's API.","Other Bidding Strategies","Variations of the bidding processes described above can be used to support other search engines. Further, a generic version of the bidding optimizer described herein can output or export a flat file for manual loading on other platforms. In addition, variations of the bidding processes described above can include time of day\/hour optimization and demographic targeting.","Automatic Bid Control Management",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0261"},"figref":"FIGS. 8-12"},"Match Type Automation","The Match Type Automation functionality provided in the computer-implemented method and system described herein enables a host to automate the decision-making process as to which keywords to buy on the different Match Types offered by the conventional search engines (e.g. Advanced\/Standard match types on Overture, and Broad\/Phrase\/Exact match types on Google).","In particular, the functionality of the present computer-implemented method and system automates the decision-making related to:\n\n","In addition, the functionality of the present computer-implemented method and system also provides additional functionality. When submitting keywords to buy on a search engine, the user can specify the desired Match Type. The user can check the Match Type status of any keyword, list of keywords, or keyword cluster at any time. The user can also manually change the Match Type status of any keyword, list of keywords, or keyword cluster at any time. When an embodiment is about to switch some existing keywords from an Advanced match type to a Standard match type, the embodiment generates a report specifying the list of keywords that have been recommended to be switched over to Standard Match. The embodiment advises the user of the recommended changes prior to trafficking the changes. An example embodiment also allows the user to switch from Advanced to Standard match type automatically on a periodic basis (e.g. monthly). Alternatively, the match type switching can be configured to occur only after being accepted by the user, in the event the user wishes to review the recommended list of words first. This would enable the ability to override recommendations.","Some conventional keyword processing systems store even the slightest differences in user queries as distinct queries\/records. For example, two phrases may have the same keywords, but one may have an additional space in the keyword string. Conventional systems create distinct records for these keyword variations even though these variations would be considered the same keyword in some conventional search engines (e.g. Overture's Match Driver Logic), thus triggering the display of the same advertisements. Thus, it is beneficial to be able to mimic the Match Driver Logic of a particular search engine to the extent possible. The following pre-processing actions can be implemented to increase the likelihood that the keyword processing can mimic the operation of the Match Driver Logic of a particular search engine.\n\n","The following actions can be used in various embodiments to process user queries and related keywords for various conventional search engines.\n\n","A particular example embodiment includes an advertising platform, allowing sellers on a host site to buy and create advertisements for their items for sale and their stores selling items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0305"},"figref":"FIG. 13-15"},"Advertiser Portal ()\u2014End user facing application.

These features can include: 1) Keyword Bidding by Category, and 2) Category Moniker.","In a particular embodiment of the Keyword Bidding by Category functionality, the association of keywords and category can build an affinity between keywords and categories. This affinity can be used to create an ad format with bidding on keyword & category level. \u2018Category\u2019 functionality can extend to other grouping functions, linked with host content including a host category hierarchy. In a particular embodiment of the Keyword Bidding by Category functionality, an example method can include the following operations:\n\n","In a particular embodiment of the Category Moniker functionality, an example method can include the following operations:\n\n","In view of the keyword bidding and advertising system described above, a particular embodiment can provide a computer-implemented method and system for keyword bidding in a market cooperative. As described above, based on a seller\/advertiser's keyword bidding, a seller\/advertiser's corresponding advertisements are trafficked to 3party content provider sites, such as search engine providers (e.g., Google, Yahoo!, or MSN) and displayed to users at the content provider sites in a manner corresponding to the seller's\/advertiser's keyword bid and the content provider's advertising protocol. In this manner, the seller\/advertiser can control the exposure of the seller\/advertiser's ads on the particular content provider site. Typically, a higher bid for a particular keyword results in a more favorable positioning of the related advertisement and thus a higher conversion rate. Users of the content provider site(s) can subsequently search for content on the content provider site(s) using search keywords that may correspond to the keywords on which the seller\/advertiser previously placed a bid. In that case, advertising of the seller\/advertiser that corresponds to the search keyword(s) is shown to the user at the content provider site. If the user at the content provider site then clicks on (or otherwise performs an action on) the advertising of the seller\/advertiser, the seller\/advertiser gets the benefit of the user action as the user is typically directed to a webpage (e.g., a landing page) associated with the seller\/advertiser. In return for this benefit of user action on the seller\/advertiser's ad, the seller\/advertiser pays the keyword bid amount to the content provider site for serving the ad. The seller\/advertiser can determine the value of the user's action on the advertising of the seller\/advertiser by tracking the activity of the user to determine if the user subsequently performs a revenue-producing action for the seller\/advertiser. Over time and using some of the revenue per click (RPC) modeling techniques described herein, the seller\/advertiser can more accurately predict the optimal keyword bid value given an expected RPC resulting from a given keyword\/advertisement configured for a particular content provider site.","As described herein, a host site may provide and perform services for a seller\/advertiser including managing the keyword bidding process for a particular seller\/advertiser. This keyword bidding management service provides many benefits for the seller\/advertiser, including, keyword clustering, automated keyword bidding, performance metrics calculations, and other functions as described herein. However, a particular embodiment also provides a market cooperative (co-op) benefit as described next.","As described above, a seller\/advertiser (or a host managing keyword bidding for the seller\/advertiser) can determine an expected RPC associated with a particular keyword using various embodiments. This expected RPC is based on the value accruing to the seller\/advertiser as a result of user action produced by the keyword. However, at the same time that user action produced by the keyword is creating value for the seller\/advertiser, the same user action can also be creating value for the host, which is managing keyword bidding for the seller\/advertiser. For example, as a result of the user action produced by the keyword and related advertisement, the user at the content provider site may be redirected to a seller\/advertiser listing or landing page managed by the host. If the user subsequently makes a purchase or otherwise completes a transaction with the seller\/advertiser on the host site, both the seller\/advertiser and the host can receive value from the user's transaction. In this situation, the host can benefit when the user completes a transaction with the seller\/advertiser. Therefore, the host has an incentive to do what it can to improve the likelihood that the user completes the commercial transaction while the host is managing the seller\/advertiser's keyword bidding.","One way for the host to improve the likelihood that the user completes a transaction with the seller\/advertiser on the host site is for the host to add value to the seller\/advertiser's bid for particular keywords (keyword bid augmentation). If the host adds value to the seller\/advertiser's bid for a keyword thereby increasing the value of the keyword bid, the higher value keyword bid is likely to improve the positioning of the seller\/advertiser's corresponding ad on the content provider's site and thereby improve the likelihood that a user will perform an action on the ad (denoted a conversion rate improvement). Thus, a host can benefit from adding value to the seller\/advertiser's bid for particular keywords. The host can also quantify the value it expects to receive as a result of adding value to the seller\/advertiser's keyword bids.","In various embodiments, the host can use historical data and predictive data to quantify or predict the expected value of a user conversion (e.g., user action on an advertisement) on a seller\/advertiser's advertisement that relates to a keyword on which the host managed the keyword bidding for the seller\/advertiser. For example, the historical data can include data associated with other user conversions on the same or similar keywords, other user conversions on the same or similar advertisements, other user conversions for the same seller\/advertiser, other user conversions for similar products\/services, and the like. Many other data items related to historical, transactional, product\/service, and user information can be captured by the host and used to correlate user conversions with keyword\/advertisement combinations. Once enough data is collected, predictive modeling can be used to extrapolate expected conversion rates and resulting RPC values for various keyword\/advertisement combinations. When this predictive data is generated, the host can determine an amount of value that can be added to a seller\/advertiser's keyword bid to produce a predicted amount of value return to the host. Thus, the host can augment the seller\/advertiser's keyword bid by this amount in a market co-op arrangement to increase the resulting value for both the seller\/advertiser and the host. An example of this arrangement is illustrated in .","Referring now to , a diagram illustrates the flow of activities in an example embodiment of the market cooperative arrangement. In the example shown, a seller\/advertiser  submits a bid for a keyword or keyword group to a host service . In this example, the seller\/advertiser's keyword bid is valued, for example, at $X. This can be a maximum bid amount. As described above, the host service  can use various modeling techniques along with historical and predictive data to compute an expected value (EV) of the seller\/advertiser's keyword bid to the host. This expected value (EV) is related to the value to the host  of a user conversion on the seller\/advertiser's advertisement corresponding to the keyword upon which the bid was placed. Given this expected value (EV) computation, the host  can determine a value $Y, for example, by which the seller\/advertiser's keyword bid can be augmented. This can be a maximum bid augmentation amount. The host service  can then augment the seller\/advertiser's keyword bid $X by adding in the host-contributed value $Y based on the expected value (EV) of the keyword bid to the host . The augmented keyword bid $X+$Y can then be submitted to one or more content provider sites, such as search engines  as the keyword bid submittal by a market cooperative including the seller\/advertiser  and the host service . This submitted bid can be considered a maximum bid amount.","Referring still to , the augmented keyword bid $X+$Y received by the one or more search engines  causes the one or more search engines  to configure the seller\/advertiser's associated advertisement to appear in a particular location on a search engine's  web page, the particular location corresponding to the value of the augmented keyword bid $X+$Y in comparison to other bids received from other advertisers for the same keyword. However, the particular position on a search engine's  web page assigned to the seller\/advertiser's associated advertisement is a more favorable location compared to a location that the seller\/advertiser's associated advertisement would have been assigned if the seller\/advertiser's bid had only been for a value of $X without the augmented value of $Y provided by the host . Given the more favorable advertising location enabled by the augmented keyword bid $X+$Y, the seller\/advertiser  and the host  can expect a more favorable conversion rate and a higher RPC from the search engines . Note that the actual traffic value corresponding to the ad may be less than the maximum augmented keyword bid $X+$Y. As shown in , user action (e.g. click-through activity) on the seller\/advertiser's associated advertisement on the search engine's  web page can cause the user to be redirected to a host  web page, because the host  is responsible for managing the seller\/advertiser's listing and\/or landing page. As such, the host  receives value from the user's presence on the host  site. In some cases, the user may click through on a seller\/advertiser's product\/service listing and complete a commercial transaction with the seller\/advertiser . In this case, both the seller\/advertiser  and the host  receive value for the completed commercial transaction. In other cases, the user may click through to other host site  web pages and\/or listings that are not connected with the seller\/advertiser . In some cases, the user may find a web page and\/or listing of interest on the host site  and complete a commercial transaction on an item that is not connected with the seller\/advertiser . In this case, the host  receives value for the completed commercial transaction but the particular seller\/advertiser  does not. In each of these cases, the host  receives value from the user's presence on the host  site as enabled by the augmented keyword bid provided by the host  as part of a market cooperative embodiment described herein.","As a result of the user click through on the seller\/advertiser's product\/service listing or ad, the corresponding search engine  will charge a traffic value to the host . The actual traffic value corresponding to the ad may be equal to or less than the maximum augmented keyword bid $X+$Y. If the actual traffic value corresponding to the ad is equal to the maximum augmented keyword bid $X+$Y, the host  pays $Y to the corresponding search engine  and the seller\/advertiser  pays $X to the corresponding search engine , or to the host  as a proxy for the corresponding search engine . If the actual traffic value corresponding to the ad is less than the maximum augmented keyword bid $X+$Y, the host  and the seller\/advertiser  pay pro-rated shares of the actual traffic value based on the ratio of their bid amounts $Y and $X.","In some embodiments, it may be beneficial for the seller\/advertiser to have the seller\/advertiser's ads trafficked to a variety of content provider sites, instead of just one or a few. In this manner, advertisements can be exposed to a greater number or more diverse group of consumers who visit a group of content provider sites. To offer seller\/advertisers additional impressions from these other sources, a host can expand its market cooperative with a variety of content provider sites and with a variety of seller\/advertisers. As part of this expanded market co-op, the advertising infrastructure described above can be used to traffic seller\/advertiser's ads to a variety of 3party content providers, such as search engine providers (e.g., Google, Yahoo!, and MSN) and other content providers engaged in keyword auctioning and advertising. Seller\/advertisers can have the option to opt-in or out of this market cooperative functionality on a campaign basis. In some cases, the host can subsidize the seller\/advertiser CPC's from a host budget. As described above, the environment in which an embodiment operates includes capabilities for sending and receiving information via application programming interfaces (API's). As such, the initial keyword bid can be obtained from the seller\/advertiser via an API. Also, the augmented keyword bid can be submitted to the content provider via an API.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0284","num":"0786"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["3310","3315","3320","3325","3330"]},"Referring now to , a diagram illustrates the network environment in which an example embodiment may operate.
