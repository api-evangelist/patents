title: User interface gestures and methods for providing file sharing functionality
abstract: Methods and devices provide a gesture activated file sharing functionality enabling users to share files with other nearby computing devices. The file sharing functionality may include establishing wireless links with nearby devices and determine their relative locations. The computing device may detect a file sharing gesture and transmit files to or request files from a nearby device in response to the gesture. Base on gesture parameters, e.g., direction, speed and shape, and computing device attitude parameters, e.g., tilt angle and pointing direction, the computing device may identify a targeted device to which a file may be transmitted. The computing device may request user verification of the identified device and send a request to transmit files to the targeted device. The computing devices may transmit files using networks and addresses provided over the device-to-device communication links.

This application cross-references and fully incorporates by reference concurrently filed U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/578,905, entitled \u201cDevice Movement User Interface Gestures for File Sharing Functionality.\u201d","The present invention relates generally to computer user interface systems and more particularly to a gesture based user interface for activating a file sharing function.","Personal electronic devices (e.g. cell phones, PDAs, laptops, gaming devices, etc.) provide users with increasing functionality and data storage. In addition to serving as personal organizers, personal electronic devices serve to store documents, photographs, videos, and music, and serve as portals to the Internet and electronic mail. These devices allow users to communicate with other users and share stored files, such as documents, pictures or videos with other mobile device users. Today, mobile devices allow users to share files by employing different methods such as emailing, texting (e.g., SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), and near field communication (NFC). However, these file sharing methods are limiting, cumbersome, and time consuming. Drafting and sending an email requires a large amount of typing. The sender must know and enter an email address before sending a message. To send SMS or MMS messages, senders must know the recipient phone number. To use the internet for uploading or downloading files, the users must know a URL and visit a website. To use NFC, the senders and recipients of files must be in very close proximity.","The various aspects include methods for sharing files among computing devices, including activating a file sharing functionality, discovering nearby computing devices, establishing a wireless link with the discovered computing devices, determining locations of the discovered nearby computing devices, detecting a file sharing gesture, identifying a targeted computing device based on the detected file sharing gesture, and transmitting a file sharing message to the targeted computing device. The wireless link may be established using a wireless technology selected from Bluetooth\u00ae, ZigBee\u00ae, Near Field Communication (NFC), wide-area-wireless IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), infrared (IrDA), and ultrasound. In an aspect, determining locations of the discovered nearby computing devices may include receiving location coordinates provided by Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers in each of the discovered nearby computing devices via the established wireless link, and transmitting the file sharing message to the targeted computing device may be accomplished using a wireless technology different from the wireless technology used to establish the wireless link. In an aspect, determining locations of the discovered nearby computing device may include determining a difference in arrival times of signals received from the discovered nearby computing devices using a first and second antennae, and using triangulation calculations based on the determined difference in arrival times of signals to determine a direction to each of the discovered nearby computing devices. In a further aspect, determining locations of the nearby discovered computing device may include receiving location coordinates provided by GPS receivers in each of the discovered nearby computing devices, and comparing the received location coordinates to location coordinates from a GPS receiver. In a further aspect, detecting a file sharing gesture may include detecting one of a flick gesture and a hand gesture. In a further aspect, identifying the targeted computing device may include determining a shape of the detected file sharing gesture, determining a direction and speed of the detected file sharing gesture, calculating a location where an object would land based on the determined shape, direction and speed of the detected file sharing gesture, and comparing the calculated location to the determined locations of the nearby discovered computing devices to identify a computing device closest to the calculated location where an object would land. In a further aspect, identifying the targeted computing device may include determining a tilt angle of the computing device, determining a direction and speed of the detected file sharing gesture, calculating a location where an object would land based on the determined tilt angle, direction and speed of the detected file sharing gesture, and comparing the calculated location to the determined locations of the nearby discovered computing devices to identify a computing device closest to the calculated location where an object would land.","In a further aspect, transmitting a file sharing message may include transmitting a selected file to the targeted computing device, and the method may further include transmitting a request to transmit the file to the targeted computing device, and receiving a response from the targeted computing device including access data specifying an address to which the file should be transmitted, in which transmitting the file to the targeted computing device may include determining a wireless communication link over which the file should be transmitted based upon the address specified in the received access data, and transmitting the file to the address via the determined wireless communication link. In a further aspect, the request to transmit the file to the target computing device may be accomplished using the established wireless link, and the determined wireless communication link used to transmit the file uses a wireless technology that is different than the established wireless link technology. In a further aspect, transmitting a file sharing message may include transmitting a selected file to the targeted computing device, and the method may further include displaying a prompt for a user verification of the targeted computing device, and determining whether a user input indicates user verification of the targeted computing device, in which transmitting the file to the targeted computing device may be accomplished if the user input indicates user verification of the targeted computing device. In a further aspect, displaying a prompt for a user verification the targeted computing device may include receiving a user identifier from discovered computing devices via the established wireless link, using the received user identifier to obtain an image from a contact database, and displaying an obtained image as the prompt for the user verification of the targeted computing device.","In another aspect, the method may further include displaying a launch pad on a touchscreen user interface, in which detecting a file sharing gesture may be accomplished by comparing a touch event start point or an end point to the displayed launch pad.","In another aspect, the method may further include displaying a radar map image including graphical indicators for the determined relative locations of the discovered nearby computing devices. In a further aspect, transmitting a file sharing message comprises transmitting a message requesting the targeted computing device to transmit a file. In another aspect, the method may further include transmitting access data to the targeted computing device in which the access data includes an address to which the requested file should be transmitted.","In another aspect the method may further include determining whether the detected file sharing gesture includes a curved path, and identifying the targeted computing device may include selecting a computing device positioned behind another computing device relative. In another aspect, the method may further include determining whether the detected file sharing gesture is directed away from other computing devices, and calculating an indirect path based on the direction of the file sharing gesture and an edge of the computing device display, in which identifying the targeted computing device may be based upon the calculated indirect path and the determined locations of the discovered nearby computing devices.","Another aspect is a mobile device that includes a processor, a display coupled to the processor, a touch sensitive surface coupled to the processor, a memory coupled to the processor, and at least one wireless transceiver coupled to the processor, in which the processor is configured with processor-executable instructions to perform operations of the various aspect methods.","Another aspect is a mobile device that includes means for accomplishing the functions involved in the operations of the various aspect methods.","Another aspect is a computer program product including a computer-readable medium storing computer-executable instructions including at least one instruction for accomplishing the processes of involved in the various aspect methods.","The various aspects will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. References made to particular examples and implementations are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention or the claims.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any implementation described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.","The term \u201cflick gesture\u201d is used herein to mean a linear or curved touch gesture that is traced in one direction on a touchscreen user interface.","As used herein, a \u201ctouchscreen\u201d is a touch sensing input device or a touch sensitive input device with an associated image display. As used herein, a \u201ctouchpad\u201d is a touch sensing input device without an associated image display. A touchpad can be implemented on any surface of an electronic device outside the image display area. Touchscreens and touchpads are generically referred to herein as a \u201ctouch surface.\u201d Touch surfaces may be integral parts of an electronic device, such as a touchscreen display, or may be a separate module, such as a touchpad, that can be coupled to the electronic device by a wired or wireless data link. The terms touchscreen, touchpad and touch surface may be used interchangeably hereinafter.","As used herein, the terms \u201cpersonal electronic device,\u201d \u201ccomputing device,\u201d and \u201cportable computing device\u201d refer to any one or all of cellular telephones, personal data assistants (PDA's), palm-top computers, notebook computers, personal computers, wireless electronic mail receivers, cellular telephone receivers (e.g., the Blackberry\u00ae and Treo\u00ae devices), multimedia Internet enabled cellular telephones (e.g., the Blackberry Storm\u00ae), and similar electronic devices which include a programmable processor, memory, a transceiver for communicating with a network (e.g., a wireless network), and a connected or integral touch surface or other pointing device (e.g., a computer mouse). In an example aspect used to illustrate various aspects of the present invention, the electronic device is a cellular telephone including an integral touchscreen display. However, this aspect is present merely as one example implementation of the various aspects, and as such is not intended to exclude other possible implementations of the subject matter recited in the claims.","As used herein a \u201ctouch event\u201d refers to a detected user input on a touch surface which may include information regarding location or relative location of the touch. For example, on a touchscreen or touchpad user interface device, a touch event refers to the detection of a user touching the device and may include information regarding the location on the device being touched.","As used herein the term \u201cpath\u201d refers to a sequence of touch event locations that trace a path within a graphical user interface (GUI) display during a touch event. Also, as used herein the term \u201cpath event\u201d refers to a detected user input on a touch surface, which traces a path during a touch event. A path event may include information regarding the locations or relative locations (e.g., within a GUI display) of the touch events which constitute the traced path.","With the advances in electronic technologies, computing devices are increasingly used to store and share personal data. Pictures, movies, emails, URLs, applications, contacts, and text messages are examples of data that users store and share with other computing devices. A variety of available file sharing methods are currently available which allow users to share files via a variety of wired and wireless communication networks. For example, emails are delivered in Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams via wired and wireless (e.g., WiFi and cellular data networks) to email addresses; Short Messaging Service (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messages are delivered via cellular telephone networks to device phone numbers; downloaded files and webpages from websites accessed at an IP address are delivered via wired and wireless networks; data can be exchanged between two computing devices via short range Bluetooth wireless communication links; and data can be communicated over very short distances using Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies.","Despite the variety of communication links available to transfer information among computing devices, current user interface systems require users to enter information that has no perceptual connection with the physical world, such as email addresses, telephone numbers or IP addresses. Those more intuitive interfaces, such as allowing users to share files by tracing a finger gesture on the touchscreen of a computing device as provided on the Bump and Move file sharing applications for the Apple iPhone\u00ae, require that all communicating devices be within the same network and require a server and internet connection to help pair sender and receiver. In sum, known methods for sharing files among computing devices are either not intuitive, or are limited to particular networks.","The methods and systems of the various aspects allow users to be cognitively and physically involved with communicating data (i.e., sharing files) by linking the file transfer functionality to gestures that have intuitive meaning. In the natural world, delivery of objects occurs when cognitive intention and physical effort combine to allow carrying of an object from one person to another. In the various aspects, the processes of transmitting files are tied to user physical actions which mimic actions that would be implemented if the files of nearby computing devices were physical objects. Computing devices may gather information about the presence and relative location of other nearby computing devices. Such presence data may include the location parameters (e.g., GPS coordinates) and access data (e.g., telephone number or email address) of nearby computing devices. Similar to how one might send a piece of paper to another by flicking it to the other person with a rapid finger movement, the various aspects allow users to select a file, determine the physical location of the targeted computing devices, and transmit the file to other computing devices using an intuitive physical action such as a flick gesture. Similarly, the various aspects may allow a computing device to request transmission of files from another computing device by using a self-directed stroke gesture.","The file sharing functionality of the various aspects may be implemented on any type of touch surface. In a particularly useful application, the touch surface is a touchscreen that is touched by a finger; since touchscreens are generally superimposed on a display image, it enables users to interact with the display image with the touch of a finger. In such applications, the user interacts with an image by touching the touchscreen with a finger and tracing a gesture, thus the user's finger activating the touchscreen serves as the pointing device. Touchscreen touch events acquisition (i.e., detection of a finger touch on a touchscreen) and processing are well known, such as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,323,846, the entire contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 3-6"],"b":["100","100","102","102"]},"In method  at block , the computing device implementing the file sharing functionality may enable the user to identify a file to be shared with another computing device. For example, the user interface may present a menu, list, or thumbnail display of files from which the user can select a file by, for example, touching it on a touchscreen display. Any known method of selecting a file may be used.","In method  at block , activation of the file sharing functionality may prompt the computing device to discover nearby computing devices using a wireless communication link by using, for example, Bluetooth\u00ae or ZigBee\u00ae wireless communication technologies. Depending on the type of wireless communication technology used to establish a wireless communication link with nearby computing devices, the computing device may discover other computing devices located at relatively close distances. For example, a computing device configured with a Bluetooth\u00ae transceiver may be configured to discover the presence of like-equipped computing devices located within about 100 meters, depending on the Bluetooth power class employed. Bluetooth\u00ae is a standard communications protocol primarily designed for low power consumption, short range (power-class-dependent: 1 meter, 10 meters, 100 meters) communications between devices equipped with low-cost transceiver microchips. Bluetooth\u00ae makes it possible for these devices to communicate with each other when they are within range. As is well known, the Bluetooth\u00ae communication protocol, like other short range wireless communication protocols (e.g., the ZigBee\u00ae and NFC protocols), provides for automatic device discovery and link establishment signaling. This automatic link establishment capability includes a set of transmissions at a predefined frequency and with a predefined format that are recognized by receiving devices, prompting the receiving devices to reply with signals that enable the two devices to commence wireless link establishment handshaking communications to establish a wireless communication link between them. The various aspects leverage such automatic device discovery and wireless communication link establishment capabilities to enable a computing device to locate other nearby computing devices. Since the computing devices use radio frequency (RF) communications to discover each other, the two computing devices do not have to be in line of sight of to enable file transfers between them.","As part of discovering nearby computing devices, at block  the computing device may receive the locations of the nearby computing devices using different methods. In one aspect, the computing device may determine the location of nearby computing devices in block  by receiving precise latitude and longitude coordinates of the nearby computing devices from Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers within the computing devices. In another aspect, the computing device may determine the relative location of the nearby computing devices at block  by using signal strength and time-of-arrival information from received RF signals and triangulation calculations, as described more fully below with reference to .","Optionally, at block , the computing device may map the locations of nearby computing devices and display the map in a display GUI once the relative locations of nearby computing devices are determined. The mapped locations of nearby computing devices may be displayed relative to the position of the computing device, such as in a radar map type display showing locations of nearby computing devices with graphical indicators (e.g., dots). An example of such a radar map display is shown in , which is described more fully below. The display GUI may also include other graphics for guiding the user while utilizing the file sharing functionality. For example, a \u201claunch pad\u201d graphic may be presented to provide an area in which the user can trace different gestures for sharing files.","Once the file sharing functionality is activated and the locations of nearby computing devices are determined, at block  the computing device may determine whether a user wishes to share the selected file with another computing device by detecting a file transfer gesture. As described more fully herein, the computing device may be configured to detect and recognize a file transfer gesture based upon user touches on a touchscreen or touch surface of the computing device.","According to the various aspects, different file transfer gestures may be employed to initiate the transmission of files between computing devices. Such gestures may include finger gestures and hand gestures. Finger gestures may include gestures that are traced on the device's touchscreen display. Hand gestures may include opening all fingers on the touchscreen like petals of a flower to send files all nearby computing devices or closing fingers together to receive files from all nearby computing devices. Each of these file transfer gestures may be used to initiate transmission of data between computing devices as described in more details below with reference to . For example, to share a file with another device, a user may use a flick gesture in the direction of another device to provide the computer device with the information it requires to identify the intended recipient of the file and initiate the transmission of the selected file to the intended computing device.","At block  the computing device may identify targeted particular nearby computing device to which the user intends to send the selected file based upon information regarding the file transfer gesture, such as its direction, distance, speed, etc., the orientation of computing device, such as its compass heading and tilt angle, and the relative location of nearby computing devices.","A computing device may be equipped with different sensors that can provide information that the device processor can use to calculate a trajectory or direction to identify the nearby computing devices that are to receive the selected file. For example, the computing device may include a compass to determine the orientation of the computing device with respect to the direction of a gesture. As another example, the computing device may include a set of accelerometers that can provide gravity vector data, which the processor can use to determine the tilt angle of the computing device.","Optionally, at block  the computing device may be configured to prompt a user to confirm or authorize sharing the selected file with the targeted computing device. Also at block  the computing device may receive a message from the targeted recipient computing device, indicating whether the device will accept the file. Providing a verification and\/or authorization process enables a user to confirm that the intended recipient's computing device has been selected, and enables intended recipients to decide whether to accept a file. Such measures may prevent transmission of files to the wrong computing device, and give recipient users control over the files that are transmitted to their computing devices. Instead of transmitting an authorization message, a targeted computing device may simply provide the requesting computing device with communication access data, such as Bluetooth identification, email address, or telephone number which can be used to complete the file transfer.","On the receiver side, authorization to receive a file may be enabled in a variety of ways. For example, a user may configure their computing device to always accept file transmissions from nearby computing devices. In another example, when a computing device receives a request to receive a file, the device processor may generate a prompt that alerts the device's user of the pending file transfer request and, optionally, the identity of the user sending the file and file name or type. An intended recipient user may then press a key or virtual key on the GUI to either accept or decline transfer of the file. In a further example, a user may set an authorization state that automatically accepts file sharing with certain known computing devices, such as those in a contact database, and requires user input to authorize file transfers from unknown computing devices. Such file transfer acceptance criteria may be defined in custom settings based on their preferences.","As part of discovering nearby computing devices at block  or receiving authorization to transmit files at block , the recipient computing device may provide access data that the transmitting computing device uses to accomplish a file transmission. Such access data may include an address of the recipient computer device, such as a telephone number (for SMS or MMS messages), email address, or IP address that the transmitting computing device can use to address the file for transmission. The access data may also identify a preferred communication method and communication network to be used for transmitting the file. For example, the receiving device may identify that the file may be transmitted via a direct communication link, such as an NFC, Bluetooth or WiFi direct communication link. Alternatively, the receiving device may identify that the file may be transmitted via an indirect communication network, such as a cellular data communication link or WiFi communication link to a server (e.g., an e-mail server). Additionally as part of the discovery and\/or authorization processes (blocks  and\/or ) the transmitting and intended recipient computing devices may negotiate a mutually acceptable communication network to use for the file transfer.","Once the intended recipient computing device is identified, and transfer of the file is verified and\/or authorized, at block  the computing device may transmit the selected file to the targeted device using identified access data and communication network.","As shown in the communication network diagram of , a communication network  may include computing devices -that are configured communicate with one another using a short range wireless communication link , such as a Bluetooth\u00ae wireless communication link. The computing devices -can also communicate with a cellular communication network  via wireless communication links  between the devices and a cellular base station . Such a cellular communication network  may be a cellular telephone network, or a WiFi hotspot network coupled to the Internet . Depending on the type of files, the short range wireless communication link  available, and the access data provided, the computing devices -may share files directly from one device to the other, through device-to-device wireless links (e.g., Bluetooth\u00ae or NFC communication link), and\/or indirectly, such as via a cellular system (SMS or MMS) or via a wireless link to the Internet (e.g., via a webpage or an email server ). For example, the computing devices -which can establish Bluetooth\u00ae links with one another may exchange access data and files directly using a Bluetooth\u00ae communication link. As another example, computing devices -may exchange access data via Bluetooth\u00ae links, and when access data specifies a telephone number for transmitting a file, the computing devices -may transmit a selected file as an SMS or MMS message transmitted via a cellular telephone access point  to a cellular network . The cellular network relays the SMS\/MMS message to the recipient device via the cellular access point . When access data exchanged between computing devices -includes an email address, a transmitting computing device may transmit a selected file via email by transmitting the email to an email server  via the cellular access point  to the cellular network , which relays the email message via the Internet . The email server  may receive the email, identify the intended recipient, and deliver it to the intended computing device or via the Internet  to the cellular network  which transmits it via the cellular access point .","While the foregoing examples described transmitting files via a cellular telephone network, messages may similarly be transmitted via another type of wireless communication network, such as a WiFi, WiMax or MiFi network. Further, the computing devices -may be configured to select among a number of alternative wireless networks (e.g., cellular, WiFi and MiFi) based upon a variety of factors, including signal strength, reliability, cost, and access rights. Further, files transmitted by one computing device via one wireless network may be received the recipient computing device via a different wireless network. For example, a transmitting computing device may transmit a selected file to a recipient device e-mail address via cellular telephone data communication link, but the recipient computing device may receive the e-mail from its e-mail server via a local WiFi wireless hotspot coupled to the Internet. The methods by which messages are routed through external networks and the Internet are well known, and thus not described further herein.","The various aspects are also not limited to radio frequency wireless communications, as the communication among mobile devices may be accomplished via visible or infrared light or ultrasound. For example, the messages employed in the various aspects may be transmitted via infrared data links using well known technologies, such as the infrared transceivers included in some mobile device models. As another example, the messages employed in the various aspects may be transmitted via visible light, such as a small projector on one mobile device (e.g. a \u201cpico projector\u201d) that may be aimed at a camera on a second mobile device to exchange images. As a further example, future mobile devices that may be equipped with ultrasound emitters and receivers may be configured to use ultrasound to communicate data across short distances in a manner similar to radio frequency communications.","Representative communications that occur between different components of the communication network described above with reference to  are illustrated in . A computing device that has its file transfer functionality activated may discover nearby computing device by sending a device discovery signal, message . The other computing device , upon receiving the device discovery signal, may transmit a response message . The device discovery and response signals may include device identifying information about the computing devices , to enable the devices to negotiate a communication link, messages . The device discovery, response, and handshaking message formats will be defined by the particular communication protocol used for the device-to-device communications (e.g., Bluetooth\u00ae). As part of the response or handshaking messages  or , the replying computing device may provide information about the device, such as its access data, its location (e.g., in the form of GPS coordinates) and, optionally, information about its owner such as a name or picture of the owner. Based on a detected gesture, the sending computing device may determine that the user desires to share a particular file with a targeted computing device . To accomplish a file transmission, the sending computing device may send a query, message , to the targeted computing device requesting permission to transmit the file and access data for use in sending the file. Based on the preferences of its owner and in response to the query message  received from the transmitting computing device , the targeted computing device may respond by transmitting the requested access data, message .","If the access data sent to the transmitting computing device specifies that the file should be transmitted via the established device-to-device communication link (e.g., a Bluetooth\u00ae link), the transmitting computing device may directly transmit the file to the targeted computing device in message .","If the access data sent to the transmitting computing device specifies a telephone number, the transmitting computing device may compose an SMS or MMS message including the file, and transmit the message via the cellular network  wireless access point , message . The cellular network  relays the SMS\/MMS message to the targeted computing device using the telephone number, message .","If the access data provided to the transmitting computing device is an e-mail address, the transmitting computing device may compose and send an e-mail message via the cellular network  wireless access point  (or other type of wireless network), message . The cellular network  may relay the e-mail message to an addressed e-mail server  via the Internet , message . The e-mail server  may store the e-mail message and, when accessed, relay the e-mail message to the cellular network , which provides service to the targeted computing device via the Internet , message . The cellular network  relays the e-mail message to the targeted computing device via a wireless access point , message . If the access data includes an IP address, the computing device may access the server with that IP address via the cellular network , and the Internet  to upload the file in a manner very similar to how an e-mail message is sent to an e-mail server. The targeted computing device may access the server at the same IP address via the cellular network  and the Internet , and download the file in a manner very similar to how an e-mail message is received from the e-mail server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIGS. 3-6","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","10","308","308","306","308","308","308","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4D","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4D"],"b":["402","10","306","402","402","402","404","404","306","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":["502","10","502","306","10","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"],"b":["308","10","306","602","308","10","10","304"]},"The foregoing examples are not intended to limit the scope of the various aspects, and other activation mechanisms may be used.","In an aspect illustrated in , once the file sharing functionality is activated, more than one launch pad  may be displayed to indicate the activation of the file sharing functionality, and to allow the user to share files with other computing devices  in different ways. For example, a first launch pad , shown in this figure with dashed borders, may be displayed to enable the user to transmit files to other computing devices . A second launch pad , shown here with solid borders, may also be displayed to enable uses to request and receive files from other computing devices , as described herein.","In an aspect illustrated in , a computing device  may inform a user that the file sharing functionality is active by displaying a radar map . Such a radar map display  may use graphical indicators , such as dots or circles, to show the location of other nearby computing devices which have wireless communication links established with the user's computing device . As described above, the wireless communication links to nearby computing devices and the device location information used to create the radar display  may be established and exchanged during the device discovery process commenced by activation of the file sharing functionality. The orientation of the nearby computing devices may be shown relative to the location of the user's computing device . The location of the user's computing device may be indicated on the radar map  by the launch pad . As the user moves, the orientation of the dots with respect to the launch pad  may change, indicating the changing relative location of the other computing devices with respect to the user's location. The radar map  display may be enabled or disabled based on the user's preferences.","Once the file sharing functionality is activated and a wireless link is established between nearby computing devices, different methods may be employed for sharing files among the linked computing devices. One method in which files may be shared is by transmitting files to another computing device . A second method in which files may be shared is by transmitting a request from the computing device  requesting another computing device to send it files.  illustrate different aspect gestures that may be used to initiate the transmission of files to other computing devices.  illustrate different aspect gestures that may be used to cause a computing device  to request files from other computing devices.","As illustrated in , a user's computing device may be near other computing devices -. In a typical social situation, other computing devices -may be located around a user's computing device . As part of establishing wireless links to the other computing devices, the computing device may be configured to determine the location of each of the other computing devices -. For example, computing device may determine the presence of computing devices and in front of it, and that of a computing device behind it. The computing device may be further configured to detect a user's touch on the touchscreen  and to recognize that a touch tracing a gesture towards a receiving computing device indicates the user's desire to share the selected file or files with that particular computing device . This touch gesture may be in the form of a quick flick of the finger on the touch screen, and accordingly is referred to herein as a flicking gesture.\u201d  shows the direction of the flick gesture by a dashed line with an arrow  directed towards the computing device . Such a dashed line  may or may not be displayed on the display , which may be a configurable setting based on user preferences. The computing device may be configured to identify the targeted computing device based on the flick gesture and initiate transmission of the selected file to that other computing device .

If the traced touch path event is not a curve shaped gesture (i.e., determination block =\u201cNo\u201d), the computing device  may identify the targeted device based on the calculated distance of the touch path event at block , and begin the processes for transmitting the file to the targeted device at block  in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0148"},"figref":"FIG. 46","b":["5200","10","5200","5202","5204","5206","5208","10","10","5210","5212","5212","10","5214","5212","5216"]},"In a further aspect a computing device to which a file is transmitted may be configured to redirect the file to another computing device if it is busy, such as involved in a telephone call or transmitting data. In a further aspect, a network delivering a file to the targeted computing device may be configured to redirect the file to another computing device if the targeted computing device is busy, such as involved in a telephone call or transmitting data.","The aspects described above may be implemented on any of a variety of portable computing devices . Typically, such portable computing devices  will have in common the components illustrated in . For example, the portable computing devices  may include a processor  coupled to internal memory  and a touch surface input device. The touch surface input device may be any type of touchscreen display , such as a resistive-sensing touchscreen, capacitive-sensing touchscreen, infrared sensing touchscreen, acoustic\/piezoelectric sensing touchscreen or the like. The various aspects are not limited to any particular type of touchscreen display  or touchpad technology. Additionally, the portable computing device  may have an antenna  for sending and receiving electromagnetic radiation that is connected to one or more wireless transceivers , coupled to the processor . For example, one wireless transceiver may be cellular telephone transceiver configured to establish a wireless communication link with a cellular telephone and data communication network, and another may be a Bluetooth\u00ae transceiver configured to establish wireless communication links with other Bluetooth\u00ae enabled computing devices. Portable computing devices  which do not include a touchscreen input device  typically include a key pad  or miniature keyboard and menu selection keys or rocker switches  which serve as pointing devices. The processor  may further be connected to a wired network interface , such as a universal serial bus (USB) or FireWire\u00ae connector socket, for connecting the processor  to an external touchpad or touch surfaces or external local area network. The computing device  may further include a microphone  coupled to the processor  to receive voice and commands from the user.","The computing device  may further include other circuit components and sensors to enable the file sharing functionality of the various aspects. An accelerometer sensor assembly  may be coupled to the processor  to detect acceleration of the computing device. Such an accelerometer sensor assembly  may include three accelerometers configured to sense accelerations along three mutually perpendicular directions. A gyroscope sensor  may be coupled to the processor  to detect rapid rotational movements of the computing device . An electronic compass sensor  may be coupled to the processor to detect the direction in which the computing device is pointing with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. In an aspect, the computing device  may also include a second antenna  coupled to one of the wireless transceivers to enable the transceiver or processor to compare the timing and\/or signal strength of signals received from nearly computing devices to support triangulation calculations. A GPS receiver  may also be coupled to the processor  to determine the location of a computing device. In an aspect, the GPS receiver  and the processor  may be configured to determine location using enhanced GPS services supported by a cellular telephone network.","In some implementations, a touch surface can be provided in areas of the computing device  outside of the touchscreen display . For example, the keypad  can include a touch surface with buried capacitive touch sensors. In other implementations, the keypad  may be eliminated so the touchscreen display  provides the complete GUI. In yet further implementations, a touch surface may be an external touchpad that can be connected to the computing device  by means of a cable to a cable connector  or a wireless transceiver coupled to the processor .","The processor  may be any programmable microprocessor, microcomputer or multiple processor chip or chips that can be configured by software instructions (applications) to perform a variety of functions, including the functions of the various aspects described above. In some portable computing devices , multiple processors  may be provided, such as one processor dedicated to wireless communication functions and one processor dedicated to running other applications. The processor may also be included as part of a communication chipset. Typically, software applications may be stored in the internal memory  before they are accessed and loaded into the processor . In some portable computing devices , the processor  may include internal memory sufficient to store the application software instructions. For the purposes of this description, the term memory refers to all memory accessible by the processor , including internal memory  and memory within the processor  itself. Application data files are typically stored in the memory . In many portable computing devices , the memory  may be a volatile or nonvolatile memory, such as flash memory, or a mixture of both.","Those of skill in the art would appreciate that the various illustrative logical blocks, modules, circuits, and algorithm blocks described in connection with the aspects disclosed herein may be implemented as electronic hardware, computer software, or combinations of both.
