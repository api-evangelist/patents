{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/364,576 filed Jul. 15, 2010, entitled PIERCED SEPTUM BLOOD CONTROL VALVE WITH A FLOW RESTRICTOR AND A BLOOD VALVE FORMING A TERTIARY FLASHBACK CHAMBER. This application claims priority to and incorporates by reference the provisional application.","Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters are used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition into a patient; withdrawing blood from a patient; or monitoring various parameters of the patient's vascular system. Catheters are typically coupled to a catheter adapter that supports catheter and provides for an attachment to IV tubing. Generally, following placement of the catheter into the vasculature of a patient, the catheter adapter may be coupled to a fluid source via a section of IV tubing to infuse fluids into the patient.","In order to verify proper placement of the catheter in the blood vessel, the clinician generally confirms that there is \u201cflashback\u201d of blood from the patient's vasculature into a flashback chamber of the catheter or catheter adapter. Once proper placement of the catheter is confirmed, the clinician must attach the catheter adapter to a section of IV tubing, or continue to manually occlude the vein to prevent undesirable exposure to blood. The process of coupling the catheter adapter to the section of IV tubing requires the clinician to awkwardly maintain pressure on the vein of the patient while simultaneously coupling the catheter adapter and the IV tubing. A common, yet undesirable practice is to permit blood to temporarily and freely flow from the catheter adapter while the clinician locates and couples the IV tubing to the catheter adapter. Another common practice is to attach the catheter adapter to the IV tubing prior to placing the catheter into the vein of the patient. While this method may prevent undesirable exposure to blood, positive pressure from the IV tubing into the catheter can does not permit desirable flashback and thus reduces a clinician's ability to confirm proper catheter placement.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a catheter assembly that permits controlled, desirable flashback without the risk of encountering undesirable exposure to blood. Such a catheter assembly is disclosed herein.","In order to overcome the limitations discussed above, the present invention relates to a pierced septum valve that provides selective activation of fluid flow through the catheter assembly while minimizing or eliminating blood exposure. Furthermore, confirmation of catheter placement can be enhanced with an additional flash chamber that is created by including a seal around the exterior of the septum activator. The combination of the pierced septum valve and the seal about the septum activator can provide a longer flashback period in which clinicians can assure that a catheter is properly placed in a blood vessel of a patient.","In one aspect, a pierced septum valve includes a septum, a septum activator, a seal and one or more vents. The septum is disposed within a lumen of a body. A septum activator is disposed proximal the septum within the lumen of the body. A seal is disposed between an outer surface of the septum activator and the body. The seal seals the portion of the septum activator distal the seal from the portion of the septum activator proximal the seal. One or more vents are disposed between the seal and the lumen of the body, the one or more vents each having a cross sectional area that permits the passage of air but not blood.","Some implementations include one or more of the following aspects. The cross sectional area of each vent can be between 0.0001 to 0.0003 inches. The one or more vents can include six or more vents. The seal can encircle the septum activator. The one or more vents can be formed in the exterior of the seal. The one or more vents can be formed through the seal. The one or more vents can be channels formed in the body. The body can be a catheter adapter and the lumen of the body can extend through the catheter adapter. The seal can have an outer diameter greater than or equal to an inner diameter of the lumen. The seal can include an elastomeric material. The seal can be disposed about a proximal portion of the septum activator.","In another aspect, a catheter assembly includes a catheter adapter, a septum, and a septum activator, a seal, one or more flow restrictors, and one or more vents. The catheter adapter has a lumen extending therethrough. The septum is disposed within the lumen. One or more flow restrictors are disposed between the septum and the catheter adapter. A septum activator is disposed within the lumen proximal the septum. A seal is disposed between an outer surface of the septum activator and the catheter adapter. The seal seals the portion of the septum activator distal the seal from the portion of the septum activator proximal the seal. One or more vents are disposed in the seal.","Some implementations include one or more of the following aspects. The one or more vents disposed in the seal can each have a cross sectional area between 0.0001 to 0.0003 inches. The one or more flow restrictors include one or more openings each having a cross sectional area of greater than 0.0003 inches. The volume exterior the septum activator between the septum and the seal can form a flashback chamber. The septum activator can have a substantially tubular-shaped body with a lumen extending therethrough. The seal can have an outer diameter greater than or equal to an inner diameter of the lumen at the locations. The seal can be disposed about a proximal portion of the septum activator. The seal can include an elastomeric material.","In another aspect, a catheter assembly includes a catheter adapter, a septum, a septum activator, an annular seal, and one or more vents. The catheter adapter has a lumen extending therethrough. The septum is disposed within the lumen. One or more flow restrictor channels are disposed between the septum and the catheter adapter. The cross sectional area of each of the flow restrictor channels is greater than 0.0003 inches. The septum activator is disposed within the lumen proximal the septum, the septum activator has a substantially tubular-shaped body. An annular seal is disposed between an outer surface of the septum activator and an inner surface of the lumen. The seal encircles a proximal portion of the septum activator. One or more vents are disposed between the seal and the lumen of the body. The one or more vents each have a cross sectional area between 0.0001 to 0.0003 inches.","Embodiment of the present invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description, as represented in the figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed, but is merely representative of presently preferred embodiments of the invention.","Referring now to , a catheter assembly  is illustrated. The catheter assembly  generally includes a catheter  coupled to a distal end  of a catheter adapter . The catheter  and the catheter adapter  are integrally coupled such that an inner lumen of the catheter adapter  is in fluid communication with an inner lumen of the catheter . The catheter  generally comprises a biocompatible material having sufficient rigidity to withstand pressures associated with insertion of the catheter into a patient.","In some embodiments, as shown, the catheter  is an over-the-needle catheter that is made of a flexible or semi-flexible polymer material and which may be used in combination with a rigid introducer needle . The rigid introducer needle  enables the insertion of the non-rigid over-the-needle catheter into a patient. The introducer needle  can be coupled to a needle hub  that is selectively coupled to the proximal end  of the catheter adapter . The introducer needle  is typically inserted through the catheter  such that a tip of the needle  extends beyond the tapered tip  of the catheter . Insertion of the introducer needle  into the vein of the patient creates an opening in the vein through which the tapered tip  of the catheter  is inserted. The outer surface of the tapered tip  enables gradual insertion of the catheter  into the opening.","In other embodiments, the catheter  is not an over-the-needle catheter, but comprises a rigid, polymer material, such as vinyl. Rigid catheters can include a beveled cutting surface that is utilized to provide an opening in a patient to permit insertion of the catheter  into the vascular system of the patient. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the catheter  comprises a metallic material, such as titanium, stainless steel, nickel, molybdenum, surgical steel, and alloys thereof. Still, in other embodiments, surgically implanted catheters may also be used in combination with the present invention.","The catheter  can be a peripheral-type intravenous catheter that generally comprises a short or truncated catheter for insertion into a small peripheral vein. Such catheters generally comprise a diameter of about a 14-gauge catheter or smaller (on a Stubs scale), and is between about 13 mm to 52 mm in length. Peripheral intravenous catheters are typically designed for temporary placement. The short length of the catheter facilitates convenient placement of the catheter. In other embodiments, the catheter  is a midline or central catheter, which may be longer and used for more extended periods.","Referring now to , once the catheter  is inserted into the vein of the patient, the introducer needle  is removed proximally from the catheter  to provide a fluid conduit through the interior lumen  of the catheter , which can be connected to a fluid source. In some embodiments, a portion of the catheter  and\/or catheter adapter  can be connected to a section of intravenous tubing  to further facilitate delivery of a fluid to or removal of a fluid from a patient. In some embodiments, a proximal end  of the catheter adapter  includes a flange . The flange  provides a positive surface that may be configured to enable coupling of an intravenous tubing  or patient conduit to the catheter assembly . In some embodiments, the flange  includes a set of threads . The threads  are generally provided and configured to compatibly receive a complementary set of threads  comprising a portion of a male luer or conduit coupler . The conduit coupler  is generally coupled to an end portion of the patient conduit  in a fluid-tight manner. In some embodiments, an inner portion of the conduit coupler  is extended outwardly to provide a probe member .","The probe member  can be compatibly inserted within a proximal end  of the catheter adapter  to activate the septum therein, thus opening a fluid path within the catheter adapter . In some configurations, following insertion of the probe member  into the proximal end  of the catheter adapter , the conduit coupler  is interlock with the coupler  and the flange  (via the sets of threads  and ), such as by rotation. During the process of interlocking the coupler  and the flange , the probe member  is advanced into the lumen  of the catheter adapter  to an inserted position (as shown in ). As shown in , the intravenous tubing  is connected to the catheter adapter , the probe member  advances into the lumen  of the catheter adapter , forcing a septum activator  therein to pierce through the septum . Piercing the septum  opens the septum and provides a fluid path through which fluids from the intravenous tubing  to flow through the pierced septum  and the catheter  into the patient. The process of piercing the septum  is described in detail below. As will be understood, prior to the insertion of the probing member , the inner lumen  of the catheter adapter  is sealed to avoid blood exposure through from flashback.","Reference will now be made to .  depicts an exploded, cross-sectional view of a catheter assembly .  depicts a cross-sectional view of an assembled catheter assembly . The septum activator  of  has an alternative structure to that of , as is explained below. These figures, along with , depict embodiments of pierced septum valves, which include a septum having a slit that is opened and closed by the advancement and retraction of a probe-like septum activator therethrough.","As shown, in some embodiments, a septum  is positioned within the inner lumen  of the catheter adapter  to control the flow of fluid therein. The septum  generally comprises a flexible or semi-flexible polymer plug having an outer diameter that is configured to compatibly sit within a groove or channel  formed on an inner surface  of the catheter adapter . In some embodiments, the septum  is barrel-shaped and has a barrier member  on its distal end and a cavity  within its a proximal end. When positioned within the channel , the barrier member  of the septum  divides the inner lumen  of the catheter adapter  into a forward fluid chamber  and a rearward fluid chamber . Thus, the presence of the septum  can limit passage of fluid between the forward and rearward fluid chambers  and .","In some embodiments, the barrier member  of the septum  includes a slit . The slit  can provide selective access or flow of a fluid through the barrier surface  as it opens (activates) and closed (deactivates) in response to the septum activator . In some embodiments, the slit  is configured to remain in a closed, fluid-tight position until activated or opened by advancing a septum activator  through the slit  in a distal direction . In some instances, the barrier member  comprises a single slit . In other instances, the barrier member  is modified to include multiple slits , such as two slits  forming a cross or x-shape. In other instances, the barrier member  is modified to include three slits  forming a Y-shape.","The septum activator  comprises a probe-like structure serves to activate and deactivate the septum  in response to the insertion and removal of the probe member . The Septum activator  can be primarily housed in the rearward chamber  of the catheter adapter , proximal the septum . In some embodiments, the septum activator  is a tubular body  having a distal end  and a proximal end . The tubular body  can be made of a rigid or semi-rigid material, such as a plastic or metallic material. The tubular body  can have an inner lumen  that facilitate flow of a fluid and\/or liquid through the septum activator  when the septum activator  pierces through the slit  of the septum .","The distal end  of the tubular body  can be configured to be compatibly inserted into the cavity  within the proximal side of the septum  so that it is positioned where it can pierce through the slit  of the barrier member  to form a fluid path therethrough. The distal end  further includes a leading surface  that can be inserted through the opening  of the septum  to a position proximal to the barrier member  of the septum , as shown in . When forced distally, the leading surface  advances through the slit  as the septum activator  is moved between a deactivated position, as shown in , to an activated position, as shown in .","To properly align the septum activator  within the inner lumen  of the catheter adapter , one or more alignment structures can be included between the outer surface of the septum activator  and the inner surface  of the catheter adapter . For example, as shown in , one or more alignment fins  can protrude from the outer surface of the septum activator  and inserted within one or more alignment groove  formed within the inner surface  of the catheter adapter . As the septum activator translates longitudinally within the catheter adapter, the one or more alignment fins  each track within the one or more alignment groove  to maintain septum activator  properly aligned within the catheter adapter . In some configurations there are three, four, five, or six alignment fins , each inserted within one of a like number of alignment grooves .","In addition to activating the septum , the septum activator  can form part of a flashback chamber  that provides an extended flashback indication to clinicians. Flashback generally occurs when the introducer needle  and\/or the catheter  enter a blood vessel of a patient, piercing the blood vessel, and opening a fluid path through the catheter . The patient's blood pressure forces blood out the blood vessel into the catheter assembly . When the catheter adapter  or a portion thereof is transparent or semi-transparent, as it is in some embodiments, blood flow through its inner lumen  is observable and can indicate to a clinician that the catheter  is currently located within the blood vessel of the patient. If blood flow stops, the clinician can understand that the catheter  is no longer located within the blood vessel or that some other factor is restricting blood flow through the catheter . Thus, a flashback that can last long enough for a clinician to properly place a catheter is desirable.","Referring to , in some embodiments, the blood generally enters the catheter assembly  and follows a flashback path  through the catheter assembly . The fluid path  enters into the forward chamber , which can be a first flashback chamber since it includes the volume that can be observed to be filled with blood. Next, blood flows through flow restrictors  disposed around the septum  and enters the flashback chamber , which can be a second flashback chamber. In instances where the catheter adapter  or a portion thereof is transparent or semi-transparent, a clinician can observe this flow of blood filing these chambers, which indicates proper placement of the catheter .","As mentioned, during flashback, blood enters the flashback chamber  through one or more flow restrictors  interposed between the septum  and the inner surface  of the catheter adapter  to provide a flow path for flashback. Generally, the septum  sits within a groove or channel  that comprises a recessed portion of the inner surface  of the catheter adapter . The outer diameter of the septum  can compatibly and securely sit within the channel . For example, in some embodiments the outer diameter of the septum  is selected to be both slightly smaller than the diameter of the channel  and slightly larger than the diameter of the inner lumen . As such, the septum  is retained within the channel  during use of the catheter assembly . The flow restrictor  can permit the passage of air and fluid therethrough, while generally regulating the flow rates. The size of the cross-sectional area of each flow restrictor can at least partially control the rate of fluid flowing therethrough. For example, as the cross-sectional area of the flow restrictors  increases, the potential rate of fluid flow through the flow restrictors  increases. Likewise, flow restrictors  having smaller cross sectional areas will decrease the flow of fluid therethrough. The sizes and configurations of flow restrictors  and other components are described in detail below.","The septum activator  in combination with the catheter adapter  and the septum  define the flashback chamber , shown in . In some configurations, the outer surface  of the septum activator  provides a fluid barrier that prevents fluid from flowing between the inner lumen  of the septum activator  and the volume of space around the outer surface  of the septum activator . Accordingly, as shown, in some instances, the septum activator  is a solid tube having only two openings: a proximal and a distal opening.","As fluid enters the flashback chamber , a seal  disposed between the septum  and the inner surface  of the catheter adapter  can prevent the fluid from flowing out the proximal end of the catheter adapter . In some embodiments, the seal  encircles the septum activator , as shown. In some embodiments, the seal  is coupled to the outer surface  of the septum activator  to prevent the proximal flow of fluids past the seal . In other embodiments, the seal  can be coupled to the inner surface  of the catheter adapter . By adjusting the location of the seal , the volume of the flashback chamber  increases or decreases. Thus, the seal  can be positioned at various locations between the proximal and distal ends of the septum activator . For instance, the seal  can be disposed on a proximal portion of the septum activator , such as the proximal half of the septum activator , as shown. More specifically, in a non-limiting example, the seal  is disposed on the proximal end  of the septum activator , as shown in , which is described below. Further, the seal  can circumscribe a portion of the outer surface  of the septum activator  in a ring-like fashion, as shown, to seal the area around a portion of the septum activator .","In some embodiments, the seal  can provide a fluid-tight barrier about the septum activator  that prevents blood from leaking through the proximal end of the flashback chamber  and out the catheter assembly . For instance, the seal  can have an outer diameter greater than or equal to the inner diameter of the lumen  of the catheter adapter  to block fluid flow through the entire area between the septum activator  and the catheter adapter . The seal  can also be made of a flexible material so that it can adequately conform to the inner surface  of the catheter adapter  to form a seal thereon. Accordingly, the seal  can comprise a non-rigid material, such as an elastomeric material. In other instances, the seal  is made of other flexible, semi-flexible, or semi-rigid materials that can provide a fluid-tight seal between the catheter adapter  and the septum activator .","Initially during flashback, blood flowing into the catheter  forces air to flow through the flow restrictors . This initial infusion of blood can be very quick as blood rushes through the catheter  into the forward chamber . The forward chamber  can serve as a first flashback chamber that provides a first indication to clinicians that blood is flowing into the catheter assembly . By observing this flow of blood, a clinician can verify that the catheter  has entered a blood vessel. However, in some instances, the time in which this initial flashback occurs is very quick and not long enough for a clinician to verify proper catheter placement. Accordingly, in some configurations, a second flashback chamber  is provided on the proximal side of the septum  that provides extended flashback indications. Accordingly, air and blood from within the forward chamber  can flow through the flow restrictors  disposed between the septum  and the catheter adapter  into the second flash chamber . Because the size of the flow restrictors  controls the flow of blood therethrough, the rate of flashback into the second flashback chamber  can be regulated to provide a longer average flashback periods.","When blood begins to flow into the catheter assembly, a positive pressure develops within the forward chamber , the first flashback chamber, and the second flashback chamber . This pressure can reduce or prevent the flow of blood into the catheter assembly , thus preventing a desired flashback of the patient's blood into the catheter adapter . Thus, some embodiments include features or elements to enable airflow through or around the seal , to relieve this positive pressure by permitting air, but not blood, to exit therethrough. As such, some embodiments of the present invention provide a complete observable flashback, as generally desired for infusion procedures.","In some embodiments, the seal  of the septum activator  is modified to include one or more vents . In other embodiments, one or more vents  (shown in ), in the form of channels, are interposed between the seal  and the inner surface  of the catheter adapter . These vents  relieve the positive pressure within the flashback chambers ,  by providing an access for air to bypass the seal  into the exterior environment. In some embodiments, the vents  are constructed by removing portions of the seal  surface, resulting in a plurality of generally parallel grooves. A close-up perspective view of a seal  having multiple vents  is depicted in . In other embodiments, the vents  are formed as channels through the seal  rather than on the surface of the seal .","In some embodiments, the rate at which air and\/or fluid flows through the vents  in the seal  is adjusted by manufacturing the catheter adapter  to include a greater or lesser number of vents  or by changing the cross-sectioned area of the vents . Thus, in some embodiments the rate at which air and\/or fluid flows out of the second flashback channel  is increased by manufacturing a catheter adapter  to have either an increased number of vent , or vents  with a greater cross-sectioned area. Conversely, in other embodiments the rate at which air and\/or fluid flows from the second flashback chamber  is decreased by manufacturing a catheter adapter  with either a decreased number of vents , or vents  having a lesser cross-sectioned area.","One having skill in the art will appreciate that the blood pressure of the patient is largely responsible for the rate at which blood and air flow through the septum  and the vents  in or around the seal . As such, the flow rate through the system is affected by the combined effective hydraulic diameter of all flow paths. Thus, in some embodiments, the hydraulic diameter of the vents  is modified to increase or decrease the rate of flow through the catheter assembly . In other embodiments, the hydraulic diameter of the vents  are decreased thereby resulting in substantially reduced or stopped flow through the ventilation means. The governing equation for controlling the flow rate through the ventilation means is given in Equation 1, where BP is the blood pressure, A is the surface area of the ventilation means, \u00f3 is the surface tension of the blood, and P is the perimeter of the ventilation means.\n\n()=\u03c3()\u2003\u2003Equation 1:\n","Thus, according to Equation 1, when the perimeter of a vent is small, the vents  will allow air venting, but will prevent blood flow due to the relatively high surface tension (\u03c3) of blood. However, when the perimeter of the vent is increased, the surface tension between the blood and the vent  is decreased thereby enabling the blood to slowly leak through the vents and around the septum to provide desirable, yet controlled flashback. Therefore, by adjusting the variable of Equation 1, a desired flow will be achieved. Thus, based on the size and\/or number of vents around the septum, the catheter assembly design will provide customized, controlled, and predictable blood flow through the seal .","In some embodiments, the one or more vents  are designed to allow the flow of air and stop the flow of blood. In some embodiments, the number of vents  is between 1 and 40. In other embodiments, the number of vents  is between 1 and 20. In some embodiments, six or more vents  are included. While in other embodiments, five or fewer vents  are included. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the vents  have a cross sectional area between about 0.000007 to 0.00004 inches. In other embodiments, the vents  have a cross sectional area between about 0.00001 to 0.00003 inches. In other embodiments, the vents  have a cross sectional area of about 0.00002 inches. For instance, in some embodiments, the vents  have a height of about 0.001 to 0.003 inches and a width of about 0.010 inches. In other embodiments, the vents have a height of about 0.002 to 0.003 inches and a width of about 0.005 inches.","Similarly, the one or more flow restrictors  between the septum  and the inner surface  of the catheter adapter  can be specifically configured to permit blood and air to pass therethrough at an estimated range of flow rates. For instance, the one or more flow restrictors  can permit blood to flow therethrough at a rate between about 10 to 200 ml\/hr. In other instances, the one or more flow restrictors  can permit blood to flow therethrough at a rate between about 15 to 150 ml\/hr. In yet other instances, the one or more flow restrictors  can permit blood to flow therethrough at a rate between about 50 to 100 ml\/hr. At these rates, the rate of blood flow into the flashback chamber  can be paced to provide a clinician with adequate time to correctly locate the catheter within a patient's blood vessel. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the flow restrictors  have a cross sectional area greater than 0.00003 inches. In other embodiments, the flow restrictors  have a cross sectional area greater than 0.00004 inches. In other embodiments, the vents  have a cross sectional area of about 0.0001 inches. In other embodiments, the vents  have a cross sectional area of about 0.001 inches.","Referring now to  a cross-sectional view of the catheter assembly  is shown following activation of the septum  via the septum activator . Upon insertion of the coupler  into the proximal opening  of the catheter adapter , the probe member  of the coupler  contacts the contact surface  of the septum activator . The septum activator  is advanced in a distal direction  as the coupler  is further inserted into the lumen  of the catheter adapter . As the coupler  is advanced farther into the lumen , the probing surface  of the septum activator  passes through the barrier member  of septum . As such, the probing surface  of the septum activator  is positioned within the forward chamber  providing a fluid pathway through the opened slit  of the septum .","During septum activation, the volume of the flashback chamber  decreases as the septum activator  advances in the distal direction . The decrease in volume can create a positive pressure within the flashback chamber  that can cause fluids within the flashback chamber  to flow back through the flow restrictors  into the forward chamber , along the fluid flow path . This fluid can then be flushed out the catheter assembly  with the infusion of fluids from the intravenous tubing .","In some embodiments, the catheter assembly  is configured to permit the septum activator  to return to a deactivated position entirely within the rearward chamber  following removal of the coupler  from the catheter adapter . Thus, when the coupler  is removed or detached from the catheter assembly , the fluid pathway through the septum  is reclosed.","Referring will now be made to , which depicts a catheter assembly  similar to that of . However, as shown, in some embodiments, the seal  does not include vents . Rather, as shown in , one or more vents  are formed into the inner surface  of the catheter adapter . In some configurations, the one or more vents  extend along the length of the inner surface  of the catheter adapter  at least at each location where the seal  contacts the catheter adapter  as it is moved from a deactivated position to an activated position. This configuration can permit air venting through the one or more vents  regardless of the location of the septum activator . In other configurations, the one or more vents  extend only across the location where the seal  contacts the inner surface  of the catheter adapter  in a deactivate position, the position shown in . As mentioned, the dimensions of the vents  can be selected to permit the flow of air but not gas therethrough. These dimensions can be substantially similar to those referenced above for the vents  within the seal .","Referring will now be made to , which depicts a septum activator  that has an alternative seal configuration. As shown, the septum activator  includes a tubular body  with a distal end  and a proximal end . A seal  is disposed on the distal end  of the septum activator , which will provide the largest possible length of flashback chamber . Vents  are formed in the seal similar to those previously mentioned. In some embodiments, the seal  is integrated into the septum activator, such that the two form a single piece structure. In some embodiments, the septum activator  and the seal  are made of the same material. In other embodiments, the septum activator  and the seal  are made of different materials that are connected in a fluid-tight manner.","Referring now to , an embodiment of a septum  is shown. In some embodiments, an outer surface  of the septum  is modified to include a plurality of recessed grooves . The recessed grooves  provide pathways between the forward and rearward chambers  and  through which air and\/or fluid may flow. Thus, in some embodiments, the channel  does not include air flow restrictor channels , but rather the outer surface  of the septum  is modified to provide desired flow between the forward and rearward chambers  and . The shape and size of these grooves can be selected, as mentioned, to provide the desired flow rate therethrough. For instance, the one or more flow restrictors  can permit blood to flow therethrough at a rate between about 10 to 200 ml\/hr. In other instance, the one or more vents  can permit blood to flow therethrough at a rate between about 15 to 150 ml\/hr. In yet other instances, the one or more vents  can permit blood to flow therethrough at a rate between about 50 to 100 ml\/hr.","From the foregoing, it can be seen that a pierced septum valve can provide selective activation of fluid flow through the catheter assembly while minimizing or eliminating blood exposure. Additionally, the pierced septum valve can enhance a clinician's ability to confirm catheter placement by providing an additional flash chamber between a seal around the exterior of the septum activator and the septum.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its structures, methods, or other essential characteristics as broadly described herein and claimed hereinafter.
