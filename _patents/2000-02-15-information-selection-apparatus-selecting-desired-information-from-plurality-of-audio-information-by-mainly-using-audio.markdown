Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information selection method selecting information associated with an audio information source, and an information selection apparatus employing such an audio information selection method.","2. Description of the Background Art","As a conventional technique of the method of selecting one information from a plurality of information, a retrieval engine using character information provided on a display is known. However, the task of continuously viewing the screen will be a burden on the user side. Accordingly, attention is now focused on the usage of voice and sound. In the case where a great number of audio media such as radio programs, music CDs and the like are the subject of selection, it will be easier for the user to actually listen to the contents rather than by selection using only character information.","A method of selecting information associated with a sound source according to a plurality of sound sources is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 10-124292. According to this method, a plurality of sound sources are placed around the user. The audio outputs are basically issued at the same volume. The user distinguishes audibly the audio outputs generated simultaneously and specifies a desired direction to select the information associated with the sound of that direction. More specifically, various audio messages such as \u201cplay\u201d, \u201crecord\u201d, \u201crewind\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d are determined for the front, right, back, and left, respectively, as the operation of a video equipment. When the user wants to effect recording, the right direction is to be selected using a pointing device such as a cross pad. Another method disclosed in this publication is devised to facilitate the audible feature of each generated sound by issuing the sound of each audio output with a slight time difference to define sound quality difference (male voice, female voice).","A method of playing again information that was missed audibly by the user indicating a certain direction with a single sound source rotating about the user is disclosed in \u201cDynamic Soundscape: mapping time to space for audio browsing\u201d (CHI97) by Minoru Kobayashi and Chris Schmandt (MIT). According to this method, one sound source moves around a user while issuing audibly various topics at a constant volume and sound quality. In the case where the user missed a certain topic by the ear, the user points out the area providing the audio output of that topic using a pointing device, whereby a sound source is generated at that site. Playback is resumed from the topic that was audibly issued when passing that site of the sound source. In this playback operation, the volume of the former sound source is lowered and the sound source that newly provides the audio output effects playback at a higher volume. Both sound sources move in an orbit at the same time. Up to eight sound sources are allowed simultaneously in this system.","However, even if audio output is provided with time difference or with different sound quality corresponding to each direction to facilitate identification of the position of the sound as in the above-described publication, the direction that can be distinguished audibly by the human being is limited to eight directions at most. The case where there are a great number of selection branches cannot be accommodated. Audio output of only single words such as playback or recording as in the case of video reservation is generally of no problem. However, in the case where audio output of continuous contents such as a plurality of news programs is issued, it is difficult to audibly distinguish the contents even if the sound sources are located at less than eight directions.","In the present specification, \u201cthe position of sound\u201d implies the site from which sound is audibly output, or a direction from which a sound can be heard.","In the above method, only one sound is audibly output unless the user provides an input. A plurality of information cannot be obtained at the same time.","The telephone push phone service is known as an information selection interface dedicated to audio (method 1). In selecting information, a voice guidance of \u201cPlease depress 1 for . . . \u201d is output. The user depresses an appropriate button according to the voice guidance.","Another method is known to operate a system by voice using a speech recognition function (method 2). According to this method, a predetermined operation command is input through voice, or a natural language processing function is added to the speech recognition function to operate the system in the manner of ordinary conversation.","A method in which the item to be subjected to selection is altered over time is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 6-149517. According to this method, the item to be subjected to selection is altered by the user or program request (output at an elapse of a predetermined time). A label of that item is displayed on the screen and a tone scale corresponding to that item is issued from a speaker. The user can select a certain item by carrying out a predetermined input operation when the label of the desired item appears.","Method 1 is disadvantageous in that the number of information that can be selected or the button to be depressed differs each time depending upon the contents. The user has to depend upon the voice guidance at every select operation, which is time-consuming. Since the number of buttons that can be depressed increases, the user will not be able to remember the location of each appropriate button. The user will have to depress the appropriate button while confirming the location of each button. This labor is tedious. Particularly in the case where it is dangerous for the user to carry out a task with his\/her view off, this button position confirmation will induce danger.","Method 2 is disadvantageous in that the user must learn and operate a plurality of types of predetermined voice commands, if any is predetermined. To date, the natural language processing function lacks the ability to recognize the meaning of the word input through an audio input of high degree of freedom. A technique at the level of practical usage is not yet established.","According to the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 6-149517, a display device is inevitable. The required information cannot be provided to the user by just through the audio output. Also, the audio information associated with each information corresponds to only the musical scale of a predetermined tone. It will be difficult for the user to master the difference of the tone and the musical interval information.","In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide an information selection method including a user-friendly user interface employing voice in selecting one desired information out from a plurality of information.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a sound information selection apparatus that facilitates selection of desired sound information from a plurality of sound information.","A further object of the present invention is to provide a sound information selection apparatus that can have the position change of a sound controlled by the user's intention.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide an information selection apparatus that allows selection of an information source without depending upon only visual recognition.","A still further aspect of the present invention is to provide an information selection apparatus that allows the user to identify at one time more information retained by an information source.","Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a sound information selection apparatus that allows the presentation status of sound information to be easily modified according to the user status.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an information selection apparatus including a user-friendly user interface employing voice in selecting one desired information from a plurality of information.","Yet a still further aspect of the present invention is to provide a computer readable recording medium including a user-friendly user interface employing voice in selecting one desired information out from a plurality of information.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a method of selecting desired information according to a plurality of sound information includes the steps of time-controlling independently the position of each sound, and selecting a sound. In selecting a sound, information associated with the sound is selected. As a result, a sound selection method can be provided that allows desired sound information to be easily selected from a plurality of sound information. Preferably, the method includes the step of controlling volume in association with the position of each sound. Information can be selected in association with the volume.","The step of controlling independently the position of each sound facilitates distinction between each sound by arranging the position of each sound on the circumference of substantially a circle to move in an orbit.","Further preferably, the position change of all the sounds can be set earlier than that of the normal time control or returned to the former position. As a result, the position change of sound can be controlled by the user's intention.","According to another aspect of the present invention, an information selection apparatus with a sound source to select desired information includes a unit time-controlling independently the position of each sound, a sound selection unit selecting a sound, and a selector selecting information associated with the sound in response to a selection signal of the sound selection unit.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, an information selection apparatus with a sound source to select desired information source from a plurality of information sources includes means for sequentially switching a plurality of information sources as audio information and presenting the same by a sound source, means for selecting audio information relevant to a desired information source from the presented audio information.","By presenting an information source as audio information by voice, an information source can be selected without depending upon only visual recognition. By selecting that audio information when presented, an information source can be selected by unitary operation.","Preferably, the information selection apparatus includes means for indicating switching of the audio information.","This allows switching of the audio information by an indication of the user. Audio information can be presented at a timing suiting the user's wishes.","Further preferably, the switch specify means specifies presentation of audio information presented after or before the currently-presented audio information.","Accordingly, switching can be effected by the user's specification so as to present audio information that was to be presented afterwards or that is already presented during presentation of audio information. Therefore, the user can sequentially refer to information according to his\/her wishes. This switching is not limited to audio information immediately preceding or succeeding the currently-presented audio information. Several audio information can be skipped by rewinding or fast-forwarding to present an appropriate audio information.","Further preferably, the information source retains information other than the audio information. The information selection apparatus can present the other information when the desired audio information is selected.","By presenting information other than the voice information such as image information retained by the information source, another information of audio information that is not presented can be provided in addition to the another information of the currently-presented audio information. Thus, the user can identify at one time more information retained by the information source.","The information other than the audio information retained by the information source is preferably image information. Information depending upon the five senses of the user (the tactual sense, the palate, the sense of smell) is allowed as long as it conveys information. For example, information can be presented by conducting a current through the clothing of the user, the scent, the taste, or the like.","According to the information stored in information storage unit , main control unit  commands play control unit  to play the audio information stored in audio storage unit  or to play the audio which is the contents of information storage unit  converted by audio conversion unit .","By presenting information other than audio information such as the image information retained by the information source during presentation of that audio information, the user can identify at one time more information retained by the information source.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, an information selection method includes the step of gradually narrowing down the information from categorized information sources by repeating the information selection method.","By gradually narrowing down the information out from categorized information sources, the user can easily arrive at the desired information out from a large amount of information sources.","According to a still further aspect of the present invention, a recording medium can be applied in which a program is recorded to cause a computer to execute the step of sequentially switching a plurality of information source as audio information and presenting the selected information source by a sound source, and the step of selecting from the presented audio information the audio information relevant to desired information source.","According to yet a further aspect of the present invention, an information presentation apparatus presenting a plurality of information as sound information includes a unit to modify, in presenting sound information, the presentation status according to the property of the sound information to be presented or the user status.","Accordingly, the presentation status of sound information can be easily modified according to the property such as the length volume, stereo\/monaural audio, and sampling frequency of the audio information to be presented and the sound quality depending upon the reproduction hardware, or according to the user status such as the case where the user is aware or not aware of the information preceding or succeeding the information to be presented, or the acceptability of the information applied as sound to the user.","Preferably in the information presentation apparatus, the presentation status to be modified includes either the status of presenting at the same time the plurality of sound information with the presentation position changed, or the status of sequentially presenting the plurality of sound information.","By selecting the status of presenting sound information simultaneously or sequentially, the sound information can be presented, not in an inflexible manner, but in a more appropriate manner suiting the situation when the information is to be presented as audio output.","Further preferably, the information presentation apparatus includes an arrangement unit time-controlling independently the position of sound information for arrangement in presenting the plurality of sound information at the same time with the presentation position changed. The position of each sound is arranged on the circumference of substantially a circle to move in an orbit. The rotation condition and sound placement condition are set according to the property of the sound information to be presented.","By arranging the sound information on the circumference of a circle to move in an orbit with the user present at a certain contact point of that circle, the user himself\/herself can easily recognize the mutual position relationship of the sound such as the most closest sound information position, the farthest sound position information, and the like in presenting a plurality of sound information at the same time. By setting the rotation condition such as the rotation speed or rotation radius, and the sound placement condition such as the distance between sounds, an information presentation environment suiting each user can be established.","The circle on which the sound information is to be arranged does not have to be a complete circle. Depending on the number of sound information presented at the same time or the user's preference, sound information can be presented with the portion of the circumference of the circle that is most remote from the user cut.","Further preferably, the information presentation apparatus includes an arrangement unit time-controlling independently the position of sound information in presenting a plurality of sound information with the presentation position altered. The position of each sound is modified to the position specified by the user independent of rotation of the position of the sound information.","By the provision of means for modifying the position of each sound to a position specified by the user independent of the rotation, i.e., without waiting for the orbital motion, sound information associated with the desired information can be obtained immediately within the reach of the user, i.e., obtained at one step without having to depress the \u201crewind\u201d, \u201cforwarding\u201d buttons several times.","Various information selection is allowed according to the information presentation apparatus such as directly calling up another sound from a slight position change of all the sounds being presented.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, an information presentation apparatus groups, when there is difference in the property between each sound information retained by the information, the property of each sound information prior to presenting the sound information.","By grouping the property of each sound information and presenting the normalization as sound information after monauralizing the stereo audio in advance when stereo audio and monaural audio are mixed in the sound information in the case where there is difference in the volume level of the sound information, the user can recognize the placement position of the sound information for all sound information.","Preferably, the information includes presentation information other than the sound information in the information presentation apparatus. The presentation information other than the sound information can be displayed together in displaying each sound information.","By presenting together presentation information other than sound information such as image information or information by touch, the user can obtain more easily the desired information.","Further preferably, the information presentation method presenting a plurality of information as at least sound information includes the step of modifying, in presenting sound information, the presentation status according to the property of the sound information to be presented.","According to yet a still further object of the present invention, a computer readable recording medium is provided in which a program is recorded to cause a computer to execute the step of presenting a plurality of information as sound information, and the step of modifying the presentation status of the sound information to be presented according to the property thereof.","The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawings.","Referring to , a user  listens to a plurality of sounds controlled by a control device  through a headphone device . A controller including a rewind button , a select button , and a fast-forward button  is provided in control device . Control device  carries out the operation to realize the left and right volume adjustment of headphone device  or a stereo speaker so as to allow user  to recognize sounds P\u2013PN located on a horizontal plane in the front direction of user , and provides control to effect simultaneous play as if the plurality of sounds P\u2013PN at a constant interval move in an orbit. In controlling the rotation of the orbit, the volume is altered according to the rotation so that the volume of a certain sound P is set to the maximum when at a point A closest to the user and to the lowest volume when at a point B farthest from the user. The volume is repeatedly increased and lowered gradually to attain the largest volume at point A and the lowest volume at point B. The relationship of the volume of each sound in  is established as P>P> . . . >PN>PN+1< . . . <PN, PN<P. This process corresponds the steps up to S in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["1","2","2"]},"At step S, sounds differing in volume move in an orbit as described above. At step S, the depression of select button  at the status of  when the user decides to select a professional wrestling match program at the maximum volume causes a process to be carried out in which the professional wrestling match is handled as the desired information (S, S, and S in ). When another sport is to be selected at the status of , the user waits until the desired program is heard at the largest volume or returns the position of each sound to one previous step using fast-forward button  or rewind button  to obtain the greatest audible output of the program that is to be selected (S). Then, the position of each sound is advanced by one step (S). Next, select button  is depressed. When a baseball game program, for example, is to be selected at the status of , the user waits a little or depresses fast-forward button . When the sumo program is to be selected, the user either waits for a rather long time or depresses rewind button  or fast-forward button  for the adjustment. Alternatively, selection switches corresponding to respective positions of each sound can be provided so that the user can depress an appropriate selection switch corresponding to the sound that is to be selected. In this case, the desired sound can be directly selected.","Referring to step S of  again, only a predetermined number of programs can be extracted to move in an orbit for selection when there are so many programs that it is difficult for a simultaneous orbital motion of all the programs such as in the case of a movie broadcast guidance of a multichannel broadcast. By replacing at a point B most remote from the user the sound that has not been selected over a predetermined period with information that is not yet included in the orbit, one information can be selected from a great many selection branches (S, S in ). In this case, a notify sound that does not disturb the information audit output is sounded in order to indicate that the information has been revised. This method will be described with reference to . When the tennis program has not been selected over a predetermined time in the above-described sports program guidance (refer to ), the sound at the head of the sound queue Q (for example, the sound of a golf program) is extracted from queue Q to move in the orbit instead of the tennis program. The sound of the tennis program is set back to the end of queue Q (). At the time when the sound of the golf program attains the maximum volume for the first time, the notify sound is issued together to indicate that is a new program on the orbit().","A second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to . In the present second embodiment, an image is employed in addition to the sound for the purpose of information selection. A controller including a rewind button , a select button , a fast-forward button , a cross pad , and a display device  is provided in a control device . User  views a plurality of images and hears sound under control of control device  through headphone device  and display device . Control device  provides control to move images D\u2013DN in an orbit corresponding to sounds P\u2013PN, respectively, orbiting at a constant interval in synchronization with the sound using display device  to display the image information (S in ). Correspondence between the volume and an image is established so that the image is displayed with the largest area when at the maximum volume. Thereafter, the volume is gradually lowered to attain the lowest level of volume. Corresponding to this change in the volume, the area of the corresponding image becomes gradually smaller than the largest area to eventually attain the smallest area. Then, the volume and the area gradually become larger to attain the largest volume and area.","In the case where the user is to select information, the user operates a pointer F on display device  using a pointing device such as a cross pad , for example, to directly select an image on display device . Alternatively, when that user wishes to select another sports program under the status of , the user waits until the desired image is exactly in front and the sound is heard at the largest volume. Instead of waiting, the user can return(S) or advance(S) the position of each image and sound by one step to let the desired information to be located in front and hear the sound at the largest volume using fast-forward button  or rewind button . Then, select button  or cross pad  is depressed. In response, the information associated with the sound designated by cross pad  is determined as \u201cthe desired information\u201d (S). For example, when a baseball program is to be selected under the state of , the user waits for a short time or depresses fast-forward button . When a sumo program is to be selected, the user waits for a longer period of time or depresses rewind button  or fast-forward button  for adjustment.","Referring to step S of  again, only a predetermined number of programs can be extracted to move in an orbit for selection when there are so many programs that it is difficult for a simultaneous orbital motion of all the programs such as in the case of a movie broadcast guidance of a multichannel broadcast. By replacing the sound that has not been selected over a predetermined period with information that is not yet included in the orbit at a point B most remote from the user, one information can be selected from a great many selection branches (S, S).","When categorization is possible in the case where there are many selection menus, an index of the categories is produced by the sound corresponding to a read out of the label of each index. By selecting that sound, the contents of a relevant category can be made to move in an orbit as a certain sound.","Control device  may be a personal computer.

Upon activation of the system in response to an instruction from the user (S), a series of audio information to be presented is read into the system. Detection is made whether there is audio information longer than the threshold value in the series of information to be presented (S). When there is a longer audio information, method 1 (simultaneous playing of sound information) is employed (S). Otherwise, method 2 (played in a presentation sequentially switched) is employed (S).","The threshold value may be a consistent value of the system, or a value set for each user according to the operation history of each user.","A step of normalizing the volume or stereo\/monaural audio prior to initiating presentation can be carried out(S). The system executes the process automatically up to S, and then initiates presentation(S). A switching specification from the user (switching between the methods (S, S), and specifying\/canceling normalization of audio parameters (S, S)) is always acceptable after initiation of the presentation and until the end of the presentation (S).","Method 1 will be described with reference to  schematically showing the operation method and the flow chart of . User  listens to a plurality of sounds controlled by a control device  through a headphone device . A controller including a rewind button , a select button , and a fast-forward button  is provided in control device .","Control device  carries out the operation to realize the left and right volume adjustment of headphone device  or a stereo speaker so as to allow user  to recognize sounds P\u2013PN located on a horizontal plane in the front direction of user , and provides control to effect simultaneous play as if the plurality of sounds P\u2013PN at a constant interval move in an orbit. In controlling the rotation of the orbit, the volume is altered according to the rotation so that the volume of a certain sound P is set to the maximum when at a point A closest to the user and to the lowest volume when at a point B farthest from the user. The volume is repeatedly increased and lowered gradually to attain the largest volume at point A and the lowest volume at point B. The relationship of the volume of each sound in  is established as P>P> . . . >PN>PN+1< . . . <PN, PN<P. This process corresponds the steps up to S in .","Only a predetermined number of programs can be extracted to move in an orbit for selection when there are so many programs that it is difficult for a simultaneous orbital motion of all the programs such as in the case of a movie broadcast guidance of a multichannel broadcast. By replacing the sound that has not been selected over a predetermined period with information that is not yet included in the orbit at a point B most remote from the user, one information can be selected from a great many selection branches (S, S in ). In this case, a notify sound that does not disturb the information audit output can sounded in order to indicate that the information has been revised.","In the case where the position of the sound is to be slightly advanced or returned, fast-forward button  or rewind button  is shortly depressed, respectively, in order to control the rotation of the sound. Fast-forward button  or rewind button  is to be depressed for a rather long time when another sound is to be drawn close. The manner of button depression is not limited to this example. The position change of the sound is controlled in method 1 in response to the step indicating sound position change by the user (S and S in ). Including the means for feedback in the button that directs position change can facilitate the perception of the user as to the moved distance of the sound position. Tactual sensation about the moved distance of the sound position by the user can be implemented by adjusting the resistance of the depression of the button.","Presentation may be devised to facilitate the usability for the user by altering the parameters related to the sound placement and rotation such as the rotation speed, the rotation radius, the distance between sounds and the like according to the length and the like of the time of play of each sound for method 1. Also, a step or means for commnding the change of the parameters on the user side can be added.","Method 2 will be described with reference to .  corresponds to  of the third embodiment schematically showing the operation contents. User  sequentially listens to the audio information presented by control device  via headphone device . Control device  is provided with a controller including a rewind button , a select button  and a forward button . Control device  sequentially switches the audio information corresponding to a plurality of information sources for presentation. For example, when there are a total of S information P to be presented, information P is sorted from P to PS. Control device  sequentially switches the information for presentation such as presenting information P following the presentation of P, presenting information P following the presentation of P, . . . .","The operation of method 2 is similar to that of the third embodiment. Therefore, description thereof will not be repeated.","The sorting sequence of the information presented to the user (arranged order) can reflect the user's preference in selecting previous information in methods 1 and 2. When there is difference in the volume of each audio to be presented, normalization can be carried out prior to presentation to play all the audio at substantially the same volume level.","It is needless to say that the sixth embodiment is applicable to the apparatuses for mails and CDs as in the fourth and fifth embodiments.","An example of employing the seventh embodiment in processing mails will be described hereinafter.","When it is not necessary to listen to the message from the beginning to the end in order to ascertain the contents of the information, depression of forward button  in  facilitates the call up of the previous sound when in method 1 and presentation of the next information skipping the currently presented information when in method 2. When the user does not remember the contents of a previous information and wishes to confirm again the contents, depression of rewind button  in  allows the previously-presented information to be presented again.","By employing method 1 in the case where the menu to be presented is long or when the information is to be obtained auditory while knowing the preceding and succeeding mails and by employing method 2 in the case where the menu to be presented is relatively short and each one is to be listened, information can be presented at the optimum status for the user regardless of the contents of presentation. Switching between the methods can be effected automatically by main control unit . Alternatively, a button for the user to specify switching can be provided so that main control unit  executes switching upon receiving the user's instruction.","By providing a common interface including at least a select button  with respect to methods 1 and 2 and additionally a rewind button  and fast-forward button , the user can obtain information with the same button and same operation even if the method is switched.","The operation of the memory is similar to that of the third embodiment. Therefore, description thereof will not be repeated.","The method of switching between method 1 and method 2 appropriately corresponding to the seventh embodiment applied to a music CD retrieval system will be described hereinafter. The normal operation is identical to that of the third embodiment.","Upon starting the system of the present application, a voice that reads out the genre as information is first presented. In the case of voice information by a guidance speech that can be presented in a relatively short time such as \u201cPops\u201d and \u201cClassic\u201d, determination is made that method 2 is appropriate. The audio information is sequentially switched and presented to the user according to method 2. In the case where music representative of each genre is employed as an index instead of the voice guidance, to determination is made that method 1 is appropriate. The sound of each music is played and moved in an orbit using method 1 to be presented to the user. In the present example, main control unit  switches between method 1 and method 2 depending upon the property of the audio to be presented. Information is presented to the user according to either method 1 or 2. A button that allows switching between method 1 and 2 according to the user's preference can be applied so that main control unit  switches between method 1 and 2 according to the user's instruction.","By providing a common interface that includes at least determination button  for methods 1 and 2 and additional rewind button  and fast-forward button , the user can obtain information with the same button and operation even if the method is switched.","In the case where the present invention is applied to a program guidance of a multichannel broadcast, indexes such as for each genre, target age and the like can be prepared in addition to the indexes for each channel and time to facilitate the user's selection of a desired program. The index label may be presented in the form of a synthesized speech, or in the form of the exact audible output of the program.","When a list of the programs that is currently being broadcasted is to be presented according to the method of the present invention, presentation can be provided in a fashion switching the channel for every predetermined time. Alternatively, an audio output characteristic of respective programs can be presented as the program information. In this case, when the program of a certain channel changes to another program of that same channel over time, the audio output of the new program is sequentially presented corresponding thereto.","Here, main control unit  can implement determination automatically to switch between method 1 or 2 such as selecting method 1 when the audio output of a program is to be directly output and method 2 when a relatively short audio output such as an index is used.","When presentation is effected using method 1 in the case where each audio to be presented is recorded at a different record level, there is a possibility of difference in volume which is one element for the user to recognize the sound placement position that \u201csound at a remote site is small whereas the sound at a close site is large\u201d may be lost. Presentation can be presented without deteriorating the usability by normalizing the volume of each sound prior to presentation using method 1. By incorporating means to switch between method 1 and method 2, presentation can be provided switched to method 2 with the volume at the same level when the user decides to negate normalization of the volume level. It is also possible to provide presentation by method 1 without altering the volume level even if the audibility is slightly difficult. Thus, a user-friendly presentation means can be selected by the user corresponding to various cases.","In the case where there is audio that includes a spatial wide sense such as recording at a concert in the audio to be presented, it may be difficult for the user to identify the location of the sound when presentation is carried out by method 1 using such audio. By converting such audio including this spatial wide sense into monaural audio prior to presentation using method 1, presentation can be provided without deteriorating the usability.","The present invention affords an application of presenting candidates of home pages disclosing information preferable for the user in the form of voice in browsing the home page on WWW. More specifically, the home page can be presented in voice form by an appropriate method such as voice-synthesizing the text information on the home page, employing the music information attached to the home page, converting the color information of the home page into sound and the like.","By converting the information that is to be presented as a candidate to the user into audio by an appropriate method, information can be presented to the user by method 1 or 2 according to the property (playback time or the like) of the voiced information as audio.

For example, it may be generally difficult for the user to identify the location of sound even if image information is added to the audio information. The pointing device such as a track ball itself can be rotated slowly corresponding to the presentation status of the sound. By applying the tactual sensation feedback such as a smooth move when in the fast-forward operation and a move with slight resistance when in a rewind operation in moving the sound information, the user can recognize more properly the sound position.
