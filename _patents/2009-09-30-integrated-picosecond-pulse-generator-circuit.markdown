More particularly, the present subject matter relates to an on-chip picosecond electrical pulse generator that can be implemented using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.","Picosecond electrical pulses have many applications, including clocks for high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and high-speed circuit component characterization using time-domain-reflectometry (TDR).","Known approaches to generating picosecond electrical pulses include: nonlinear transmission lines (NLTL) as described by, for instance, Rodwell et al. in \u201cActive and nonlinear wave propagation devices in ultrafast electronics and optoelectronics,\u201d 82, no. 7, pp. 1037-1059, 1994 and by Birk et al. in \u201cEfficient transient compression using an all-silicon nonlinear transmission line,\u201d , vol. 8, no. 5, pp. 196-198, 1998. Other approaches include transmission line discontinuities as described by, for instance, Frankel et al. in \u201cPicosecond pulse formation by transmission line discontinuity,\u201d 25, no. 20, pp. 1363-1364, 1989[5]; and photoconductive switching as described by, for instance, Takakata et al. in \u201c3.3 ps electrical pulse generation from a discharge-based metal semiconductor-metal photodetector,\u201d , vol. 41, no. 1, pp. 38-39, 2005.","These methods exploit the electromagnetic properties of passive circuit components to produce fast signals. It can be difficult to implement these circuits using CMOS technologies on a CMOS semiconductor substrate even though all-silicon NLTLs to sharpen the signal rise edges to 8-ps have been reported by Mohammed et al. in \u201cA novel silicon schottky diode for NLTL applications,\u201d , vol. 52, no. 7, pp. 1384-1391, 2005.","Digital circuits can be used to generate short-pulses, but the pulse widths of the output pulses are determined by the speed of the transistors used in the digital circuits. A bench-mark for pulse-duration of the generated pulses is the fan-out-of-four (FO4) propagation delay of corresponding inverter gates. An exemplary FO4 delay corresponds to about 50 ps for the present technology.","Nanosecond and sub-nanosecond electrical pulses have been generated through a few other techniques, such as those circuits for ultrawide-band (UWB) applications disclosed in, for example, J. Han et al, \u201cOn the development of a compact sub-nanosecond tunable monocycle pulse transmitter for UWB applications,\u201d , pp. 1-9, 2006, and various pulsed-power circuit topologies. These techniques also exploit the properties of transmission lines. However, on-chip applications of these techniques and their picosecond pulse generation capabilities have not previously been reported.","All of the foregoing publications are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","There is a need for a picosecond pulse generator circuit that can be implemented on a common semiconductor substrate, such as a CMOS semiconductor substrate. While various implementations of picosecond pulse generation circuits and systems have been developed, no design has emerged that generally encompasses all of the desired characteristics as hereafter presented in accordance with the subject technology.","Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.","One exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure is directed to a pulse generator circuit that includes a transmission line configured to be charged when voltage is applied to the transmission line. The pulse generator circuit further includes a switching device operably connected to the transmission line and a trigger circuit operably connected to the switching device. The trigger circuit is configured to provide an input pulse to the switching device. The transmission line discharges an output pulse when the trigger circuit provides an input pulse to the switching device. The pulse width of the output pulse depends in major part on the length of the transmission line. The amplitude of the output pulse depends in major part on the charging voltage applied to the transmission line. The pulse generator according to exemplary embodiments of the present technology can therefore transform the input pulse provided by the trigger circuit into an output pulse having a desired pulse width, such as a pulse width in the range of about 6.0 to about 10.0 picoseconds, and amplitude by varying transmission line length and charging voltage. The transmission line, the switching device, and the trigger circuit are located on a common semiconductor substrate. For example, the transmission line, the switching device, and the trigger circuit can be provided on a common complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) substrate.","Various additions or modifications can be made to this exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.","Another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure is directed to a pulse generator circuit having a voltage source, a load resistor and a transmission line operably connected between the voltage source and the load resistor. The transmission line has a length and a characteristic impedance. The pulse generator circuit further includes an N-type field effect transistor having a gate terminal, a drain terminal, and a source terminal. The N-type field effect transistor can also have a bulk terminal that is connected to ground or to a reference voltage. The drain terminal of the N-type field effect transistor is coupled to the transmission line. The pulse generator circuit further includes a trigger circuit coupled to the gate terminal of the N-type field effect transistor. The trigger circuit provides an input pulse to the gate terminal and the N-type field effect transistor is driven into a linear regime when the input signal is provided to the gate terminal. The transmission line discharges an output pulse across the load resistor when the N-type field effect transistor operates in the linear regime. The transmission line, the switching device, and the trigger circuit can all be located on a common semiconductor chip, such as a common CMOS semiconductor chip.","In a variation of this exemplary embodiment, the trigger circuit can be configured to convert an input signal provided by an input signal generator into an input pulse having a desired fast rise time. For instance, the input signal can have a rise edge of about 50.0 picoseconds and the input pulse can have a rise edge in the range of about 20.0 picoseconds to about 30.0 picoseconds. The input signal generator can be, for instance, a ring oscillator or other suitable signal generator. In a particular embodiment, the trigger circuit can comprises an inverter chain. In another particular embodiment, the trigger circuit can comprise a Schmidt trigger circuit.","In yet another variation of this exemplary embodiment, the N-type field effect transistor can have an equivalent resistance when the N-type field effect transistor operates in the linear regime. The equivalent resistance of the N-type field effect transistor in series with the resistance of the load resistor can be substantially equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line for matching purposes.","A further exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure is directed to a method for generating an output pulse. The method includes providing a transmission line, a switching element and a trigger circuit on a common semiconductor substrate; charging the transmission line with a source voltage; providing an input pulse to the switching device from the trigger circuit to close the switching device; and discharging an output pulse from the transmission line across a load resistor when the switching device is closed.","These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.","Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.","Generally, the present disclosure is directed to a picosecond pulse generator circuit that utilizes a transmission line in combination with a switching element. The transmission line and the switching element are provided on a common semiconductor substrate or semiconductor chip, such as a common CMOS semiconductor substrate. A voltage is applied to the transmission line to charge the transmission line. An input pulse is applied to the switching device to trigger the switching device to cause the transmission line to discharge an output pulse across a load resistor. The pulse width of the output pulse depends in major part on the length of the transmission line. The amplitude of the output pulse depends in part on the charging voltage applied to the transmission line. Additional components can be provided on the common semiconductor substrate or chip to shape the input pulse to the switching device to ensure a fast rise time.","Referring now to , an exemplary picosecond pulse generator circuit  will now be disclosed. As illustrated, exemplary picosecond pulse generator circuit  includes a transmission line  having a signal line  and a ground line . A DC voltage source Vo is connected through charging resistor Rc to a source side of signal line  of transmission line . A switching device S is connected to the load side of signal line . A load resistor Ris connected to load side of ground line . The ground reference is connected between switching device S and R. The source side of ground line  is left floating.","DC voltage Vo is applied to transmission line  to charge transmission line. When switching device S is closed, transmission line discharges an output pulse across load resistor R. The duration of the output pulse is Vo\/2 with a duration time of 2 d\/v, where d is the length of transmission line  and v is the wave propagation velocity which can be calculated by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"v","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":"c","msqrt":{"msub":{"mi":["\u025b","r"]}}}}}},"br":{},"b":"110"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","200","202","204","204","206","204","204","202","200","200","204","204"],"sub":"load","i":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science"},"The switching speed of NFET  is significant to the present subject matter. In particular, the input pulse used to trigger NFET  preferably includes a fast rising edge. To attain such an input pulse with a fast rising edge, a trigger circuit  is used to shape an input signal into an input pulse have a fast rising edge. For instance, in one exemplary embodiment, a fast rising edge of an input pulse can be accomplished with Schmitt trigger  as illustrated in . In an alternative exemplary configuration, inverter chains as illustrated in , with adjusted threshold voltages, can be employed for this purpose. The obtained rise-time when using a Schmitt trigger  of , however, can be much shorter than the propagation delay of inverters in a ring oscillator since there are no P-type field effect transistors (P-FET) to complicate the process. Furthermore, the falling edge of the obtained trigger signal is not critical to the present subject matter, which simplifies the circuit design.","When operated in the linear regime, NFET  is equivalent to a resistor. Linear regime operation is illustrated in  by dashed line l\/Rfor an exemplary NFET device as may be employed with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. The equivalent resistance of NFET  and load resistor Rshould be equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line to satisfy matching conditions. As a result, the voltage drop across the equivalent resistance of NFET  is about half of the charging voltage Vo applied to transmission line  by way of charging resistor Rc.","The duration of the output pulse for the exemplary picosecond generator circuit depicted in  is about 2 d\/v, where d is the transmission line length and v is the signal transmission velocity on the transmission line. Under these operating criteria, the amplitude and duration of the output pulse are primarily determined by the charging voltage applied to the transmission line and the transmission line length, respectively.","With reference now to , there is illustrated an exemplary layout of a picosecond pulse generator on a common CMOS semiconductor substrate in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure using standard IBM 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS technology to implement the pulse generator circuit. In the exemplary configuration of , the on-chip CMOS transmission line or coplanar waveguide is about 500 \u03bcm long. The trigger circuit and the NFET are standard CMOS devices as will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.","With reference to , there are illustrated exemplary waveforms obtained from post layout simulation of the present technology wherein  represents input signals and  represents output signals. The input signal, illustrated as Vin , and noted as Input Signal in  has a 50 ps rise edge. Such input pulses can be easily obtained on chip, for instance by use of ring oscillators. The input signal is then converted to a pulse by trigger circuit  with about a 20 ps rise edge to drive the NFET  of . NFET  is driven into linear operation regime and effectively becomes a small valued resistor, which is connected in series with load resistor R.","From experimental observation it was determined that the obtained pulse had a full-width-half-magnitude (FWHM) of about 6 ps, which is close to the expected duration as determined by the 500 \u03bcm long line length and the signal velocity of 1.6\u00d710mm\/s. Further, experimental observation showed that the obtained pulse width was significantly shorter than the 50 ps FO4 for the technology used. It was also observed that the 10%-10% pulse width was about 8.6 ps.","When the transmission line length is reduced to 100 \u03bcm, the FWHM is not significantly reduced. The additional pulse duration is mainly caused by the relatively large parasitic capacitance of NFET  and the obtained pulse resembles that of an RC discharge circuit. Ideally, the obtained pulse amplitude should be Vo\/2 or about 800 mV. Schematic simulation gives about 720 mV as illustrated in . The layout simulation, however, yields about 217 mV. The significant signal amplitude difference is believed to be attributable to the deterioration of the trigger pulse rising edge in the layout as is shown in , where parasitic effects are severe for the simple layout used.","A more compact layout, such as Waffle layout as described by Wu et al. in \u201cA wide-band T\/R switch using enhanced compact waffle MOSFETs,\u201d , vol. 16, no. 5, pp. 287-289, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes, can be employed to improve the performance. The repetition rate of the output pulse is mainly determined by the charging time of the transmission lines. For the circuit in , the repetition rate is higher than 400 MHz.","Using the disclosures provided herein, those of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that a variety of different configurations of transmission lines and switching elements can be used to provide an picosecond pulse generator without deviating from the scope of the present invention. The transmission lines and switching devices can all be implemented on a common semiconductor substrate, such as a CMOS semiconductor substrate using CMOS technologies similar to the exemplary pulse generator circuit discussed in .
