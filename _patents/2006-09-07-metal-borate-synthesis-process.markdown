Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF) is commonly employed as the electrolyte salt in lithium ion batteries. Lithium hexafluorophosphate is characterized by solubility in aprotic solvents that results in an electrolyte characterized by high electrical conductivities and electrochemical stability. However, lithium hexafluorophosphate has limited applicability in future lithium ion batteries owing to a lack of thermal stability. In solution, lithium hexafluorophosphate dissociates into lithium fluoride and phosphorus pentafluoride which are then free to cationically polymerize electrolyte solvents. Additionally, lithium hexafluorophosphate releases hydrofluoric acid upon contact with moisture. Lithium hexafluorophosphate hydrolysis not only impedes safe handling but also leads to the degradation of transition metal oxides often utilized in electrochemical cells as a cathode material.","Considerable efforts have been made to develop alternative conducting salts to lithium hexafluorophosphate. Representative of these efforts is U.S. Pat. No. 4,505,997 that describes the use of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and lithium tris(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)methanide salts for use in battery electrolytes. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,874,616 and 6,319,428 describe the use of lithium perfluoro amide salts as battery electrolytes. While these salts display high anodic stability and form solutions having high electrical conductivity with organic carbonates, these same salts suffer the limitation of not adequately passivating aluminum. This is problematic since aluminum is a commonly used current collector for battery cathodes. Additionally, these salts tend to be comparatively difficult to produce and purify.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,210,830 and 6,423,454 describe perfluoro- or partially fluorinated-alkyl fluorophosphates as lithium ion battery electrolytes. While the thermal stability and hydrolysis resistance of these compounds as lithium salts are superior to lithium hexafluorophosphate, these salts are comparatively difficult to produce and as such significantly add to production costs for lithium ion batteries containing these salts. Barthel et al. (Journal of Electrochemical Society, 147, 2000, 21) teaches lithium organoborates as an electrolyte salt. These salts have met with limited acceptance owing to the inability to withstand high anodic potentials and the formation of unstable triorganoboranes.","DE 19829030 C1 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,506,516 describe lithium bisoxalatoborate as a battery electrolyte salt. Xu et al. (Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 5, 2002, A26) note that lithium bisoxalatoborates readily passivate aluminum, show good thermal stability, yet have met with limited acceptance owing to the poor solubility of bisoxalatoborate in conventional lithium ion battery organic solvents.","Zhang et al. (Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry, 7, 2003, 147) teach the use of lithium tetrafluoroborate as a lithium ion battery electrolyte salt demonstrating good cycling performance at low temperatures. However, lithium tetrafluoroborate suffers from comparatively low ionic conductivity which limits battery power density.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,232 and Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002\/0022181, 2002\/0081496 and 2003\/0100761 teach a class of cyclic compounds, some of which are lithium salts, which appear to offer lithium ion battery salts having good overall properties. However, the process of synthesizing such cells is inherently dangerous and inefficient.","Thus, there exists a need for an efficient process for the production of lithium ion battery salts.","A process for preparing a metal borate includes forming a carboxyl borate through the reaction of boric acid with a carboxylic acid followed by reaction of the resulting carboxyl borate with a halide salt.","A carboxyl borate is provided of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"32.09mm","wi":"58.67mm","file":"US07820323-20101026-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"29.55mm","wi":"54.95mm","file":"US07820323-20101026-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2 "],"sub":["1","12 ","6","14 ","1","12 ","1","12 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"13.72mm","wi":"13.21mm","file":"US07820323-20101026-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"13.72mm","wi":"18.29mm","file":"US07820323-20101026-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"12.19mm","wi":"10.75mm","file":"US07820323-20101026-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"17.10mm","wi":"13.72mm","file":"US07820323-20101026-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"3 ","sub":["1","12 ","6","14 ","1","12 ","1","12 ","0","10 ","1","12 ","4","18 ","4","18 "]},"An operative electrolyte includes a compound produced by an inventive process and a synergistic mixture of aprotic solvents.

The concentration of a halogenated borate according to the present invention in an electrolyte is typically between 0.01 and 3 molar, preferably from 0.01 to 2 molar, and most preferably from 0.1 to 1.5 molar.","An inventive halogenated borate is solvated to create an operative electrolyte.

These examples are not intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention, but rather to detail specific aspects thereof.","Synthesis of lithium oxalodifluoroborate (LiODFB). 27.0 grams of oxalic acid (0.3 mols) and 12.4 grams of boric acid (0.2 mols) are dissolved in ethanol containing 30% water. The resulting solution is dried with a rotary evaporator. The resulting mixture is heated to 120\u00b0 C. for six hours. A compound corresponding to formula (3) (0.1 mols) is obtained. The product (3) is dissolved in acetonitrile along with 10.4 grams (0.4 mols) lithium fluoride. The resulting solution is refluxed for six hours to yield LiODFB and dilithium oxalate. High purity LiODFB is obtained by recrystallization using a 1:1 volume ratio of acetonitrile\/toluene mixed solvent. The resulting halogenated borate is characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in order to confirm the product as LiODFB.","LiODFB electrolyte and its properties. Three electrolytes are prepared by dissolving 1.0 molar LiODFB produced in Example 1 in three solvents in 1:1:3 weight ratio, propylene carbonate (PC)-ethylene carbonate (EC)-ethyl methyl carbonate (ECM), 3:3:4 PC-EC-EMC, and 1:1:3 EC-EMC-gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), respectively. Ionic conductivities of these electrolytes are determined by measuring the impedance of a dip-type two-electrode cell. Ionic conductivities of the said electrolytes are plotted as a function of the temperature in , which indicates that the LiODFB is capable of providing high ionic conductivity. Cu and Al wires, which both have a diameter of 0.1 cm and have a length of 1.0 cm with a freshly scratched surface exposed to the solution, are respectively used to determine cathodic and anodic stability of the electrolytes since these are the most common materials for the current collector of the anode and cathode of lithium ion batteries.  shows that cathodic stability of the LiODFB electrolyte is only limited by plating and stripping of the metal lithium on Cu substrate due to the presence of lithium ions in the solution.  shows that A1 can be very well passivated near 4.2 V versus Li+\/Li, and that in the second sweep, the anodic currents ranged from zero up to 6.0 V. The above results prove that the LiODFB electrolytes are electrochemically stable for the operations of lithium ion batteries.","Li\/graphite and Li\/LiNiCOOhalf-cells. The electrolyte having a composition of 1.0 molar LiODFB is dissolved in 3:3:4 PC-EC-EMC mixed solvent, as prepared in Example 2 and is used to assemble Li\/graphite and Li\/LiNiCoOhalf-cells. These two cells are initially cycled two times at a current density of 0.1 mA\/cm, then cycled at 0.5 mA\/cm2 for all the following cycles.  and  show cycling performance of these two types of half-cells, respectively. It is shown that in the LiODFB electrolyte, both graphite and LiNiCoOare reversibly cycled with a good capacity retention.","Lithium ion cells and their cycling performance. Using the electrolyte, graphite, and LiNiCoOcathode, as described in Example 3, four identical lithium ion cells are assembled. All these four cells are formed two cycles at 0.1 mA\/cmbetween 2.5 V and 4.1 V.  shows voltage curves of the initial two forming cycles of such a typical cell. After two forming cycles, these cells are evaluated in the following conditions:","(1) Cell  is cycled at room temperature (\u02dc23\u00b0 C.) and cell  at 60\u00b0 C. with the same current density of 0.5 mA\/cmand voltage range of 2.5-4.1 V ().","(2) Cell  is charged at 20\u00b0 C. and discharged at different low temperatures under the same current density of 0.5 mA\/cmbetween 2.5 V and 4.1 V ().","(3) Cell  is charged at 0.5 mA\/cmand discharged at different discharge current density at 20\u00b0 C. between 2.5 V and 4.1 V ().","Comparison of the Li\/graphite half-cells without and with carboxyl borate coating. A graphite electrode as described in Example 3 was wetted with a mixed solution of 0.02 molar HBOand 0.03 molar HCOin methanol. After drying at room temperature, the electrode was further heated at 100-110\u00b0 C. under vacuum for 16 h so that a carboxyl borate layer was coated on the surface of the graphite electrode. Two Li\/graphite button cells with the same configuration but different graphite electrodes were assembled and filled with 150 \u03bcl of the liquid electrolyte composed of 1.0 molar LiBFdissolved in a 1:1:3 (wt.) PC-EC-EMC mixed solvent.  compares a change in the open-circuit voltage of these two fully lithiated cells at 45\u00b0 C.
