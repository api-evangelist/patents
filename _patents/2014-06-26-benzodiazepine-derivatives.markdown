The entire contents of each of the above-referenced applications are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to novel cytotoxic compounds and cytotoxic conjugates comprising these cytotoxic compounds and cell-binding agents. More specifically, this invention relates to novel benzodiazepine compounds (e.g., indolinobenzodiazepines or oxazolidinobenzodiazepines), derivatives thereof, intermediates thereof, conjugates thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as medicaments, in particular as antiproliferative agents.","Benzodiazepine derivatives are useful compounds for treating various disorders, and include medicaments such as, antiepileptics (imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,5]benzothiadiazepines, U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,688; U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,852), antibacterials (pyrimido[1,2-c][1,3,5]benzothiadiazepines, GB 1476684), diuretics and hypotensives (pyrrolo(1,2-b)[1,2,5]benzothiadiazepine 5,5 dioxide, U.S. Pat. No. 3,506,646), hypolipidemics (WO 03091232), anti-depressants (U.S. Pat. No. 3,453,266); osteoporosis (JP 2138272).","Recently, it has been shown in animal tumor models that benzodiazepine derivatives, such as pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs), act as anti-tumor agents (N-2-imidazolyl alkyl substituted 1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine-1,1-dioxide, U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,746), benzo-pyrido or dipyrido thiadiazepine (WO 2004\/069843), pyrrolo[1,2-b][1,2,5]benzothiadiazepines and pirrole[1,2-b][1,2,5]benzodiazepine derivatives (WO2007\/015280), tomaymycin derivatives (e.g., pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines), such as those described in WO 00\/12508, WO2005\/085260, WO2007\/085930, and EP 2019104. Benzodiazepines are also known to affect cell growth and differentiation (Kamal A., et al., Bioorg Med. Chem. 2008 Aug. 15; 16(16):7804-10 (and references cited therein); Kumar R, Mini Rev Med.

The PBDs differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their potential for use as antiproliferative agents.","There still exists a need for novel benzodiazepine derivatives as effective and safe therapeutics for treating a variety of proliferative disease states, such as cancer.","One object of the invention is to provide novel benzodiazepines of formula (I) and (II), in which the diazepine ring (B) is fused with a heterocyclic ring (CD), wherein the heterocyclic ring is bicyclic,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"64.52mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09265841-20160223-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001","he":"2.12mm","wi":"2.12mm","file":"US09265841-20160223-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},"sub":["2","3","3","2","2","n","7","8","9","2","10","2","3","3","2","11","11 ","11","12","7","8","9","10","11 ","12 ","2","2","n","10 ","13 ","12","13 ","2","2","n","11 ","14","14 ","2","2","1","2","3","4","2","2","n","7","8","9","2","1","2","3","3","2","2","11","11 ","11","12 ","7","8","9","10","11 ","12 ","1","2","3","4 ","5 ","15","15 ","15","15 ","5 ","6 ","6 ","2","n","15","16","17","15","16 ","17 ","2","2","n"]},"A second object of the invention is to provide novel benzodiazepines of formula (III), in which the diazepine ring (B) is fused with a heterocyclic ring (C), wherein the heterocyclic ring is monocyclic,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"22.61mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09265841-20160223-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002","he":"2.46mm","wi":"3.13mm","file":"US09265841-20160223-P00002.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},"sub":["2","3","3","2","2","n","7","8","9","2","10","2","3","3","2","11","11 ","11","12","7","8","9","10","11 ","12 ","2","2","n","10 ","13 ","13","13 ","2","2","n","11 ","14","14 ","2","2","5 ","15","15 ","15","15 ","6 ","6 ","2","2","2","2 ","2","n"]},"A third object of the invention is to provide cytotoxic dimers (IV), (V) and (VI)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"150.62mm","wi":"136.82mm","file":"US09265841-20160223-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003","he":"2.46mm","wi":"3.13mm","file":"US09265841-20160223-P00002.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},"sub":["2","3","3","2","2","n","7","8","9","2","10 ","2","3","3","2","11","11 ","11","12","7","8","9","10","11 ","12 ","2","2","n","10 ","13 ","13","13 ","11 ","14","14 ","2","2","1","2","3","4","1","2","3","4","2","2","n","2","7","8","9","2","10","2","3","3","2","11","11 ","11","12 ","7","8","9","10","11 ","12 ","1","2","3","4","1","2","3","4","2","n","15","16","17","15","16 ","17 ","2","2","n","6 ","6 ","2","2 ","2","2 ","2","n","2 ","15 ","15","15 ","7","8","9","2","10","2","3","3","2","11","11 ","11","12","7","8","9","10","11 ","12 ","2","2","n","7","8","9","2","10","2","3","3","2","11","11 ","11","12","7","8","9","10","11 ","12 ","2","2","n"]},"A fourth object of the invention is to provide conjugates of cell binding agents with the novel benzodiazepine compounds or derivatives thereof of the present invention.

Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as crystallization, electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and I or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","A substituent is \u201csubstitutable\u201d if it comprises at least one carbon, sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen atom that is bonded to one or more hydrogen atoms. Thus, for example, hydrogen, halogen, and cyano do not fall within this definition.","If a substituent is described as being \u201csubstituted,\u201d a non-hydrogen substituent is in the place of a hydrogen substituent on a carbon, oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent wherein at least one non-hydrogen substituent is in the place of a hydrogen substituent on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro substituent, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro substituents. It should be recognized that if there is more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen substituent may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted,\u201d the substituent may be either (1) not substituted, or (2) substituted. If a carbon of a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with one or more of a list of substituents, one or more of the hydrogens on the carbon (to the extent there are any) may separately and\/or together be replaced with an independently selected optional substituent. If a nitrogen of a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with one or more of a list of substituents, one or more of the hydrogens on the nitrogen (to the extent there are any) may each be replaced with an independently selected optional substituent. One exemplary substituent may be depicted as \u2014NR\u2032R,\u2033 wherein R\u2032 and R\u2033 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, may form a heterocyclic ring. The heterocyclic ring formed from R\u2032 and R\u2033 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached may be partially or fully saturated. In one embodiment, the heterocyclic ring consists of 3 to 7 atoms. In another embodiment, the heterocyclic ring is selected from the group consisting of pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyridyl and thiazolyl.","This specification uses the terms \u201csubstituent,\u201d \u201cradical,\u201d and \u201cgroup\u201d interchangeably.","If a group of substituents are collectively described as being optionally substituted by one or more of a list of substituents, the group may include: (1) unsubstitutable substituents, (2) substitutable substituents that are not substituted by the optional substituents, and\/or (3) substitutable substituents that are substituted by one or more of the optional substituents.","If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen substituents, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen substituents or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen substituents, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen substituents as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. Such substituents, in non-limiting examples, can be selected from a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, halogen, guanidinium [\u2014NH(C\u2550NH)NH], OR, NRR, NO, NRCOR\u2032, SR, a sulfoxide represented by SOR\u2032, a sulfone represented by \u2014SOR\u2032, a sulfite \u2014SO, a bisulfite \u2014OSO, a sulfonamide represented by SONRR\u2032, cyano, an azido, \u2014COR, OCORor OCONRRwherein R, R, R, R, Rand Rare each independently selected from H, linear, branched or cyclic alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a polyethylene glycol unit (\u2014OCHCH), wherein n is an integer from 1 to 2000, aryl having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, heterocyclic ring having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a compound of the invention that is capable of being enzymatically or hydrolytically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., Wilman, \u201cProdrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy\u201d Biochemical Society Transactions, 14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast (1986) and Stella et al., \u201cProdrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,\u201d Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press (1985).

Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, compounds of the invention and chemotherapeutic agents such as described above.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d is also meant to include a derivative of a compound that can hydrolyze, oxidize, or otherwise react under biological conditions (in vitro or in vivo) to provide a compound of this invention. Prodrugs may only become active upon such reaction under biological conditions, or they may have activity in their unreacted forms. Examples of prodrugs contemplated in this invention include, but are not limited to, analogs or derivatives of compounds of any one of the formulae disclosed herein that comprise biohydrolyzable moieties such as biohydrolyzable amides, biohydrolyzable esters, biohydrolyzable carbamates, biohydrolyzable carbonates, biohydrolyzable ureides, and biohydrolyzable phosphate analogues. Other examples of prodrugs include derivatives of compounds of any one of the formulae disclosed herein that comprise \u2014NO, \u2014NO, \u2014ONO, or \u2014ONOmoieties.

Examples of biohydrolyzable carbamates include, but are not limited to, lower alkylamines, substituted ethylenediamines, amino acids, hydroxyalkylamines, heterocyclic and heteroaromatic amines, and polyether amines. Particularly favored prodrugs and prodrug salts are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a mammal.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate \u201cmesylate\u201d, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, pamoate (i.e., 1,1\u2032-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts, alkali metal (e.g., sodium and potassium) salts, alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium) salts, and ammonium salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and\/or one or more counter ion.","If the compound of the invention is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.","If the compound of the invention is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like.

representative monomer compound of the present invention, exemplified by indolinobenzodiazepine compound 8, is shown in . Starting from commercially available indoline-2-carboxylic acid 1, its methyl ester 2 was prepared in quantitative yield by reaction with thionyl chloride in methanol. Methyl indoline-2-carboxylate 2 was coupled with the acid chloride 4, or directly with acid 3, to furnish the amide 5, which was further reduced with diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL) to the aldehyde 6. While, many methods can be used to reduce the nitro functional group of formula 5 to the corresponding amino group, in this example sodium dithionite was used to conveniently convert to aldehyde 6 to the ring closed compound 7 after further treatment with methanol under acidic conditions. The benzyl protecting group was removed to furnish monomer 8.","The process of preparation of the oxazolidinobenzodiazepine monomer compound of formula 14 of the invention is shown in . Starting from commercially available compound 9, its methyl ester 10 was prepared in quantitative yield by treatment with thionyl chloride in methanol. Compound 10 was deprotected followed by coupling with the acetyl chloride 4 or directly with acid 3 to furnish the amide 11, which was further converted to the aldehyde 12.

Cell-binding agents may be of any kind presently known, or that become known and includes peptides and non-peptides. Generally, these can be antibodies (especially monoclonal antibodies), lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, vitamins, nutrient-transport molecules (such as transferrin), or any other cell-binding molecule or substance.","More specific examples of cell-binding agents that can be used include:","polyclonal antibodies;","monoclonal antibodies;","fragments of antibodies such as Fab, Fab\u2032, and F(ab\u2032), Fv (Parham, 131:2895-2902 (1983); Spring et al. 113:470-478 (1974); Nisonoff et al. 89:230-244 (1960));","interferons (e.g. alpha., .beta., .gamma.);","lymphokines such as IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6;","hormones such as insulin, TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone), MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone), steroid hormones, such as androgens and estrogens;","growth factors and colony-stimulating factors such as EGF, TGF-alpha, FGF, VEGF, G-CSF, M-CSF and GM-CSF (Burgess, 5:155-158 (1984));","transferrin (O'Keefe et al. 260:932-937 (1985)); and","vitamins, such as folate.","Monoclonal antibody techniques allow for the production of extremely specific cell-binding agents in the form of specific monoclonal antibodies. Particularly well known in the art are techniques for creating monoclonal antibodies produced by immunizing mice, rats, hamsters or any other mammal with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell, antigens isolated from the target cell, whole virus, attenuated whole virus, and viral proteins such as viral coat proteins. Sensitized human cells can also be used. Another method of creating monoclonal antibodies is the use of phage libraries of scFv (single chain variable region), specifically human scFv (see e.g., Griffiths et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,885,793 and 5,969,108; McCafferty et al., WO 92\/01047; Liming et al., WO 99\/06587). In addition, resurfaced antibodies disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,641 may also be used, as may chimeric antiobodies and humanized antibodies. Selection of the appropriate cell-binding agent is a matter of choice that depends upon the particular cell population that is to be targeted, but in general human monoclonal antibodies are preferred if an appropriate one is available.","For example, the monoclonal antibody MY9 is a murine IgGantibody that binds specifically to the CD33 Antigen {J. D. Griffin et al 8 Leukemia Res., 521 (1984)} and can be used if the target cells express CD33 as in the disease of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Similarly, the monoclonal antibody anti-B4 is a murine IgG, that binds to the CD19 antigen on B cells {Nadler et al, 131 J. Immunol. 244-250 (1983)} and can be used if the target cells are B cells or diseased cells that express this antigen such as in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphoblastic leukemia HuB4 is a resurfaced antibody derived from the murine anti-B4 antibody (Roguska et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 91, pg 969-973). HuN901 is a humanized antibody that binds to the CD56 antigen expressed on small cell lung cancer, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer and other solid tumors including neuroendocrine cancers (Roguska et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 91, pg 969-973). B38.1 is a chimeric antibody targeting EpCAM. Fully human antibodies such as panitumumab targeting the EGF receptor expressed on several solid tumors may also be used (Van Cutsem et al., J Clin Oncol. 2007; 25(13):1658-1664). The cell-binding agent that comprises the conjugates and the modified cell-binding agents of the present invention may be of any kind presently known, or that become known, and includes peptides and non-peptides. The cell-binding agent may be any compound that can bind a cell, either in a specific or non-specific manner. Generally, these can be antibodies (especially monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments), interferons, lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, vitamins, nutrient-transport molecules (such as transferrin), or any other cell-binding molecule or substance.","Where the cell-binding agent is an antibody, it binds to an antigen that is a polypeptide and may be a transmembrane molecule (e.g. receptor) or a ligand such as a growth factor.

An average of 2.2 IGN23 molecules per molecule of antibody were linked.","A solution of chB38.1 antibody at a concentration of 2 mg\/mL in an aqueous buffer containing 0.05 M N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-N\u2032-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and 2 mM ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.5 was treated with a 12-fold molar excess of a solution of IGN27-NHS in dimethylacetamide (DMA, 5 mM stock) such that the final concentration of DMA in the buffer was 15% v\/v. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hr and then loaded on to a Sephadex G25 gel filtration column (HiPrep\u212226\/10 Desalting Column GE#17-5087-01) that had been previously equilibrated into an aqueous buffer containing PBS pH 7.4. The conjugated antibody-containing fractions were collected and pooled to yield product.

An average of 2.9 IGN27 molecules per molecule of antibody were linked.","General Procedure Used: Samples of IGN Free Drugs or IGN Conjugates were added to 96-well flat bottomed tissue culture plates and titrated using serial dilutions to cover the desired molar range. Antigen positive (Ag+) or Antigen negative (Ag\u2212) cells were added to the wells in specific cell densities in such a way that there were triplicate samples for each drug concentration for each corresponding cell line. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere of 5% COfor 4-5 days depending on the cell line.

The absorbance in each well was measured and the surviving fraction of cells at each concentration was plotted to reveal the cytotoxicity and antigen specificity (of the conjugates).","The cytotoxicity of the IGN Free Drugs and the potency and specificity of the IGN conjugates were measured against a panel of human cancer cell lines selected from COLO 205, NB-4, LOVO, Namalwa, RH30, Ramos, KB, and\/or LOVO.

COLO 205 tumor cells, 2\u00d710cells\/mouse were subcutaneously inoculated at a volume of 0.1 mL\/mouse in the area over the right shoulder of female athymic nude mice, 5 weeks of age. Eight days after tumor cell inoculation mice were randomized into groups (n=6 per group) by tumor volume. Treatment was initiated the day of randomization, and groups included a control group dosed with PBS (200 L\/injection), naked chB38.1 antibody (2.8 mg\/kg), non-targeting chKTI-IGN14 (50 \u03bcg\/kg) conjugate and chB38.1-IGN14 (50 \u03bcg\/kg IGN14 dose; 2.5 mg\/kg antibody dose). All treatments were administered twice on a weekly schedule (day 8 and 15, post-cell inoculation). Arrows indicate dosing times post inoculation. All treatments were well tolerated with the mean body weight losses comparable to loss seen in PBS control mice. Median tumor volume vs time is shown () with the data demonstrating the anti-tumor activity of the chB38.1-IGN14 conjugate. Both the non-targeting and the naked antibody show no activity beyond that seen with the vehicle control, suggesting that the anti-tumor activity observed with the chB38.1-IGN-14 conjugate is antigen-specific.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0511","num":"0588"},"figref":"FIG. 59"}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 14 and 15","sub":"n "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 18-19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIGS. 21-26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 28-30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 31","sub":"50 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 32","sub":"50 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 33-36","b":["39","42","43","44","48","49","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 37","b":["38","40","41","45","46","47"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 51"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 52","b":["54","56","57","58"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIGS. 53 and 55"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 59"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
