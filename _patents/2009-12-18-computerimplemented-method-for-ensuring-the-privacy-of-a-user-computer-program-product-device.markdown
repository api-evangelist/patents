Priority Claim","This application claims the benefit of priority from European Patent Application No. 09 011 182.4-1245, filed Aug. 31, 2009, which is incorporated by reference.","2. Technical Field","This application relates to a computer-implemented method for ensuring the privacy of a user, a computer program product, and a device.","According to an aspect, a computer-implemented method for ensuring the privacy of a user and the utility of data communicated by a device, such as a vehicle telematics device, to a server. The method may comprise receiving data at the device during a time period; processing, by the device, the received data; summarizing, by the device, the processed data in a matrix, wherein the rows and columns of the matrix define circumstances of movement of the device, wherein the matrix includes a plurality of matrix-entries, and wherein each matrix-entry includes a distance covered by the device during a time period under a pair of circumstances of movement; and transmitting the summarized data from the device to the server.","Summarizing the data in the matrix as described above may have the effect of ensuring the privacy of the user and the utility of the data communicated by the device. This is because the summarization reduces the processed data to the distance covered and the circumstances of movement under which the distance was covered. Thus, the transmitted data may not include sensitive user data, thereby ensuring the user's privacy. However, since the transmitted data includes the distance covered and the circumstances of movement, the transmitted data retains utility.","It may be understood that summarizing the data may refer to compressing and aggregating (e.g. statistically aggregating) the data. In particular, summarizing may refer to converting a distance covered at a specific velocity to distance covered at a range of velocities.","The processed data may include at least one of position data, velocity data, and time data. In addition, the velocity data may indicate a speed at which the device has been moved. The term \u201cvelocity\u201d may refer to a vector having a direction and a value. The term \u201cspeed\u201d may refer to the value of the velocity.","The method may further comprise correlating the position data and\/or the velocity data and\/or the time data with map information stored on the device; determining, by the device and based on the correlation, that the user has performed an action with an associated consequence; and generating, in particular communicating, by the device, an alert in response to the action.","The alert may be understood as a simple way of interacting with the user without distracting the user. The alert may be communicated and may include a visual display and\/or audio sound in such a way that substantially no distracting signals are provided that do not relate to the alert. The alert may provide information that is otherwise not available to the user of the device such as a driver of a vehicle. Thus, the alert may be a simple way to inform the user of the action. This simplification may also reduce costs, e.g. the cost of displaying a map. Furthermore, in view of the alert, the user may be able to take corrective action to improve his driving (e.g. respond to alerts, avoid future alerts, etc.).","The method may also comprise encrypting, before transmission, the summarized data, wherein the summarized data can be decrypted by the server without assistance from the user. In addition, the method may comprise encrypting, before the transmission, the processed data corresponding to the action, wherein the processed data can only be decrypted with a key of the user. Furthermore, the method may comprise transmitting the encrypted processed data from the device to the server.","The two different types of encryption may have the effect of improving the security of the processed data. Thus, the processed data may be stored on the server while still ensuring the privacy of the user, since this data can only be accessed with the consent of the user (e.g. by means of a secret key of the user). By encrypting the summarized data in a way that it can be decrypted without the assistance of the user, the summarized data may be protected from third parties. Furthermore, the summarized data can be used and processed at the server.","Moreover, by only encrypting and transmitting the processed data to the server in response to the action of the user, CPU load on the device is conserved and network traffic is reduced. Nevertheless, there is sufficient data (the encrypted processed data) stored at the server to fully document the action of the user that generated the alert.","In some specific embodiments, the summarized data may be encrypted using a public key of the server or a secret key shared between the user and the server. Some embodiments may specify that the processed data is encrypted with a secret key of the user or a public key of the user. In addition, some specific embodiments may specify the simultaneous transmission of encrypted processed data and encrypted summarized data.","It may be that the predefined circumstances of movement include one or more of the following a velocity range at which the device covered the distance; a rate of acceleration at which the device covered the distance; a speed limit corresponding to at least one position within the distance covered by the device; or a road category corresponding to at least one position covered by the device.","The rate of acceleration may be determined using a sensor, or acceleration may be calculated based on a change in velocity over a period of time. In other words, the acceleration may be determined empirically using a sensor and\/or may be determined mathematically as the first order time derivative of the velocity and\/or the second order time derivative of the position, wherein velocity and\/or position may be obtained empirically e.g. using a GPS sensor.","Accordingly, the map information may comprise a set of map coordinates. It may be that correlating the position data and the velocity data further comprises correlating the position data and the velocity data with a road category and\/or a speed limit linked to the set of map coordinates.","Furthermore, the action may include one or more of the following: exceeding a speed limit; exceeding a predefined rate of acceleration; approaching and or being at a position that presents a risk to the user.","Moreover, it may be that the device does not display the map information. Consequently, the alert may be communicated and may include a visual display and\/or audio sound in such a way that substantially no distracting signals are provided that do not relate to the alert. Thus, the alert may be a simple way to inform the user of the action. This simplification may also reduce costs, e.g. the cost of displaying a map on the device, or providing a sophisticated display.","Also, it may be that at least one matrix entry Eis composed of a plurality of elements, wherein each element eof the plurality of elements defines a distance. Furthermore, the distance defined by the element emay have been covered during a time interval which is nonadjacent to the time interval during which the distance defined by the next element ewas covered. In addition, it may be that the plurality of elements of each matrix entry defines the distance covered by the device during the time period under the pair of predefined circumstances of movement corresponding to said matrix entry, and it may be that the plurality of matrix entries defines the distance covered by the device during the time period.","In the text above,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","ij"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["e","ij","k"]}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"In some embodiments, the matrix may have a maximum size of 30\u00d730. In other words, values of i and j may be in the range of 0 to a maximum value of 29. It is also possible that the maximum value is less than 29. In a preferred embodiment, a size of the matrix may be 26\u00d726. In other words, values of i and j may be in the range of 0 to 30, preferably 10 to 30 more preferably 20 to 30. In some cases the matrix may not be square (e.g. an ecological matrix).","In some implementations, a smallest size of an element emay be 10 meters. Other implementations, e.g. the smallest size of 20 m, 50 m or 1 km, are also possible. In some cases, a matrix entry may be 0. Also, a matrix entry may be composed of only one element.","Accordingly, the device may be embedded in a vehicle. Also, the method may comprise compensating the user because the device is embedded in the vehicle.","Additionally, the matrix may be used to calculate an indication of driving behavior.","In some embodiments, the method may comprise: aggregating the transmitted data with data from at least one other device at the server, and generating statistical data based on the aggregated data at the server, as well as providing a web portal, wherein the user is able to access the statistical data and\/or the summarized data of the user by means of the web portal.","It may be that the web portal comprises two web portals, where a first web portal is designed to be accessed from a personal computer and a second web portal is designed to be accessed from the telematics device. It may be desirable to have two web portals in order to account for limited capabilities of the telematics device. It may be that the web portal is a dynamic web portal, which may include that the device accessing the web portal may be deduced and the information\/data provided by the web portal may be adapted to the device. Hence, a user accessing the web portal using a mobile device, such as a PDA, may receive different data compared to when accessing the web portal using a network computer. Accordingly, the network is used in an optimum manner regarding the device trying to access the portal.","The display of summarized and aggregated data at the portal may result in an improved man-machine interaction. Since the user is provided with online feedback related to his driving behavior and\/or fuel consumption, the user may be able to take corrective action to improve his driving (e.g. avoid risks, reduce fuel consumption, etc.).","According to another aspect, a computer program product is provided. The computer program product may comprise computer-readable instructions which may be stored on a computer-readable medium or provided as a data signal, such that when the instructions are loaded and executed on a device having a memory and processor, such as a vehicle telematics device, the instructions cause the device to perform operations according to the method aspect described above.","According to yet another aspect, a device, such as a vehicle telematics device is provided. The device may comprise: a receiver operable to receive data during a time period, wherein the received data indicates that the device has been moved during the time period; a processor operable to process the received data, and summarize the processed data in a matrix, wherein the rows and columns of the matrix define circumstances of movement of the device, wherein the matrix includes a plurality matrix-entries, and wherein each matrix-entry includes a distance covered by the device during the time period under a pair of said predefined circumstances of movement; and a transmitter operable to transmit the summarized data to the server.","In some embodiments, the device is a mobile device, such as a mobile telephone. It may be that the device is physically embedded in a vehicle, and wherein the device uses an interface of the vehicle to communicate.","In accordance with the methods, systems, program, and devices described herein, manufacturing\/installation costs and also the technical complexity of the device may be reduced by avoiding duplication of vehicle components in the device.","As used herein, a \u201ctelematics device\u201d may be understood as a telecommunication device capable of sending, receiving and storing information.

The private key may be used as part of a public-private key pair or for digital authentication (e.g. digital signing of a message).","Ensuring the \u201cprivacy\u201d of a user may be understood to include protecting the data of the user, in particular, protecting sensitive data of the user. Sensitive data may include the following: position data, time data, and the identity of the user; sensitive data may further include a combination of one or more of these data elements.","Ensuring the \u201cutility\u201d of data communicated by a device may be understood to include providing data that is useful to a receiver of the communicated data.","\u201cSummarizing\u201d processed data may be understood as reducing the processed data in a way that relevant data is retained and sensitive data is eliminated. Summarizing data may have the effect of eliminating sensitive data while retaining useful data. Summarizing data may be understood as a form of processing data. Thus, summarizing the processed data may be understood as a way of processing the processed data. Moreover, summarizing may be understood as creating matrix entries from the data.","\u201cMoving the device\u201d may be performed by the user. For example, the device may be in a vehicle driven by the user from one location to another location. In addition, the time period during which the device is moved may be predefined.

Consequently, the pair of circumstances of movement for the matrix entry at row 1 column 1 are a velocity range of 0-50 km\/h and a speed limit of 50 km\/h, where the value of the matrix entry is 21 km.

The second row defines a velocity range of 50-100 km\/h, and the third row defines a range of 100-150 km\/h, where the velocity ranges of 50-100 km\/h and 100-150 km\/h are exemplary circumstances of movement.

Each matrix entry may be composed of a plurality of elements. For example, the entry at row 2, column 1 of the speed matrix has the value 56 km. 56 km may be understood as the distance covered under the pair of circumstances of movement defined by row 2, column 1 (i.e. a speed limit of 100 km\/h and a speed range of between 0-50 km\/h). A time period, programmed into the device, is defined as one day. According to the example, the matrix entry with the value of 56 km is composed of 3 elements. The first element was recorded in the matrix entry when the user  drove the vehicle  20 km at 40 km\/h in an area where the speed limit was 100 km\/h. The second element was recorded later in the time period when the user  drove the vehicle  20 km at 30 km\/h in a different area where the speed limit was also 100 km\/h. The third element was recorded even later in the time period when the user  drove the vehicle  16 km at 35 km\/h in yet another area where the speed limit was 100 km\/h. Other elements of different matrix entries may have been recorded while the elements of the example were recorded.","In some situations, it may be that position data is uploaded to the SDP  along with one or more matrices. The position data may be uploaded when the user performs an action with an associated consequence. The action may be risky driving behaviour (e.g. exceeding a speed limit), driving behaviour with adverse environmental consequences (e.g. a high rate of acceleration), driving in a dangerous area (e.g. an icy area) or driving at a dangerous time of day (e.g. at night). The consequence may be an increase in the fee changed to the user  by the service provider . When the position data is uploaded to the SDP , the position data may be encrypted with a secret key of the user. Encrypting position data with the secret key of the user may have the effect of protecting the privacy of the user. The user  may choose to allow the SDP  or the service provider  to decrypt the position data in order to avoid paying additional fees (e.g. the user may be able to use the position data to show that he was not at the position at the time the action occurred).","The SDP  may confirm receipt of the event message at S. At S, in an additional message or in the same confirmation message, the SDP  may provide a URL for a new configuration for telematics device . The URL may be used to download the new configuration. A code may be provided in the message sent at S to indicate that the data sent at S was accepted and processed. Alternatively, a message may be sent at S indicating whether a new configuration is available for download by the telematics device , and that the event data sent at S could not be processed.","It may be that the SDP  aggregates data from several telematics devices (including telematics device ) and performs statistical analysis on the aggregated data before forwarding the aggregated data to the service provider . The statistical analysis performed by the SDP  may involve aggregation of data similar to the aggregation described above in connection with the three exemplary matrices (i.e. the matrices for speed, ecological driving behaviour, and risk). One distinguishing feature of the statistical analysis performed at the SDP  may be that it takes place over a longer time period, e.g. a week. For example, 7 risk matrices from the telematics device  can be sent to the SDP  over the course of a week. At the end of the week, the SDP  aggregates the 7 matrices into one matrix (possibly by adding up the corresponding values), and then sends the result to the service provider .","It may be that the SDP  stores the speed, ecological, and risk matrices. In practice, the matrices may be sparse, since some drivers do not drive in the early morning, and entries corresponding to this time slice may all be 0. Also, a number of speeding violations, e.g. 100 km\/h in the centre of a city, are rare. It may be advisable to compress the matrices with sparse block compressed row storage or Harwell-Boeing format before storing the matrices, and possibly before transmitting the matrices from the telematics device  to the SDP . Thus, it may be possible to reduce bandwidth consumed by sending matrices by compressing the matrices (e.g. eliminating or reducing matrix entries with a value of 0) or not sending matrices when the matrix entries are all 0.","The speed, ecological and risk matrices may be transmitted from the telematics device  to the SDP  in XML format. In order to minimize the quantity of data sent, and thereby minimize the cost of transmitting the data, matrix data may be transmitted in an XML list format.
