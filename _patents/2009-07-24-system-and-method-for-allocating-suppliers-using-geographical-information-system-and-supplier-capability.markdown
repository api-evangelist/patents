{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to supply chain systems, and more particularly to allocating suppliers using geographical information system and supplier capability.","A supply chain (e.g., retail chains) could include hundreds of customers and suppliers, and it is not trivial to allocate suppliers to customers. Effective allocation of suppliers is helpful in sizing the suppliers, and lead to better customer services and reduced costs (e.g., inventory), better utilization of resources such as warehousing space, transportation fleet. While the traditional methods for supplier selection are based on price, current inventory, historical records, business relationship and distance between the supplier and customer, they may not always provide an effective solution.","A method and system for allocating suppliers to customers are provided. The method, in one aspect, may include locating a plurality of suppliers in a geographical information system and determining relative capability associated with each of the plurality of suppliers. The method may also include for each supplier in the plurality of suppliers, generating lines by connecting said each supplier to neighboring suppliers in the plurality of suppliers; establishing relative capability points on the lines between said each supplier and the neighboring suppliers; defining boundaries of a coverage region associated with said each supplier based on the relative capability points; and allocating a customer located in the coverage region to the associated supplier of the coverage region.","A system for allocating suppliers to customers, in one aspect, may include a locator module operable to locate a plurality of suppliers in a geographical information system. A processing module may be operable to determine relative capability associated with each of the plurality of suppliers. For each supplier in the plurality of suppliers, the processing module may be further operable to generate lines by linking said each supplier to neighboring suppliers in the plurality of suppliers, establish relative capability points on the lines between said each supplier and the neighboring suppliers, and define boundaries of a coverage region associated with said each supplier based on the relative capability points. The processing module may be further operable to allocate a customer located in the coverage region to the associated supplier of the coverage region. The system may also include a user interface module operable to present allocation of customers to suppliers.","A program storage device readable by a machine, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine to perform one or more methods described herein may be also provided.","Further features as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements.","System and method are presented that automatically allocate suppliers to customers using geographical information system (GIS). GIS generally may be an information system that provides geographical information, for example, including mapping software or the like. It stores, displays, edits, and analyzes data that is linked to location, and it may allow users to create queries, edit existing data, add new data, and present results through its Application Programming Interfaces (API) or the like. The system and method in one aspect utilize GIS and relative supplier capability to automatically allocate suppliers to customers by selecting suppliers by splitting the geographical space into polygons with consideration of relative capabilities of suppliers and overlaying customer locations onto it. For example, a given geographical area may be divided into multiple areas of polygon shape or having polygonal boundaries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"102","br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["C=w","C","+w","C","+w","C","+w","C"],"sub":["1","1","2","2","3","3","4","4 ","1 ","2 ","3 ","4 ","1 ","2 ","3 ","4 "]},"Table 1 shows example relative capability computed based on a parameter, average on-hand inventory level.

Each supplier has an address (or geocode: longitude and latitude) or the like, and GIS may be used with such supplier location data to locate the supplier on a geographical map.","Referring to , at , for each supplier, steps , ,  and  are performed. At , lines are generated to link each supplier to neighboring suppliers, i.e., connections are made between a supplier and its neighboring suppliers. Generating the lines may include deriving a linear equation connecting the points (e.g., representing the supplier locations). A user interface may display the lines by drawing the connections.  shows an example of such links or connections or the like (e.g., ) with respect to supplier  (). Each of the suppliers, e.g.,  shown in  may be mapped similarly. An instruction may be given inside of GIS system to draw a line between two nodes (e.g., between two suppliers) iteratively.","Referring again to , at , relative capability is marked as a point on a line linking the suppliers. The position of the mark on the line is determined based on the relative capability of the supplier  () relative to the capability of the supplier () that the supplier  () is linked to. For example, based on the data in Table 1, the relative capability between the supplier  and supplier  is 30:32 or 15:16. If the distance between the supplier  and  are 100 miles, then the relative capability mark is positioned 48.3 8 miles, i.e., 100*15\/(15+16), away from the supplier  and 51.62 miles away from the supplier .  illustrates an example of relative capability mark () placed on a line connecting supplier  () and its neighboring supplier (). At least one relative capability point is placed between two suppliers.","At , lines or connections or the like are drawn on the relative capability marks or points or the like, and perpendicular to the lines drawn between suppliers. For instance, a line that passes through the relative capability mark and that is perpendicular or orthogonal to the line connecting a supplier to its neighboring supplier is drawn. Such perpendicular line may be drawn for each of the relative capability mark.  shows examples of the perpendicular lines. Take for example supplier  () and its neighboring supplier (). A perpendicular line () to the line () connecting the two suppliers is drawn or placed through the relative capability point ().","At , Minimal region around the supplier is determined. For example, to find the minimal region around the supplier, intersections between the perpendicular lines are determined. Intersections are then associated, for example, via a line from supplier  to the intersections. If the associated lines do not cross another perpendicular line, the intersection point forms a boundary point for the minimal region. An example is shown in . For each intersection (e.g., , ), association lines (e.g., , ) are formed or drawn between the supplier () and the intersections. The association line () does not cross any perpendicular lines, therefore, the intersection point () forms a boundary point. On the other hand, the association line () crosses a perpendicular line () to get to the intersection (). Thus, this intersection point () is not used in determining the minimal region. In the similar manner, all intersection points around the supplier () are established. The perpendicular lines connecting those intersection points form the minimal region. The minimal region formed accordingly is shown in . A minimal region for another supplier (e.g., suppliers -) may be formed similarly.","At , the entire map is split or divided into coverage regions and critical regions. Coverage regions refer to the minimal regions determined for each of the suppliers in the region being considered. Critical regions refer to those areas in the region being considered that are not covered by any of the minimal regions for the suppliers. That is, no suppliers are located within the boundaries that form the critical regions. Critical regions result from the above-described intersection connecting method when determining the minimal regions.  shows an example of covered and critical regions.","At , customers are located in GIS. Each customer has an address or geocode that specifies the longitude and latitude, or the like, and GIS may be used with the customer location data to locate the customer on the map.  shows examples of customer locations overlaid on top of the map having covered and critical regions, where the circles represent the location of the customers. At , the customers located in coverage regions are allocated to corresponding suppliers.  shows an example of the customer locations mapped to the covered and critical regions. For example, customers (, ) located within the minimal region () for supplier  () are allocated to supplier . Other customers are similarly allocated to other suppliers based on their GIS locations and defined minimal regions associated with the other suppliers.","At , the customers in critical regions are allocated by applying an allocation rule.  illustrates an example of customers in located in critical regions. For instance, customers (, , ) are allocated to suppliers based on one or more allocation rules. An example of an allocation rule may include but is not limited to choosing a supplier with highest relative capability in the adjacent suppliers. For example, the customer  is located in a critical region and has three neighboring suppliers (,  and ). Using the relative capability as allocation rule, the supplier  is chosen as the supplier for the customer  because the relative capability of supplier  is 32 while that of supplier  and  is only 30. Another example of an allocation rule may be choosing the closest supplier.","At , customer allocation information is exported from the GIS. A computer code or instruction or the like inside GIS can generate a table which shows which supplier each customer is allocated to, and the table information can be further exported into a text table file or a spreadsheet table outside of GIS system. For example, a table of customer and supplier list may be provided as shown in .","As described above, the system and method of the present disclosure may be implemented using GIS and its functionalities. In one embodiment, some or all of the functionalities of a GIS may be incorporated with a plug-in module or the like into the system and method of the present disclosure. In another embodiment, similar functionalities of a GIS may be independently implemented and used in the system and method of the present disclosure. Other implementations that allow the system and method of the present disclosure to utilize GIS functionalities may be also contemplated.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.
