{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/373,800 filed Feb. 25, 2003, now pending, and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention is directed to electronic screening tools for managing electronic message communications.","In a typical electronic messaging system (e.g., an email system), a user composes a message in an editor and then initiates a \u2018Send\u2019 action. This causes the email client application to (i) move the message into a queue (or folder) where a software component transforms that message into the representation needed by the message transport agent (MTA\u2014e.g., SMTP), (ii) execute code to connect to the message transport agent (\u201cMTA\u201d) and (iii) pass the message to the MTA for delivery.","Originally, this was the only manner in which email messages were sent. In a traditional email system , an email client  sent an electronic message through an outbound message queue  which then directed the electronic message to the MTA , . The MTA  then delivered the electronic message to the recipient's inbox . No mechanism existed for any message processing once the Send button was pressed unless the use could find the message and delete it before it had been handed off to the MTA.","The present invention is directed to a method and system for identifying content in an unsent electronic message composed by a sender affiliated with a business, wherein, the content is potentially not authorized by the business or potentially harmful to the business. An electronic screening tool is applied to the unsent electronic message prior to transmission of the unsent electronic message from a server, associated with the business, to the recipient. The electronic screening tool is programmed to identify content that is potentially not authorized by the business or potentially harmful to the business, and is comprised of one or more of the following: a proxy service comprised of a message accessor, a message analyzer and an action manager that is more fully described below. The sender's request to transmit the electronic message to the recipient may be automatically cancelled and\/or scraped from the server if the output of the electronic screening tool indicates that the unsent electronic message contains content that is potentially not authorized by the business or potentially harmful to the business. In one embodiment, the sender of the electronic message is automatically sent an electronic alert message indicating that the unsent electronic message contains content that may be objectionable (and optionally indicating that the message has not yet been sent or delivered) if the output of the electronic screening tool indicates that the unsent electronic message contains content that is potentially not authorized by the business or potentially harmful to the business. The sender is provided with at least one of the following options: (i) delete the unsent electronic message and\/or scrape the unsent electronic message from the server if the unsent electronic message was previously stored on the server, (ii) revise the unsent electronic message, or (iii) send the unsent electronic message to a super-visor or designated company official for approval. The unsent electronic message may be comprised of any message transmitted by electronic means.","The present invention is also directed to a method for identifying whether a first party is engaging in electronic communications that are potentially harmful to the first party in commercial or residential environments. An electronic screening tool is applied to one or more electronic messages sent or received by the first party. The electronic screening tool is programmed to identify content associated with a situation that is potentially harmful to the first party. An alert message is automatically sent to a second party indicating that the first party may be involved in a situation that is potentially harmful to the first party if the output of the electronic screening tool indicates that the electronic messages contain content associated with a situation that is potentially harmful to the first party.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.","The overall purpose of the invention is to enable a business to manage the content and transmission of electronic communications. Electronic communications occur between one or more people: either within a business or between a business and its customers\/clients or within a residential situation. Even simple electronic communications may have serious implications on a business. Managing the communications effectively helps mitigate the consequences of potentially improper communications.","Communications management may take several forms. Intelligent content-based filtering may prevent intentional and\/or accidental electronic communications between people (including employees, companies, agents, representatives, counsel, etc.) governed by rules that protect a business. Examples of electronic messages that may be filtered include but are not limited to; messages relating to legally prohibited activities; messaging relating to ethically prohibited activities; messages containing information about a particular subject matter; messages that could place the sender or company at risk of imprisonment, fines and\/or lawsuits; and messages that contain information which a business has determined to prohibit from dissemination.","Communication management may occur by blocking communications between people. This may involve stopping a communication between people based upon identification of users, companies, email addresses and\/or content. The management may also involve auditing or logging of communications between people and\/or capturing or recording communications between people where copies of the communication are preserved in a database.","It is expected that the communications management policies implemented by the present invention will change over time, and the kinds of communications that are or are not allowed will similarly change over time. Likewise, the type and degree of scrutiny placed on particular messages and\/or particular users may vary over time. To accommodate the changing landscape of the activity that an effective electronic messaging filter encounters, the overall design of this invention provides a solution that is configurable, expandable, and designed for high throughput.","This description discusses email systems and the infrastructure surrounding an enterprise email installation as the basis for describing the invention's capabilities and the mechanisms the invention may connect to, use, or implement to provide its functionality. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description is not limited to email systems. It is believed that the architecture and design of the invention may be used to effectively manage communications in a variety of electronic media including instant messaging, newsgroups (e.g., Usenet), bulletin boards, telephony, general purpose file system access (including shared folders, drop boxes, ftp, etc.), Lotus Notes data stores, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["2","220","100","200","220","200","140","160","240","260"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1000","1000","400","140","400","1000","400"]},"The preferred embodiment of this invention has adopted a proxy technique for a new purpose: enabling effective, controlled communications management within an enterprise. Business policies are implemented such that messages may be sent, blocked from being sent, archived, expunged etc. consistently throughout the organization according to explicitly defined business policies.","For more loosely coupled email environments that do not use a centralized, enterprise-wide email service (e.g., an enterprise where each employee uses a personal\/home SMTP\/POP mail account and the SMTP server is not controlled by the enterprise), the system  would be deployed as add-ins to the email client (e.g., a COM add-in to the Microsoft Outlook\u2122 email client.) In this scenario, the proxy service  would be installed such that the proxy service  processed the message as it was being placed in the sender's outbox rather than when it is uploaded to the MTA. However, this deployment method may be less desirable because it requires installation on each email client and a cumbersome updating process as the rules guiding the processing of the message change.","Because the act of filtering messages needs to accommodate different policies in different environments, the proxy service  is not a simple mechanism \u2018spliced\u2019 between the email system's outbound message queue  and the MTA . Instead, the proxy service's  internal action manager  may choose between a broad range of \u2018output actions\u2019 , - not just a limited set of email-oriented actions .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 9"],"b":["1000","400","200","140","420","2","451","453","452","453","160","451","453","1000","160","451","453","800","400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-9","FIGS. 6-8","FIGS. 4 and 9"],"b":["1000","500","600","722","800","600","800","451","452","453"]},"The message accessor  connects to the underlying email system to retrieve each message that is waiting to be \u2018sent.\u2019 When implemented inside an email server (the preferred implementation\u2014e.g., an SMTP or Microsoft Exchange\u2122 environment), this module may be implemented as a system program that responds to the calls typically made from an email client to the email server in order to accept the \u2018outbound\u2019 messages from the calling program. For example, in a typical scenario where outbound mail is \u2018sent\u2019 by making a call to TCP\/IP port  (typically, the SMTP port), this module would be installed on port  on the enterprise's email server and emulate USER\/PASS and other commands that would allow each outbound message to be uploaded to the proxy service  (acting as a gateway to the MTA.) When implemented inside an entail client (e.g., Microsoft Outlook\u2122), this module may be implemented as a COM (Component Object Model) Add-in to process the messages from the entail client's \u2018outbox\u2019 folder.","Once an outbound message has been received, it is transformed from its original representation (e.g., SMTP message format, Microsoft Exchange\u2122 format) into an MTA-neutral format. Transforming the message into a neutral format allows the subsequent analysis step(s) to act on messages regardless of their original source and, therefore, allows the proxy service  (and message accessor ) to have multiple connections to multiple, different underlying message services. The preferred implementation of the MTA-neutral format is XML, XML is an open standard for data representation that is well supported in databases and other tools and whose explicit \u2018tagged data\u2019 format allows for explicit representation of the information in the message. If necessary, the original message representation may be stored unchanged inside the XML-based MTA-neutral message representation and passed along as the process progresses.","After the original content of the message has been transformed into the MTA-neutral format, the MTA-neutral message representation (Table 2) is passed to the message analyzer .","The message accessor  may also be implemented in an \u2018analyze as you author\u2019 mode. The benefit of an \u2018analyze as you author\u2019 mode is that it enables a document\/message author to understand the ramifications of the message\/document being prepared before sending it to anyone else.","This mode would implement a message accessor  inside an authoring application (e.g., as a COM add-in to Microsoft Word\u2122 or Microsoft Outlook\u2122 or plug-in to other authoring tools such as Adobe In Design.) In this case, the implementation of the message accessor  would capture the current contents of the message in the MTA-neutral format as a snapshot at determined intervals of the authoring process\u2014such as every 3 minutes. The add-in\/plug-in would include a mechanism to either (a) run the rest of the system  on the client system where the authoring is occurring or (b) pass the MTA-neutral representation off to the system  running on another accessible machine (on the local network, VPN, etc. for processing. When processing is complete, the results are passed back to a calling add-in\/plug-in in the same format as that is passed to the action manager . However, instead of actually taking those actions, the add-in\/plug-in may report to the user the action that would likely be taken if those contents were sent.","Running the entire system  on the client machine would require a complete installation of the message accessor  and message analyzer  on the client machine. In practice, this is possible but may be cumbersome to install and keep up-to-date. In some cases, however, it may be desired since it would allow for accurate analysis on a machine that is completely disconnected from a network e.g., local area network (LAN) or virtual private network (VPN).","Connecting an add-on\/plug-in implementation of the message accessor  to an existing installation of the message analyzer  is a more modular solution that is easier-to-install and easier to maintain. However, it does require a connection to a local area network (LAN) or virtual private network (VPN) in order to work properly.","The role of the message analyzer  is to determine whether the contents of a specific electronic message may violate one or more of the enterprise policies for allowable communications. The policies that govern allowable electronic messages may be governed by some rules related to legal requirements, security concerns, ethical aspirations or simply based on subject matter.","To perform this task adequately, the message analyzer  needs additional information about the sender and recipient(s) who are involved in the communication. Therefore, in addition to the specific information contained in the message about the sender, intended recipients, etc., the message analyzer  uses a user\/role knowledge base  to extend the explicit information in the message with information that is implicit to the message, . The user\/role knowledge base  integrates information culled from various enterprise data sources, an employee\/human resource database  and a customer\/client database , to augment the MTA-neutral message representation with additional information (metadata) about the role played by each of the sender and recipient(s) in the contents of the electronic message.","As illustrated in , this augmented MTA-neutral message representation is passed along to a subcomponent  that distributes the message representation to one or more risk assessment module(s) that applies rules contained in a general purpose, domain-independent risk assessment module  about the contents of the electronic message, its participants, etc. and initiates the application of domain-specific risk assessment modules , , ,  that are applied to the message. This step results in up to two outcomes. First, the general purpose domain-independent risk assessment  generates a risk metric that is passed along to the downstream risk assessment integrator. Secondly, the augmented, MTA-neutral message representation is passed to additional, domain-specific risk assessment modules , ,  and\/or  for further processing. These are exemplary modules, not an exhaustive list. Other modules are possible and considered to be within the scope of the invention.","The domain-specific risk assessment modules , ,  and\/or  are designed to contain more detailed rules about a particular risk domain (e.g., collusion, insider trading, fraud, theft of intellectual property, contains sexual content, etc.). They act independently on the MTA-neutral message representation  (and may act in parallel in order to get higher throughput.) The outcome of each risk assessment module , , ,  is a risk metric assigned to the message based on the domain knowledge, rules, etc. that are modeled in the risk assessment module.","When the domain-independent risk assessment module  completes its processing, the work order (with the results of the risk assessment module ) is passed to the risk assessment distribution mechanism , . This mechanism sets up a process to run and receive the results of the domain-specific modules , , ,  and waits for them all to complete. Once all domain-specific risk assessment modules , , ,  have reported their results, the risk assessment integrator  compiles an overall risk metric and passes this information along with the MTA-neutral message representation along to the action manager .","As illustrated in , the action manager will receive several types of information from the message analyzer . The received information may include the MTA-neutral message representation including the metadata augmentation to the original message to the action manager . The action manager will also receive the overall risk metric score for the message and the risk metric associated with each risk assessment module , , , , . It will also receive any additional information concerning the reasons for each risk assessment score . These risk assessments are inserted into the MTA-neutral message representation  thus keeping all of the information about the message in one place.","Given this information, the action manager  determines (based on some configurable threshold(s)) what action should be taken. The configuration information also provides a mechanism for the policy maker to assign particular actions with particular risk metrics (or ranges of risk metrics.) The policy maker may allow the message in its original form to be passed on to the MTA . (This is what would be expected to happen to a message that poses no or little risk to the enterprise.) The policy maker may block the message from being sent in its original form.","Depending on the severity of the risk, possible response actions to a message that is blocked include any combination of the following: (a) returning the message to the sender with reasons for blocking , (b) notifying the enterprise's compliance group that the message was blocked  along with reasons for blocking. A message may be marked as \u2018suspect\u2019 but not automatically blocked . This may result in the message and the results of the message analyzer  being forwarded to the enterprise's compliance group  where a person may make a determination of whether to allow the message to pass through or to block the message . This \u2018marking as suspect\u2019 process may also Inform the sender that the message has been set aside for further review to let the sender know that it hasn't been sent to the intended recipients .","The message may be logged in a message audit trail . In the preferred implementation, this may be configured to do \u2018shallow\u2019 logging to only note that some activity has occurred. It may also be configured to do \u2018deep\u2019 logging, where the original message, the MTA-neutral message representation, and the results of the message analyzer  are stored in a database for corporate audit or archival purposes.","After determining what action should be taken, the action manager  would invoke the appropriate action(s). Note that, in the normal case, of allowing a message to pass through unfettered, the action manager  takes on the role of passing the message to the underlying mail system's MTA such that the message is delivered as intended using the existing email system mechanisms. The system , therefore, does not require replacing an existing email system to provide the benefits of the system.","The message accessor  is the entry point for screening the contents of messages by the proxy service . It receives\/detects new electronic messages, prepares each message for processing, and passes each message off to the message analyzer . The message accessor  implements two subcomponents: (a) the message receiver\/retriever  and (b) the message transformer .","As illustrated in , the message receiver\/retriever  is responsible for retrieving or receiving an unsent message into the system  workflow. There are two ways in which the message retriever\/receiver  subcomponent may be implemented. In the receive mode, it may be called by an external entity to receive messages or, in the retrieve mode it may poll for messages in art external entity. In either case, it is acting as a transparent gateway to the email system's MTA . It is transparent in the sense that, from the point of view of the email system sender, messages are being sent normally with no extra burden placed on the sender to ensure that the message is processed by the system .","In receive mode, this subcomponent  implements and exposes an existing messaging API such that this subcomponent  may be used in place of the \u2018real\u2019 messaging API. In the retrieve mode, the subcomponent  calls software routines or plugs into an email system, to get unsent messages from a folder\/queue, where they are waiting for processing. In this model (for example, an email client like Microsoft Outlook Express\u2122), electronic messages that are \u2018sent\u2019 are actually copied to an unsent message queue  where periodic processing occurs to forward the message on to the MTA . When implemented in retrieve mode , the message receiver\/retriever  replaces or overrides the usual polling mechanism that looks for these waiting messages. Once configured appropriately, the retriever mode  retrieves the messages from the unsent message queue  in the native format of the MTA that this subcomponent is emulating. For example, the message would be retrieved in SMTP format when reading messages from an outbox for an SMTP-based MTA. This allows the message retriever  to act as an SMTP receiver without the native email environment being aware that the message retriever  isn't actually a simple SMTP MTA.","Once a message is received by or retrieved into the message receiver\/retriever , it is written out to a short-term persistent message store . This is done to prevent the message from being lost in case of power outage, system crash, or other feature before the message is finally acknowledged as received\/retrieved. Note that this message, stored in the short-term persistent message store , should be deleted once the proxy service  has completed its work on the message.","After the message has been received or retrieved into this subcomponent  and written to the temporary persistent storage , the message is marked as received to the underlying email system. For example, the message receiver\/retriever  would return an OK to the SMTP protocol or signal that the underlying unsent message queue  may safely delete the message because it has been successfully received by, what it thinks is, the MTA.","At this point, the message (in its native representation\u2014ex, in the SMTP case, a text file that represents all of the various SMTP message headers, message content, etc.) is passed along to the message transformer .","The message transformer  prepares each message for processing by the message analyzer . The preparation consists of transforming the raw, native (MTA-specific) message format to the common MTA-neutral message representation used by the message analyzer . Examples of native message formats are the Internet standard SMTP format and the Microsoft Exchange\u2122 format. The common message representation used by system  is based on industry standard XML (Extensible Markup Language see\u2014www.w3.org.).","The message transformer  receives a message in its raw, native format from the receiver\/retriever . For example, a message that was received from an SMTP-based implementation of the message receiver\/retriever  would pass the message to this subcomponent  in its SMTP format: essentially, a text file that represents the various SMTP message headers, message content, etc.","When the message transformer  receives the native message, the caller (typically, the message receiver\/retriever ) also indicates the MTA type of the native electronic message (e.g. SMTP, Microsoft Exchange\u2122.) The message transformer  uses this information to determine which parser to use to convert the message to the common, MTA-neutral format. Thus, there may be separate transformers for SMTP, Microsoft Exchange\u2122, etc. message types but each transformer generates the MTA-neutral message representation in the same, XML-based format.","In the following example, the system  has received an SMTP message being sent from john.smith@tradingcompany.com to jane.jones@clientcompany.com. John Smith is a financial planer for Trading Company who is letting Jane Jones (one of his clients) know that it is time to re-balance her portfolio and asking if she wants to sell some of her growth stocks to invest in some of her more conservative mutual funds. John has \u2018sent\u2019 the following message by connecting his email client's unsent message queue to the corporate SMTP process on smtp.tradingcompany.com. The salient parts of the unsent SMTP electronic message would appear as shown in Table I where the period (\u2018.\u2019) at the end of the message indicates that the end of the message body has been reached.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"From: \u2018John Smith\u2019 <john.smith@tradingcompany.com>"]},{"entry":[{},"To: \u2018Jane Jones\u2019 <Jane.Jones@clientcompany.com>"]},{"entry":[{},"Subject: Time to re-balance your portfolio"]},{"entry":[{},"Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2002 09:41:29 -0500"]},{"entry":[{},"Jane:"]},{"entry":[{},"As the end of the year approaches, it's time to start thinking"]},{"entry":[{},"about re-balancing your portfolio.

This component  completes the preparation of the message for processing by augmenting the MTA-neutral message representation. With this additional information in place, the message analyzer  may perform domain-independent risk assessment of the message as well as domain-specific risk assessment of the message. Each risk assessment compares the information in the message representation to information in a related knowledge base to determine a score (\u2018risk metric\u2019) for the message. Once the risk metrics have been aggregated into a composite risk score, the composite metric along with the corroborating detail is added to the message representation. This augmented representation is then passed along to the action manager .","The message analyzer  is specifically designed to match the requirements needed for a successful communications management product. The system  must have the ability to process messages fast enough such that \u2018good\u2019 messages are delivered in a timely manner and \u2018bad\u2019 messages are handled quickly enough that the enterprise gets the benefits of the communications management without any perception that communications are sluggish. The design accommodates this by providing a multi-level risk assessment process where not every message needs to be subjected to multi-step analysis in all risk domain modules , , , .","Not every enterprise will want to analyze messages according to the same criteria. Within an enterprise, circumstances may require that messages sent from one type of sender (or even a specific sender) is treated differently. The system  accommodates this by allowing configuration settings and rules to apply different levels of scrutiny to messages sent by different users or different classes of users. Also, particular domain-specific risk assessment modules , , ,  may be burned on and off as business policy warrants.","Just as business policy may require that certain risk assessment domains may not be necessary at all times, not every enterprise will want to purchase domain-specific risk assessment modules , , ,  that it may never need. The design partitions the risk assessment modules , , ,  into separately installable units in order to accommodate this kind of evolutionary sale or evolutionary deployment. This architecture also provides for the possibility that professional services may be provided to larger customers to develop custom risk assessment modules  that build on the feature set of the off-the-shelf product. It also allows for a third-party development market for development of risk-assessment modules.","One easily overlooked subtlety of the standard proxy to MTA of system , in , is the assumption that all of the necessary information, concerning the unsent message, is contained in the unsent message. For the case of virus detection, this is an obvious assumption. An electronic message cannot contain a virus that will do any damage unless the message contains the virus (by attaching an infected file as an attachment, incorporating malicious code in the message body, or referring to a potentially malicious Internet reference in the message body.) While the virus prevention use of the proxy technique looks only at the actual content of the message, it is necessary to look beyond the actual explicit content of the message to determine whether to disallow the message in many business communications scenarios. In addition as described below, the invention may be used to disallow the message in residential environments.","For example, many of the heuristics that are needed to determine a risk assessment score  are concerned with the role a sender or recipient is representing in the contents of the unsent message. For example does the sender or the intended recipient(s) represent a stockbroker, a designated insider, a director level, etc. Regardless of the parties' identities that are participating in the contents of the unsent message, information such as this may drive some decisions about what action should be taken on an unsent message.","As illustrated in , the message metadata augmentation module  uses the explicit information about the message that is already stored in the MTA-neutral message representation and injects relevant metadata into the representation. The new data is derived from a knowledge base  that correlates information from the enterprise's various databases to information in the message. For example,  shows a user\/role knowledge base  that has been derived from information obtained from the enterprise's employee\/HR database  and its customer\/client database .","This user\/role knowledge base  may include information on an employee's job title, job code, organization\/department name, organization codes telephone number, instant messaging username(s). These may be found by matching the employee's email address to the matching record in an employee master file.","The user\/role knowledge base  may also include information on a client or customer: an employee's customer\/client\/account number, trading status, social security number, telephone numbers (work; home), instant messaging username(s), director\/insider status classification, employer ID for company of which customer is a designated insider (if any), company name, company trading symbol. These may be found by matching the customer's email address to a master customer list and using information in it to cross-reference other databases (e.g., company name\/trading symbol.)","Furthermore, the user\/role knowledge base  may include information from databases and enterprise data sources that may pertain to the relationship between the message sender and recipients. For example, an enterprise's telephone billing\/tracking\/usage system may be queried to determine the duration and extent of recent telephone communication in a defined time period. Similarly, any auditing of email or instant messaging (whether performed inside the system  or externally) may be queried to determine the duration and extent of email and\/or instant messaging communications between the parties in a defined time period (e.g., the previous 30 days). The purpose for gathering this information and augmenting it in the current message's representation is that the upcoming risk assessment may judge\/score the message contents differently depending on whether or not a pattern of communications has occurred or is emerging.","Referring back to the example in Table 2, the MTA-neutral message  will be augmented in this step by applying knowledge found in the user\/role knowledge base  to the information known about the message being analyzed. The message metadata augmentation component  and the user\/role knowledge base  has been programmed to look for information about the sender and intended recipients of messages in various databases of employees, customers, consultants, etc. In the example, it is assumed that an entry for John Smith with an email address of john.smith@tradingcompany.com has been found in the employee database . The message metadata augmentation component  and the user\/role knowledge base  have been programmed to get the job code and description for any employee match it finds and add it to the MTA-neutral message representation. John Smith's job code is FP07 (Financial Planner 07).","Similarly, an entry for Jane Jones (with an email address of jane.jones@clientcompany.com) was found in the customer database  as a brokerage account client. The message metadata augmentation component  and the user\/role knowledge base  have been programmed to gather data about any customer that is found and determine additional salient information about the customer that may be helpful during rule analysis. In this case, Jane Jones has previously indicated (during the account signup process) that she is a Director of a publicly traded company\u2014SampleCompany2. The user\/role knowledge base ,  are also programmed to find the trading symbol for the publicly traded company, CPY2.","With this information (for an employee: employer, job code, and job description; for a customer\/client: brokerage customer role and a \u2018significant\u2019 employee at publicly traded company), the user\/role knowledge base  has also been programmed to add additional information about any company faith which either a sender or intended recipient has a significant relationship. In our case, this means that the employee's information is tagged in the knowledge base  with the company name and trading symbol for tradingcompany.com and the customer's information is tagged with the company name and trading symbol for the company of which Ms. Jones is a Director, SampleCompany2. With this information, a final knowledge base rule is initiated that determines whether any of the companies referenced during the course of this message augmentation are inside the window of any significant events (e.g., blackout period for insider trading, SEC reporting due, etc.).","As shown in , the user\/role knowledge base  is populated with information derived from various enterprise data sources including the employee\/HR database  and\/or the client\/customer database . The message metadata augmentation component  uses the information in the user\/role knowledge base  to add the information to the MTA-neutral message representation. Both the message metadata augmentation component  and the user\/role knowledge base  operate by applying pattern-matching rules and other processing techniques (e.g., neural nets, genetic algorithms, Bayesian Belief Network, etc.) to trigger the programmed behavior. When all of this activity has been completed, the MTA-neutral message representation includes significant additional information that will be useful to subsequent processing by the risk assessment modules , , , ,  of the message analyzer .

To meet the expected throughput demands, the architecture of the message analyzer  is decomposed into three subcomponents: a risk assessment distributor ; risk assessment module(s) , , , , ; and a risk assessment integrator . It is expected that deep analysis by the risk assessment modules , , , ,  will consume significant time. Therefore, the work associated with the message analyzer  is partitioned such that the work way be divided into multiple operating systems processes. By having functionality encoded in different processes, the system  will have the ability to use more computing resources and it is expected that it will have the ability to meet the high throughput and scalability demands that provides value to customers.","As illustrated in , the risk assessment distributor  has several purposes. It must know how many domain-specific risk assessment modules , , ,  have been configured and how to connect to each configured domain-specific risk assessment module , , , . The component may add routing information as additional metadata to the MTA-neutral message representation. Thirdly, it may create an abstraction called a work order  as an internal control object and attach the MTA-neutral message representation  to the work order . The risk assessment distributor  may also argument the work order  with routing information and then pass the work order  to the appropriate domain-specific risk assessment modules , , , . Or it may hand off the work order  to the risk assessment integrator . Thus, the role of lie risk assessment distributor  is to parcel out the analysis work intelligently such that the message contents may be scored in as little time, using as few computing resources as possible.","Architecturally, the system  may be designed or may function by assigning an operating system process to each risk assessment module , , , ,  and to both the risk assessment distributor  and risk assessment integrator . However, there is overhead associated with inter-process communications and with having multiple processes. To minimize the overhead, one operating system process will share the risk assessment distributor , the domain-independent risk assessment module , and the risk assessment integrator .","The explanation for this decision requires looking ahead to some of the component details. The domain-independent risk assessment module  performs risk assessment on the contents of every message regardless of (a) the content of the message and (b) which content-based (domain-dependent) options have been configured. The risk assessment integrator  performs the inverse task of the risk assessment distributor . It looks at the work order  and then waits for a response from each risk assessment module , , , , . Once it receives all responses, it integrates them and computes the final risk score  for the message from the separate risk scores  of each risk assessment module.","The contents of each message must the processed by the three subcomponents, the risk assessment distributor , domain-independent risk assessment , and the risk assessment integrator . Evaluator  extracts out all of the scoring information provided by separate risk assessment modules , , , , , and uses this information to (determine a final risk score for the message . Depending on the business environment and the configuration options chosen, a message may not require analysis by a domain-specific risk assessment module , , , . Therefore, co-locating subsystems , ,  within the same operating system process results in efficient and timely communications management.","As illustrated in , a risk assessment module  receives a request for processing, in the form of a work order . The work order  is associated with an MTA-neutral message representation . The work order  is placed into the risk assessment module's  input \u2018work queue\u2019 . In most cases, one risk assessment module  will be developed for each content area to which filtering will be applied to the unsent message. Thus, if an initial rollout of system  covered the content areas of Collusion, Price Fixing and Corporate Fraud, the installation would typically include 3 risk assessment modules .","When a message first arrives for processing by the message analyzer , the system  does not know whether the topic area defined in a particular risk assessment module  applies. Therefore, the general architecture of a risk assessment module  is designed as a two-pass analysis system in order to improve the overall performance and throughput of the risk: assessment module . During the first pass, a broad analysis processor  looks broadly at the message Contents to determine whether configuration information or domain-specific information applies to the message contents. In the second pass, a deep analysis knowledge processor  performs an in-depth analysis of the message contents.","For example, during the first pass analysis by a domain-specific risk assessment module , ,  and\/or , the message is initially scanned by the broad analysis knowledge base processor  looking for occurrence(s) of key words or phrases that appear in the module's  associated (content-specific) knowledge base  (e.g., Collusion, Price Fixing, Corporate Fraud.) In this first pass, the message content is looked at broadly with the goal of deciding whether or not this message applies to this domain area. This decision is reached by calculating a score for the first pass analysis. The first pass analysis score is calculated by finding matches of the key words or phrases in the knowledge base .","Each key word or phrase in the knowledge base  will be associated with a match score and an occurrence multiplier. The \u2018match score\u2019 assigns a number of points to the presence of this word\/phrase in the message where a higher score indicates that the message is more likely relevant to this content area than a lower score. The \u2018occurrence multiplier\u2019 indicates whether the match score should be applied once for all occurrences (a value of false) or once for each occurrence (a value of \u2018true\u2019). With this model, the knowledge base designer has the flexibility to influence the outcome of the scoring in two dimensions of key word and phrase usage. The broad analyzer will scan the message's content looking for the key words and phrases and then compute a score. If the resulting score\/metric, calculated from the completion of the first pass is low, the work order  is passed to the risk assessment integrator  thereby bypassing the computational and temporal cost of completing the second pass or deep analysis.","In the second pass, the message content is analyzed further by using one or more artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., forward chaining rules, backward chaining rules, neural nets, genetic algorithms, Bayesian Belief Networks) scoring the message content with each step.","As illustrated in , this multi-pass analysis is implemented by designing the risk assessment module  as a multi-threaded process. The risk assessment distributor  gives a work order to the risk assessment module . The work order is placed in the risk assessment module's work queue  until the broad analysis knowledge-based processor  retrieves it to complete the first pass analysis.","The broad analysis knowledge-based processor  retrieves work orders one at a time from the work queue  to analyze. If after the completion of the first pass analysis, the resulting score exceeds a predetermined threshold, the work order  is placed into the deep work queue , for second pass analysis by the deep analysis knowledge-based processor . This processor , also scores the message content. Upon completion, the work order  is updated to reflect the completed scoring\/metric and it is passed to the risk assessment integrator .","In particular, the domain-independent risk assessment module  uses configuration intonation  to determine the set of configuration options\/features that have been enabled by a business. Computations based on the configured options will associate a risk score with the message. Analysis is performed in a series of steps. First it is determined whether the system is configured to block messages from the sender to anyone. Next it is determined whether the sender or any of the intended recipients was associated with earlier suspect messages. If the answer to any of these inquires is no, then the message content is given a score of zero. If the answer to either inquiry is yes, the MTA-neutral message representation is augmented with the new information, and the document is given a score.","The example, in Table 4, illustrates a rule that may be implemented in a particular instance of a domain-independent risk assessment module . In this example, the business situation is that all of the company's financial planners are having their messages logged in response to an investigation about possible trading irregularities. Therefore, the rule states that any employee with a job code containing \u201cFP\u201d (the financial planning job code category) should have messages they send logged, with deep logging, to comply with the needs of the investigation. The sample rules in the example are shown in XML Stylesheet Transformation Language (XSLT.) These serve to demonstrate XSLT (and the XPath operations it includes) as one possible rule processing mechanism that the system  can support.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 4"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml version=\u201c1.0\u201d encoding=\u201cUTF-8\u201d?>"},{"entry":"<xsl:stylesheet version=\u201c1.0\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003xmlns:xsl=\u201chttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/XSL\/Transform\u201d>"},{"entry":"<xsl:template match=\u201c\/\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003<ActionEnvelope>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<xsl:apply-templates select=\u201c\/message\/from\/employee\/company\u201d\/>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/ActionEnvelope>"},{"entry":"<\/xsl:template>"},{"entry":"<xsl;template match= \u201ccompany\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003<xsl:if test-\u201d@symbol= \u201cTRC\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<xsl:choose>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<xsl:when test=\u201ctitle[@jobCode=\u2018FP\u2019)\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<ActionRequest>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Action>Log Communication - Deep<\/Action>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<Reason>Employees in FP job code are having"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003messages deep logged due to investigation"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003#789"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/Reason>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/ActionRequest>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/xsl:when>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/xsl:choose>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/xsl:if>"},{"entry":"<\/xsl:template>"},{"entry":"<\/xsl:stylesheet>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Table 5 illustrates the result of applying the rule in Table 4 to the MTA-neutral message representation shown in Table 3.

the first-pass score exceeds the defined content threshold, the second pass analysis is performed by the deep analysis knowledge base processor . In this second pass analysis, the assessment by the deep analysis knowledge base processor  looks for cases where the trading referred to in the message relates to the company in which the recipient is an insider. This second pass analysis gives a score (that may be the same as the first pass score if no deep rules update the score) and may generate additional action request(s). This behavior is similar to that generated during the domain-independent assessment.

Other actions are driven by business decisions such as: a business decision was made to enable deep auditing therefore, the occurrence of the message will be persisted in the audit DB. It may take a requested action when the domain-independent risk assessment module requests an explicit action. This action will be carried out unless it conflicts with a configuration option.","The action determination module  may also take a score based action. If a domain-independent risk assessment module  scored the message contents at a value higher than its threshold, then the document is considered to pertain to that content area.

Additionally, the action determination module  may examine the overall score assigned to the message by the risk assessment integrator to determine the action(s) to take.","As a set of action requests is determined, each action is placed in an ActionEnvelope. When the final ActionEnvelope has been calculated (containing the complete set of configured actions, requested actions, and score-based actions determined form the message), a final step it the action determination component  examines the set of actions in the ActionEnvelope and determines whether some actions in the ActionEnvelope render other actions unnecessary. In this step, a set of configured rules indicate the precedence of operation on the rules. For example, a block message action may override a hold message action; a deep logging request may override a shallow logging request, etc. Applying these precedence rules results in a minimal set of actions that are then passed on to the action orchestrator .","The precedence rules may result in a variety of actions. For example, multiple requests for the same action may be thinned into a single action request. Within the message audit trail , deep logging may take precedence over shallow logging.

Examples of the system  for telephony cover a wide range of possibilities. Some of which are more immediately attainable and some of which require advances in related technologies. For example, a use of telephony systems in the short-term would be to build an MTA-neutral message representation of information that is already available in common telephony applications: phone number placing the call, destination phone call, etc. Simple analysis and filtering may be performed to allow or disallow calls based on who's calling whom and the ramifications of what's known about the caller\/callee using rules similar to those described earlier in this disclosure. More advanced applications would be possible in terms of telephone voicemail processing and post-processing of phone calls. This would become possible once technologies and regulations allow the recording of phone calls and transforming the conversation from voice into some kind of MTA-neutral text representation becomes sufficiently accurate aid efficient.","The invention, furthermore, may be used to filter instant messages. The invention involves a message accessor module  that receives or retrieves electronic messages such that they may be processed by a message analyzer module . The examples show how messages may be accessed using existing email protocols such as SMTP. The examples also describe the implementation of a proxy service for FTP file \u2018put\u2019 operations or acting as a proxy between a user's instant messaging (IM) client such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) or Microsoft Messenger\u2122. All that is necessary for the architecture to work is the ability to access the message\/file\/document in its native format and have the ability to knowledgeably read that format. For example, a message accessor  that received a raw AIM instant message may parse the message for the salient components such as sender, recipient, message body, attachments, etc., and create the MTA-neutral format that is described and used in the rest of the invention. Similarly, the ability to access and pass a message (the original or a new\/modified version of the message) to the actual implementation of the instant messaging server would allow the building of the proper \u2018back end\u2019 action for the action manager  component. It would also allow the full implementation all of the examples shown as \u2018email\u2019 examples as \u2018instant messaging\u2019 examples instead.","What this means is that the invention's architecture and design may be implemented as a communications manager for any electronic communications media provided that the following \u2018hooks\u2019 into existing systems and\/or protocols may be made. The existing system must have the ability to read and receive the raw, native format of the documents\/files\/messages for the given communications mechanism. Obtaining full utility and functionality requires the ability to parse die semantics of the document\/file\/message in terms of identifying the sender\/author, recipient\/audience, content, attachments, etc. In all cases, the required format-\/protocol-specific work involves parsing the raw, native format into what is called MTA-neutral format in this architecture\/design. Once the document\/file\/message is in MTA-neutral format, the rest of the architecture\/design will apply on the item being processed regardless of its origin. The knowledge, related to parsing the incoming document, is typically applied to writing an outbound document. Once a program is written to put the MTA-neutral message representation into raw, native format for a given communications mechanism, it is only necessary to know how to connect to a server that may handle that raw, native format and to put the native message into that server.","The detailed description of the present invention is directed to the handling and analyzing of outbound electronic messages. However, the present invention is also amenable to providing the same kind of processing on inbound messages (e.g., email, IM.) In this case, the message accessor  would run on messages that are received into an inbound electronic message store (for example, a POP protocol typically found on port  of a Unix\/Linux system or an IMAP message store.) In an instant messaging (IM) sense, the system  may act as both an inbound and outbound filter on a user's IM traffic because his\/her connection through a system  may run the message accessor  on both inbound and outbound messages. For example, if Company XYZ has installed a system  on their corporate IM infrastructure and the user initiates a \u2018chat\u2019 with a user outside the corporate firewall, then (a) the \u2018outbound\u2019 system  could receive messages typed and sent by the internal user and process them before passing them along to the \u2018real\u2019 IM message server to be sent to the outside user, and (b) messages received from the outside user, could be trapped and processed by the \u2018inbound\u2019 system  before being forwarded along to the internal user's IM client.","The system  is configured so that a business may define and enable the set of actions suitable for their specific business needs.

In this scenario, the compliance manager would use his\/her web browser  to access a specially designed input screen which would enable them to enter information about the two parties, and perhaps a topic of conversation it wants blocked. The data would then be entered into the configuration data store .","The domain-independent risk assessment module  may gain access to this same set of data through the configuration API  to ensure that the appropriate communications management took place.","As noted earlier, knowledge bases will contain the domain-dependent data that enables the risk assessment modules , , ,  to score a message.  illustrates a knowledge base management subsystem. It is expected that, for particular domains, the supporting data that enables the invention to score a document may change frequently. To this end, the knowledge base management subsystem  of a customer's system  may automatically contact the knowledge base subscription service department  to update the customer's knowledge bases .","Domain experts in the knowledge base subscription service department  will be responsible for staying current with changes in their areas of expertise (domains). These experts will update a central knowledge base with the evolving set of domain expertise. A customer's installation may then automatically update its installed knowledge bases such that the knowledge bases stay current with changes in laws and the supporting data.","This data flow is illustrated in . In this figure, a representative or domain expert is scanning several online data stores including Lexus\/Nexus\u2122 , Westlaw\u2122 , and other sources  to learn about the ever-changing laws and requirements about a particular domain. The representative is then responsible for making updates to the central knowledge base  maintained within the knowledge base subscription service department. A customer's system  (including ) then automatically contacts the subscription service  and updates its local knowledge bases .","The user interface of the system  may perform different actions including: enabling or disabling certain features such as auditing or the domain-independent risk assessment module; generating reports of suspect message(s); or updating the knowledge base  with new data by using the automatic subscription services provided by the knowledge base content vendor. It may also perform the compliance manager functions: including the ability to review\/manually process suspect messages; or other screens as necessary by user interfaces , .","Nigh level Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) , ,  will be provided to give any of the subsystems access to the system  data. By encapsulating the access to the data behind an API, the physical data schema may change without adversely affecting the larger system. This design pattern allows the location of databases on one or more physical computers while other components of the system  reside on different computers or in an embedded device\/appliance. Data access interface layers are used for access to the audit DB  and to the knowledge base .","The configuration data store  will contain a series of data elements\/data tables related to: users acting as senders and recipients; companies; message topics; features which have been enabled\/disabled, or statistics. This information is used depending upon which configuration option(s) is\/are turned on.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes of the invention. Accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims, rather than the foregoing specification, as indicated the scope of the invention.","All or part of the foregoing may be implemented as a computer program product that includes instructions that are stored on one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media, and that are executable on one or more processing devices.
