{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention is related to:\n\n","The invention relates generally to optical waveguides, and more particularly to apparatus and methods for obtaining and controlling optical signals from infrared lasers (and other nerve-stimulation-signal light sources) and low-level-light therapy sources, modulating the optical signals to form optical signals that are effective to control pain, and guiding the optical signals to the appropriate nerves using innovative waveguides.","Chronic or recurrent pain affects 20-25% of the U.S. population, and it leads to approximately $100 billion in health care costs each year. The lost productivity due to pain is estimated at approximately $50 billion per year in the U.S. (low back pain is alone responsible for about a third of this figure). Traditional pain treatments include drugs (e.g., opioids (the world-wide market size for opioids (e.g., morphine and hydrocodone) is approximately $36 billion), anti-convulsants, anti-depressants, epidurals\/anesthetics), surgery (e.g., disk surgery, nerve cutting), cognitive\/behavioral (e.g., biophsychosocial approach, relaxation\/biofeedback, placebo), and physical therapy. Other non-traditional approaches to pain management include acupuncture, ultrasound, and low-level light therapy (LLLT). The rule of thumb for leading pain researchers is that almost every major pain treatment creates about a 50% reduction in pain for 30-40% of patients (there is generally no good way to identify who will respond to a given treatment). Many drugs, particularly opioids, carry significant side effects and can become addictive. Depending on the study, 10-49% of back surgery patients are worse after the surgery (\u201cfailed back surgery syndrome\u201d).","For specific types of pain, or when more conservative approaches fail, electrical-signal stimulation (ES) is applied to neural tissue with \u201cneuromodulation\u201d devices to relieve the pain. These devices include peripheral nerve stimulators (PNS), deep brain stimulators (DBS), spinal cord stimulators (SCS), and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators (TENS). The first three types of devices are implanted, while TENS is applied on top of the skin. Combined, these devices have the opportunity for an approximately $1.5 billion dollar market.","While these electrical-signal-stimulation devices can be effective, they often lack the specificity to target the specific neurons responsible for pain without also activating other sensory or motor neurons as a side effect (because electrical current spreads in the body, most if not all neuromodulation devices wind up stimulating other nerves in the area besides the intended target (e.g. causing tremors or unintended sensations)). The presence of a stimulation artifact can also obfuscate signals elsewhere along the nerve, which precludes stimulating and recording electrical nerve activity in the same or nearby locations.","U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005\/0143789, filed Feb. 25, 2005 by Todd K.
