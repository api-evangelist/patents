{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This non-provisional patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application, Ser. No. 61\/366,077, filed Jul. 20, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.","This invention relates in general to online media content management and, in particular, to a system and method for providing searchable online media content.","Over the last few decades, digital data communication networks have evolved from simple local area networks that only interconnected computers within an office environment to wide area networks operating on a worldwide scale. Today, the most widely used public data communications network is pejoratively called the \u201cInternet,\u201d although the term is sometimes confused with the Worldwide Web (\u201cWeb\u201d), which refers to the set of hyperlinked documents and related resources available over the Internet, as well as other network portals.","The Internet is accessible through numerous wired and wireless network interfaces, the latter of which has undergone significant recent evolution as the capabilities of portable digital data processing and communications devices, such as smart mobile telephones, portable digital assistants, digital media players, and wireless tablet computers, have grown. And with the increased ubiquity of wireless digital data communications, access to an increasingly voluminous compendium of online content, including both traditional textual materials and audio and visual media, has become possible by a larger base of end users.","Video content available online, especially over the Internet, has appealed to an especially wide audience, from individuals to businesses and organizations, due to the breadth of subject matter that can be presented. For example, network and cable television programming and commercial movies are now offered through Web-based services, such as Hulu and Netflix. As well, video-sharing Web sites, such as YouTube and Yahoo! Video, allow end users to freely upload, share, and view video content. Similarly, popular social networking Web sites, such as MySpace and Facebook, tie in with video content sharing and viewing.","In a business environment, online video content has many uses with applicability in wide ranging fields, including e-learning, research, entertainment, corporate knowledge, surveillance, and user-generated content. Web casting, that is, streaming video or audio media delivery to an online viewing or listening audience, and Web conferencing, which transacts many-to-many real time communication, are currently the most popular business applications of online video content. However, video content has recently begun playing an increasingly important role in marketing and advertising, employee and customer training, and internal and external communications.","Nevertheless, despite the breadth of video content subject matter and applicability of use in business and other endeavors, challenges remain. For instance, video, audio, or other forms of multimedia content are only partially \u201cvisible\u201d to conventional search engines, which are typically limited to indexing any metadata, such as title or description, that happens to accompany the video content. Similarly, video content is ordinarily treated as a closed box within which end users must manually navigate to find a desired spot. Only high level tables of content, such as found with movie video content, partially facilitate internal navigation, but only to the extent of selecting enumerated chapters, after which the end user must manually navigate through the video content until the desired spot is found. On the same note, current online video content tools lack the convenience of providing ad hoc book marks of individual scenes. Instead, end users must clumsily note the time within the video content that a desired scene appears during playback, after which the time is shared with other users who must manually fast forward their video media players to the time indicated.","Therefore, a need remains for supplementing online media content, particularly video and audio content, with searching and marking features that facilitate searching and browsing through Web search engines and usability and sharing by end users.","One embodiment provides a system and method for managing video content. Sections within the video content can be temporally marked and annotated with a title and description. \u201cSnippets\u201d of transcripts can also be synchronized to the annotated sections. Both the annotations and snippets can be associated with sharable and searchable Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). A media player is provided with the capability of searching within video content being played, and end users are able to attach ad hoc bookmarks to sections or locations within the video content. In a further embodiment, online video metrics or analytics can be collected to track and analyze usage patterns at the Web site and Web page levels.","One embodiment provides a computer-implemented system and method for providing searchable online media content. A data store is maintained through a media server that is accessible online over a data communications network. Media content, including device-playable data provided for dynamic online use through remote streaming over the network, is stored. Media metadata, including markers synchronized to sections of the device-playable data, is also stored. The media content and the media metadata are functionally combined through a layered network architecture. The data store is provided as a data layer of the network architecture. Applications are provided within a client layer of the network architecture that execute on a client interconnected to the network. Service interfaces are provided within a data access layer of the network architecture, which are each accessible by at least one of the applications. The media content and the media metadata are combined in response to a request received through a service interface from one of the applications. The combined media content and media metadata are served to the requesting application including streaming the device-playable data.","Still other embodiments of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein are described embodiments by way of illustrating the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.","Online video content, as well as other types of audio and visual media, can be shared, viewed, and managed by end users interconnected through a network.  is a block diagram  showing an exemplary environment  for providing searchable online media content. Although described herein with reference to a typical business enterprise environment, the use and management of video content is applicable to any form of networked computing environment for all manner of end users.","A typical enterprise environment includes both local enterprise components operating within the confines of a corporate intranetwork , and outside components operating remotely over an internetwork , such as the Internet, through, for instance, a gateway . Enterprise components include servers  and clients , that are assigned to users in different areas of responsibility within a company. Outside components similarly include remote servers ,  and remote clients , which collaboratively interface with the enterprise components. Server functionality may be provided through a single physical server system, or by a combination of distributed server systems that can be situated both within and outside of the intranetwork . Other types of enterprise and outside components could also be a part of the enterprise environment. The servers , ,  and clients , ,  include hardware components conventionally found in general purpose programmable computing devices, such as a central processing unit, memory, input\/output ports, network interfaces, and non-volatile storage, and execute software programs structured into routines, functions, and modules for execution on the various systems.","For purpose of facilitating video content usability and sharing, the local enterprise components include a local server  that is coupled to a local media storage  (not shown), within which video content , as well as other forms of audio and visual media, are maintained. The video content  is accessible by both local clients , operating within the intranetwork  and remote clients  operating over the internetwork . As well, a remote server  operating over the internetwork  is coupled to a remote media storage , within which additional video content , as well as other forms of audio and visual media, can be maintained for both retrieval and storage into the local media storage  by the local server , and for remote sharing and viewing by the local clients , ","The local server  and the remote server  access a transcription and metadata database  when accessing, playing, or searching the video content . The local server  is coupled to the transcription and metadata database , which stores the transcripts  of and metadata  for video content  in the local media storage  and remote media storage . The transcription and metadata database  can be accessed by the local server , remote server , and clients , , . However, access is read-only and copying or modification of the transcription and metadata are disallowed. In one embodiment, the transcription and metadata database  is implemented using SQL Server 2008, Enterprise Edition, licensed by Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash. Other forms of structured relational databases could be used.","The local server  stores and executes one or more media server applications collectively referred to as a media platform , as further described below beginning with reference to . The video content metadata  \u201ctags\u201d the video content  with shareable, browseable, and searchable URLS that are accessible by both the local clients , and remote clients , as well as by external search engines , including a Web crawler  operating over the internetwork . Other local server functions and modules are possible.","Clients , can directly access the media platform  on the local server . Each client , respectively executes a media player , that provides end users with the capability of searching within the video content  being played, as further described below beginning with reference to . Other local client functions and modules are possible.","The media platform  and media players , ,  together provide searching and marking features that facilitate usability and sharing.  is a functional block diagram showing a process flow  for the components of . The media platform  executes on the local server  and exports a set of Web services interfaces  through which a variety of operations  can be performed by users on the servers , ,  and clients , , , as permitted by applicable permissions and restrictions.","Videos are a type of device-playable data that is a combination of both audio and video content. Specific locations within this content can be exposed for searching by external search engine , including Web crawling search engines, through media metadata  that includes media jots  and transcript snippets  stored in the transcription and metadata database . A media jot  is a title and description that is attached to specific sections within the video content . A transcript snippet  is a segment of transcript that is synchronized to specific sections within the video content . Both media jots  and transcript snippets  are maintained separately from the original video content , which is preferably left unmodified.","The media platform  exposes the media jots  and transcript snippets  in the transcription and metadata database  through the Web services interfaces  that enables the media jots  and transcript snippets  to be attached to Web-crawlable-and-indexable URLs. When an end user enters a search query using search terms or other searchable information, the media jots  and transcript snippets  allow the system to search for the terms and generate the search results to specific sections within the video content  in which the terms were found, as further described below with reference to . The media jots  and transcript snippets  can be searched in two ways. If site searching through an external search engine , such as a Web crawler, site map functionality  is exported and integrated into the external search engine . A site map list of the pages of a Web site accessible to Web crawlers or other Web search engines or to end users, which makes the metadata for the video content  available for search. Alternatively, a search application programming interface (API)  (operation ) is exported by the Web services interfaces  of the media platform  for integrating searching of local video content , generally as stored in the local media storage  (shown in ) with an existing site search  feature. The API can be integrated into an enterprise Web application platform, such as SharePoint, licensed by Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash., or other customizable portals, to provide a complete Web search environment. These portals permit searching of documents, Web pages, and video content online through the media jots  and transcript snippets .","Additionally, in conjunction with the media platform , individual media players  implement search within (operation ), table of contents (operation ), and bookmarks (operation ) features. End users are able to internally search, that is, search within, video content  during playback through their media players by browsing the media jots  and transcript snippets . As well, end users can browse a table of contents, click on a topic within the table of contents, and directly navigate to the location within the video content  indicated. The media player also allows end users to send hyperlinks to the sections within the video content . Finally, end users can temporally attach bookmarks to sections within video content  through their media player. The bookmarks are persisted across Web browser sections. Thus, end users can return to the video content  at a later time, click on a bookmark, and be returned to the same section.","Administrators are able to manage media (operation ), particularly video content , through an administration console (\u201cAdmin Console\u201d) , which executes, for instance, as a Web application through the Web services interfaces  of the media platform . The administration console  is typically installed on the local server . Lastly, in a further embodiment, the Web services interfaces  include an analytics API (operation ) that allow tracking of both site and video level analytics data. The site level analytics reports include top ten videos by view, top ten videos by duration, and viewing trends over a timeline. The video level analytics reports include top ten search terms, most popular topics, and bookmark usage data. Other analytics and reports are possible. Moreover, the analytics data can be integrated with conventional third party analytics software packages.","The suite of services provided through the media platform are implemented through a layered architecture.  is a block diagram showing an architectural view  of the components of . The three lowermost layers, data layer , data access layer , and service layer , are implemented in the media platform  on the local server  (shown in ). The fourth layer up, client layer , is implemented functionally external to the local server  on different physical systems, as explained below, while the top layer, end user layer , is logically implemented through Web browsers executing on clients , ,  and other systems. Other layered architectures are possible.","At the lowermost data layer , the transcription and metadata database  stores the media jots  and transcript snippets  independently of the actual video content , which is retained in original condition and stored in the local media storage  or remote media storage , although the media jots  and transcript snippets  could be integrated into the video content  directly. The transcription and metadata database  is implemented using SQL Server 2008, Enterprise Edition, licensed by Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash. Other forms of structured relational databases could be used.","The next layer up, data access layer , interfaces to the transcription and metadata database  through a language integrated query (\u201cLINQ\u201d)-to-SQL interface  that is implemented as a .NET Framework component, as licensed by Microsoft Corporation. The LINQ-to-SQL interface  defines a set of method names and translation rules that are used by four sets of services : data access layer (\u201cDAL\u201d) publish , DAL analyze , DAL search and browse , and DAL indexing and relevancy scoring .","The next layer up, service layer , primarily interfaces the three sets of services  that make up the media platform  with applications executing on different physical systems, such as clients , ,  (shown in ) executing in the client layer . The service layer  is implemented through a Windows Communication Foundation (\u201cWCF\u201d) service API, also implemented as a .NET Framework component for service-oriented applications. The services  interact with the applications in the client layer  through the service layer .","The DAL publish service  primarily interfaces with media players executing on clients , , . The DAL publish service  interfaces to the media players , which send video content  requests, including internal search queries that include search terms matching external queries. In response, the DAL publish service  executes the queries on the transcription and metadata database  by identifying markers in the metadata that match each query and sends search results back to the requesting media player , including metadata , table of contents data, bookmarks, and transcripts . Other types of requests and response data are possible. The DAL publish service  also persists metadata , particularly the media jots  and transcript snippets , to the transcription and metadata database  in the data layer . The metadata is provided through a searching and marking service, as described above with reference to .","The DAL analyze service  primarily interfaces to an administration Web site in the client layer  executing on the local server  as part of the media platform  (shown in ). The administration Web site  provides a user interface to an administration console  and analytics tool . The administration console  sends metadata , particularly the media jots  and transcript snippets , table of contents data, and transcripts  to the DAL analyze service , which in turn are persisted to the transcription and metadata database  in the data layer  by the DAL publish service . The DAL analyze service  collects and logs events and related data concerning use of the video content  by other applications into the transcription and metadata database  and retrieves the events and related data for use in generating analytics reports that are provided to the analytics tool .","Finally, the DAL search and browse service  implements external and internal search functionality, respectively, through both site searching and the search API , which is part of the client layer . The search API  sends search terms to the DAL search and browse service  that originated from searches generated by Web search engines and the like. In turn, the DAL search and browse service  sends requests for video content  details to a database server for the transcription and metadata database . Video content  that the server matches is provided back to the search API  as search results. In a further embodiment, information about the video content , user, group, and so forth can be used to determine a relevancy score as part of the indexing process by the DAL indexing and relevancy scoring service , as further described below with reference to .","In the topmost end user layer , Web sites  are browsed using Web browser applications on clients , , , within which media players  execute. The media players  can be executed by personal computers, handheld and mobile devices, and other systems and devices capable of serving and playing Web content. Video content  is provided to the Web sites  as embedded objects. The media players  are compliant with the Silverlight Web application framework, licensed by Microsoft Corporation, although other Web application frameworks could also be used, such as QuickTime, licensed by Apple Inc., Cupertino, Calif., and Adobe Flash, licensed by Adobe Systems, Mountain View, Calif. As well, Web pages are searched  within the end user layer  by submitting search queries that include search terms to external search engines  (shown in ) and through site searching front ends implemented using Web scripting interfaces, for example, Active Server Pages, licensed by Microsoft Corporation, or JavaScript, licensed by Netscape Communications Corporation, Mountain View, Calif.","Online media content, particularly video content , is provided with searching and marking features through a multi-step process.  is a flow diagram showing for providing searchable online media content . The steps are implemented in three stages that create transcripts (steps -), manage video content  (steps -), and integrate the video content  into Web sites (steps -). The steps can overlap.","During the transcript creation stage, the video content  is first provided to the service (step ), which transcribes any dialogue in the video content  and generates transcript snippets (step ). The transcript snippets are stored in the transcription and metadata database (step ).","During this stage, the video content  is indexed based on regularly updated data. In one embodiment, each type of available data concerning the video content  can be indexed, including any closed captions, transcripts, or metadata that is provided with the video content , as well as any user- or administrator-provided annotations and comments. In addition, information about the user is indexed, such as what chapter points, bookmarks, search terms, or videos they have searched, browsed, or watched, as well as what group, social cluster, demographic, or zip code-defined group they belong in and the videos which that group has watched. Multiple indexes can be used for different groups or individuals, or as needed for scaling, location, and architecture.","Referring back to , this regularly-updated information is used by the DAL indexing and relevancy scoring service . For each search, a relevancy score is calculated based on the foregoing regularly updated index data. The relevancy score can be used in various operations with the video content , including being displayed, stored, or made available through an API. In one embodiment, a relevancy edge scoring mechanism is used to tune the relevance in a search indexing engine, such as available in the Apache Lucene information retrieval software library, licensed by Apache Software Foundation, Forest Hill, Md., or the FAST ESP enterprise search product, formerly licensed by Fast Search & Transfer ASA, Oslo, Norway. Edge scoring is described in J. Sun et al., \u201cRelevance Search and Anomaly Detection in Bipartite Graphs,\u201d SIGKDD Explorations, 7(2): 48-55 (Spec. Issue on Link Mining December 2005), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Relevance tuning in a search indexing engine is described in J. Kumar, \u201cDocument Scoring\/Calculating Relevance in Lucene,\u201d available at http:\/\/jayant7k.blogspot.com\/2006\/07\/document-scoringcalculating-relevance08.html (July 2006), and \u201cTune relevance factors (FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint),\u201d available at http:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ff453902.aspx (February 2011), the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. The relevancy score can factor in the frequency of the search terms and other relevant business intelligence data. Based on the relevancy score, the search results can be ranked by relevancy to the applicable metric, such as user or group, and the most relevant search results can be returned in response to search queries of the video content .","Referring back to , during the management stage, the software components for the media platform are installed into the enterprise environment (step ) and details regarding the video content  are added to the transcription and metadata database (step ). The transcript snippets and any tags, that is, URLs that have been added to the video content , are associated with the original copy of the video content (step ). Thereafter, in a further embodiment, analytics are generated and reviewed as the video content  is viewed (step ).","Finally, during the site integration stage, the media players are installed into clients that execute at end user sites (step ). As well, video content  search capabilities are integrated (step ), whether using a site map or the search API.","The end users viewing video content  through their media players are able to search within video content  being played and attach ad hoc bookmarks to sections within the video content .  are diagrams showing, by way of example, screen shots of a user interface presented by one of the clients of . Referring first to , an overall screen shot  of the view presented to an end user within a media player is shown. The video content  plays in a viewing area , while a menu of playing options  are presented, including a table of contents option that causes a table of contents for the video content  being played to be displayed .
