Call recording may enable a transcription for legal purposes, marketing purposes, business purposes training purposes and\/or for other uses. Call recording at a user location may not capture the full call. For example, call recording implemented on a PBX (private branch exchange) may not capture a portion of a call prior to a transfer to the PBX or after a transfer from a PBX. Recording a call at a network location may require significant resources for processing and storage. Recording a call at a network location may require a service provider to deploy a new platform to handle call recording. The deployment of a new platform to handle call recording may require extensive resources and may take a significant portion of time.","Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Telecommunication devices  and  may be operatively connected to network  and\/or network .","Telecommunication devices  and  may transmit and\/or receive data to and\/or from network  and network  representing call data. The call data may be transmitted and\/or received utilizing a standard telecommunications protocol or a standard networking protocol. For example, one embodiment may utilize Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In other embodiments, the call data may be transmitted and\/or received utilizing other Voice Over IP (VOIP) protocols. Call data may be transmitted and\/or received wirelessly or may utilize cabled network or telecom connections such as an Ethernet RJ45\/Category 5 Ethernet connection, a fiber connection, a traditional phone wireline connection, a cable connection or other wired network connection. Telecommunication devices  and  may use standard wireless protocols including IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g. Telecommunication devices  and  may also be connected to networks  and\/or  via protocols for a wired connection, such as an IEEE Ethernet 802.3.","Networks  and\/or  may be local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), the Internet, cellular networks, satellite networks, long distance telecommunication networks, or other networks that permit the transfer and\/or reception of data to and\/or from telecommunication devices  and . Network  and\/or network  may utilize one or more protocols of telecommunication devices  and .

Network  and\/or network  may be IP (Internet Protocol) based networks, networks utilizing time domain multiplexing (TDM), networks utilizing signaling system #7 (SS7) and\/or networks utilizing other telecommunication or data protocols. Network  and\/or network  may contain one or more network elements.","Network elements , , and  may be Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) servers, application servers, user acceptance testing (UAT) application servers, record servers, voice response units (VRUs), bridging switches, gateways, tools servers, voice portals, network interactive voice response (IVR) nodes or other network devices. In some embodiments, VRUs, SS7 gateways, and application servers may be a part of a NGSN. Network elements , , and  may include one or more processors (not shown) for recording, transmitting, receiving, and or storing data. Although network elements , , and  are each depicted as one server, it should be appreciated that the contents of a network element may be combined into a fewer or greater number of devices and may be connected to one or more data storage systems. For example, network element  may be connected to one or more record servers. Furthermore, the record servers may be local, remote, or a combination thereof to network element .","Network elements , , and  may provide application programming interfaces (APIs), interface tables, remote procedure calls (rpcs), web services, Extensible Markup Language (XML) based interfaces, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based interfaces, common request broker architecture (CORBA), interfaces utilizing Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Common Gateway Interfaces (CGI), and other interfaces for sending or receiving call recording information.","Network client  may be a portable computer, according to one embodiment. Network client  may also be another device capable of sending and receiving network signals such as a personal digital assistant, desktop computer, workstation, server, and\/or a cellular telephone. Network client  may authenticate with a network using Wired Equivalent Privacy, Wi-Fi Protected Access or other wireless network security standards.","Data storage  may be local, remote, or a combination thereof to network elements , , and . Data storage  may utilize a redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID), a redundant array of inexpensive nodes (RAIN), tape, disk, or other computer accessible storage. In one or more embodiments data storage  may be a storage area network (SAN), an internet small computer systems interface (iSCSI) SAN, a Fibre Channel SAN, a common Internet File System (CIFS), network attached storage (NAS), or a network file system (NFS). Data storage  may utilize a file system, a database and\/or other storage management tools and utilities.","Data storage  may be storage utilized for storing recorded calls, recorded call metadata, call recording orders or requests, call recording users, and\/or other call recording data. In some embodiments, there may be multiple storage devices utilized. For example, recorded calls may be stored in one or more storage devices associated with a network element at which the call was captured, such as a voice response unit (VRU). A second or greater data storage device may be associated with a portal, or another centralized network element and may be utilized to store metadata associated with a call and\/or call order information.","In one or more embodiments, network element  may be a VRU, network element  may be an application server, and network element  may be a voice portal. In these embodiments, a user may utilize network client  to access a voice portal represented by network element . The user may request the recording of one or more calls and may specify call recording parameters. The call recording parameters may determine which calls or portions of calls are recorded. The recorded information may be stored in data storage . Network element  may forward the call recording request to one or more voice response units, such as network element . When a call is received by network element , the VRU may determine if the call matches the parameters of a call recording request. The network element  may determine if it has adequate resources to record one or more portions of the call. For example, network element  may determine if it has free ports or channels to utilize for recording a conversation utilizing digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities of the VRU. The number of channels required may depend upon whether a user requested a full recording (e.g., inbound and outbound legs, both sides of a call) or a partial recording (e.g., one leg of call). For example, enhanced call routing applications on NGSN may be \u2018wholly\u2019 recorded (meaning the whole call and all extensions may be recorded) or \u2018partially\u2019 recorded (meaning segments of a call may be recorded.) A VRU may utilize unused ports on a DSP board to record the call. The VRU may connect to a call to be recorded in a listen only connection to one or more legs of the call. For example, for the recording of both the send and receive legs of a call a VRU may utilize two ports of a DSP board, one for each leg. The VRU may receive the call data from a DSP board or other DSP component and may perform processing on the data prior to streaming the data to a record server, an application server or other storage. For example, the VRU may put the data into packets or otherwise process the data so that it is in a standard format. Processing and\/or putting the data into packets may ensure that call recording can be implemented in a similar manner on different types of networks. Processing the data may enable the same call recording implementation to be utilized on Time Domain Multiplexing (TDM) based networks, on IP based networks and on other types of networks. A VRU may encapsulate call data into Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets. The RTP packets may be encapsulated in User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. The UDP packets may be captured using Packet Capture (PCAP). A PCAP file may be then transferred to a record server, an application server, and\/or other storage. In one or more embodiments, DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) entries may be converted to RFC 2833 compliant packets. This may allow DTMF entries to be converted to packets and stored for subsequent rendering.","Prior to recording of a call, the VRU or another component may verify adequate storage space for a specified recording length or for an estimated recording length. For example storage space on a record server associated with the VRU or an application server associated with the VRU may be verified. A recorded call may be stored on an application server associated with the VRU such as network element . Metadata associated with a recorded call may be stored on storage associated with a voice portal. For example, metadata may be stored on a tools server or on storage associated with a tools server. The tools server may be utilized to provide call recording functionality to a voice portal. A voice portal and\/or a web portal may provide a customer interface for entering call recording requests and parameters.","The various components of system  as shown in  may be further duplicated, combined and\/or integrated to support various applications and platforms. Additional elements may also be implemented in the systems described above to support various applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","200","100","100","200","200","200","202"]},"At block , a new recording request may be received. The new recording request may be received from a user via a voice portal. The voice portal may allow a user to enter a call recording request. For example, network element  may be a voice portal and a user at network client  may access network element  to submit a new recording request. In some embodiments, network element  may be a portal providing web based access for one or more users. In these embodiments, a user may utilize web based access to submit a call recording request and\/or access other call recording functionality.","At block , a user may determine call recording attributes. For example, a user may specify whether to record all calls within a specified time range or a percentage of calls within a specified time range. A user may further identify calls to record by attributes such as calls related to a menu choice or option on a voice response unit, calls associated with a set of ANI (Automatic Number Identification) information, a calling party number, calls associated with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) information, a called party number and other attributes.","At block , the call recording request may be saved. In one or more embodiments, the call recording request received by a voice portal may be saved to storage associated with a tools server. For example, in one or more embodiments, network element  may be a tools server and a call recording request may be saved to data storage .","At block , one or more portions of a call recording request may be distributed to one or more VRUs. In some embodiments, the parameters utilized to identify which portions of which call may be distributed to one or more VRUs or an intelligent peripheral associated with a VRU. For example, a tools server or another network component receiving a call recording request from a user may forward the desired start time and stop time of recording and other identifying information such as calling party information.

For example, a VRU may utilize Automatic Number Identification (ANI) data, Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) data, a time interval, the identity of a user application, a called party number or other information associated with the call and may determine that the call matches an existing call request. For example, a call request may specify all calls associated with a certain user application, such as a Interactive Voice Response (IVR) application, are to be recorded. The VRU may match an identifier associated with the IVR application against a call and may determine that the call is to be recorded.","At block , the level of recording may be determined. For example, the VRU may determine that only one leg or side of a call should be recorded based on the call request.","At block , the VRU may stream captured audio to an intelligent peripheral, a recording server, an application server or another device for recording. The recording device may be associated with the VRU and may not require transmission of the data over a network, or may require transmission of the data only over a local or dedicated network condition. This may reduce an amount of recording data on one or more networks. In one or more embodiments, the VRU may stream captured audio to an application server and may thus utilize resources deployed on the network for other applications. In some embodiments, the VRU may stream captured audio to a dedicated recording server, which may provide extended storage for captured audio.","At block , captured audio may be encrypted. In some embodiments, encryption may be performed by an intelligent peripheral, a recording server, an application server or another device which may be capable of storing captured audio. In some embodiments, the VRU or a device associated with the VRU may perform encryption prior to streaming the captured audio. The VRU may also perform other processing such as encapsulating call data into packets.","At block , a record header for the captured audio may be generated. A record header may contain metadata about the captured audio. A record header may be associated with the captured recording and may contain an identifier that uniquely identifies the captured recording. One or more pieces of data in a record header may be utilized to request and\/or access the captured recording.","At block , record header information may be sent to one or more central locations.
