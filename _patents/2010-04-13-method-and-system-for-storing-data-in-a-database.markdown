title: Method and system for storing data in a database
abstract: A method allows one to store in a parallel way branches and nodes of a hierarchy into a database by creating queues. Each queue has a status and a unlock item indicating if a superior node has already been stored. A process looks up these indicators and performs according to commands received from a first process control of the queues.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method and a system for storing a hierarchy in a relational database management system (RDBMS) used within a manufacturing execution system (MES). The hierarchy has a root element and is structured into branches with nodes. The method is carried out by a first process knowing the hierarchy and a second process storing branches in the database, and the second process receives commands from the first process.","In the world of process automation and process monitoring standard automation systems for controlling the widest conceivable variety of machines and plants are known in the prior art. Such technology covers in particular a broad range of products which are offered by the Siemens Corporation under its SIMATIC\u00ae product family within the field of manufacturing execution systems (MES). An extensive line of products for solving the technical tasks in question such as counting, measuring, positioning, motion control, closed-loop control and cam control enhance the performance capabilities of appropriate process controllers. A variety of configurations enable the implementation of flexible machine concepts.","Software programs can deal with and represent data in various ways. Nowadays the most popular of them are Object Oriented programming and relational databases. Many programs representing data as objects maintain objects \u201clive\u201d in memory, or in their process allocation space, mainly for performance reasons: in this way, in fact, objects are immediately available to processes, without the need of accessing a data storage component, as a relational database management system (RDBMS). On the contrary, RDBMS give a powerful way to make data persistent, and allow other software components to access them in a standard way. The set of objects living in the process allocation space (i.e.: directly available on physical memory) is usually referred as the process image.","In manufacturing execution systems (MES) software applications relational databases are broadly used not only to store data stemming from the production process, but also, and even more attributed, to store configuration data, application data and system data.","The process image of complex programs can be very complex as well, and objects there contained can be related to each other, forming a hierarchy, which can be of different types. In an MES environment a common hierarchy is the topological one, where a plant can be described by a set of objects which can, in turn, contain other objects of a lower level.","In many cases in MES applications we have to handle the persistence in a RDBMS of entities\/objects hierarchies that are living in a process image managed using an Object Oriented Approach. One of these topological hierarchies is the plant model with all equipment defined for a plant according to the s95 standard levels, see ANSI\/ISA-95.00.01-2000 Enterprise-Control System Integration Part 1: Models and Terminology. Each equipment instance is an entity with a standard attribute, a list of other equipment, methods and default values. Such equipment is inserted in a topological hierarchy, and thus it may contain other equipment, which in turn contains other and so on.","Storing an actual plant can require a lot of time because any equipment has to be sent to the database with a correct sequence, in order to create an effective and a correct hierarchy into the database tables. There, in fact, each item of equipment must be saved only when a superior one (i.e.: the one which contains it) has already been saved. Note that, in order to correctly store a plant it is necessary to store the relation with the parent node for any child equipment. It has to be noted that this problem relies also on the wide field of object-relational mapping (ORM), which is one of the tougher things to accomplish in modern, object-oriented programming languages.","In the state of the art (e.g. prior art), the question is how has this problem been solved up to now?","Usually this operation is made in an asynchronous way sending the object data in a queue. A dedicated process takes data from the queue and stores it in the database. The data have to be inserted, in the queue, in the correct order: first is the root entity then the first children level and so on. On the other side the process that stores data in a RDBMS has to proceed storing the root equipment and then the first children level of equipments storing also, for each child, the relation with the parent node. The correct ordering is guaranteed by the fact that:","The module where the hierarchy is defined is the one which inserts the equipment in queue, and thus can insert them in the correct order.","Elements in the queue are stored one by one; the subsequent element is stored only when the previous has been correctly stored, thus not altering the order.","The drawbacks of this approach are now described.","i) Since storing the equipment in RDBMS is an operation longer than inserting it in a queue, to avoid that it may grow indefinitely, speed of saving is ultimately determined by RDBMS.","ii) Additionally, to preserving ordering, the queue is unique and it is not possible to take advantage of multiprocessor hardware (HW), which is available now.","iii) The operation is not scalable.","Due to the above problems, this operation can be very time-consuming and ultimately unaffordable in case of a hierarchy with large structures to save. In such a case, downloading a plant model of medium complexity can require hours of work on the RDBMS side.","It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a method and a system for storing a hierarchy in a RDBMS which overcome the drawbacks of the known solutions for storing a hierarchy in a RDBMS of the prior art methods and devices of this general type.","With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention a method for storing a hierarchy in a database being part of a relational database management system. The hierarchy has a root element and is structured into branches with nodes. The method is carried out by a first process knowing the hierarchy and a second process storing the branches in the database. The second process receives commands from the first process. The method includes structuring the second process in queues, where a queue is created via a command from the first process except a first queue which is always present with a status RUNNING. The other queues are created with a status WAIT. Each of the queues has access to the database independently from another one of the queues. The root element is inserted in the first queue and the root element is stored in the database. Further nodes of the hierarchy are inserted in the other queues, where in each of the queues an unlock item is held indicating if a superior node already has been stored in the database, if not, the queue is held in the status WAIT until the unlock item contains an id of the superior node. A threading of the queues is performed via the second process by extracting a first node, storing the first node in the database, and looking in the other queues if one of them has the unlocked item equal to the superior node just stored, and changing the status of the queue to RUNNING.","To speed up the overall operation objects must be stored in parallel, while maintaining a correct ordering. The basic idea comes noting that the order must be maintained inside a branch of the global tree, but parallel branches can be stored independently. Exploiting this idea makes it possible for the storing process to able to work in parallel: each branch of the tree will in fact be processed by a different thread running in parallel. The number of threads can be configured taking in account PC resource usage versus speed of saving and spread of hierarchy. Since the number of threads does not affect the saving process behavior, but only its speed, the process is easily scalable according to user needs.","The advantages of the present invention are related to the possibility to save in a parallel way a branch of a hierarchy leaving to the owner of the tree the configuration and the optimization of the algorithm to avoid queue to stop\/start many time.","With this approach saving complex hierarchy of objects in databases is feasible in reasonable time. Moreover, the time can be further reduced by adjusting the number of queues, leveraging multiprocessor architectures more and more common nowadays. With this approach, we can make complex hierarchies of objects saved on RDBMS in a time which is compatible with real time operations. In this way, the publication of such structures living in process images of single programs can be done on standard ROBMS, opening a wide set of possibilities.","The proposed algorithm can be in advance widely used in every case where a object oriented structure must be saved on RDBMS, like in the more recent object-oriented programming methodologies (see Microsoft's OEM for an example).","Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims.","Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a method and a system for storing a hierarchy in a RDBMS, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.","The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first, particularly, to  thereof, there is shown as an example of a hierarchy, a plant hierarchy. The hierarchy is structured into several branches. It can be easily noticed that each branch can be saved independently from others. One may assume to have more than one queue saving objects. This is not yet sufficient however; because it is not wanted that each queue will be statically assigned to a branch of the tree. In other words, it is not wanted that in the previous example CELL-PO-O branch will be managed by queue Q and CELL-PO- branch by queue Q.","The main reasons are:","i) Saving time in the different branches can vary in unpredictable ways (it depends from a single object's complexity, which should not be considered in advance, to speed up the algorithm).","ii) The number of elements in the branches and the sub branches can be very different, so having a queue working and another empty, and thus not exploiting parallel computing.","iii) It may not be inserted a \u201cpredictive\u201d algorithm to decide which queue must be used; instead, the algorithm must work even if the queue is chosen randomly.","So, the algorithm must deal with the fact that in the same queue, objects belonging to different trees must be inserted, while still maintaining the correct order between them.","Before describing the algorithm, the involved elements are listed as follows with reference to :","1. Process P manages the object hierarchy and is shown in . This is an object oriented process which holds the process image and deals with living objects; particularly, it knows the hierarchy. The main tasks of process P are now described:","1.1 To communicate to the Queue Manager, implemented via a Storing Server, how many queues are needed.","1.2 To walk through the tree starting from the root and the processing children.","1.3 Sending an item to a queue.","2. The Storing Server creates and manages queues and stores objects in a RDBMS  being part of a database system  having a database  as shown in . A direct link library (DLL) that expose the set of an application programming interface (API)) has to be used by the process P in order to communicate with the server. The main tasks of the Storing Server are:","2.1 Creating the required queues and managing their status.","2.2 Serializing access to the header information of queues.","2.3 Extracting items from queues in parallel (a thread is dedicated to that for each queue).","2.4 Storing data items on RDMBS.","3. A queue is an item living in the process P respectively in the storing server, created by a command from the process P, which has the following attributes:","3.1 Status: RUNNING, WAIT, FULL.","3.2 Unlock Item: Is an identification of the item that has to be already saved into RDBMS before proceeding to extract a new item from the queue.","3.3 Item list: Contains items representing the entities to be stored on the database; each item is a node of hierarchy.","3.4 The number of items in the queue (zero means an empty queue). It has to be considered that the queue has a maximum dimension in term of bytes.","The status of a queue determines its behavior: when a queue is in status WAIT, no elements will be saved.","4. The main Queue Q is a queue like others queues but","4.1 it is always created;","4.2 The status is set to \u201cRUNNING\u201d at the creation by default. All remaining queues are created with the status set to WAIT.","4.3 The unlock element for all queues except the main queue contains the name of the \u201cRoot\u201d of the plant hierarchy.","5. Item: is a file of type XML that contains data to be stored: in this file of type XML the following information are mandatory.","5.1 Unique id of equipment (or tree node id).","5.2 Unique id of his parent equipment (parent tree node id) root node has this field empty.","The algorithm is described in the following:","a) Process P, looking at a hierarchy to save, and a user configuration asks Process P to create n queues.","b) Process P looks if the requested number of queues has already been created; if not, it will be created.","c) Process P inserts the hierarchy root element in the main queue (all other queues are waiting for the root to be saved).","d) Process P recursively looks at sub nodes of the tree and inserts them in available queues. The choice of the queue must not be important: it can be a simple round robin algorithm. What is important is that each item is inserted with the knowledge of its \u201csuperior\u201d (i.e. the object containing it in hierarchy).\n\ne) Process P threads managing queues by the steps:\n","V.1 Extract the first item;","a) V.2 Save it on RDBMS;","b) V.3 Once saved, it looks on other waiting queues: if some of them has the \u201cunlock item\u201d equal to the one just saved, it changes its status to RUNNING;","c) V.4 If the saving on RDBMS fails because the superior object has not been saved:","i) The queue's status is set to WAIT,","ii) the unlock item is set to the name of the superior object blocking.","It has to be noted that with this approach a dead lock can not be excluded, in this case:","(1) A superior object SO is inserted in a queue Q different from that containing a child node CN in Queue Q;","(2) The superior object SO is saved in the very same moment when the child node CN fails;","(3) The queue Q status is checked (due to the save of the superior object SO) from queue Q before being set to \u201cfail\u201d (due to failure in saving the child Node CN).","In this case, when the superior object (SO) is saved queue Q is not awakened (because is still running) and shortly after queue Q is put in wait (by failure in saving the CN), without being awakened later by queue Q (because the SO has already been saved).","This is true also in case where we have more than two queues. To avoid this dead lock, a simple retry mechanism can be added at the last point of the previous algorithm: when the saving on RDBMS fails because the superior object has not been saved, another retry is issued. The retry for sure comes after the saving of the superior object, and thus the saving can proceed. To cover each possible time combination, this retry is issued when both of the following conditions occur:","Failure of saving the element in queue; and","Status of the holding queue equal to run.","An embodiment of the present invention will be explained with the following example, let's suppose that the below depicted hierarchy has to be saved on a RDBMS:","Site-O\n\n","A user configured process P is to have 3 queues available; inserting an element in a queue from process P to the storing server is faster than storing an element from the queue to the RDBMS. At a certain point, a connection between the RDBMS and the storing server might break. Let's now follow a step-by-step discussion of what can happen with the proposed algorithm:","1.
