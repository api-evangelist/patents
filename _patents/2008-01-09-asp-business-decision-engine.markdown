No. 09\/790,382, filed Feb. 21, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,356,503.","1. Technical Field","The invention relates to the submission of applications for credit. More particularly, the invention relates to a decision engine that facilitates the submission, receipt, and evaluation of an application for credit.","2. Description of the Prior Art","For those entities who apply for, offer, or broker credit in its various forms there are solutions available that allow one to obtain credit bureau data, parse it, and provide the data, e.g. an easy to read version of the data, create additional values from the original data, and return the reasons for the data. Company of San Rafael, Calif. offers a SEARCH product, which is an example of these solutions. There have been many components of the solution available as end-user solutions. There have also been some components available as on-line, e.g. Internet or direct dial up connection, solutions.","There are also scoring engine technologies that Fair, Isaac (hereinafter, interchangeably used with the term \u201cCompany\u201d), HNC Software, Inc., American Management Systems, Incorporated (AMS), Experian Information Solutions, Inc., and many other companies produce. These tools allow end-users to implement a scoring model in a software tool and return the score, the reasons for the score, and all the ancillary data back to the calling system. Company solutions include TRIAD\u2122, ASAP\u2122, StrategyWare\u00ae-ASAP\u2122, CreditCenter\u2122, Prosper, Prosper-ASAP, ScoreWare\u00ae, decision system, StrategyWare\u00ae, CreditDesk\u00ae, and SBSS-CreditDesk\u00ae.","Other systems can create additional complex characteristics, which are values derived from other data, such as determining the \u201copen amount to buy on credit card balances\u201d, calculated from the various lines of credit, their associated balances and their limits. Such systems can implement segmentation strategies, e.g. defining who in Northern California might want a car loan, execute rules, for example \u201cDo not lend to people under the age of 18,\u201d and implement multiple score models in series. These rules, strategies, models, and characteristics are established by the clients who use or implement the system, or their representatives. Company products in this space include a decision system and StrategyWare.","It would be advantageous to provide a solution that integrates all of the components of a credit application process, including access to and manipulation of credit bureau data, credit scoring, and credit decisioning into a single application service provider (ASP) platform.","The invention provides a solution that integrates all of the components of a credit application process, including access to and manipulation of credit bureau data, credit scoring, and credit decisioning into a single application service provider (ASP) platform.","The presently preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a solution that combines analytic and decisioning technology with Web-based credit granting in an ASP model. The invention applies available credit origination solutions and brings such solutions to the Internet.","The decision ASP environment disclosed herein allows clients to reduce the time and costs associated with installation, upgrades, and maintenance of software and analytic common to the traditional mainframe environment. For users of mainframe solutions, this reduces or eliminates the problems with the inflexibility of the mainframe, maintenance issues, and continual update\/scalability\/migration issues.","The invention allows credit brokers to benefit from access to a wider audience for their services. In addition to attracting more consumers, brokers are able to offer multiple choices based on the consumer's individual needs and situation, resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction. This aspect of the invention is implemented in a broker engine that matches scored applicants to credit grantors' lending criteria, and that presents applicants with a variety of credit options within seconds. Applicants receive a list of multiple offers and multiple terms, while participating lenders receive quality borrowers.","The invention reduces total cost of ownership for decisioning applications. Without large up-front costs and with reduced need for maintenance, the total cost of ownership is greatly reduced, leading to an enhanced return on investment and profitability. In addition the service can be made available within an institution and its associated components worldwide, in days rather than months to years.","Consumers and small businesses benefit from the convenience of getting credit when and where they want it. The broker engine provides consumers with the ability to get credit at point of Internet purchases, allowing them to make instant purchases, i.e. they do not have to wait minutes\/hours\/days for credit approval. The broker engine also provides consumers with access to multiple lending sources offering more credit \u201cat an fingertips when one should want it.\u201d","Financial institutions get best-in-class decision technology, available through their browser. For those who are already racing to the Web environment, the decision engine disclosed herein gets them there quicker.","Consumers are demanding access to financial information and products via the Web. The decision engine enables financial institutions to offer not just electronic brochures on their Web site, but it enables them to accept and decision credit applications immediately and in an automated environment. This increases a financial institution's ability to meet consumer demands for immediate credit and improve customer service with faster responses and more ways to say \u201cyes\u201d to requests.","In cases where credit will not be offered to an applicant, the reasons for not providing credit are automatically generated off of the objective algorithms built into the invention, meeting the legal requirements for adverse action. Using the invention, lenders automatically have the data returned necessary to be legally compliant in taking adverse action through reason codes provided within the invention.","The invention is uniquely suited to help acquire new consumer and small business customers via the Internet.","The invention offers at least the following advantages over known credit decisioning solutions:","The invention gives credit decisions powered by, in the presently preferred embodiment, Company's gold standard analytic and decision technology.","The invention can be up and running in days, reducing the wait until initial implementation and subsequent upgrades. As the objective scorecards are based on historical data, reducing the time to implement the scorecards significantly improves the quality of using the scorecards. Present solutions can take months to years to implement while this invention has had implementations in days to weeks and upgrades can be instantaneous with the changing of the scorecard.","The invention can respond in seconds to each interaction. This will significantly reduce the number of abandoned online shopping carts by offering instant purchasing power at the point of customer contact. Each second has a measurable impact upon the willingness of the consumer to continue to wait.","The invention does not require significant investment in time and cost for on-site software installations, implementation, upgrades, and maintenance.","With the invention's decision support in the background, a client's site can maintain their own unique look and feel. The application can provide decisioning through a defined application programming interface (API) that allows an existing system or developed system to use the decisioning without having to change the look and feel.","The decision engine provides access to multiple lender's products simultaneously so that each application can be evaluated against a pool of competing lenders for providing instant credit and establishing lasting customer relationships.","The decision engine empowers traditional credit grantors to develop instant credit relationships via their Web sites. Product matching technology supports decision strategies, optimizing electronic solicitation campaigns, and encouraging visiting customers and prospects to apply for credit with the promise of an instantaneous reply.","The decision engine allows e-tailers and virtual marketplaces quickly and significantly to increase sales revenue, turning browsers into buyers. By offering immediate purchasing power, businesses establish relationships that grow beyond single transactions, up-selling or cross-selling goods to shoppers with instant credit.","Getting started is significantly faster and more cost-effective. Thus, it is easy to begin building customer relationships with the decision engine. The client takes the consumer or small business customer's application for credit and sends that information to the invention to an API using Extensible Markup Language (XML). In seconds, the invention returns all matching credit products for presentation to the customer via a synchrous response in the API via XML.","The invention provides the ability to establish, manage, and update credit product matching criteria at any time. The end-user (client) or multiple clients (for broker engine) each can have multiple unique decisioning rules and factors assessed simultaneously, in seconds.","The invention is optimized to allow direct feeds of the decisioning strategies into the invention through an API. This allows the clients current data bases, legacy systems, account management systems, or other technologies as well as partner technologies to feed very complex decisioning strategies and products automatically into the invention. This allows the system to seamlessly work with other technologies, reduces re-keying, reduces errors, and allows for simultaneous use of the same strategies in the client's systems and the invention.","The invention incorporates product match technology to fully compare all credit products in the invention with the characteristics of the application. It then will either return either many offers of credit, one offer of credit, and\/or conditional offers of credit or it will return the reasons that the application did not have any matches.","The invention is fast to market because it offers the choice of existing, pre-developed application risk models, developed using national pools of data from the combined experience of consumer and small business credit grantors, and industry-standard FICO\u00ae credit bureau scores. Or it can implement custom models.","The invention provides a solution that integrates all components of a credit application process, including access to and manipulation of credit bureau data, credit scoring, and credit decisioning into a single application service provider (ASP) platform.","The presently preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a solution that combines analytic and decisioning technology with Web-based credit granting in an ASP model. The invention applies available credit origination solutions and brings such solutions to the Internet. The invention is comprised of various modules that include the following three modules, i.e. the app engine, the broker engine, and the decision engine.","App Engine","In the app engine, one of the three main services that comprise the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, a client facilitates the decisioning of applications for a financial institution. For example, a bank employee uses this service in place of an end user application processing system. A graphical user interface (GUI) allows the collection of needed data to submit a request for a loan, credit card, lease, or line of credit. On submission of an application by the customer, certain application data are sent to a decision engine.","The decision engine, in turn, pulls a credit reporting agency report(s), and scores the application. The application data, e.g. credit reporting agency data and score for each applicant, reason codes, and all generated data used in the decision, are then sent back to the GUI to be presented for further processing. If appropriate, the loan is automatically recommended for approval, review, or disapproval. If approved the application, decisioning, and credit bureau data are provided to a secure server for the institution to obtain and use. If review is needed, the application is routed to the appropriate group for further work and manual decisioning. If disapproved, the reasons for the disapproval and all of the application, decisioning, and credit bureau data are provided to a secure server for the institution to obtain and use. Reports are provided on-line on the system performance, decisioning results, and through put are available on-line. A data base of all the application, decisioning, and credit bureau data is maintained for an appropriate interval which, in the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, is up to 26 months meeting Federal lending requirements for retaining data after denying credit. The app engine supports both consumer and small business credit decisioning","Broker Engine","In the broker engine, a financial services broker facilitates the decisioning of applications for many financial institutions. The broker has an existing application processing system that supports external decisioning. On submission of an application by the customer, certain application data are sent to the broker engine through an XML API. The broker engine supports both consumer and small business credit decisioning","The broker engine, in turn, pulls a credit reporting agency report(s), scores the application, and performs a product match. The product match identifies all of the products for which the applicant(s) or small business is qualified, for each financial institution working with the broker. The application data, e.g. credit reporting agency data, score, reason codes, product matches, are then sent back to the broker for further processing.","Decision Engine","In the decision engine, one institution's applications are received through the XML API and are processed. The institution has an existing application processing system that supports external decisioning. On submission of an application by the customer, certain application data are sent to the decision engine via the API.","The decision engine, in turn, pulls a credit reporting agency report(s), scores the application, and performs a product match. The product match identifies all of the products for which the applicant is qualified, for each financial institution working with the broker. The application data, e.g. credit reporting agency data, score, reason codes, product matches, are then sent back to the broker for further processing. The decision engine supports both consumer and small business credit decisioning","Application Programming Interface (API)","The API consists of a number of function calls which provide the ability to interact with the three engines. The APIs are accessed using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and the data are submitted using XML. All calls to the API are synchronous.","How do the Engines Work","The decision or broker engine receives a call from an application processing system, process, or web site to make a decision on an application. Using the data in the application and the pre-programmed bureau preferences of the clients, the engine obtains a credit bureau report on the applicant and the co-applicant (if co-applicant information is submitted). In small business decisioning, two principles and the small business credit reports may be obtained.","The engine then automatically routes the application and credit bureau data to the decisioning engine to obtain a combined score, i.e. application and credit bureau scores. The broker engine then uses this score and other factors established by the financial services institutions (clients), to determine the product(s) for which the application qualifies.","The matching technology in the preferred embodiment of the invention emulates the technology used by a bone marrow matching system that is in the public domain (National Marrow Donor Program matching HLA types for the Bone Marrow Donors). The interface to provide and retrieve data to the system is based on the XML and the simple object access protocol (SOAP). The fields for this input and out are unique to the invention.","The broker engine then returns these product(s) matches to the calling system with all decisioning data and reason codes. The matches can be from similar products (all loans), dissimilar products, (credit card, loan, and lease), or no products might be recommended. Reason codes are returned in the data if no products can be recommended.","After the products are returned, the calling system allows the applicant to choose the best product for them. The calling system then creates a second call to the broker engine to tell it what product was selected. The broker engine, in turn, sends this selection to the appropriate financial services institution with complete decisioning information and reruns the same to the calling system.","All the set up of the product data and their conditions required for these products are entered into the broker engine through a set of administrative screens. The financial services institution, or its designated representative, can change the products offered and then offer new, or changed conditions daily, if desired.","Capacity","The preferred engines are capable of processing thousands of applications per minute with pre-built system extensibility to accommodate significant increases in volume.","Configuration","One or more loan, lease, or revolving products must be configured before clients can process applications. Product configuration allows the lenders to specify product offerings that are very similar or even very different, depending on how they are configured. Products can be set up to target similar or different market segments. They can be categorized as either revolving or direct credit. Additionally, for each product offering, lenders can specify useful identification numbers, descriptive information, and other offer terms.","Access to the product configuration is provided through a set of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) forms (see the ). A lender administrator  enters the necessary information into the forms, and then submits the information to the broker engine  across an HTTPS connection.","The broker engine validates the submitted information, and then stores it on a product database . Each night the new product information is placed into production.","The product configuration information includes both information about the product offering and the match criteria for that product.","Processing Applications",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","22","14","28"]},"The system sends the product selection, all decisioning data (including application and bureau data), and reason codes out to a secure site  for the lender who created the product. The lender is then notified that a decisioned application is waiting for then to download. For broker engine, after the product is accepted by the applicant, the system submits a second call to the API to notify the lender and obtain the product data.","Credit Bureau Interface","With the invention, the client accesses the service via the Internet. The system looks to the bureau  like a client themselves or a \u201cthird party processor\u201d to connect to the bureaus' product system. The client still works with their existing bureau representative to establish their services and set up their account. They continue to use their existing subscriber contact name, but must get a new subscriber number for an access name. They then have the same type of contractual and pricing relationship with the bureau. The only difference is that the client does not need to obtain a phone number or leased line from the bureau because the invention is connecting to the bureau.","Data Exchange","Data exchange between the client and the system takes place using three technologies simultaneously:\n\n","For security reasons, the invention uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), routed through selected system ports, as the communication protocol for remote API calls over the Internet.","SOAP Envelopes","Method or function calls are accomplished using SOAP envelopes. The invention uses the SOAP 1.0 working draft specification, which can be found on the Web. For additional information on SOAP, refer to book Professional XML.","Table 1 depicts the coding for the HTTP POST header and the SOAP envelope and method call from the client system to the system, where FunctionName represents the name of the remote API function and where enginename represents the engine being accessed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0077"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SOAP Envelope and Method Call for XML Input to System"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"POST \/ enginename\/LiquidCredit.asp HTTP \/ 1.1"]},{"entry":["HTTP",{},"Host:liquidcredit"]},{"entry":["POST"," {open oversize brace} ","Content-Type: text \/ xml"]},{"entry":["Header",{},"Content-Length: nnn"]},{"entry":[{},{},"SOAPMethodName: SOAP#FunctionName"]},{"entry":[{},{},"<SOAP:Envelope xmlns:SOAP=*urn:schemas-xmlsoap-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003org:soap.v1*>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003<SOAP:Body>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003<m:FunctionName xmlns:m=*SOAP*>"]},{"entry":["SOAP",{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<String>"]},{"entry":["Envelope"," {open oversize brace} ","\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<!--Insert XML input to LiquidCredit here-->"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/String>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003<\/m:FunctionName>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003<\/SOAP:Body>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"<\/SOAP: Envelope>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 2 depicts the HTTP POST header and the SOAP envelope coding returned from the system, where FunctionName includes the name of the function called.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0079"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SOAP Envelope for XML Output from System"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"HTTP\/ 1.1 200 OK"]},{"entry":["HTTP POST",{},"Connection:close"]},{"entry":["Header"," {open oversize brace} ","Content-Type:text\/xml"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Content-Length:nnnn"]},{"entry":[{},{},"<SOAP:Envelope xmlns:SOAP=*urn:schemas-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003xmlsoap-org:soap.v1*>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003<SOAP:Body>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003<m:FunctionNameResponse xmlns:m=*SOAP*>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<String>"]},{"entry":["SOAP"," {open oversize brace} ","\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<!--XML output from LiquidCredit appears"]},{"entry":["Envelope",{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003here-->"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/String>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003<\/m:FunctionNameResponse>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003<\/SOAP:Body>"]},{"entry":[{},{},"<\/SOAP: Envelope>"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Electronic data exchange between the client system and system of the invention is facilitated by XML input and output payloads incorporating consumer and\/or business data.
