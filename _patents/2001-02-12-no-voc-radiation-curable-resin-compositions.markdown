{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 60\/182,619, filed on Feb. 15, 2000; and U.S. provisional application No. 60\/220,988, filed on Jul. 25, 2000, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. provisional application No. 60\/182,619, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Funding for the present invention was obtained from the Government of the United States by virtue of Contract No. F09650-98-M-1024 from the U.S. Department of the Air Force. Thus, the Government of the United States has certain rights in and to the invention claimed herein.","This invention relates to radiation curable resin compositions that contain no or essentially no volatile organic components (VOCs), and to methods of using these compositions. The radiation curable resin compositions find particular use as coating compositions. In particular, the radiation curable resin compositions of this invention comprise a vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomer blended with a photoinitiator.","Curable resins are suitable for a variety of applications. For example, curable resins have been used as coatings, sealants and adhesives, and in producing molded articles. The manufacturing facilities that utilize conventional curable resins in their operations are typically expensive to maintain due to the nature of these resins. Conventional curable resins are typically solvent-based and contain volatile organic components (VOCs). VOCs favorably affect the viscosity of curable resins, and often VOCs are added so as to make the curable resin composition sprayable. This is a particularly desired quality for coating applications (e.g. furniture, automobile, ship, aircraft and other transportation vehicle coating applications). However, during the application and cure of these conventional resin compositions, substantial amounts of VOCs are released into the atmosphere. This is a serious problem because VOCs are toxic, flammable, explosive, smog-producing and noxious. As a result, elaborate and expensive fire and explosion-prevention measures, worker protection measures and pollution control equipment are required during the use of such conventional resins.","A number of resin manufacturers are currently developing low\/no VOC curable resin formulations including, high solids, blocked isocyanate polyurethanes and aqueous-based polyurethane dispersions. These emerging resins possess certain advantageous attributes, but not without specific drawbacks. High solids formulations use low VOCs and provide equivalent performance to low solids urethanes, but cannot be applied using spraying techniques. Blocked isocyanate polyurethanes also use low VOCs and have low toxicity levels and good properties. These materials however, must be cured at elevated temperatures around 150 to 200\u00b0 C., which is not practical in most applications, for example in coating automobiles and aircraft. Aqueous based polyurethanes use no VOCs, are nontoxic and easy to apply via spraying. To date, however, these polyurethanes have not provided the properties required to meet military specifications, such as adhesion and moisture-resistance, desired for high performance applications.","Polyesters have emerged as promising candidates for inclusion as components in advanced aircraft coatings. Polyesters are polymers formed by the reaction of aliphatic or aromatic polyol monomers with aromatic or aliphatic diacids in the presence of catalyst, usually, metallic acetates, such as calcium acetate. Polyesters can provide a combination of useful properties including: clarity, transparency, absence of color, flexibility, excellent adhesion to most substrates, abrasion-resistance, water-resistance, fuel and oil-resistance, UV-resistance, weather-resistance, variable hardness (from elastomer to tough plastic), moderate cost, low temperature flexibility and availability as variable molecular weight, ester-endcapped, difunctional prepolymers.","Polyester polymers cannot be used as curable resins themselves, however, since their functionality is not conducive to the formation of hard, cross-linked structures. To be used advantageously as advanced coatings, polyester polymers must first be functionalized with reactive groups, such as hydroxyl groups, and then cured by chemical reaction with other comonomers, such as polyurethane diisocyanate monomers, into hard, tough polymer resins that can be used as protective coatings. Hydroxy-functional, polyester-based reactive prepolymers are frequently selected for use as components in polyurethane coatings over polyether and other type, polymers since they typically impart superior solvent-resistance, mechanical toughness and clarity to the coating and do not yellow upon exposure to intense UV light.","The major problems associated with the use of polyester-derived polyurethanes have involved the requirement for addition of substantial quantities of flammable, toxic solvents to polyurethane coating formulations to lower viscosity sufficiently for spray-painting operations. Another problem involved the use of toxic, irritating and volatile diisocyanate monomer components as major components in the polyurethane coating. The vapors that evolve from polyurethane operations may cause serious injury to workers breathing the fumes if they do not wear protective equipment.","A number of polyester-polyurethane coating manufacturers have been actively pursuing the development of low VOC and no VOC polyurethane curable resin formulations. To date however, none of these resins have exhibited the required processability or properties for use in e.g., automotive and aircraft coatings.","For example, damaged areas on U.S. Air Force aircraft are currently repaired on-site using aerosol sprayed coating compositions containing single component polyurethane enamel. Generally, these compositions are sprayed on the damaged portion of the aircraft and allowed to dry.","One disadvantage associated with such methods and compositions is that substantial amounts of volatile organic solvents (VOCs) are released into the atmosphere during application. In addition, such \u201ctouch-up\u201d methods and compositions result in coatings having significantly inferior properties as compared to the original coating. Namely, the portions of the aircraft that are repaired using these one component polyurethane enamels have inferior abrasion-resistance, UV stability and fuel\/oil resistance properties as compared to the original two-component polyurethane (PUR) coating of the aircraft. This is because unlike the two-part PURs, the one component coating formulation does not cure in-situ to form a crosslinked urethane structure in place, but, rather, simply deposits as a film upon evaporation of solvent.","Two-component aliphatic polyurethane compositions have been developed which provide satisfactory performance as aircraft coatings after drying and cure. However, to date, these coating compositions require the use of large quantities of flammable, toxic and environmentally hazardous organic solvents\/diluents to produce low viscosity sprayable coatings. In addition, these polyurethane coating compositions utilize pure aliphatic diisocyanate as one of the reactive components. During coating and cure operations the pure aliphatic diisocyanate component liberates toxic vapors that may harm the workers and the environment.","A number of aircraft coating manufacturers are currently developing low\/no VOC coating formulations including, high solids, blocked isocyanate polyurethanes and aqueous-based polyurethane dispersions. However, to date, these new materials have either been too high in viscosity for spraying, require excessive temperatures for cure (150 to 200\u00b0 C.) or simply did not provide the properties required to meet military specifications. For example, while the high solids formulations use low VOCs and provide performance equivalent to that of low solids urethanes, these formulations cannot be applied using spraying techniques. Blocked isocyanate polyurethanes also use low VOCs, have low toxicity levels and good properties. However, these materials must be cured at elevated temperatures (150 to 200\u00b0 C.), which are not practical when coating aircraft, since must be coated at ambient temperature. Aqueous based polyurethanes use no VOCs, are nontoxic and easy to apply via spraying. However, to date, these compositions do not provide the properties required to meet military specifications, such as adhesion and moisture-resistance.","Furthermore, current coating repair processes do not take into account the need to replace the underlying corrosion-resistant conversion coating and primer coating layers that were originally applied to the aircraft aluminum surface skin prior to application of the PUR topcoat. During surface preparation for re-coating, most damaged coatings are currently sanded down to bare metal, thereby removing any primer and conversion coating that might have remained and exposing the metal to the threat of corrosion, even after application of topcoat.","Accordingly, what is needed are improved curable resin compositions that contain no or substantially no VOC's and methods of using these compositions whereby no VOC's are released. It is desired that these curable resin compositions are convenient to apply, and, preferably are sprayable. It is further required that these coating compositions air-dry at room temperature with or without application of a UV-source.","Specifically, in the case where the curable resin compositions are used as coatings to repair aircraft, it is desired that these coating compositions and methods provide equivalent or better performance than conventional two-component polyurethane (PUR) coatings that are used on aircraft. Namely, it is desired that these coating compositions provide excellent adhesion to aircraft surfaces after drying, protect against corrosion, UV rain erosion, small particle impact and weathering, and resist the effects of operational fluids (fuel, lubrication, hydraulic and deicing) and moisture. It would further be advantageous to provide coating compositions that may be easily removed by stripping if required.","The present invention provides environmentally-compliant radiation curable resin compositions that contain no or essentially no volatile organic components (\u201cVOCS\u201d). The cured coatings of the present invention cure within minutes at air temperature, to form hard, durable resins with excellent adhesion, solvent resistance and water resistance. These radiation curable resin compositions are easy to apply, and are preferably sprayable.","The radiation curable resin compositions of the present invention find particular use as coating compositions for vehicles such as airplanes, automobiles, and ships, for furniture and even building structures. The compositions are particularly suitable for use in repairing U.S. Air Force aircraft because these compositions cure to form coatings having excellent properties that match and even exceed the original two-component polyurethane (PUR) coating of such aircraft. Namely, the cured coatings of the present invention possess excellent abrasion-resistance, UV stability and fuel\/oil resistance properties that are equal to and superior to the original coating applied to the aircraft. Further, these compositions cure within minutes at ambient temperature.","The radiation curable resin compositions of the present invention comprise a vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomer, and at least one photoinitiator to initiate cure of the resin.","The term \u201cradiation curable\u201d as used herein is defined as the capacity to be cured under the influence of ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS) or electron beam (EB) irradiation.","Preferred vinyl dioxolanes for use in the present invention include: substituted or unsubstituted vinyl hydroxy alkyl dioxolanes and vinyl carboxy alkyl dioxolanes. Vinyl dioxolane monomers used in forming the curable resin compositions of the present invention have the formula: \n\n\nwherein R, is an alkyl group preferably having from about 1 to 10, and more preferably no more than about 6 carbon atoms. R, R, Rand Rmay be the same or different and each represents hydrogen or an alkyl group, having from about 1 to 10, and more preferably having from about 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Most preferably R, R, Rand Rare hydrogen.\n","The vinyl dioxolane monomers may be either substituted or unsubstituted. More specifically, the vinyl dioxolane monomers for use in the present invention are preferably selected from substituted or unsubstituted vinyl hydroxy alkyl dioxolanes and vinyl carboxy alkyl dioxolanes, which have from 2 to about 10 carbons. Particularly useful as vinyl dioxolane monomers in the present invention are 2-vinyl-4-hydroxybutyl-1.3-dioxolane (HBVD) and 2-vinyl-4-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dioxolane (HMVD).","Preferred vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomers for use in the present invention include: polyurethanes, polyesters, acrylates, and copolymers and blends thereof.","One preferred vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomer comprises a polyester. The term \u201cpolyester\u201d as used herein also includes polymers which are not made up fully of polyester linkages. For example, other linkages which may also be present in a vinyl dioxolane end-capped, enzyme degradable polyester oligomer of the present invention, depending upon ingredients used and reaction conditions, include those having isocyanate, cyclohexane and amide linkages along the backbone. Aliphatic polyester segments are particularly preferred. As used herein, the term \u201caliphatic\u201d includes \u201ccycloaliphatic\u201d and saturated and unsaturated groups.","Aliphatic polyesters are preferred over aromatic polyesters in preparing the enzyme degradable oligomers of the present invention, particularly in forming colorless coatings, even though aromatic polyester groups are considerably more reactive than the aliphatic polyester groups for a number of reasons. Coating products made from aromatic polyesters suffer the disadvantage that they degrade more easily than do those prepared from aliphatic polyesters, especially when exposed to UV light. The higher resistance of products prepared from aliphatic polyesters to UV light-induced degradation means that coatings based on them have better yellowing and chalk resistance than those based on aromatic polyesters.","Another preferred vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomer comprises a polyurethane. The term \u201cpolyurethane\u201d as used herein includes polymers which are not made up fully of polyurethane linkages. For example, ureas, allophonates, cyanurates and other linkages, may also be present in a vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomer of the present invention, depending upon ingredients used and reaction conditions. Additionally, isocyanates may be reacted with themselves to form polymeric forms of isocyanate linked together by isocyanurate and\/or carboniimide bridges. The term polyisocyanate refers to an isocyanate having at least two \u2014NCO groups per molecule.","In forming the vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethanes of the present invention, aliphatic or aromatic polyisocyanates and isocyanate end-capped aliphatic or aromatic urethane prepolymers are particularly useful. Some preferred aliphatic polyisocyanates include hexamethylene diisocyanate, 4,4-bis(cyclohexyl)methane diisocyanate, bis(4-isocyanato-cyclohexyl)methane, isophorone diisocyanate, 1-methylcyclohexane-2,4-diisocyanate and 4,4\u2032,4\u2033-tricyclohexylmethane triisocyanate. A preferred aliphatic polyisocyanate is a 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate based polyisocyanate. One such particularly preferred 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate based polyisocyanate has a viscosity at 23\u00b0 C. of from about 90 to about 250 mPa\u00b7s, such as commercially available DESMODUR N3400. Another preferred 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate based polyisocyanate has a viscosity at 25\u00b0 C. of from about 1,300 to about 2,200 mPa\u00b7s, such as commercially available DESMODUR N3200. Preferred isocyanate end-capped aliphatic urethane prepolymers include hexamethylene diisocyanate aliphatic polyester polyol or polyether polyol. A particularly preferred isocyanate used in preparing the vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane is an aromatic isocyanate: tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate (TMXDI).","Another preferred vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomer comprises polyurethane acrylates. Polyurethane acrylates are available commercially, and include, for example, CN985-B88, CN963-B80, CN964-B85, CN-965-A80 and CN966-J75, all available from Sartomer, Inc. Alternatively, polyurethane acrylates may be synthesized by the reaction of a hydroxy-functional acrylate with at least one of a branched polyfunctional isocyanate, aliphatic isocyanate-terminated urethane prepolymer, or aliphatic isocyanate-terminated polyester. One preferred polyurethane acrylate comprises the reaction product of an acrylate and at least one aliphatic isocyanate-terminated urethane prepolymer having a molecular weight ranging from about 500 to 1000, and more preferably, having a molecular weight ranging from about 500 to 600. A particularly preferred polyurethane acrylate comprises the reaction product of an acrylate and at least one HMDI-terminated polyethyleneadipate aliphatic urethane prepolymer.","Preferred photoinitiators include those that are soluble in the monomer, absorb light at the wavelength of UV or visible light cure, and then form active species such as radicals that initiate polymerization and cure of the coating resin. For example, some preferred photoinitiators comprise: alpha hydroxy ketones, polymeric hydroxy ketones, trimethylbenzophene, methylbenzophenone, 2 hydroxy-2-ethyl-phenyl-1-propane, phosphine oxide, bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide, 1-hydroxy cyclohexyl ketone, benzyl dimethyl ketal, trimethylbenzophenone, benzophenone, bis \u03b7-2,4-cyclopentadien-1-yl) bis(2,6-difluoro-3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)phenyl) titanium and blends thereof. A particularly preferred photoinitiator is an alpha hydroxy ketone based photoinitiator. The photoinitiators are added in amounts ranging from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the composition. Preferably, the photoinitiators are added in amounts ranging from about 2% to about 6% by weight of the composition, and more preferably, in amounts ranging from about 4% to about 5% by weight of the composition.","Thus, in one preferred polyester or polyurethane curable resin composition of the present invention, the substituted vinyl dioxolane monomer is 2-vinyl-4-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dioxolane (HMVD) or 2-vinyl-4-hydroxybutyl-1,3-dioxolane (HBVD) or a blend thereof, the ester of a polycarboxyl acid is dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate (DMCDC) or the polyurethane is tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate (TMXDI) and the photoinitiator is an alpha hydroxy ketone photoinitiator.","In some embodiments, the radiation curable resin composition further comprises at least one reactive diluent, which may be added to obtain desired properties, e.g., a sprayable curable resin, a desired degree of crosslinking, increased flexibility or enhanced water-resistance. Some examples of reactive diluents suitable in the present invention include vinyl dioxolanes, such as HMVD and HBVD, methyl ether derivatives of HMVD and HBVD, unsubstituted vinyl dioxolane, alkylated vinyl dioxolane, trimethylopropane triacrylate (TMPTA), diethylene glycol diacrylate (DGD), tetrahydroopurfuryl acrylate, 2-phenoxyethyl acrylate, isooctyl acrylate, propoxylated neopentyl glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, lauryl acrylate, hexanediol diacrylate, polyester vinyl dioxolane (PEVD), and blends thereof.","DGD is a particularly particularly preferred reactive diluent. These reactive diluents are added in amounts ranging from about 1% to about 50% by weight of the composition. More preferably, these reactive diluents are added in amounts ranging from about 10% to about 25% by weight of the composition.","In some embodiments, when desired, the radiation curable resin composition further comprises at least one pigment, such as titanium dioxide and carbon black, to impart a color on the cured resin. These pigments are added in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 30% by weight of the composition. In some embodiments, when pigments are added, photoinitiators having a higher absorption band than the pigments are required.","In some embodiments, processing aids are added to the radiation curable resin composition to facilitate the development of smooth, adherent and defect free coatings. Such processing aids may include co-initiators, wetting agents, coupling agents, adhesion promoters and thixotropic agents. Some useful co-initiators include reactive amines such as Sartomer CN381 (viscosity of 95 cps at 25\u00b0 C.), Sartomer CN384 (viscosity of 100 cps at 20\u00b0 C.), and Sartomer CN386 (viscosity of 25 cps at 25\u00b0 C.). These co-initiators are added in amounts of up to about about 5 weight percent. Conventional wetting agent may further be added in amounts of up to about 0.5 weight percent. A useful coupling agent is a silane coupling agent, which may be added in amounts of up to about 1.5 weight percent. A preferred thixotropic agent is fumed silica, which may be added in amounts of up to about 10 weight percent.","It has unexpectedly been found that fillers may be added to the present composition. Fillers suitable for use in the present invention do not substantially interact adversely with the cure mechanism or the properties of the cured coating. Some preferred fillers include, for example, organic and inorganic fillers which impart desired electromagnetic or conductive properties or performance, color, opacity, abrasion resistance, hardness and the like. Examples of such fillers include Ni coated carbon powder fillers and iron powder fillers. Other examples of suitable fillers include, for example, pigments such as those set out above, including titanium dioxide, carbon black and thiokol blue.","In one preferred embodiment, both UV cure (photoinitiator) and thermal cure catalysts are added to the composition. Such compositions may then be cured both by thermal and UV means. For example, during UV cure, substantial heat is released, thereby combining both UV and thermal initiation for the cure of the composition. Photoinitiators and thermal cure catalysts suitable for use in the present invention do not substantially interact adversely with the cure mechanism or the properties of the cured coating. Some preferred thermal cure catalysts include, for example, peroxides, cobalt and combinations of peroxides and cobalt. One particualrly preferred thermal cure catalyst is a peroxide combined with at least one transition metal soap, such as Co, Mn or Al, which act as promoters. In particularly preferred embodiments, the peroxide is a high temperature peroxide such as tertiary butyl perbenzoate, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexane, dicumylperoxide, benzoyl peroxide and MEK peroxide, which convey shelf life stability and completes cure in thickly coated sections, eg. greater than about 2 mils and up to about 50 mils.","In one preferred embodiment, the radiation curable resin composition is used to repair an aircraft by a procedure such as the following: strip the damaged area of the aircraft to bare metal; apply a non-chromate conversion coating, preferably by spraying; apply a non-chromate conversion coating primer, preferably by spraying; apply the radiation curable resin composition, preferably by spraying; cure the resin composition by either a visible or UV source range.","The present invention provides radiation curable resin compositions that contain no or essentially no volatile organic components (\u201cVOCs\u201d), and methods of using these compositions. The radiation curable resin compositions comprise (i) at least one radiation curable vinyl dioxolane (VDO) end-capped oligomer and (ii) at least one photoinitiator to initiate UV or visible light cure of the composition.","The vinyl dioxolane monomers for use in the present invention are readily made by known methods, e.g., by condensing an unsaturated aldehyde, such as acrolein, with an appropriate 1,2-diol or triol, such as glycerol, in the presence of an acidic catalyst, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid. Such substituted vinyl dioxolane monomers are autooxidizable, that is, on exposure to the air the monomer undergoes a cross-linking reaction. The mechanism of cure has been reported to involve a ring-opening reaction in the presence of air and catalyst, forming pendant hydroxyl groups (which contribute strong adhesive properties) and polymerizing the vinyl group into a highly cross-linked, hard structure. Accordingly, in forming substituted vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers for use in the present invention, care must be taken to avoid the use of reactants which cause premature opening of the ring. For example, the substituted vinyl dioxolane monomers should be stable to selected reaction catalysts for formation of the vinyl dioxolane end-capped, enzyme degradable oligomers. Preferred vinyl dioxolane monomers are stable in the presence of the catalyst systems of the present invention.","HMVD and HBVD are readily synthesized from the reaction of low-cost starting materials. For example, they may be made by condensing an unsaturated aldehyde, such as acrolein, with an appropriate 1,2-diol or triol, such as glycerol, in the presence of an acidic catalyst, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid. This synthesis is shown below: \n\n\nIn the case of HMVD, n=0 and of HBVD, n=3.\n","Vinyl dioxolanes suitable for use in the present invention are described for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,010,923 (the '923 patent) the teachings of which are incorporated by reference, which disclosed substituted vinyl dioxolane compounds for coating applications which contain a plurality of 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane groups. Although the '923 patent taught that the coating compositions disclosed therein can be applied in aqueous media, the '923 patent taught that spraying of the disclosed compositions is achieved by diluting with a volatile organic solvent such as toluene. See, e.g., column 15, lines 26-29 and lines 40-49. Furthermore, it appears that the only coating composition reported to be free of solvent suggested in the '923 patent can be found in Example 68. See also related U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,010,918; 3,055,766; 3,058,933; and 3,245,927.","Preferred substituted vinyl dioxolane monomers for use in forming the vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomers of the present invention have a rapid rate of reaction with the alkyl ester or isocyanate component; are low in volatility and toxicity; and provide coatings having transparency and appropriate color which cure in air at room temperature in presence of a photoinitiator under a visible or UV source range.","Examples of suitable vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomers for use in the present invention include polyesters, acrylates, polyurethanes, and copolymers and blends thereof.","One preferred vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomer comprises a polyester. In some embodiments, the vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyester comprises the reaction product of a vinyl dioxolane monomer, as set out above, and an ester of a polycarboxylic acid having the formula: \n\n\nwherein Ris a branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated, alkyl or alkoxy group having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms or a cyclic alkyl or alkoxy group having from about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms: and Rand Rare the same or independently selected from \u2014CHor an alkyl group having up to about 10 carbon atoms; and Ris \u2014H or a branched or unbranched alkyl or alkoxy group having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms or a cyclic alkyl or alkoxy group having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, Rfurther comprises at least one amide linkage.\n","Some examples of esters of polycarboxylic acids are useful in the practice of the present invention include hydroxy functional, saturated and unsaturated, alkyl esters, such as, adipate phthalate, and malonate esters; cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid esters; and various alkyl ployols, such as ethylene glycol based polyesters. Polyester prepolymers useful in the practice of the present invention also include those having cyclohexane groups along the backbone, as well as amide containing oligomers.","Difunctional saturated polyester oligomers are preferred components of the coating compositions of the present invention. Saturated esters are especially preferred for colorless coatings, because they are less light-sensitive and, thus, less prone to yellow. Particularly preferred saturated esters include adipate and cyclohexane diesters.","Aliphatic polyesters sometimes are preferred over aromatic polyesters in preparing the vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomers of the present invention, particularly in forming colorless coatings, even though aromatic polyester groups are considerably more reactive than the aliphatic polyester groups for a number of reasons. Coating products made from aromatic polyesters suffer the disadvantage that they degrade more easily than do those prepared from aliphatic polyesters, especially when exposed to UV light. The higher resistance of products prepared from aliphatic polyesters to UV light-induced degradation means that coatings based on them have better yellowing and chalk resistance than those based on aromatic polyesters.","However, aromatic polyesters may also be used in the practice of the present invention.","Dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylate is one preferred polyester prepolymer for use in the coatings of the present invention and can be prepared by reacting HMVD and dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxyate as illustrated in FIG. .","Table 1 summarizes the properties of some radiation cured PEVD coating formulations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1 "}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"PEVD Coating Results"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Coating Formulation","Advantages","Disadvantages"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["PEVD + photoinitiator","Cures within a minute","Not sprayable"]},{"entry":[{},"Hard coating"]},{"entry":[{},"Excellent adhesion"]},{"entry":["PEVD with 5%","Cures within a minute","Soft coating"]},{"entry":["monofunctional reactive","Excellent adhesion"]},{"entry":["diluent + photoinitiator","Sprayable"]},{"entry":["PEVD with 25%","Cures within a minute","Mediocre adhesion"]},{"entry":["difunctional reactive","Hard coating"]},{"entry":["diluent + photoinitiator","Sprayable"]},{"entry":["PEVD with 5%","Cures within a minute","Barely sprayable"]},{"entry":["monofunctional reactive","Excellent adhesion"]},{"entry":["diluent + photoinitiator","Hard coating"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The coating compositions prepared from vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyesters were often higher in viscosity than that suitable for spray applications. It is anticipated that the properties of these coating composition and the coatings formed therefrom can be tailored, for example, by blending at least one reactive diluent as described herein, prior to or after the reaction, between the polyester prepolymer component and the vinyl dioxolane monomer or by blending different vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyester oligomers of the present invention after their synthesis. Further, some vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyester compositions did not achieve the desired adhesion to the aluminum substrate. However, these coatings are expected to be useful for other sufraces. It is also anticipated that coating properties can be optimized as desired by varying reaction components and\/or conditions, e.g., adhesion to an aluminum surface may be improved by, for example, the addition of adhesion promoters, use of different reactive diluents and, for example, by blending the PEVD compositions with PUVD compositions described herein.","Another preferred vinyl dioxolane end-capped oligomer comprises a polyurethane. In some embodiments, the vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane comprises the reaction product of a vinyl dioxolane monomer, as set out above, and","(i) at least one isocyanate or polyisocyanate having the formula\n\nR(NCO)\u2003\u2003Formula 1\n\nwherein Ris an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alkyl group having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms or an aromatic group and p is at least 1, or\n","(ii) at least one isocyanate-endcapped aliphatic urethane prepolymer having the formula \n\n\nwherein R, Rand Rare independently an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alkyl group having from 1 to about 10 carbons. Isocyanate-endcapped aromatic urethane prepolymers may also be useful in the practice of the present invention.\n","Aliphatic isocyanates are sometimes preferred over aromatic isocyanates in preparing the reactive oligomers of the present invention even though aromatic isocyanate groups are considerably more reactive than the aliphatic isocyanate groups, resulting in coatings that dry faster and develop cure properties faster than comparable systems based on aliphatic isocyanates for a number of reasons. Urethane products made from aromatic diisocyanate monomers suffer the disadvantage that they degrade more easily than do those prepared from aliphatic diisocyanate monomers, especially when exposed to UV light. The higher resistance of products prepared from aliphatic diisocyanates to UV light-induced degradation means that coatings based on them have better yellowing and chalk resistance than those based on aromatic diisocyanates. Nonetheless, aromatic isocyanates may also be preferred for certain embodiments. As used herein, the term \u201caliphatic\u201d includes \u201ccycloaliphatic.\u201d","Preferred isocyanates for use in forming vinyl dioxolane end-capped urethane polyurethane oligomers for use in the coating compositions of the present invention have a rapid rate of reaction with the substituted vinyl dioxolane monomer; are low in volatility and toxicity (e.g., no isocyanate vapors); provide coatings having transparency and appropriate color which cure at room temperature in presence of a catalyst; and, in particularly preferred embodiments, react to form spray-coatable vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers.","Suitable aromatic and aliphatic, including cycloaliphatic, isocyanates for use in preparing the reactive oligomers of the present invention include mono, di, tri, and other polyisocyanates.

Such prepolymers for use in forming the vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers for use in the present invention include, for example, the prepolymer prepared from hexamethylene diisocyanate aliphatic polyester and polyether polyols, such as polycaprolactam and polyethylene adipate derived polyester polyols, and polytertramethylene polyether polyols.","A particularly preferred aromatic isocyanate is tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate (TMXDI).","It should be noted that in forming the coating compositions of the present invention mixtures of substituted vinyl dioxolane monomers may be used. Mixtures of aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates and polyisocyanates, as well as mixtures of isocyanate-endcapped aliphatic or aromatic urethane prepolymers, may also be used.","Illustrative of such combinations are mixtures of hexamethylene diisocyanate with polymeric isocyanates derived from hexamethylene diisocyanate and mixtures of hexamethylene diisocyanate with 4,4\u2032,4\u2033-tricyclohexylmethane triisocyanate.","One preferred vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane for use in the present invention is synthesized as shown in FIG. .","If any volatile organic components are used in preparation of the reactive vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers of the present invention, such volatile organic components are readily removed before spraying. However, one major advantage of our invention is that 100% of all reactants initially added to the reaction are consumed in producing the nonvolatile polyurethane\/vinyl dioxolane coatings.","The reaction of the vinyl dioxolane and isocyanate or end-capped polyurethane prepolymer to form vinyl dioxomane end-capped polyurethane oligomers of the present invention can be followed by infrared spectroscopy (IR). The IRs give valuable information as to where the peaks of interest lay for each material and with this knowledge the subsequent appearance\/disappearance of these peaks can be followed.","Determination of the reactivities of the substituted vinyl dioxolane monomers with aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic isocyanates or polyisocyanates or isocyanate-endcapped aliphatic or aromatic prepolymers were based on the appearance\/disappearance and relative intensity changes of absorption peaks in the infrared spectra of the reaction solutions with time. Infrared spectral analysis systems commercially available may be used.

The disappearance of the peak at 2273 cmand appearance of a peak at 1720 to 1690 cmis indicative of the isocyanate group undergoing a reaction with the hydroxy group of the vinyl-1,3-dioxolane to form the desired urethane linkage. The relative intensity changes in these peaks can be used to measure the progress of the urethane formation reaction with time. The appearance of an absorption peak at 3330 cm, due to the \u2550N\u2014H stretch of the urethane linkage, is also used to determine reaction success. The 1,3-dioxolane ring should remain intact throughout all the formations of vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers of the present invention and can be monitored based on the absorption peaks at 990 and 942 cmremaining approximately constant in intensity with time.","Immediately prior to or during the coating process the photoinitiator is added to the vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers of the present invention. If it is desired to apply the coating composition of the present invention by spray-coating, and the viscosity is too high, reactive diluents as described herein can be added to achieve the desired viscosity for spraying. If it is desired to use the vinyl dioxolane monomer used in preparation of the vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers as the reactive diluent, an excess of this reactant can be added at the time the vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers are prepared.","Vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers of the present invention were prepared using the following aromatic isocyanate: tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate (TMXDI).","The vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomer was evaluated with respect to its effect upon processing and\/or properties of the coatings formed in accordance with the present invention.","The infrared spectra for HMVD, HBVD and the isocyanate may be used to determine the progress of the reaction. The vinyl dioxolane peaks of interest can be seen at 3430 cm-1 (\u2014O\u2550H) and at 990 and 942 cm(\u2014C\u2014O\u2014C stretch), while the isocyanate materials have their main peak of interest at about 2270 cm, (\u2014N\u2550C\u2550O stretch).","One preferred coating composition of the present invention comprises the vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers comprising the reaction product of HBVD\/TMXDI.

Further, such materials lead to increased hardness of the cured resin, and improved water and hydraulic fluid resistance. Further, such materials form cured compositions that are easy to remove, when desired, via plastic media blast (PMB) techniques.","Aliphatic isocyanate-terminated urethane prepolymers have the effect of increasing the length, and consequentially, the molecular weight, of the urethane segment. Increased molecular weight and urethane length improves the toughness, rain erosion-resistance, abrasion-resistance and low temperature flexibility of the cured resin. Such prepolymers may have molecular weights ranging from 500 to 1000. However, as the molecular weight of the polyurethane segment increases, the coating viscosity of the composition also increases. Thus, the molecular weight of the prepolymer, more preferably, ranges from about 500 to 600. One particularly preferred aliphatic isocyanate-terminated urethane prepolymer useful in forming the vinyl-dioxolane end-capped polyurethane acrylate is an HMDI-terminated, polyethyleneadipate aliphatic urethane prepolymer (See FIG. ).","Preferred photoinitiators include those that are soluble in the monomer, absorb light at the wavelength of selected UV radiation or visible light cure, and then form active species such as radicals that initiate polymerization and cure of the coating resin. For example, some preferred photoinitiators comprise: alpha hydroxy ketones, polymeric hydroxy ketones, trimethylbenzophene, methylbenzophenone, 2 hydroxy-2-ethyl-phenyl-1-propane, phosphine oxide, bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide, 1-hydroxy cyclohexyl ketone, benzyl dimethyl ketal, trimethylbenzophenone, benzophenone, bis \u03b7-2,4-cyclopentadien-1-yl) bis(2,6-difluoro-3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)phenyl) titanium and blends thereof.","Some commercially available photoinitiators useful in the present invention include: Sartomer KIP-100F, Sartomer KT-046, CIBA Darocur 4265, CIBA Irgacur 819, CIBA Irgacur 184, and CIBA Irgacur 784. Sartomer KIP-100F is an alpha hydroxy ketone based photoinitiator comprising a liquid mixture of an oligomeric alpha hydroxy ketone and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl 1-propanone. More specifically, Sartomer KIP-100F comprises 70 wt % of oligo(2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-[4-(1-methylvinyl)phenyl]propanone]), (molecular weight n*204.7) and 30 wt % of 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl 1-propanone (molecular weight 164.2). Sartomer KT-046 is a blend of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide, alpha-hydroxyketone and benzophenone derivative. CIBA Darocur 4265 comprises 2 hydoxy-2-ethyl-phenyl-1-propane. CIBA Irgacur 819 comprises bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide and has a molecular weight of 418.5. CIBA Irgacur 184 comprises 1-hydroxy cyclohexyl phenyl ketone and has a molecular weight of 204.3. CIBA Irgacur 784 comprises bis \u03b7-2,4-cyclopentadien-1-yl)bis(2,6-difluoro-3-(1H-pyrrol-1 -yl)phenyl)titanium and has a molecular weight of 534.4.","A particularly preferred photoinitiator is an alpha hydroxy ketone based photoinitiator, such as Sartomer KIP-100F. The photoinitiators are added to the radiation curable resin compositions in amounts ranging from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the composition. Preferably, the photoinitiators are added in amounts ranging from about 2% to about 6% by weight of the composition, and more preferably, in amounts ranging from about 4% to about 5% by weight of the composition.","For coating applications of the curable resin compositions, it is preferred that the viscosity of the radiation curable resin composition is controlled to render the compositions sprayable. Generally, if a sprayable radiation curable resin composition is desired in accordance with the present invention, the viscosity of the composition is typically about 1000 cps or below.","Obtaining sprayable viscosities may be accomplished by selecting the appropriate combination of vinyl dioxolane monomer, oligomer and photoinitiator. For example, the molecular weight of the oligomer is taken into consideration. Lower molecular weight oligomers generally have associated lower viscosities. In addition, the viscosity of vinyl dioxolane is taken into consideration, as well as the degree of cross-linking that the particular vinyl dioxolane is likely to provide. For example, coating compositions of the present invention prepared from HMVD tend to be higher in viscosity than similar formulations prepared using HBVD, even though HMVD is lower in viscosity than HBVD. It is believed that the higher viscosity of HMVD end-capped oligomers of the present invention results from increased cross-linking provided by the smaller HMVD molecule.","Sprayable viscosities of the curable resin compositions may also be achieved by adding reactive diluents to the curable resin compositions. Reactive diluents suitable in the practice of the present invention generally possess the following properties: low viscosity; low volatility; presence of functional groups similar in reactivity to those attached to the vinyl dioxolane monomer so that the diluent is compatible with the catalyst formulation; and does not adversely effect properties of the cured resin. In addition, the reactive diluent is compatible with the radiation curability of the resin composition. Reactive diluents particularly useful in obtaining sprayable resin viscosities generally have a viscosity from about 10 to about 100 mPa\u00b7s at about 23\u00b0 C.","Some examples of preferred reactive diluents include vinyl dioxolanes, such as unsubstituted and monosubstituted vinyl dioxolane monomers such as HMVD and HBVD, methyl ether derivatives of HMVD and HBVD, unsubstituted vinyl dioxolane, allylated vinyl dioxolane, diethylene glycol diacrylate (DGD), tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate, 2-phenoxyethyl acrylate, isooctyl acrylate, propoxylated neopentyl glycol diacrylate, lauryl acrylate, triethyleneglycol diacrylate, hexanediol diacrylate, polyester vinyl dioxolane (PEVD), and trimethylopropane triacrylate (TMPTA).","In the practice of the present invention, DGD is a particularly preferred diluent. Also particularly useful as a reactive diluent are vinyl dioxolane monomers, since they may be incorporated simply by the addition of an excess of the vinyl dioxolane monomer during the reaction between the vinyl dioxolane and the PCL oligomer end-capped with functional groups.","The reactive diluent is present in the curable resin in amounts up to about 50% by weight of the composition. More preferably, the reactive diluent is present up to about 25% by weight of the composition, and even more preferably up to about 10% by weight of the composition.","Table 2 summarizes some pertinent properties of some reactive diluents",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0113"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Properties of Reactive Diluents"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["MONOMER\/SUPPLIER","VISCOSITY at 23\u00b0 C., mPa.s"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate","6"]},{"entry":"(Sartomer SR-285)"},{"entry":["Lauryl acrylate","6"]},{"entry":"(Sartomer SR-335)"},{"entry":["2-Phenoxyethyl Acrylate","5"]},{"entry":"(Sartomer SR-339)"},{"entry":["Isooctyl acrylate","5"]},{"entry":"(Sartomer SR-339)"},{"entry":["Diethylene glycol diacrylate","15"]},{"entry":"(Sartomer SR-230)"},{"entry":["Propoxylated neopentyl glycol diacrylate","12"]},{"entry":"(SR-9003)"},{"entry":["TMPTA","74"]},{"entry":"(Aldrich)"},{"entry":["HMVD","23"]},{"entry":"(Degussa)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In some embodiments, when desired, the radiation curable resin composition further comprises at least one pigment, such as titanium dioxide and carbon black. These pigments are preferably added in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 30% by weight of the composition, so as to impart a color on the composition but not interfere with the radiation curability, hardness or other properties of the radiation curable resin composition.","In some embodiments, when pigments are added, photoinitiators having a higher absorption band than the pigments are required. For example, when adding titanium dioxide or carbon black, the photoinitiator should have an optimum absorption of at least 360 nm. For example, preferred photoinitiator for use with pigmented resin compositions include Sartomer KT-046, CIBA Irgacur 819, CIBA Darocur 4265 and blends thereof.","In some embodiments, when desired, the radiation curable resin composition further comprises processing aids, which may to contribute to the development of a smoother, more adherent and defect free cured resin. Some useful processing aids may include wetting agents, coupling agent, adhesion promoters, co-initiators, and thixotropic agents.","Wetting agents are surfactants that are particularly useful for coating compositions because they improve the composition's ability to \u201cwet\u201d and coat the substrate surface. When added in appropriate amounts, of up to about 0.5 weight percent, wetting agents can significantly improve the ability of a coating to release bubbles, flatten out on the surface and cure to a smooth, glossy surface.","Coupling agents are multifunctional chemical reagents that are typically added to coatings to improve the wetout and adhesion to a substrate surface. Usually, the coupling agent is applied to the substrate before application of the coating. There, it bonds chemically through one of its two different functional groups to hydroxyl groups usually present on the metal surface oxide layer. Occasionally however, the coupling agent is added to the coating formulation, where it migrates to and reacts with the substrate surface. When the coating is dried, the second functional group present on the coupling agent co-cures along with the coating, forming a strong covalent bond between coating and substrate. The overall result of using a coupling agent is a more durable, tightly-bonded coating on the metal substrate.  illustrates the mechanism by which a silane coupling agent can be used to improve the bonding of UV-curable coatings to both pigment particles and metallic substrates. These coupling agents may be added in amounts of up to about 1.5 weight percent.","Thixotropic agents, such as fumed silica, are added to coating formulations to improve their resistance to running when applied to vertical surfaces. While the coating material containing this additive is sheared, such as in spray-coating, viscosity remains low and the coating is easily sprayed. Immediately upon cessation of shear however, such as when the coating reaches and covers the substrate surface, a molecular network forms causing the coating to set-up and remain in place on the vertical surface while the curing process begins. These thixotropic agents may be added in amounts of up to about 10 weight percent.","Adhesion promoters, such as those known in the art, may further be added to the radiation curable resin composition to enhance the cured resin's adhesion to a substrate. A metallic diacrylate based adhesion promoter, such as Sartomer SR 706 is particularly useful in the present invention. These adhesion promoters may be added in amounts of up to about 15 wt %.","Co-initiators may further be added to the radiation curable resin composition to accelerate cure of the composition and to improve cured coating properties. Some suitable co-initiators include reactive amines, such as Sartomer CN381, Sartomer CN384 and Sartomer CN386. These co-initiators may be added in amounts of up to about 5 wt %.","The coating composition blends of the present invention will be illustrated by the formula of a polyester prepolymer prepared by the reaction of HMVD or HBVD with dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate and the formation of a polyurethane prepolymer prepared by the reaction of TMXDI in the presence of at least one catalyst. However, it is not intended to limit the scope of the coating compositions of the present invention to these components.","Reaction conditions were adjusted to maximize the formation of the PEVD and PUVD prepolymers while minimizing unwanted and undesirable side-reactions. The most deterious side-reaction is the opening of the dioxolane ring system at elevated temperatures, resulting in the formation of free radicals which can induce cross-linking via the pendant vinyl groups and cause gelation of the prepolymers. Introduction of color into the prepolymer by thermal degradation of the reactants or the PEVD and PUVD prepolymer is an undesirable side-reaction because of the intended use of the PEVD\/PUVD coating compositions of the present invention as a clear and colorless topcoat. Thus, the length of time the reaction is carried out at elevated temperatures as well as the maximum reaction temperature is kept to a minimum.","Most chemical reactions involve an equilibrium situation where the reaction combining reactants to form products (i) is in competition with the decomposition reaction of the product into reactants (ii). with product formation being slightly favored. One way to assist the formation of PEVD and PUVD is to generate a reaction byproduct which can be removed from the reactoin environment and shift this equilibrium situation to favor product formation (i). \n\n\nWhen the PEVD prepolymer produced by an ester interchange reaction involving replacing, for example, the methoxy groups of dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate with methoxy vinyl dioxolane groups, methanol is evolved as a reaction byproduct. Methanol can be distilled from the reaction apparatus as its toluene azeotrope at the elevated reaction temperatures used.\n","The coating compositions of the present invention can be used as clear, unpigmented coating compositions, or they can be pigmented, using proportions well known in the art, with pigments such as titanium dioxide and carbon black.","The clear unpigmented compositions of this invention can be made by simply mixing the ingredients as taught in the present specification. When pigmentation is involved, a conventional pigment grinding or dispersing step is generally required. The curable resin compositions of this invention are particularly useful as coatings in the following areas: automotive, commercial and military aircraft, navy and commercial ships, transportation vehicles, industrial structures, electronics, spacecraft, and household. The coatings of the present invention are applied by spraying followed by UV, visible light or electron beam cure at ordinary room or atmospheric temperature or by force-drying at a convenient temperature above ambient temperature but below a temperature which decomposition or some other objectionable results occur or a combination of both.","The coating compositions of the present invention are preferable applied by spraying, including airless and electrostatic spraying.","In one preferred embodiment, the radiation curable resin composition is used to repair an aircraft by a procedure such as the following: strip the damaged area of the aircraft to bare metal; apply a non-chromate conversion coating, preferably by spraying; apply a non-chromate conversion coating primer, preferably by spraying; apply the radiation curable resin composition, preferably by spraying; cure the resin composition by either a visible or UV source range.","The coating compositions and coatings of the present invention will be further illustrated with reference to the following Examples which are intended to aid in the understanding of the present invention, but which are not to be construed as a limitation thereof.","Materials:","Metal substrates were primed or unprimed 3 in.\u00d75 in. steel (low carbon, cold-rolled, SAE 1010) or 4 in.\u00d76 in. aluminum (\u201cyellow chromated\u201d 2024-T3 alloy) panels from Q-Panel Lab Products, Cleveland, Ohio.","TMXDI was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company.","General PUVD Synthesis:","Conventional laboratory apparatus may be used to prepare PUVD coating material from the reaction of hydroxy-substituted vinyl dioxolane with an appropriate diisocyanate.","The ratio of vinyl dioxolane to isocyanate during synthesis of vinyl dioxolane end-capped polyurethane oligomers of the present invention is determined by the free-NCO content of the isocyanate. Unless otherwise specified, one free-NCO is reacted with each hydroxy methyl substituent on the reactive vinyl dioxolane. The percent of photoinitiator is based on the combined weight of the vinyl dioxolane and isocyanate components.","A typical experimental procedure used for the preparation of PUVD coating material is as follows:\n\n","At this point, all of the reaction mixture is transferred to a container and stored for use in preparing the coating compositions of the present invention.","Reaction of 2-vinyl-4hydroxybutyl-1,3-dioxolane (HBVD) with TMXDI","The general PUVD syntheses procedure set out above was followed, using HBVD (29.45 g), TMXDI (20.75 g) and DABCO -1,4 Diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane polymerization catalyst (0.1 g).

This is sufficient spectral data to allow the monitoring of the progression of PEVD formation.","It is the disappearance of the pronounced absorption of HMVD at 3433 cmas HMVD becomes attached to the dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate unit, forming the ester linkage, that was used to monitor the progress of the reaction. The displaced methoxy groups are converted into methanol under the reaction conditions, are distilled as a methanol\/toluene azeotrope out of the reaction solution into the Dean-Stark trap, removed via the stopcock at the trap bottom, and the azeotrope volume measured using a graduated cylinder. Azeotrope distillation was confirmed by IR spectroscopy and boiling point, occurring at 63.7\u00b0 C. rather than 64.7\u00b0 C. (methanol) or 110.6\u00b0 C. (toluene) (Weast, R. C., , 49th edition, The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, Ohio, 1968). The amount of evolved methanol can be calculated from the azeotrope volume and its reported composition (Weast, R. C., supra). IR spectroscopy was also used to confirm the retention of other functional groups in PEVD initially present in HMVD, the dioxolane ring (\u2014C\u2014O\u2014C\u2014 absorptions at 984 and 943 cm) and vinyl (\u2550CH\u03b4absorption at 1438 cm). Reformation of the ester linkage [\u2014C(O)O\u2014] was confirmed by the observation of an absorption at 1732 cm, attributed to the C\u2550O stretch.","The IR spectrum of the reaction dispersion prior to any prepolymer formation () showed absorptions at 3493 (\u2014OH), 1733 (C\u2550O), 987 (\u2014C\u2014O\u2014C\u2014) and 940 (\u2014C\u2014O\u2014C\u2014) cm, indicating that both reactants are present. The catalyst was then added and the reaction temperature gradually increased until methanol\/toluene azeotrope distillation began. The reaction temperature was maintained at 100 to 125\u00b0 C. for approximately 5 hours until azeotrope distillation ceased. After allowing the reaction to proceed almost to completion, the IR spectrum of the reaction dispersion had lost the \u2014OH absorption at 3490 cmwhile maintaining an ester C\u2550O absorption at 1732 cmand vinyl dioxolane absorptions at 1483, 982 and 940 cm, indicating the dioxolane ring and pendant vinyl groups are still intact at the end of the reaction (FIG. ). The reaction temperature was increased to 140 to 155\u00b0 C. for approximately 2 hours to ensure the reaction had gone to completion and then cooled to ambient temperatures. The time the reactants and PEVD prepolymer are exposed to elevated temperatures must be minimized in order to avoid undesirable side-reactions that generate color and cross-links which result in gelation. The completeness of the reaction was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and IR spectroscopy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0161"},"sup":["1","13","1","13","13"],"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 10","FIG. 11"],"sub":["1 ","2"]},"Prepolymer synthesis conditions can be modified, if desired, to obtain more complete conversion to the PEVD prepolymer by altering the reaction conditions, e.g., to increase the activity of the polymer, by removing by-products, and other alterations that will be apparent to the skilled artisan.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0142","num":"0163"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"sup":"1"}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Absorption","Experimental Peak","Theoretical Peak",{}]},{"entry":["Peak (ppm)","Intensity Ratio","Intensity Ratio","Assignment"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["5.95-5.75","1.5","2","H on Cof vinyl"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"group"]},{"entry":["5.60-5.29","3.1","4","Hs on Cof vinyl"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"group"]},{"entry":["5.28-5.23","0.5","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["5.04-4.98","0.4","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["4.95-4.85","0.4","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["4.63","0.4","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["4.41-3.40","8.1","\u2014","\u2014"]},{"entry":["2.70-1.30","8.0","8","Hs on Cof"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"cyclohexyl group"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0164"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"sup":"13 "}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Absorption Peak",{}]},{"entry":["(ppm)","Assignment"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["175.6-174.5","C: carbonyl group"]},{"entry":["134.0-133.5","C: carbon of vinyl group"]},{"entry":["120.7-119.1","C: carbon of vinyl group"]},{"entry":["140.4-99.9\u2002","C: dioxolane ring carbon"]},{"entry":["76.1-61.6","C: dioxolane ring carbons"]},{"entry":["51.4","Carbon of methoxy group"]},{"entry":["42.3-40.5","C: carbons of cyclohexyl group"]},{"entry":["28.0-25.9","C: carbons of cyclohexyl group"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Both bare and chromated aluminum test-panels may be used as indicated in the following examples.
