title: Message integration framework for multi-application systems
abstract: A system and method for integrating messages across multiple applications. The applications may be on one server or on several servers, and each application may service one or more e-clients. The system and method securely segregates the data for each e-client. Further, the system can be dynamically reconfigured by adding or deleting new messages and/or applications, without affecting the performance of the unchanged parts of the system. The various applications using the system need not be aware of the existence of the other applications.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/915,492, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,093,261, filed Jul. 25, 2001, which claims benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60\/222,094, filed Jul. 28, 2000, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Integration Framework\u201d which applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to middleware systems, and more particularly to middleware systems that use databases to configure the integration of various applications.","2. Description of the Related Art","Vast amounts of data are stored, transmitted, and manipulated in today's Internet driven world. Organization of this data so that information can easily be accessed is thus an important need. Huge amounts of data are often organized in databases. Such stored data often cuts across several databases and other applications that may support a business, and several customers that an Application Service Provider (ASP) may service. The customers serviced by an ASP can be referred to as \u201ce-clients.\u201d","A single e-client often uses various applications. For example, an e-client may have an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) that is used with an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to direct customers of the e-client to particular customer service representatives that have expertise in a particular area. Further, the e-client may have a web page which allows its customers to enter into interactive sessions on the web page and learn more information about products and support issues. Further, e-mail can be used by e-clients to contact their customers and for customers to contact the e-client business regarding sales and support issues. Such an e-client may use an IVR application, a web application, and an email application.","These various applications may be on a single server, or on various different servers. In either case, it is desirable to be able to exchange messages between applications, and to route these messages accurately from one application to another, regardless of whether the applications reside on a single server or on different servers.","In some conventional systems, this problem is handled by specifying a configuration file for each application. The configuration file for an application may specify where messages sent by the application are to be delivered. However, when such application specific configuration files are used, it is difficult to dynamically modify or update the system. Any time a change needs to be made (for example, a new e-client is to be added), each of the configuration files for each application on each server need to be updated accordingly.","Another issue arises in systems that integrate multiple applications. Conventionally, each application needs to be aware of the existence of the other applications. Each application also needs knowledge of which server the other applications are using, and so on, in order to route messages to these other applications. One of the problems with such a system is that any time a new application is added or deleted, each of the other applications needs to be modified to reflect that change. Dynamic addition or deletion of applications, while the rest of the applications continue to function in a normal manner, is not possible.","Some conventional applications eliminate this issue by providing a central message processing \u201chub\u201d which each application is aware of. However, the \u201chub\u201d solution has another drawback, which is that each message must first be sent to the hub for processing, then re-sent by the hub to the ultimate destination of the message, and this is inefficient.","In addition, several e-clients may use each of these applications. Thus it is important to keep data for each e-client secure, and not allow it to be accessed by any other e-clients. It is thus often desirable to segregate data, regardless of what application requires that data.","There are two ways in which conventional systems deal with this problem. One approach entails having applications which themselves support partitioning of data. However, this approach implies that only applications that have this partitioning capability can be used. Since not all applications possess this capability, systems employing this approach are restricted in the applications they can support.","The second approach entails using separate servers for separate e-clients. However, this approach often results in the increased use of hardware and\/or software, and is thus expensive and cumbersome. Hosting multiple e-clients on a single server, and\/or using the same software instances of applications for different e-clients, is more economical.","Thus what is needed is (1) a system and method for enabling the configurable exchange of messages between applications, regardless of the servers on which these applications may reside; (2) a system and method for centralizing control of message exchange, but which distributes the message processing to the applications which produce and consume the messages; (3) a system and method for integrating multiple applications, where the various applications do not need to be aware of the existence of the other applications; and (4) a system and method that segregates data for multiple e-clients and multiple applications.","The present invention is a system and method for enabling the configurable exchange of messages between applications, regardless of the servers on which these applications may reside. The present invention centralizes the control of the messages, but distributes the processing to each application, so that a separate message processing \u201chub\u201d is not needed. Further, the present invention is a framework for integrating applications, where the various applications do not need to be aware of the existence of the other applications. In addition, the present invention is a method and system for segregating data for multiple applications and multiple e-clients.","An integration framework in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is a software topology that has a number of different characteristics such as what server an application resides on, what e-client it is servicing, etc. The present invention is database driven, and the various relationships for the different data entities are modeled into the database. The functionality of the system is driven by the database model and by the applications which send and receive messages, which adhere to the rules that are in the database.","In one embodiment, the following data entities are included in the data model: application, partition, metadata, host, message, queue, and queue manager. These various data entities and their relationships with each other (which are represented by the entities app instance, app partition, and app message) are stored in the database. The various applications in the integrated framework communicate with each other through Message-Oriented-Middleware (MOM) modules. In one embodiment, these MOM modules have two layers. One of these layers is specific to the application with which the MOM module is coupled, while the other layer is a layer common to all the MOM modules. This common layer communicated with the database mentioned above, and with the MOM system, also known as the message bus.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the structure of the data model is such that when the application topology is updated in the database, the message routing schema is automatically updated accordingly. In addition, messages, applications, servers, etc. can be added or deleted from the system without affecting the operation of the other, unchanged parts of the system.","Different embodiments of the present invention are now described with reference to the figures, where like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Also in the figures, the left most digit of each reference number corresponds to the figure in which the reference number is first used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","104","106","108","110"]},"In one embodiment of the present invention, the applications  are standalone applications. An application  can be a standalone application having an MOM module . An example of such an application is a unified administration application. An application  can also be a third party application, where the application's Application Programming Interface (API) is used to interface with the MOM module . Some examples of such applications  are Octane\u2122 from Epiphany (San Mateo Calif.), WebLine\u2122 from Cisco Systems (San Jose Calif.), and Kana\u2122 from Kana Communications (Redwood City Calif.). The application  can also be an unmodified third party application. Such applications could include reporting and email applications. Further application  can be a service application modified to use the MOM module . Such applications can include monitoring, control, logging, and\/or error handling applications. Moreover, an application  can also be a custom application which uses the MOM module . Such custom applications can include blending applications, and Graphical User Interface (FUI) managers. In addition, an application  can be a normal system service application. Such an application could include time applications, security applications, and directory applications. These applications  can all be on the same server, or can all be on individual servers. Alternately, some of the applications  could share servers, while other applications  reside on separate servers.","These applications communicate with each other through a message bus  on a network . The message bus  provides the ability for exchanging messages between applications. In one embodiment, the message bus is a commercial Message-Oriented-Middleware product such as the MQSeries product from IBM Corporation (Armonk, N.Y.). In one embodiment the network  could be a Local Area Network (LAN). In another embodiment, the network  could be a Wide Area Network (WAN).","In the embodiment shown in , the applications  communicate with the message bus  through Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) modules . In other embodiments, applications  may also communicate with each other across a network. In still other embodiments, applications  may also use Operating Systems' (OS) interface. That is, an application  may use a standard call across the network initiated by the application.","The MOM Modules  interact with the database . The MOM modules  read the configuration database and query it for information regarding message routing.  is a block diagram illustrating the structure of a MOM module  in some detail.  illustrates that a MOM module  is comprised of two layers: an application adapter layer , and a message adapter layer . The application adapter is specific to each application  that the MOM module  interfaces with, and is based on the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the application . The message adapter  is the part of the MOM module  that communicates with the database  to determine the routing of messages sent and received by the MOM module .","The database  stores data regarding various applications  and their characteristics. In one embodiment, the database  stores the relationships between the physical servers (hosts), applications, messages and message queues to define the flow of messages in the system. In addition, the one embodiment, the characteristics of the applications  are reflected in the database . For instance, the database  may specify that Application A must reside on its own separate server, or that Application B can only support one partition of data. In one embodiment of the present invention, a partition is a subdivision of the system as a whole to be used by a particular e-client. In one embodiment, a partition and an e-client have a one-to-one relationship. That is, one e-client has only one partition, and one partition corresponds to a single e-client. In other embodiments, an e-client may have more than one partition associated with it.","Further, the database  defines the messages used, the relationship of the system components to each other, and the routing of messages. The use of the database  provides great flexibility of message routing in a system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Addition of messages or deletion of existing messages is controlled by the database , and the applications  which use the messages. Neither the MOM modules , nor the database , needs to be recompiled to add data entities in the database  such as Hosts, Applications, Queues, Queue Managers, etc. Messages and MetaData can also be added, modified, or deleted without redesign or recompilation of a system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Further, in one embodiment, these changes can be made while the system is in use, without affecting the operation of other, unchanged parts of the system.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the database  is centralized. In other embodiments, the database  can be distributed across various servers.","The data model  on which the database is based in one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in .  illustrates the following data entities: Partition , MetaData , Application , Message , Host , Appinstance , AppMessage , AppPartition , Queue , Queue Manager . Each of these data entities is described below. The collection of these data entities and their correlations defines the way in which messages flow between applications .","In the embodiment illustrated in , Partition  defines one e-client of the system. MetaData  defines data which is used to uniquely identify a specific e-client. In one embodiment, this is in addition to the e-client Name, which is only one way to identify the e-client. The MetaData  is used to uniquely identify the e-client. MetaData  is a component of the message format described below, and is used to determine initially what partition a particular message is intended for.","The data entity Application  defines the software applications which comprise the system. Various applications  have been discussed above with reference to . Message  defines the messages (by a unique message id) which flow through the system. Host  defines the physical servers on which Applications  may be hosted.","Appinstance  defines the relationship between Hosts  and Applications . Each Appinstance  represents an instance of a software application running on a host. A \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationship exists between the Hosts  and Applications , and the Appinstance  data entity is the database modeling method used to implement that relationship. For example many Applications  could be running on one Host , and one Application  could be running on many Hosts .","AppMessage  defines the relationship between Messages  and Applications , and AppMessage  is the database entity used to implement that relationship. For example many Applications  could be associated with one Message , and one Application  could be associated with many Messages .","AppPartition  defines the relationship between AppInstances  and Partitions . A \u201cmany-to-many\u201d relationship exists between the AppInstances  and Partitions , and AppPartition  is the database entity used to implement that relationship. For example many AppInstances  could be associated with one Partition , and one Appinstance  could be associated with many Partitions .","Queue  defines a repository for messages sent and received by an application. Queue  has a many-to-one relationship with AppPartition , and a many-to-one relationship with QueueMgr . That is, many Queues  may be associated with an AppPartition ; many Queues  are associated with a QueueMgr . In one embodiment, a Queue Manager Name and Queue Name uniquely identify a queue for sending and receiving messages. QueueMgr  defines a special software application (the Queue Manager) running on a Host . The QueueMgr  is required to send and receive messages for Applications  on a Host , and a \u201cmany-to-one\u201d relationship exists between QueueMgr  and Host , i.e., many QueueMgrs  may be associated with one Host . In one embodiment, Queues  and Queue Managers  are third party commercial software products.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the messages to be routed in the system are direct messages from one application  to another. In another embodiment, the messages to be routed in the system are broadcast messages to multiple applications . In yet another embodiment, direct messages as well as broadcast messages are to be routed. Regardless of what type of messages are to be routed in a system, the messages follow a certain message format.","In one embodiment, the message format consists of keyword-value pairs. The use of keyword-value pairs permits great flexibility in the messages, and also eliminates the need for multiple, nearly identical messages used by different applications. If two applications  use essentially the same message, with one keyword difference, then one message can be defined with the superset of keywords used by each application, and when a message of this type is received by an application , the application  can use the keywords relevant to it and discard the others. Further, there is no need for a specific ordering of keywords. Since the keywords themselves are contained in the message, any application  using the message can search the message for the keywords, rather than needing a fixed ordering of the data in the message.","In one embodiment, certain keywords are required to be in a message, while other keywords are optional. The mandatory keywords are used by the system to determine how to handle the message. In one embodiment, these mandatory keywords are those shared in common between multiple messages, and those which affect the routing of messages in the system.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the mandatory keywords are: AppID, MessageID, and MetaData. The MessageID is used to uniquely identify a message. MetaData is used to uniquely identify an e-Client. These two keywords are inserted into the message by the MOM Module . Other keywords (such as PartitionID and AppInstanceID) are derived from the AppID, MessageID and MetaData by the MOM module  by communicating with the database . This is discussed in greater detail below, with reference to .","In one embodiment of the present invention, some of the more commonly present optional fields include CustomerID, Media Unique Identifier (MediaUID), Global Unique Identifier (GUID), MessageID, and DateTimeStamp. CustomerID is the source application (the application  which the MOM Module  connects to) identifier for the e-Client which the data in the messages belongs to (where applicable). MediaUID is a unique identifier which is provided by the source application. It is carried in the message in case the source application needs it later (for example in a response to a request message). GUID is a system-wide Global Unique Identifier which uniquely identifies a specific instance of a type of message. MessageID is the identifier of the type of message (for example a RequestAgent message). DateTimeStamp is the date and time the message was generated.","An example of a message containing these keywords is:","KEYWORD=AppID\\VALUE=2\\KEYWORD=MessageID\\VALUE=1010\\","KEYWORD=MetaData\\VALUE=Development\\KEYWORD=CustomerID\\","VALUE=12345\\KEYWORD=GUID\\VALUE=103312214176\\","KEYWORD=PartitionID\\VALUE=3\\KEYWORD=AppInstanceID\\VALUE=17\\","KEYWORD=MessageSize\\VALUE=280\\KEYWORD=DateTimeStamp\\","VALUE=01012001101426\\","A system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is a dynamically configurable system. The use of the database  provides great flexibility of message routing in the system. Addition of messages, or destinations of existing messages, is completely controlled by database  and the applications  which use messages. Further, the MOM modules  do not require recompilation to add Hosts , Applications , Queues , or Queue Managers  to the system. Moreover, in one embodiment, Messages  and MetaData  can also be added, modified or deleted without redesign or recompilation of a system in accordance with an embodiment of the present system. In addition, in one embodiment, these changes can be made while the system is in use, without affecting the operation of other, unchanged parts of the system.","These aspects of the various embodiments of the present invention can be better understood with the help of an example.  is a diagram which illustrates an example of a topology of a number of different applications  running on different hosts  for different partitions , some of which overlap in various ways. The diagram in  represents data in accordance with the data model in . The topology in  consists of four hosts , four partitions , seven applications , nine app partitions , seven app instances , and four queue managers .","The dotted lines in  indicate different partitions, which may cross multiple hosts  and applications . The applications  shown in  are Octane (AppID=1), Kana (AppID=2), eGain EMS (AppID=3), WevLine MB (AppID=4), EIC (AppID=5), TEST_ (AppID=6), and TEST_ (AppID=7). The partitions  are SwitchSoft (Partition ), ATN (Partition ), Partition , and TestPartition (Partition ). It can be seen from  that some of the applications  are used by more than one partition . For instance, the EIC (AppID=5) is used by two partitions: Partition , and Partition . Thus there are two app partitions corresponding to the EIC application: EIC_QA and EIC_QB. Also, one host can have multiple partitions. For instance, Host supports both Partition and Partition. Finally, a single partition can overlap across various hosts. For instance, Partition overlaps across Host, Host, and Host.","An example of the data that can be stored in the database (in accordance with the datamodel illustrated in )
