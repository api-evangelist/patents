applicable.","The present invention relates to the field of inkjet printing and, in particular, discloses a method of manufacturing a micro-electromechanical fluid ejecting device.","Many ink jet printing mechanisms are known. Unfortunately, in mass production techniques, the production of ink jet heads is quite difficult. For example, often, the orifice or nozzle plate is constructed separately from the ink supply and ink ejection mechanism and bonded to the mechanism at a later stage (Hewlett-Packard Journal, Vol. 36 no 5, pp 33-37 (1985)). The separate material processing steps required in handling such precision devices often add a substantial expense in manufacturing.","Additionally, side shooting ink jet technologies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,899,181) are often used but again, this limits the amount of mass production throughput given any particular capital investment.","Additionally, more esoteric techniques are also often utilized. These can include electroforming of nickel stage (Hewlett-Packard Journal, Vol. 36 no 5, pp 33-37 (1985)), electro-discharge machining, laser ablation (U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,604), micro-punching, etc.","The utilization of the above techniques is likely to add substantial expense to the mass production of ink jet print heads and therefore add substantially to their final cost.","It would therefore be desirable if an efficient system for the mass production of ink jet print heads could be developed.","In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a Dual Chamber Single Vertical Actuator Ink Jet Printer print head wherein an array of nozzles are formed on a substrate utilizing planar monolithic deposition, lithographic and etching processes. Preferably, multiple ink jet heads are formed simultaneously on a single planar substrate such as a silicon wafer.","The print heads can be formed utilizing standard vlsi\/ulsi processing and can include integrated drive electronics formed on the same substrate. The drive electronics preferably being of a CMOS type. In the final construction, ink can be ejected from the substrate substantially normal to the substrate.","In the preferred embodiment, there is provided an inkjet printhead having an array of nozzles wherein the nozzles are grouped in pairs and each pair is provided with a single actuator which is actuated so as to move a paddle type mechanism to force the ejection of ink out of one or other of the nozzle pairs. The paired nozzles eject ink from a single nozzle chamber which is re-supplied by means of an ink supply channel. Further, the actuator of the preferred embodiment has unique characteristics so as to simplify the actuation process.","Turning initially to , there will now be explained the principles of operation of the preferred embodiment. In the preferred embodiment, a single nozzle chamber  is utilized to supply ink to two ink ejection nozzles , . Ink is re-supplied to the nozzle chamber  via means of an ink supply channel . In its quiescent position, two ink menisci ,  are formed around the ink ejection holes , . The arrangement of  being substantially axially symmetric around a central paddle  which is attached to an actuator mechanism.","When it is desired to eject ink out of one of the nozzles, say nozzle , the paddle  is actuated so that it begins to move as indicated in . The movement of paddle  in the direction  results in a general compression of the ink on the right hand side of the paddle . The compression of the ink results in the meniscus  growing as the ink is forced out of the nozzles . Further, the meniscus  undergoes an inversion as the ink is sucked back on the left hand side of the actuator  with additional ink  being sucked in from ink supply channel . The paddle actuator  eventually comes to rest and begins to return as illustrated in . The ink  within meniscus  has substantial forward momentum and continues away from the nozzle chamber whilst the paddle  causes ink to be sucked back into the nozzle chamber. Further, the surface tension on the meniscus  results in further in flow of the ink via the ink supply channel . The resolution of the forces at work in the resultant flows results in a general necking and subsequent breaking of the meniscus  as illustrated in  wherein a drop  is formed which continues onto the media or the like. The paddle  continues to return to its quiescent position.","Next, as illustrated in , the paddle  returns to its quiescent position and the nozzle chamber refills by means of surface tension effects acting on meniscuses ,  with the arrangement of returning to that showing in . When required, the actuator  can be activated to eject ink out of the nozzle  in a symmetrical manner to that described with reference to . Hence, a single actuator  is activated to provide for ejection out of multiple nozzles. The dual nozzle arrangement has a number of advantages including in that movement of actuator  does not result in a significant vacuum forming on the back surface of the actuator  as a result of its rapid movement. Rather, meniscus  acts to ease the vacuum and further acts as a \u201cpump\u201d for the pumping of ink into the nozzle chamber. Further, the nozzle chamber is provided with a lip  () which assists in equalizing the increase in pressure around the ink ejection holes  which allows for the meniscus  to grow in an actually symmetric manner thereby allowing for straight break off of the drop .","Turning now to , there is illustrated a suitable nozzle arrangement with  showing a single side perspective view and  showing a view, partly in section illustrating the nozzle chamber. The actuator  includes a pivot arm attached at the post . The pivot arm includes an internal core portion  which can be constructed from glass. On each side ,  of the internal portion  is two separately control heater arms which can be constructed from an alloy of copper and nickel (45% copper and 55% nickel). The utilization of the glass core is advantageous in that it has a low coefficient thermal expansion and coefficient of thermal conductivity. Hence, any energy utilized in the heaters ,  is substantially maintained in the heater structure and utilized to expand the heater structure and opposed to an expansion of the glass core . Structure or material chosen to form part of the heater structure preferably has a high \u201cbend efficiency\u201d. One form of definition of bend efficiency can be the Young's modulus times the coefficient of thermal expansion divided by the density and by the specific heat capacity.","The copper nickel alloy in addition to being conductive has a high coefficient of thermal expansion, a low specific heat and density in addition to a high Young's modulus. It is therefore a highly suitable material for construction of the heater element although other materials would also be suitable.","Each of the heater elements can comprise a conductive out and return trace with the traces being insulated from one and other along the length of the trace and conductively joined together at the far end of the trace. The current supply for the heater can come from a lower electrical layer via the pivot anchor . At one end of the actuator , there is provided a bifurcated portion  which has attached at one end thereof to leaf portions , .","To operate the actuator, one of the arms ,  e.g.  is heated in air by passing current through it. The heating of the arm results in a general expansion of the arm. The expansion of the arm results in a general bending of the arm . The bending of the arm  further results in leaf portion  pulling on the paddle portion . The paddle  is pivoted around a fulcrum point by means of attachment to leaf portions ,  which are generally thin to allow for minor flexing. The pivoting of the arm  causes ejection of ink from the nozzle hole . The heater is deactivated resulting in a return of the actuator  to its quiescent position and its corresponding return of the paddle  also to is quiescent position. Subsequently, to eject ink out of the other nozzle hole , the heater  can be activated with the paddle operating in a substantially symmetric manner.","It can therefore be seen that the actuator can be utilized to move the paddle  on demand so as to eject drops out of the ink ejection hole e.g.  with the ink refilling via an ink supply channel  located under the paddle .","The nozzle arrangement of the preferred embodiment can be formed on a silicon wafer utilizing standard semi-conductor fabrication processing steps and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) construction techniques.","For a general introduction to a micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) reference is made to standard proceedings in this field including the proceeding of the SPIE (International Society for Optical Engineering) including volumes 2642 and 2882 which contain the proceedings of recent advances and conferences in this field.","Preferably, a large wafer of printheads is constructed at any one time with each printhead providing a predetermined pagewidth capabilities and a single printhead can in turn comprise multiple colors so as to provide for full color output as would be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.","Turning now to FIG. \u2014 there will now be explained one form of fabrication of the preferred embodiment. The preferred embodiment can start as illustrated in  with a CMOS processed silicon wafer  which can include a standard CMOS layer  including of the relevant electrical circuitry etc. The processing steps can then be as follows:\n\n","Subsequently, the print head can be washed, mounted on an ink chamber, relevant electrical interconnections TAB bonded and the print head tested.","Turning now to , there is illustrated a portion  of a full color printhead which is divided into three series of nozzles ,  and . Each series can supply a separate color via means of a corresponding ink supply channel. Each series is further subdivided into two sub rows e.g. ,  with the relevant nozzles of each sub row being fired simultaneously with one sub row being fired a predetermined time after a second sub row such that a line of ink drops is formed on a page.","As illustrated in  the actuators are formed in a curved relationship with respect to the main nozzle access so as to provide for a more compact packing of the nozzles. Further, the block portion ( of ) is formed in the wall of an adjacent series with the block portion of the row  being formed in a separate guide rail  provided as an abutment surface for the TAB strip when it is abutted against the guide rail  so as to provide for an accurate registration of the tab strip with respect to the bond pads ,  which are provided along the length of the printhead so as to provide for low impedance driving of the actuators.","The principles of the preferred embodiment can obviously be readily extended to other structures. For example, a fulcrum arrangement could be constructed which includes two arms which are pivoted around a thinned wall by means of their attachment to a cross bar. Each arm could be attached to the central cross bar by means of similarly leafed portions to that shown in  and . The distance between a first arm and the thinned wall can be L units whereas the distance between the second arm and wall can be NL units. Hence, when a translational movement is applied to the second arm for a distance of N\u00d7X units the first arm undergoes a corresponding movement of X units. The leafed portions allow for flexible movement of the arms whilst providing for full pulling strength when required.","It would be evident to those skilled in the art that the present invention can further be utilized in either mechanical arrangement requiring the application forces to induce movement in a structure.","One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet print heads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps:\n\n","The presently disclosed ink jet printing technology is potentially suited to a wide range of printing system including: color and monochrome office printers, short run digital printers, high speed digital printers, offset press supplemental printers, low cost scanning printers high speed pagewidth printers, notebook computers with in-built pagewidth printers, portable color and monochrome printers, color and monochrome copiers, color and monochrome facsimile machines, combined printer, facsimile and copying machines, label printers, large format plotters, photograph copiers, printers for digital photographic \u201cminilabs\u201d, video printers, PhotoCD printers, portable printers for PDAs, wallpaper printers, indoor sign printers, billboard printers, fabric printers, camera printers and fault tolerant commercial printer arrays.","It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","High-resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty-five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table above under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.","The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5-micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50-micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micro machined insert in a standard injection-molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Tables of Drop-On-Demand Ink Jets","Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.","The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of ink jet types.","Actuator mechanism (18 types)","Basic operation mode (7 types)","Auxiliary mechanism (8 types)","Actuator amplification or modification method (17 types)","Actuator motion (19 types)","Nozzle refill method (4 types)","Method of restricting back-flow through inlet (10 types)","Nozzle clearing method (9 types)","Nozzle plate construction (9 types)","Drop ejection direction (5 types)","Ink type (7 types)","The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 which matches the docket numbers in the table under the heading CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS.","Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty-five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet print heads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.","Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases, a printer may be listed more than once in a table, where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.","Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include: Home printers, Office network printers, Short run digital printers, Commercial print systems, Fabric printers, Pocket printers, Internet WWW printers, Video printers, Medical imaging, Wide format printers, Notebook PC printers, Fax machines, Industrial printing systems, Photocopiers, Photographic minilabs etc.","The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix is set out in the following tables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0155"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"357pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ACTUATOR MECHANISM (APPLIED ONLY TO SELECTED INK DROPS)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Description","Advantages","Disadvantages","Examples"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Thermal","An electrothermal","Large force","High power","Canon Bubblejet"]},{"entry":["bubble","heater heats the ink to","generated","Ink carrier limited","1979 Endo et al GB"]},{"entry":[{},"above boiling point,","Simple","to water","patent 2,007,162"]},{"entry":[{},"transferring significant","construction","Low efficiency","Xerox heater-in-"]},{"entry":[{},"heat to the aqueous","No moving parts","High","pit 1990 Hawkins et"]},{"entry":[{},"ink.
