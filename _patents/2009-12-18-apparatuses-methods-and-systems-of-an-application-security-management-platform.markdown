{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Recent advances in information technology include the development of software including network applications that can be accessed and shared over the Internet. Such network software applications may cause potential security risks throughout the design, development, deployment, upgrade, and\/or maintenance processes. For example, an E-commerce web platform may encounter security violations such as cookie manipulation, credential theft, cross-site scripting and\/or the like.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed. As such, a detailed discussion of reference number  would be found and\/or introduced in . Reference number  is introduced in , etc.","This disclosure details the implementation of apparatuses, methods and systems of an application security management platform (hereinafter, \u201cASMP\u201d). ASMP systems may, in one embodiment, implement a live dashboard platform on a computerized system, whereby the platform may receive security data associated with a running application from multiple security tracking systems, evaluate the security performance of the application, generate an application security summary report for review and manage review processes.","For example, in one embodiment, the ASMP application may be installed on a network server of a local area network (LAN) of an entity and operated by one or more users. For instance, in one implementation, the users may be security professionals of the entity. In one embodiment, the ASMP may download security data from a plurality of security data sources, wherein the security data is associated with different applications implemented at hosts and terminals within the LAN of the entity. For instance, in one implementation, the security data sources may include a corporate application directory (CAD), a security and asset tracking system (SATS), a data classification and trustee system (DCATS), a security resource (SRC) system, and\/or the like. In one implementation, a SATS may be implemented by software such as, but not limited to, the Computrace\u00ae by Absolute\u00ae Software, the Numara\u00ae Track-it package, or the like. Such systems may be implemented to monitor and scan network ports, gateways, routing information of terminal computers, workstations and\/or the like on the network to track various aspects of each application running within the network. In one embodiment, a DCATS may include a repository of data classification such as data confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA), and the data's trustees by application, etc. In one embodiment, a SRC system may include a repository of security information from past and ongoing application security audits, such as, but not limited to data CIA, application software information, server information, contacts, port scan information, application scan information, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the ASMP may employ a scanning management tool to collect security data from scan results of applications, computers, and network ports that have been scanned by the SATS. For example, in one implementation, an Assessment Management Platform (AMP) may be utilized to obtain scanning information via a web service call, such as, but not limited to SpiDynamics\u00ae WebInspect\u00ae, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the ASMP may store a local cached copy of application data and the associated security data, and may synchronize the local cached data with the data sources, such as CAD, SATS, SRC, etc. In one implementation, the security data from such data sources may be loaded into the ASMP in XML in real time. For example, the XML output that is received for vulnerability results from a SRC system may be in a form similar to the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"POST

one embodiment, the ASMP may store the obtained data in the local cache and evaluate an application based on the obtained security data associated with the specific application. For example, in one implementation, the ASMP may retrieve application information from the CAD, and for each application, the ASMP may determine a risk factor intake form containing security criterion questions. In one implementation, the ASMP may generate and display risk factor intake questions to a security professional, and the security professional may submit responses, including potentially a numeric score for using in calculating the risk factor associated with the application based on the obtained security data.","In one embodiment, the ASMP may allow a security professional to search local cached data from all data sources. For example, in one implementation, the ASMP may form a query based on an application ID and\/or application acronym specified by a user to search for relevant security data with the specified application among the local cached data from multiple sources. As another example, a query may be formed based on a specified IP address, and the security data associated with the host under the specified IP address may be returned.","In one embodiment, the ASMP may perform a cross check for data received from multiple security data sources prior to scoring an application, and if a particular data item is fed by different data sources, a predefined agreement rule may be applied to determine the content of the particular data item based on the received data. For example, in one implementation, the data item \u201cData CIA\u201d may be included in data from both the SATS the DCATS. In some cases, the \u201cData CIA\u201d fed by the SATS may read \u201cCIA low\u201d but the \u201cData CIA\u201d fed by DCATS may read \u201cCIA high.\u201d In such cases, a cross-check agreement rule may be applied to record the most critical scenario for \u201cData CIA\u201d values. For example, in this case, the \u201cData CIA\u201d value may be noted as \u201cCIA high\u201d for the associated application.","In one embodiment, ASMP systems may manage the review processes. For example, in one implementation, the ASMP may maintain an exclusive work queue for a user. When the user logs in the ASMP system, a \u201cmy work queue page\u201d may be displayed, presenting a custom list of separate work queues such as pending reviews of security reports, pending reviews of applications, pending reviews of other data depending on the assignment to the user, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, a method is disclosed, comprising: obtaining application security data from a plurality of data sources; associating the obtained data with at least one application; generating a risk factor matrix for the at least one application based on the obtained data; and evaluating the at least one application based on the generated risk factor matrix.","It is to be understood that, depending on the particular needs and\/or characteristics of an ASMP application, associated security data sources, associated operating system, user interface, object, administrator, server, hardware configuration, network framework, and\/or the like, various embodiments of the ASMP may be implemented that enable a great deal of flexibility and customization. The instant disclosure discusses embodiments of the ASMP primarily within the context of analyzing application security performance. However, it is to be understood that the system described herein may be readily configured\/customized for a wide range of other applications or implementations. For example, aspects of the ASMP may be adapted for mobile device security management, asset tracking systems, and\/or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["105","107","110","120","119","140","113","107","110","107","110","120","110","120","110","113"]},"In one embodiment, an application entity  may submit security data related to the application to the communication network  during the security scanning of web services, such as SpiDynamics\u00ae, WebInspect\u00ae and\/or the like. A security data source  may collect and store the security data related to applications via the communication network . In one embodiment, the security data source  may include, but need not be limited to the CAD, SATS, DCATS, SRC systems as discussed above, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the CAD may provide data such as application name, application ID, associated SATS ID, Mission Criticality (MC), owning entity, and\/or the like; the SATS may provide data such as the SAT ID, the SAT acronym, application name, data classification (e.g. CIA, etc.), MC, software licensing information, contacts, servers, interfaces to other applications, compliance report, offshore (or other) access reports, and\/or the like; the DCATS may provide data such as data CIA information, data trustee information (e.g. by CAD ID), acting trustee information and\/or the like; the SRC system may provide data such as data CIA, application software information, servers, contacts, port scan information, application scan information, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the ASMP server  may request connection to the security data source  to download data on-demand or via other methods. For example, in one implementation, the ASMP server  may receive a request from a user  to refresh the cached security data and\/or generate application reviews. In another embodiment, the ASMP may be configured to update and\/or synchronize the latest security data with the security data source  periodically. The ASMP server may obtain security data from the security data source  in a variety of ways. For example, in one implementation, the ASMP server  may download security data in spreadsheets, pdf files, CSV files, and\/or other document formats through ftp transfer, packaging in directory, XML feeds, and\/or direct database connection with an online database, and\/or the like. In another implementation, the security data source  may provide http posts, xml feeds of security data and other data downloading formats.","In one embodiment, the ASMP server  may generate security risk intake forms for each application for application scoring. In one implementation, the ASMP server  may generate answers to intake questions based on the obtained security data. In another implementation, the ASMP server  may display the intake form to a security professional and receive answers and scores to each security question from the user (security professional). In another embodiment, the ASMP server  may generate application reviews based on the security data and send them to a user . For example, in one embodiment, the ASMP server  may display an application security review on a screen to the user , send an email including the review report, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the user  may submit review comments to the ASMP server , such as, but not limited to, review schedule, review progress, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, a user  may configure the settings of the external security data sources for the ASMP system. For example, in one implementation, a user  may determine a monitoring range of a data source  for the ASMP, e.g., an entire entity network, a subsystem of a business unit within the entity network, and\/or the like. As another example, a user  may add a new application to the monitoring range of the data sources for the ASMP, as will be shown in . In , in one implementation, a system may be registered to a security data source to be monitored and a user may submit via the shown user interface information of the system such as, but not limited to server name, DNS suffix, IP address, facility, network zone, platform, vendor and\/or the like. In , in one implementation, software associated with the monitored system may be registered to a security data source and registration information may be submitted via the shown user interface, such as, but not limited to software vendor, software type, software description, software version, target platform, purchase date, and\/or the like. In , in one implementation, a new application may be added to the monitored network and registration information may be submitted via the shown user interface, such as, but not limited to requestor information, application purpose description, application phase, application information, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the user  may configure the system settings for synchronization schedules with security data sources. For example, in one implementation, the user  may configure the ASMP server  and ASMP database  to update security data at midnight on a daily basis. In a further implementation, the user  may define agreement rules of storing and invoking data elements from multiple data sources. For example, in one implementation, the user  may configure a data source as priority source for a data item which may be fed from different data sources.","In one embodiment, the ASMP server  may also communicate with an ASMP database , for example, in one implementation, to store the obtained security data as a local cache copy. In some embodiments, an ASMP server  may be integrated with a local ASMP database . In other embodiments, an ASMP server  may access a remote ASMP database  via the communication network . The ASMP server  may send the information to the database  for storage, such as, but not limited to user account information, cached application security data from security data sources , agreement rules of multiple data sources, review memoranda, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, a system administrator  may communicate with the ASMP server  and the ASMP database  for regular maintenance, service failure, system updates, database renewal, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the system administrator  may directly operate with the ASMP server  and the ASMP database  on an in-house basis, such as, but not limited to via an integrated administrator user interface. In another embodiment, the system administrator  may remotely access the ASMP server  and the ASMP database  and perform its functionality via the communication network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","205"]},"In one embodiment, the ASMP controller  may be housed separately from other modules and\/or databases within the ASMP system, while in another embodiment, some or all of the other modules and\/or databases may be housed within and\/or configured as part of the ASMP controller. Further detail regarding implementations of ASMP controller operations, modules, and databases is provided below.","In the implementation illustrated in , the ASMP controller  may be configured to couple to external entities via a maintenance interface , a power interface , a user interface  and a network interface . The user interface  may, for example, receive and configure secured user account information, user submitted configuration data, user submitted security question answers, security review information from users (security professionals) and\/or the like. In one implementation, the user interface  may include, but not limited to devices such as, keyboard(s), mouse, stylus(es), touch screen(s), digital display(s), and\/or the like. In various implementations, the network interface  may, for example, serve to configure data into application, transport, network, media access control, and\/or physical layer formats in accordance with a network transmission protocol, such as, but not limited to FTP, TCP\/IP, SMTP, Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) and\/or the like. For example, the network interface  may be configured for receive and configure security data downloaded from an external security data source.

The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the ASMP controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the ASMP database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the ASMP database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the ASMP. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the ASMP as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new result Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, functionality, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, functionality, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS\/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista (i.e., Aero)\/XP, or Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU.

Of course, in entitity of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the ASMP enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU .

The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the ASMP.","Access to the ASMP mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP3, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash function), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the ASMP may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for a digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the ASMP component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the ASMP and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The ASMP database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the ASMP database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data, but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the ASMP database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the ASMP database may be integrated into another component such as the ASMP component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A Users table may include fields such as, but not limited to: user_ID, user_name, user_password, contact_info, hardware_ID, task_ID, task_history, user_evaluation and\/or the like. A Hardware table may include fields such as, but not limited to: hardware_ID, hardware_type, hardware_name, data_formatting_requirements, protocols, addressing_info, usage_history, hardware_requirements, user_ID, and\/or the like. A Cache table may include fields such as, but not limited to: cache_date, cache_source, cache_ID, cache_source_ID, cache_system_ID, cache_application_acronym, cache_trustee, cache_contact, and\/or the like. An Agreement rule table may include fields such as, but not limited to: rule_ID, rule_acronym, rule_sources, rule_data, rule_content, and\/or the like. A Review may include fields such as, but not limited to review_ID, review_date, review_assignment, review_system, review_application, and\/or the like. A Score table may include fields such as, but not limited to score_ID, score_intake, score_app, score_system, score_risk_factor, and\/or the like. These tables may support and\/or track multiple entity accounts on the ASMP controller.","In one embodiment, the ASMP database may interact with other database systems. For example, the ASMP may employ a distributed database system for queries and data access by search. In one implementation, the ASMP component may treat the combination of the ASMP database and an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the ASMP. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the ASMP may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The ASMP may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The ASMP database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the ASMP database communicates with the ASMP component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The ASMP component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the ASMP component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the ASMP that was discussed in the previous figures. As such, the ASMP affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The ASMP component is configurable to access, calculate, engage, exchange, generate, identify, instruct, match, process, search, serve, store, and\/or facilitate communication channels between ASMP components and\/or affiliated entities, transmission of security related data between interfaces, functional modules and storage elements, and\/or the like and use of the ASMP.","The ASMP component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the ASMP server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The ASMP component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the ASMP component communicates with the ASMP database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The ASMP may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The structure and\/or operation of any of the ASMP node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the ASMP controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), local and remote application program interfaces Jini, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. Again, the configuration will depend upon the context of system deployment.","The entirety of this disclosure (including the Cover Page, Title, Headings, Field, Background, Summary, Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description, Claims, Abstract, Figures, and otherwise) shows by way of illustration various embodiments in which the claimed inventions may be practiced.
