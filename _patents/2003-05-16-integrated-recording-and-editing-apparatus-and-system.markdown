No. 09\/150,265, filed on Sep. 9, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,636,687.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an editing apparatus and an editing system. For example, the present invention can be applied to a field editing system in which a broadcast program or the like made of materials collected on the spot is edited. The present invention can improve handling of a system of this kind in such a manner that data for management of video and audio signals and data of an edit list are recorded on a disc-like recording medium together with the video and audio signals to enable the process from image pickup to editing to be performed on the one disc-like recording medium.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, in a place for collection of materials, e.g., a field outside a broadcasting station, a television program or the like made of collected materials is edited by a simple editing system to immediately broadcast the edition result. Such an editing system is arranged to achieve efficient editing by using a process in which materials collected on a magnetic tape are temporarily recorded on an intermediate recording medium formed of a hard disk.","That is, in a case where collected materials are edited in a field by processing using two video tape recorders, i.e., by so-called AB-roll editing, a substantially long time is required for operations for fast-forward feeding and rewinding a magnetic tape, cueing desired cuts, and so on, so that the overall editing time is considerably long.","In an editing system with an intermediate recording medium arranged to solve this problem, video and audio signals recorded on a magnetic tape by, for example, an integrated video camera-tape recorder are dubbed on a hard disk. An edit list is made by setting editting points with respect to the video and audio signals reproduced from the hard disk, and the video and audio signals recorded on the hard disk are then recorded on a magnetic tape in accordance with this edit list.","This editing system requires an edit point setting time markedly shorter than that required by the AB-roll editing system using magnetic tapes and, therefore, enables collected news materials to be broadcast in a shorter time.","In this editing system, however, a considerably long time is required to dub, on an intermediate recording medium, video and audio signals recorded on a magnetic tape. For example, in a case where collected materials having a length of 30 minutes are recorded on a quad-speed hard disk, a time period of seven minutes and thirty seconds is required for recording on the hard disk.","Moreover, a considerably long time is required to rerecord the results of editing on the magnetic tape before the magnetic tape is brought back to the broadcasting station","It is thought that this kind of system can be handled more easily and conveniently if the these time periods are reduced to enable collected materials to be processed more efficiently.","In view of the above-described circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide an image pickup apparatus, an editing apparatus and an editing system arranged to process collected materials more efficiently than those based on the conventional art.","To achieve this object, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided and image pickup apparatus having recording means for recording video and audio signals on a disc-like recording medium detachably held. An information recording surface of the disc-like recording medium is divided into at least two concentric areas, one of which includes an edit list recording area and a management data recording area. The video and audio signals are recorded in the divided concentric area other than that including the edit list recording area and the management data recording area. Data for management of the video and audio signals is recorded in the management data recording area.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an editing apparatus which records an edit list in an edit list recording area corresponding to one of divided areas of a disc-like recording medium on which management data and video and audio signals are recorded.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an editing system including an image pickup apparatus in which an information recording surface of a disc-like recording medium is divided into at least two concentric areas, one of which includes an edit list recording area and a management data recording area, and in the other of which video and audio signals are recorded, data for management of the video and audio signals being recorded in the management data recording area. The editing system also includes an editing apparatus in which an edit list is recorded in the edit list recording area.","According to the present invention, an information recording surface of one disc-like recording medium is divided into concentric areas, which include an edit list recording area and a management data recording area. Data for management of video and audio signals is recorded in the management data recording area, and an edit list is recorded in the edit list recording area. Disc-like recording medium thus formed can be used in common through the process from image pickup to editing to process the video and audio signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","3","2","3","2","4","4","5","3","3"]},"In this editing system , the optical disc  is brought back to a broadcasting station and the results of editing of collected materials recorded on the optical disc  can then be broadcast immediately in accordance with the edit list recorded on the optical disc . Alternatively, the result of editing can be directly transmitted from the viewer  to a broadcasting station via a satellite news gathering (SNG) line or the like if necessary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["3","1","3","3","3","3","3","2","4","3","2","4"]},"Optical disc  is formed of a rewritable phase-change optical disc having information recording surfaces formed on opposite sides, in each of which a pre-groove serving which is a groove for guiding a laser beam is formed in a meandering manner. Optical disc  is driven to rotate so that the meandering period of the pre-groove with respect to a laser beam irradiation position is constant, thereby enabling optical disc  to be driven on the condition of rotation at a constant linear velocity. On one side of optical disc , the pre-groove is formed so as to wind clockwise from the outer circular end to the inner circular end of the recording area as viewed from the same side. On the other side of optical disc , the pre-groove is formed so as to wind counterclockwise from the outer circular end to the inner circular end of the recording area. Each of a pair of optical pickups disposed so as to face the two surfaces of optical disc  can be moved from the outer circular end to the inner circular end of the recording area to successively displace the laser beam irradiation position along the pre-groove in the corresponding surface.","A system data area AR is formed adjacent to the inner end of each recording area of optical disc . The system data area AR is divided into three concentric areas ARA, ARB, and ARC. Management data is recorded in the innermost area ARA when optical disc  is manufactured. This management data includes an optimum quantity of light at the time of recording of data on optical disc , a common serial number for a group of optical discs , and individual identification data assigned to the corresponding optical disc .","Data for management of digital video signals recorded on optical disc  is recorded in the area ARB on the outer circumferential side of the area ARA. This management data includes address information formed of recording start positions and recording end portions of digital video and audio signals for files, time codes for recording start points and recording end points, data for identification as to whether each file is an editable file set by a cameraman, and data on image pickup conditions. Data on image pickup conditions includes a time when image pickup operation is performed, a place where image pickup operation is performed, a name of a cameraman, and television camera setting data. As television camera setting data, data on the white balance, gain, audio signal level, aperture, etc., set in television camera  is recorded. From such management data recorded in the area ARB of optical disc , records of files recorded on optical disc  can be confirmed.","In the next outer area ARC, data for editing is recorded. This editing data is recorded in the form of a file as an edit list for editing files recorded on optical disc . The edit list is formed of data on edit points which are set with respect to each file. This edit point data is recorded by designating a reproduction order with time codes and addresses, with addition of transition forms (e.g., cut-editing, cross-fading, etc.). From optical disc , the desired edit list can be selected and recorded collected materials can be successively reproduced in accordance with the selected edit list.","The area ARB for recording of data for management of digital video signals recorded on optical disc  and the area ARC for recording of editing data are provided on one of the two sides of optical disc .","An outer area AR is allotted as a user area in which digital video and audio signals are recorded. The user area AR is zoned into twenty-six concentric zones having pre-bits formed between pre-groove portions radially adjacent to each other. In the innermost zone, nineteen sectors are allotted per round. The number of sectors per round is successively increased from the innermost zone to the outermost zones. In the outermost zone, forty-five sectors are allotted per round.","In the user area AR, regardless of this zoning, the recording area is concentrically divided as shown in an enlarged view of a portion indicated by A in . An outer portion of each of the divided concentric areas is formed as a recording area for digital video signal V. An inner portion of each of the divided concentric areas is further divided into recording areas for digital audio signals A to A in four channels corresponding to the digital video signal recorded in the outer recording area. In optical disc , therefore, various sounds, e.g., sounds from an object and surrounding things when a picture of the objected is taken (hereinafter referred to as environmental sounds), announcer's explanatory speech, explanatory speech in some of various languages, and background music can be recorded along with the corresponding digital video signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["2","2","3","3"]},"That is, in the television camera , optical pickups A and B are held so as to be face the two surfaces of optical disc , and a sled mechanism  can move the optical pickups A and B in a radial direction of optical disc  under the control of a servo circuit  while maintaining the optical pickups A and B in a linked relationship with each other. Thus, in the television camera , the optical pickups A and B linked to each other can be moved in a radial direction of optical disc  to access any track selected as desired.","Each of the optical pickups A and B irradiates optical disc  with a laser beam and receives light returned from optical disc  to form and output a tracking error signal which changes in level according to a tracking error amount, a focus error signal which changes in level according to a focus error amount, and a wobble signal which changes in level according to meandering of the groove, and a reproduced signal RF which changes in level according to the quantity of returned light.","Each of the optical pickups A and B also outputs a laser beam quantity monitoring signal which changes in level according to the quantity of laser beam light. The servo circuit  performs control based on the level of the monitoring signal such as to intermittently increase the quantity of laser beam light from a quantity at the time of reproduction to an optimum quantity for formation of pits according to a drive signal SR output from a recording signal processing circuit , etc.","The television camera  intermittently increases the quantity of laser beam light in this manner to perform thermal recording of desired data in an area unused for recording on optical disc .","During this data recording, the optical pickups A and B are successively displaced from the outer end toward the inner end of the recording area by the sled mechanism  to perform thermal recording of digital video and audio signals on optical disc . Thus, in the television camera , digital video signals and digital audio signals are successively recorded on optical disc  from the outer area, from which recorded data can be reproduced at a higher transfer rate when optical disc  is driven on the condition of rotation at a constant angular velocity.","The servo circuit  controls tracking and focusing with respect to each of the optical pickups A and B based on the tracking error signal and the focus error signal. The servo circuit  also drives a spindle motor  so that the signal level of the wobble signal changes at a predetermined frequency, thereby rotating optical disc  on the condition of rotation at a constant linear velocity.","Further, when optical disc  is loaded in the television camera , the servo circuit  drives the sled mechanism  under the control of a system control circuit  to seek the system data areas AR of optical disc  through the optical pickups A and B. Thus, in the television camera , various sorts of management data recorded in the system data areas AR can be preliminarily obtained by the system control circuit . On the other hand, at the time of, for example, shutting off the power supply for the television camera  or removing optical disc  out of the television camera , the servo circuit  also drives the sled mechanism  to seek the system data areas AR of optical disc  through the optical pickups A and B, thereby enabling additional management data to be recorded in the system data areas AR according to a requirement.","The camera unit  has an optical system for imaging an object, a solid image pickup device formed of a charge-coupled device (CCD) for forming an image of the object, and a signal processing system for processing an output signal from the CCD solid image pickup device to output digital video signal V. With respect to this signal processing, a white balance, a gain, an audio signal level, an aperture, etc. are set as image pickup conditions by the control operation of a control circuit provided for the camera unit . The camera control unit  informs the system control circuit  with setting data DS consisting of these set conditions. The camera control unit  also informs the system control circuit  of time codes for digital video signal V.","The-recording signal processing circuit  converts digital video signal V output from the camera unit  into recording signal SR together with digital audio signals A and A in two channels and outputs the recording signal SR. Digital audio signal A in one channel in the signals A and A in the two channels is a stereo digital audio signal obtained from front microphones and ordinarily allotted for environmental sounds. Digital audio signal A in the other channel is obtained from a rear microphone and ordinarily allotted for announcer's explanatory speech, for example. Thus, in the television camera , digital audio signals in two channels in digital audio signals A to A in four channels recordable on optical disc  are recorded.","A reproduced signal processing circuit  processes reproduced signals RF output from the optical pickups A and B to reproduce digital video signal V and digital audio signals A and A, and outputs these signals to a viewfinder or to an external apparatus. In the television camera , therefore, image pickup results can be immediately monitored if necessary. When the system data areas AR are accessed with the optical pickups A and B immediately after loading of optical disc , the reproduced signal processing circuit  reproduces management data recorded in the system data areas AR instead of digital video signal V and digital audio signals A and A, and outputs the management data to the system control circuit .","The system control circuit  is formed of a microcomputer for controlling the recording system of the television camera . When optical disc  is loaded, the system control circuit  controls the operations of the servo circuit  and the reproduced signal processing circuit  to obtain management data recorded on the system data areas AR.","Further, when a video recording button  is repeatedly pressed by a cameraman, the system control circuit  changes the operations of the recording signal processing circuit  and the servo circuit  in response to this recording button operation to record digital video signal V and digital audio signals A and A on optical disc  and to stop recording on optical disc . At this time, the system control circuit  performs seeking through the optical pickups A and B on the basis of the management data obtained from the system data areas AR to record digital video signal V and digital audio signals A and A in an area unused for recording on the optical disc . Also, the system control circuit  temporarily stores, in an internal memory, time codes for the recording start time and recording end time corresponding to the pressing operation of the video recording button  and corresponding addresses on the optical disc .","Also, the system control circuit  temporarily stores, in an internal memory, data which is input by operating an operating knob  and which consists of a time when image pickup operation is performed, a place where image pickup operation is performed, and a name of a cameraman, data input by operating a marker key A to enable identification as to whether each of files is an editable file, and television camera setting data DS supplied from the camera unit . From the data thus stored temporarily in the internal memory, the system control circuit  forms data for management of each file recorded on optical disc . The system control circuit  writes, through a drive circuit not shown, this management data in the system data area of the optical disc  in a certain situation, for example, when optical disc  is unloaded.","The system control circuit  also starts the operation of the reproduced signal processing circuit  when a cameraman operates, for example, an operating button for starting reproduction, thereby enabling files recorded on optical disc  to be monitored as desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["11","11","20","1","14","1"]},"A data compression circuit  successively compresses data of digital video signal V output from the video process circuit  into a format prescribed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and outputs the compressed data. A packing circuit  forms blocks of data corresponding to a predetermined data unit from the image data output from the data compression circuit .","An audio process circuit  corrects the signal level of digital audio signals A and A and outputs the corrected digital audio signals A and A. An error-correcting code (ECC) circuit  adds an error-correcting code in a product code form to the audio data output from the audio process circuit  and to the image data output from the packing circuit , and outputs the data with the error-correcting code. At this time, in the recording signal processing circuit , digital audio signals A and A and the image data are processed successively and alternately by transferring the signals through predetermined buffer memories. That is, referring to , continuous digital video signal V and digital audio signals A and A (, (B), and (B)) are input to the recording signal processing circuit  to form a time-division-multiplexed output from the ECC circuit  ().","A memory  is formed of a large-capacity buffer memory. The memory  temporarily stores output data AV from the ECC circuit , and outputs a data array corresponding to the recording areas described above with reference to . That is, the memory  outputs a predetermined amount of image data V, then outputs the corresponding digital audio signal A in the first channel, and subsequently outputs the corresponding digital audio signal A in the second channel (see ). In this embodiment, digital video audio signals are recursively recorded in a cycle corresponding to ten frames by processing using the memory , thus forming the concentric areas described above with reference to .","A striping circuit  separates output data AV from the memory  into two sequences of data corresponding to the optical pickups A and B, and outputs these sequences of data. Channel coding circuits A and B process the two sequences of data output from the striping circuit  in an interleaving manner, thereafter modulate the data by a modulation method suitable for recording on optical disc , and output the modulated data. Sectorization circuits A and B respectively add data such as sync patterns, preambles and postambles to the groups of data output from the channel coding circuits A and B, and output the data. Drive circuits A and B respectively drive the optical pickups A and B in accordance with the groups of data output from the sectorization circuits A and B, thereby intermittently increasing the quantities of laser beam light.","In the television camera , digital video signal V and digital audio signals A and A are recorded on optical disc  at a transfer rate of 33 Mbps.

Also, a waiting time which occurs during intermittent reproduction of digital video and audio signals can be efficiently utilized as a seek time, so that, even when files recorded on optical disc  are discretely accessed in accordance with an edit list, digital video and audio signals can be reproduced substantially continuously.

This display also enables formation of an edit list by selecting some of the files and by setting in and out points or the like. Thus, the personal computer  can execute editing by referring to image pickup information added to each file.","In the television camera  in the editing system  arranged as described above (see ), digital video signals and digital audio signals representing collected materials are recorded on optical disc . This optical disc  is loaded in the viewer  to reproduce data therefrom. An edit list made on the basis of the collected materials is also recorded on the optical disc .","This procedure enables collected materials and an edit list made by editing the collected materials to be managed on one base, i.e., one recording medium. Optical disc  used as such recording medium to record materials collected in a material collecting place is brought back from the material collecting place to a broadcasting station and the collected materials can be readily broadcast by being successively reproduced in accordance with an edit list. Editing of the materials can be executed by selecting desired cuts after only loading optical disc  in viewer . Therefore, the time required for editing can be markedly reduced in comparison with the conventional art. Moreover, there is no need for operations for rerecording on a recording medium such as a magnetic tape after editing.","Further, in the optical disc, identification data for confirmation as to whether collected materials are appropriate to the intention of editing is recorded as management data. At the time of editing, recorded digital video and audio signals are selectively reproduced based on such management data, thus improving the efficiency of editing.","That is, in the television camera (see ), digital video signal V output from the camera unit  is preprocessed by the video process circuit , thereafter compressed by the data compression circuit , and formed into blocks by the subsequent packing circuit . In the subsequent ECC circuit , an error correcting code is added to the digital video signal. Thereafter, the signal is processed through the memory  and converted into two sequences of data by the striping circuit . These two sequence of data are modulated by the channel coding circuit A and B and supplied to the sectorization circuits A and B and to the drive circuits A and B to be recorded on optical disc  on the condition of rotation at a constant linear velocity.","In this recording, the digital video and audio signals (see ) are simultaneously recorded on two surfaces of optical disc  driven on the condition of rotation at a constant linear velocity from the pair of optical pickups A and B disposed on the opposite sides of optical disc . The signals are recorded from the outer end of optical disc , in which pre-grooves are formed from the outer end to the inner end of the recording surfaces so as to wind in opposite directions as viewed from the opposite sides of optical disc . Thus, on optical disc , digital video signals and digital audio signals are successively recorded from the outer area, from which data can be reproduced at a higher transfer rate when optical disc  is driven on the condition of rotation at a constant angular velocity.","By the inputting and outputting operation of the memory , digital video signal V is recorded from the outer end of optical disc  for a predetermined time period, and corresponding digital audio signals, i.e., first-channel digital audio signal A, second-channel digital audio signal A, third-channel digital audio signal A, and fourth-channel digital audio signal A, are thereafter recorded, followed by recursive recording of digital video signal V and digital audio signals A to A (see ).","When recording on optical disc  is completed (see ), times codes for recording start times and recording end times, addresses on optical disc , image pickup time\/place data, a name of a cameraman, data for identification as to whether each of files recorded on optical disc  is an editable file are recorded with respect to the files on the second area ARB in the system data area AR allotted at the inner end of the recording area on optical disc  (see ), along with setting data DS supplied from the camera unit .","The digital video and audio signals thus recorded on optical disc  are reproduced to obtain reproduced signals RF from the optical pickups A and B. In the television camera  (see ,  and ), the reproduced signals RF are respectively corrected in the preprocessing circuits A and B, thereafter decoded by processing in the PRML circuits A and B and the channel decoding circuits A and B, and input to the memories A and B. By the inputting and outputting operations of the memories A and B, the digital video and audio signals successively input recursively in the order of digital video signal V and digital audio signals A to A corresponding to the assignment in the information recording surfaces described above with reference to  are changed into sequences of predetermined unit blocks. The signals are then combined into one sequence of data in the subsequent mixer .","Further, after undergoing error-correcting processing in the subsequent ECC circuit , the digital audio signals are demodulated by the audio process circuit  to be output while the digital video signal is processed by the depacking circuit  to have the original array form, expanded by the data expansion circuit and demodulated by the video process circuit  to be output. The collected materials recorded on optical disc  are reproduced in this manner in the television camera  to be confirmed if necessary.","When collection of materials with the television camera  in a material collecting place performed as described above is finished, the optical disc  having collected materials recorded therein is loaded in the viewer , and editing operations are performed with the viewer  and the personal computer  (see ). When the power supply for each of the viewer  and the personal computer  is turned on, a predetermined operating system is started in the personal computer  and an application program for editing is started after the operating system (see ). Further, a predetermined menu window is displayed on the display  of the personal computer  by the application program.","When the optical disc  is loaded in the viewer  while the application program is in the activated state or while only the power supply for the viewer  is on, or when the power supply for the viewer  is turned on after loading the optical disc  in the viewer , file management data recorded in the system data areas AR is reproduced with two optical pickups A and A in the two pairs of optical pickups A and B, and A and B supported so as to face each other with optical disc  interposed therebetween. This management data is held by the system control  and is output to the personal computer  to be recorded by the hard disk drive  () of the personal computer .","When some of the standard operating buttons  arranged on the viewer  is operated (), the areas assigned to the digital video signal are accessed with one pair of optical pickups A and B in response to this operation, and the areas assigned to the digital audio signals are accessed with the other pair of optical pickups A and B. Reproduced signals RF output from the optical pickups A, B, A, and B are processed by the signal processing circuit . Reproduced data thereby obtained is processed by the video decoder  to reproduce the digital video and audio signals. These reproduced digital video and audio signals are output through the display  and the built-in speakers L and R, thus enabling the materials collected by the television camera  to be confirmed through the viewer .","Data on the operation of the pointing device  in the viewer  is also supplied to the personal computer , and a cursor is displayed on the display  in response to this operation data. When a predetermined menu item is selected by the operation using the cursor, a window for confirming the contents of recording on optical disc  is displayed on the display . Further, in response to operations in this window using the pointing device , the central processing unit  of the personal computer  issues various control commands to the viewer . Reproduction from optical disc  is performed in accordance with these control commands, as is that in the case where standard operating buttons  are operated, thus enabling the collected materials to be also confirmed by operations through the GUI on the personal computer  side.","In this event, files judged to be editable by the cameraman are selectively reproduced by the system control  of the viewer  and the central processing unit  of the personal computer  on the basis of the file management data recorded in the system data area of the optical disc , thus enabling the collected materials to be confirmed easily and reliably without monitoring unnecessary materials.","In the viewer , the pair of optical pickups A and B in the two pairs of optical pickups A and B, and A and B are used to reproduce digital video signals while the other pair of optical pickups A and B are used to reproduced digital audio signals, thereby enabling the desired digital video signals and the corresponding digital audio signals to be reproduced with an extremely small waiting time from optical disc  on which digital video and audio signals are successively recorded in concentric divided areas of the information recording surfaces.","When an operator operates the edit operating buttons  arranged on the viewer  while confirming the collected materials recorded on optical disc  in the above-described manner (), in and out points are set by this operation to select cuts as objects of editing. Editing-object cuts are also selected by selecting a predetermined menu on the personal computer  side and by operating the pointing device  in the window displayed by this menu selection. With respect to the digital audio signals, editing-object cuts are also selected in the same manner by operating the viewer  or by operating the personal computer .","In the case where cuts are selected with respect to the digital video and audio signals by operating the personal computer , the data for management of files may be displayed according to need. The data for management of files may be effectively utilized by, for example, fixing a material collecting place, a time and so on to improve the efficiency of editing.","If, for example, simple editing using stamp pictures is selected on the display  of the personal computer  (see ) after editing-object cuts have been selected in the above-described manner, still images corresponding to the cuts previously selected are displayed on the predetermined window W, and the still images are selectively dragged and dropped (as indicated by arrow E) by operating the pointing device  provided in the viewer , thereby arranging the cuts in the order according to the operator's intention. Also with respect to the digital audio signals, cuts previously selected are arranged in the order according to the operator's intention. Further, an edit list is made by these arrangements to be stored in the hard disk drive .","If in this state the operator selects the menu item for previewing, the personal computer  issues control commands to the viewer  in the reproducing order in accordance with the edit list to reproduce data from optical disc  in the edit order, thereby enabling the editing results to be confirmed through the displays  and  and the built-in speakers L and R.","In this reproduction from optical disc  in the viewer , optical disc  is driven on the condition of rotation at a constant angular velocity higher than the rotating speed at the time of accessing the system data areas AR on the condition of rotation at a constant linear velocity. The digital video and audio signals are thereby reproduced intermittently, and the digital video and audio signals intermittently reproduced are output as continuous digital signals from the buffer memories.","Accordingly, a waiting time which occurs during the intermittent reproduction of digital video and audio signals can be assigned as a time for seek with the optical pickups A, B, A, and B, so that images and sounds between cuts discretely selected on optical disc  can be continuously reproduced. Also, because of drive on the condition of rotation at a constant angular velocity, the need for the time for changing the rotating speed can be eliminated. Also for this reason, images and sounds between cuts discretely selected on optical disc  can be continuously reproduced.","Moreover, the pairs of optical pickups A and B, and A and B are assigned to reproduction of digital video signals and reproduction of digital audio signals, respectively, thereby ensuring that, even in a case where digital video signals and digital audio signals of different files are combined, the desired editing results can be obtained by, for example, reproducing the files in outer areas with the optical pickups A and B for digital video signals while reproducing the files in inner areas with the optical pickups A and B for digital audio signals.","Further, since in optical disc  the recording area is divided to record digital video signals and digital audio signals separately from each other, the optical pickups A, B, A, and B used as described above can reproduce digital video and audio signals more efficiently in comparison with the case where digital video and audio signals are recorded by being time-division-multiplexed (that is, for example, video and audio data compressed in formats prescribed by MPEG are recorded in the same time series.","That is, reproduced signals RF output from the digital video signal optical pickups A and B are processed to reproduce only digital video signals, and reproduced signals RF output from the digital audio signal optical pickups A and B are processed to reproduce only digital audio signals. Therefore, the reproducing system of the viewer  does not require selective processing of reproduced signals such as that required in the case where time division multiplexing is performed, so that a simpler process may suffice for reproduction of digital video and audio signals.","In case where a digital video signal is reproduced at rate of 33 Mbps from an optical disc on which a digital video signal of 30 Mbps and digital audio signal of 3 Mbps are recorded, the actual effective data rate is 30 Mbps\/33 Mbps, that is, the recording reproducing capacity is apparently reduced to about 91%. In this case, with respect to the digital audio signal, the recording reproducing capacity is reduced to about 9%. In contrast, if the system for reproducing a digital video signal and the system for reproducing a digital audio signal are formed independent of each other like those in this embodiment of the present invention, and if digital video and audio signals are recorded in separate recording areas, a reduction in recording reproducing capacity can be effectively avoided.","On the other hand, in the television camera , digital video signals and digital audio signals are successively recorded from the outer area, from which recorded data can be reproduced at a higher transfer rate when optical disc  is driven on the condition of rotation at a constant angular velocity. Therefore, even if seeking with the optical pickups is performed, a sufficient spare time can be maintained to enable digital audio signals and digital video signals to be continuously reproduced.","That is, a magnetic tape of a video recording time of about twenty minutes is generally used for use in television cameras for collecting materials. In particular, in news gathering places or the like, it is rarely that recording area of this kind of recording medium is entirely used for recording of collected materials; in most cases, many areas are left unused for recording. For this reason, it is thought that, even in the case of recording collected materials on optical disc , the possibility of finishing collection of materials while leaving unused recording areas on optical disc  is strong.","In such a situation, the method of successively recording digital video and audio signals from the outer end of the recording area from which data recorded at a higher transfer rate can be reproduced ensures that a sufficient time margin can be spared to enable digital video and audio signals to be reproduced with substantially no discontinuity even if seeking is frequently repeated, in contrast with the case where digital video and audio signals are recorded from the inner end.","If the operator changes in and out points or the like of cuts after confirming editing results by previewing in the above-described manner, the operations of the viewer  and the personal computer  are such that files the operator wants to use are reproduced in response to the operation of the operating buttons or the like, changes of in and out points are accepted, and previewing processing is executed. When a final edit list is thereby determined, a file name is added to the edit list stored in the hard disk drive , and the edit list is transferred to the viewer  to be recorded in the system data area of optical disc  with change of the drive condition to the condition of rotation at a constant linear velocity.","This optical disc  is removed from the viewer  in the material collecting place to be brought back to the broadcasting station. In the broadcasting station, the collected materials recorded on optical disc  can be broadcast by being reproduced in accordance with the edit list recorded on optical disc  in the same manner as in previewing in the viewer . Alternatively, the results of reproduction from optical disc  in accordance with the edit list may be transmitted from the broadcasting station via a suitable communication line to enable use of the collected materials in broadcasting.","In the above-described process, in the viewer , editing can be executed by a simple processing procedure of only reproducing data from optical disc  and recording an edit list in response to the operation of the operating buttons and control commands from the personal computer . On the other hand, in the personal computer , the overall operation is controlled by an application program constructed on an operating system on the market. In this operating system, therefore, a program can easily be formed for processing in each of the viewer  and the personal computer , and can easily revised for version up. The personal computer  may be changed as desired to improve the facility with which the computer is operated by an operator.","On the personal computer  side, a simple editing process is executed by operating the pointing device  provided in the viewer  in association with the GUI displayed on the display  on the assumption that the personal computer  and the viewer  are used in a state of being connected to each other. Therefore, editing can be performed easily even in a restricted environmental space not large enough to operate a pointing device, e.g., a mouse. That is, to move a set of apparatuses between news gathering places or the like, the set of apparatus is ordinarily mounted on a motor vehicle capable of a small turn or easy to drive. It is probable that such a motor vehicle lacks a space large enough to operate a mouse or the like. In this embodiment of the present invention, however, editing can be easily performed if only a space for placement of the viewer  and the personal computer  is provided.","In the editing system arranged as described above, an information recording surface of an optical disc is divided into concentric areas mainly forming a system data area and a user area, and data for management of files and data of an edit list are recorded in the system data area. A common disc-like recording medium formed of such an optical disc can be used from collection of materials with television camera  to editing to record the corrected materials, to enable editing, and to enable the collected materials to be promptly edited and brought back to a broadcasting station. Thus, the editing system of the present invention is capable of processing collected materials more efficiently than the conventional system.","In the reproducing system from the optical pickup operation of viewer  to signal processing, a system for reproducing digital audio signals is formed independent of a system for reproducing digital video signals. Therefore, editing can be performed by using a simple process for combining digital video signals and digital audio signals of different scenes, and the results of such editing can easily be confirmed.","Since the recording areas is divided into concentric areas for recording digital video and audio signals, digital video and audio signals can be efficiently reproduced by being reproduced through independent reproducing systems formed as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["81","81","3","84","81","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0157"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 12"],"b":["84","84","85","86","85","85","5"]},"The video board  displays images reproduced from optical disc , still images, edit windows, etc. on the display  under the control of the CPU board .

Therefore, an operator can execute editing by placing the viewer , for example, on his or her lap in a material collecting place.

Also, even in a case where a phase-change optical disc is used, the optical disc can be driven on the condition of rotation at a constant angular velocity both for recording and for reproduction provided that the desired data recording can be reliably performed by laser light quantity control regardless of the difference between linear velocities at inner and outer positions.","In the above-described embodiments, the optical disc is accessed with one pair of optical pickups in the television camera and with two pairs of optical pickups in the viewer.
