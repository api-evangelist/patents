{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Before computing devices became portable, customers sometimes obtained information about products at home, and then took that information with them when viewing, purchasing, or evaluating the product. Mobile computing devices allow customers to obtain product information when viewing or evaluating the product, when the information is more relevant. For example, a customer can search a manufacturer's web site or read product reviews while in the store. However, sometimes customers desire product information which is not readily found on the internet.","The present disclosure relates to providing assistance to customers, including mobile customers. More specifically, some embodiments of the present disclosure relate to using the current geographic location of a mobile customer to route a call from the mobile customer to a specialist who can provide product assistance. The mobile customer interacts with an application to request contact with a specialist. A mobile customer's current location, for example, within a particular department of a store, is obtained using technology such as a global positioning system (GPS) in a mobile computing device. The current location is mapped to a topic or product category, and the topic is mapped to a person with knowledge about that topic. Other embodiments of the present disclosure relate to using a product identifier to identify an appropriate product specialist.","Through the contact application on the computing device, a phone call is automatically established between the computing device and a computing device operated by the topic specialist. The topic specialist is then available to provide assistance to the customer while the customer is on site and able to interact with products.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments. The networked environment  includes one or more computing devices  in data communication with one or more client devices  and one or more client devices  by way of a network . The network  includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks.","The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. A plurality of computing devices  together may comprise, for example, a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device  is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store , for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and\/or functional entities described below. The data stored in the data store  includes, for example, a specialist listing , as well as potentially other data. The specialist listing  contains information about persons who specialize in or have expertise in various subject matter or topic areas. Examples of specialist listing  include a phone number at which the person can be reached, a subject matter or topic area in which the person is knowledgeable, and educational or work experience qualifications of the subject matter specialist. The specialist listing  may be implemented as a database, and in such cases may be indexed by topic, by a geographic location which is associated with a topic, or by any other suitable field.","The components executed on the computing device , for example, include a call center server  and a specialist locator module . The specialist locator module  is executed to find a topic or subject matter specialist that is appropriate to aid a customer. In some embodiments, the appropriate topic specialist is determined based on that customer's current physical location. The location may correspond, for example, to a department within a store. In other embodiments, the appropriate topic specialist is determined based on an identifier of a product selected by a customer.","The specialist locator module  is also executed to determine a phone number at which the topic specialist can be reached. The call center server  is executed to route and connect calls from a client device , operated by a customer, to a client device  operated by a topic specialist. The topic specialist can thus be viewed as a call agent with respect to the call center server .","Calls between customers and topic specialists are carried on a data network such as the network . The call center server  may utilize features such as automatic call distribution and interactive voice response in the process of routing a call between a customer and a subject matter specialist. In some embodiments, the call center server  is implemented using a set of protocols referred to as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). The VoIP protocols may include, but are not limited to, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Session Description Protocol (SDP), Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP), Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP), IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) H.323.","In various embodiments, the call center server  and the specialist locator module  may utilize any type of middleware framework to communicate with each other. Similarly, the call center server  and the specialist locator module  may utilize any type of middleware framework to communicate with application executing on a client device , such as the topic assistance application  or the location provider component . Examples of such frameworks include remote procedure calls, service-oriented architecture protocol (SOAP), representational state transfer (REST), Windows Communication Foundation, and other frameworks. Although described herein as separate components, the functionality of the call center server  and the specialist locator module  can also be combined, as should be appreciated. Although described herein as separate components, the functionality of the topic assistance application  or the location provider component  can also be combined, as should be appreciated.","The client device  or client device  is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client device  or client device  may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a cellular telephone, a smart phone, a personal digital assistant, a portable navigation system, a set-top box, a music player, a video player, a media player, a web pad, a tablet computer system, a game console, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or other devices with like capability. Some embodiments of the client device  or client device  may be mobile or portable devices.","The client device  may be configured to execute various applications such as a topic assistance application  and a location provider component . The client device  may be configured to execute other applications such as, for example, browsers, email applications, instant message applications, navigation applications, and\/or other applications. The topic assistance application  may be executed in the client device  to facilitate a customer contacting a topic specialist in order to obtain assistance or more information about a particular topic. To this end, the topic assistance application  may interact with the call center server . The topic assistance application  may be implemented as a standalone application or may be executed in the context of a browser, as should be appreciated.","The location provider component  is executed in the client device  to provide the current location of the client device . Various technologies may be used to implement the location provider component , for example, a global positioning system (GPS), an assisted global positioning system (A-GPS), a wireless local area network (WiFi) positioning system, or a wireless network (WiMax) positioning system. The location provider component  may rely on specialized hardware residing in the client device , such as a GPS transceiver, a WiFi transceiver, and\/or a WiMax transceiver, as should be appreciated. The location provider component  may also rely on other specialized hardware separate from the client device , such as a GPS satellite network, one or more WiFi access points, and\/or one or more WiMax access points, as should be appreciated.","The client device  may be configured to execute various applications such as a call agent application  and\/or other applications. The call agent application  may be executed in the client device  to answer phone calls that originate from customers. To this end, the call agent application  may interact with the call center server . During the call, the call agent application  may provide the topic specialist with information that identifies the topic of the call. The client device  may be configured to execute other applications such as, for example, browsers, email applications, instant message applications, navigation applications, and\/or other applications.","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  in an example use scenario is provided. To begin, a mobile customer uses the topic assistance application  to make a phone call in order to obtain assistance for a particular topic. The customer is not required to identify the topic. Instead, the topic of interest is derived from the mobile customer's current physical location. To this end, in response to a request for assistance from the mobile customer, the topic assistance application  obtains the mobile customer's current geographic location from the location provider component . The current geographic location is more specific than an area code, and in some embodiments may be more specific than a street address. In particular, the current geographic location may be accurate enough to place the customer within a structure or building such as a store, and may even be accurate enough to place the customer within a particular department or aisle within a store.","These geographic locations are each associated with a topic or subject matter area. As one example, a location corresponding to a store department is associated with the category of items or products offered in that department. As another example, a location corresponding to an aisle within a store is associated with the category or categories of items or products displayed on that aisle. Automatically deriving the item category from the customer's location reduces the amount of information which the customer must provide in order to obtain assistance on that item category.","As yet another example, if the location is a city neighborhood, the associated topic may be the neighborhood itself. By automatically deriving the topic from the customer's location, the topic assistance application  can facilitate the customer obtaining more information about the neighborhood by talking to a specialist, without even knowing the name of the neighborhood.","As yet another example, if the location is a particular city block, the associated topic may be businesses, stores, or points of interest located on that block. By automatically deriving the topic from the customer's location, the topic assistance application  can facilitate the customer obtaining more information from a specialist who is knowledgeable about those points of interest.","The topic assistance application  then sends a call request, which includes the customer's current location, to the call center server  executing on the computing device . The call center server  uses the services of the specialist locator module  to find a particular person who has knowledge about a topic, where the topic has a predefined association with the customer's geographic location. The topic specialist returned by the specialist locator module  may be at the same location as the customer, or may be located remotely with respect to the customer. If the customer location is a business, the topic specialist may be an employee of the business, or may be a third party provider. The call center server  then fulfills the customer's request for assistance by routing the phone call to the identified specialist. The topic may be an item such as a product or product category, so that the topic specialist can be viewed as an item specialist or product specialist.","In some embodiments, the specialist locator module  maps directly from the geographic location to the contact phone number for the topic specialist. In other embodiments, the specialist locator module  maps from the geographic location to the topic area, and from the topic area to a contact phone number for a specialist in that topic area. In still other embodiments, the specialist locator module  maps from the geographic location to the topic area and the call center server  maps the topic area to a specialist and a phone number for the specialist. In such embodiments, the mapping function is distributed between the specialist locator module  and the call center server .","Once the call between the mobile user and the topic specialist is established, the call proceeds in the conventional fashion. The phone call may include audio, video, multimedia, or a combination thereof. The video portion of the call may utilize a camera or other video capture device located in the mobile client device , or may utilize cameras or other video capture devices installed at the mobile customer's current location and connected to the network . For example, if the customer is in a store, network-accessible cameras may be installed along various aisles of the store, or in various store departments. If the customer is outside on a street, the call may use various network-accessible cameras on the street.","The call may include, or be associated with, data other than audio or video. For example, the topic specialist may send data to the mobile client device , for example in the form of a network page. In this manner, the topic specialist can provide information about a product during the call.","Turning now to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the topic assistance application  according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of  provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the topic assistance application  as described herein. As an alternative, the flowchart of  may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the client device  () according to one or more embodiments.","Beginning at box , the topic assistance application  receives, from a user of the client device , a request to contact a topic specialist. The contact request is not required to identify the topic, because the topic is instead derived from the current location of the mobile client device . To this end, at box  the topic assistance application  obtains, from the location provider component  executing on the client device , the current location of the client device . At box , the topic assistance application  sends a call initiation request to the call center server . The request includes the geographic location, but is not required to include the phone number of the callee. In some embodiments, the request also includes a topic identifier.","In response to the call initiation request, the call center server  routes the call to a topic specialist who can provide assistance to the user. At box , the topic assistance application  receives from the call center server  a notification that the call to the topic specialist has been established. The notification may include information such as the name, credentials, qualifications, and\/or business affiliation of the specialist, Next, at box , the client device  handles the call by sending audio and\/or video to the topic specialist, and by receiving audio and\/or video from the topic specialist. Finally, at box  the call is terminated at the direction of either the customer or the topic specialist. The process of  is then complete.","In the embodiment described in connection with , an appropriate topic specialist is determined based on the customer's geographic location, for example, the current location of a mobile customer. In another embodiment, an application executing on a client device provides a product identifier to the topic assistance application , and the product identifier is mapped to a topic and then to a topic specialist. For example, the product bar code may be used as a product identifier. The bar code may be directly readable by the client device, or the customer may input the bar code manually. Other types of product identifiers may also be used, such as stock-keeping units (SKUs), serial numbers, etc.","With reference now to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the call center server  according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of  provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the call center server  as described herein.

The call request includes the current location of the client device . As discussed above, associations between geographic locations and topics, and\/or between geographic locations and topic specialists, are stored in the specialist listing . At box , the call center server  uses the services of specialist locator module  to identify a topic specialist based on the mobile customer's geographic location. Next, at box , the call center server  routes the call from the client device  to the phone number of the identified topic specialist. At box , the call center server  notifies the topic assistance application  that the call has been established. At some later point in time, at box  the call is terminated at the direction of either the mobile customer or the topic specialist. The process of  is then complete.","In the embodiments described above, the mapping between the current geographic location of the client device  and the appropriate topic specialist for the phone call is performed by the call center server . In other embodiments, the client device  performs this mapping locally. In some of these embodiments, the client device  then establishes the phone call without the assistance of the call center server , using for example, a VoIP service to connect to the client device  and thus to communicate with the topic specialist.","Moving on to , shown is a schematic block diagram of the computing device  according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The computing device  includes at least one processor circuit, for example, having a processor  and a memory , both of which are coupled to a local interface . To this end, the computing device  may comprise, for example, at least one server computer or like device. The local interface  may comprise, for example, a data bus with an accompanying address\/control bus or other bus structure as can be appreciated.","Stored in the memory  are both data and several components that are executable by the processor .
