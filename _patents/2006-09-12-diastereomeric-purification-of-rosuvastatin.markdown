Rosuvastatin calcium is a superstatin, which can lower LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides more effectively than first generation drugs. Rosuvastatin calcium has the following chemical formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"44.70mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US07582759-20090901-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Rosuvastatin calcium is marketed under the name CRESTOR for treatment of a mammal such as a human. According to the maker of CRESTOR, it is administered in a daily dose of from about 5 mg to about 40 mg. For patients requiring less aggressive LDL-C reductions or who have pre-disposing factors for myopathy, a 5 mg dose is recommended, while 10 mg dose is recommended for the average patient, 20 mg dose for patients with marked hyper-cholesterolemia and aggressive lipid targets (>190 mg\/dL), and the 40 mg dose for patients who have not been responsive to lower doses.","Rosuvastatin is an enantiomerically pure compound having two chiral centers at positions 3 and 5 of the molecule. Two of the four diastereoisomers of Rosuvastatin calcium are (3R,5R) and (3R,5S) derivatives. These diastereoisomers can be detected by reverse phase HPLC.","The synthetic process disclosed in US RE37,314E for rosuvastatin involves reduction of a keto-ester of a rosuvastatin at carbon 5 to obtain a diol ester. This reduction at position 5 is a standard typical step in the synthesis of statins. This reduction step however can result in diastereoisomeric impurities.","WO 2005\/040134 discloses a process that is reported to reduce the diastereoisomer content of rosuvastatin through lactonization, or through conversion of amorphous rosuvastatin to crystalline rosuvastatin and subsequent conversion to the amorphous form.","There is a need in the art for preparation of diastereomerically pure rosuvastatin and its intermediates.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides a rosuvastatin intermediate of the following structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"42.08mm","wi":"59.94mm","file":"US07582759-20090901-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","1","4 "]},"In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process for preparing a rosuvastatin intermediate diol ester having the structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"42.08mm","wi":"59.94mm","file":"US07582759-20090901-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","1","4 "]},"a) combining MeO-9-BBN with an organic solvent and a source of hydride ions;","b) adding to said combination a solution of a rosuvastatin keto-ester in an organic solvent, wherein the rosuvastatin keto-ester has the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"42.08mm","wi":"65.70mm","file":"US07582759-20090901-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":"1 "},"c) maintaining the reaction mixture to obtain the diol ester.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a one pot process for preparing rosuvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof comprising:","a) combining MeO-9-BBN with an organic solvent and a source of hydride ions;","b) adding to said combination a solution of a rosuvastatin intermediate keto-ester in an organic solvent, wherein the rosuvastatin intermediate keto-ester has the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"42.08mm","wi":"65.70mm","file":"US07582759-20090901-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":"1 "},"c) maintaining the reaction mixture to reduce the intermediate;

In wet granulation, some or all of the active ingredients and excipients in powder form are blended and then further mixed in the presence of a liquid, typically water, that causes the powders to clump into granules. The granulate is screened and\/or milled, dried and then screened and\/or milled to the desired particle size. The granulate may then be tableted, or other excipients may be added prior to tableting, such as a glidant and\/or a lubricant.","A tableting composition may be prepared conventionally by dry blending. For example, the blended composition of the actives and excipients may be compacted into a slug or a sheet and then comminuted into compacted granules. The compacted granules may subsequently be compressed into a tablet.","As an alternative to dry granulation, a blended composition may be compressed directly into a compacted dosage form using direct compression techniques. Direct compression produces a more uniform tablet without granules. Excipients that are particularly well suited for direct compression tableting include microcrystalline cellulose, spray dried lactose, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and colloidal silica. The proper use of these and other excipients in direct compression tableting is known to those in the art with experience and skill in particular formulation challenges of direct compression tableting.","A capsule filling of the invention may comprise any of the aforementioned blends and granulates that were described with reference to tableting, however, they are not subjected to a final tableting step.","A preferred dosage is from about 5 mg to about 80 mg per day, more preferably about 5 mg to about 40 mg per day, with 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg tablets once a day being a preferred method of administration.
