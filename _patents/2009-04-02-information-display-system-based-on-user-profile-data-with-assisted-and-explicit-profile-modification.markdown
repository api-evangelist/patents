Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to retrieving, analyzing and delivering information using user profiles that are explicitly edited by the user, and tools for facilitating the creation and editing of such profiles by users in an interactive, computer implemented process.","2. Description of Related Art","The Internet is becoming a leading source for news. However, the amount of news available through the Internet is overwhelming. Thus, Internet portals and other websites offer so-called personalization to varying degrees. A great deal of active research is being conducted concerning how to improve personalized access to news and other resources. See, Pretschner et al., \u201cOntology Based Personalized Search,\u201d Proc. 11th IEEE Intl. Conf. on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, pp. 391-398, Chicago, November 1999.","Personalization technologies often require creation of a user profile, which is used in the process of filtering information and presenting the information to the user. One common perception in this field is that profile creation should not require significant effort by the user at the risk of alienation and loss of the customer. However, so-called open profiles which include editable user models have been proposed, allowing a user to examine and edit a user profile. See, Ahn et al., \u201cOpen User Profiles for Adaptive News Systems: Help or Harm?\u201d, International World Wide Web Conference Committee, WWW2007, May 8-12, 2007. In Ahn et al., an editable profile is described based on the display of keywords used in the filtering process. The user is able to add and delete words from the list. Also, the process identifies \u201ctop\u201d keywords in articles returned to the user, which enables the user to discover the terms used in the articles, and utilize the information in the process of editing the profile. Ahn et al. found however that providing a user the ability to add and remove keywords typically harms system and user performance in information retrieval systems. Ahn et al. suggests that user editable profiles might work in systems that have good control over the delivery of cumulative or duplicative articles, which they characterize as good \u201cnovelty control\u201d, in the filtering of information to deliver to the users. They found evidence that duplicative articles led users to try to amend their profiles to eliminate the duplicates, with poor results. However, as Ahn et al. have demonstrated, practical and useful systems based on open user profiles have not been deployed.","It is desirable therefore to provide personalization technologies based on open profiles which can be modified by users, in a way that actually improves the results of the information filtering and presentation systems.","Personalization technology for delivery of news and other information is described that is based on an open user profile, and supported by sophisticated content analysis and tools that enable a user to quickly and easily take advantage of the content analysis in the creation and refinement of his or her profile.","A data processing system for delivering the service includes a database storing a plurality of user records. The user records include respective profile data structures that contain one or more interest nodes. The interest nodes in turn include respective sets of targets, where the targets comprise typed-attributes to be used in the filtering of information files for delivery of result sets for the interest nodes. The data processing system also includes logic that is executable to process the information files and associated metadata in response to a selected interest node to produce a filtered set of information files. The processing applies the targets of the interest node over the typed-attributes of available information files to produce the filtered set. The data processing system includes logic executable to compose and send executable documents to a user terminal, where the executable documents are rendered to produce a graphical user interface. The executable documents comprise data specifying a representation of the filtered set of information files, a representation of the targets which define the interest node, and a representation of selectable markup identifying typed-attributes associated with the filtered set of information files. Upon rendering of the graphical user interface at the user terminal, tools are presented that highlight the typed-attributes and enable the user to select the highlighted typed-attributes and cause messages to be sent to the data processing system for use in refinement of the interest node. The data processing system includes logic to receive these messages indicating the selection of particular markup in the graphical interface at the user terminal, which is executable to modify the selected interest node in response to these messages by, for example, adding a target corresponding to the typed-attributes identified by the particular markup.","Typed-attributes usable as targets in the user profile include entity type attributes that identify entities named in the associated information files, topic type attributes that identify topics from a taxonomy addressed in the associated information files, phrase type attributes identifying keywords or phrases used in the associated information files, concept type attributes identifying concepts that are addressed in the associated information files, and so on. The entity type attributes, topic type attributes, and concept type attributes are extracted from information files using content analysis programs that require analysis requiring linguistic and statistical techniques beyond simply recognizing and indexing words used in the information files. By delivering markup identifying typed-attributes to the user in association with tools used for editing an open profile, the user's participation in the creation and refinement of interest nodes in the profile is facilitated and superior personalization results are achieved.","In addition to targets as described above, user profiles include interest nodes in which typed-attributes are used as qualifiers, where a qualifier is an argument used by an algorithm or algorithms for ranking and filtering information files in result sets, or an argument used for composition and delivery of result sets. The executable documents that are used for rendering the graphical user interface include data structures specifying user selectable markup that enable user to produce messages to the data processing system to add or modify qualifiers in the profile data structure. In one embodiment, user selectable markup-up is provided that allows the user to generate an indication of interest in specific information files represent on the graphical interface. In this case, the menu is presented in response to the indication of a selected information file with \u201crecommended\u201d typed-attributes. The menu enables a user to produce messages to the data processing system to modify the selected interest node based on typed-attributes associated with the selected information file, such as by adding, or removing, the highlighted typed-attribute as a qualifier in the selected interest node.","The data processing system also includes logic for the initiation of interest nodes within a profile data structure. Profile data structures can be characterized as data structures arranged to contain sets of targets and qualifiers. An executable document is presented that includes data structures that specify user selectable markup for generating an indication that user intends to create an interest node. In the creation of interest nodes, the markup identifying typed-attributes of information files and other tools are leveraged to assist the user to create relevant and useful targets and qualifiers.","A method for presenting personalized content is provided which includes storing information files and associated metadata in computer readable storage, and storing a profile data structure in a database including a plurality of interest nodes that include respective sets of targets. The method includes filtering the information files and metadata using targets in a selected interest node to produce a filtered set of information files by executing a procedure on the data processing system in communication with the storage and the database. The method includes composing a first executable document using the data processing system. The first executable document is used by a user terminal for rendition of a graphical user interface that includes a representation of the filtered set of information files, user selectable markup identifying typed-attributes represented in the filtered set of information files and a representation of the selected interest node from the profile data structure of the user. The data processing system sends the first executable document on a data network to a user terminal which renders a graphical user interface enabling the user to the return messages to the data processing system. The data processing system modifies the selected interest node and the profile data structure in response to an indication of selected markup by the user. The modification can include adding the typed-attributes identified by the selected markup as a target or qualifier in interest node. Next, the data processing system composes a second executable document use for rendition of a graphical user interface at the user terminal, based on a modified interest node. The second executable document is returned to the user across the data network and rendered to produce an updated graphical user interface with modified results.","Embodiments of the first and second executable documents include a first pane displaying a representation of the profile data structure, a second pane displaying a representation of the filtered set of information files, and a third pane including a list of markup identifying typed-attributes represented in the filtered set of information files. Also, embodiments of the first and second executable documents include a status bar indicating the selected interest node.","In composing a second executable document, a new filtered set of information files is produced in response to the particular typed-attribute is provided as part of the second executable document along with a second annotation marking the particular typed-attribute is provided that is selectable to cause execution of the program to update the selected interest node with a target corresponding to that particular typed-attribute. In this manner, a two-phase process is required for updating the interest node that involves first reviewing results provided by the proposed update, and second deciding whether to permanently add the proposed update to the interest node.","Other aspects of the technology described herein can be seen on review of the figures, the detailed description and the claims which follow.","A detailed description of embodiments of the present invention is provided with reference to the .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","11","11","11","11","11","11","12","12"]},"In the configuration illustrated, a content database A is coupled with and managed by a content pipeline executed by data processors C. The content database includes metadata associated with the information files, including typed-attributes usable by the logic executed by data processors A, B, C in the filtering of information files. Information files in a representative system can include text based files, image based files, video files and other content which can satisfy parameters of a user's profile as it is reflected in a profile data structure, and can be obtained via a content pipeline.","A user database B is coupled with and managed by a personalization engine executed by data processors B. The user database B includes user records that store parameters of user accounts, including user profile data structures utilized for personalization of the information files fed to the users. The profile data structures include one or more interest nodes, associated with the user account. The interest nodes comprise targets, which are typed-attributes usable by the logic executed by data processors A, B, C in the filtering of information files. The interest nodes also comprise qualifiers, which are typed-attributes usable by the logic executed by data processors A, B, C for ranking and further filtering the information files.","In the environment shown, sources  of information files provide such files to the content pipeline at data processors C via the communications infrastructure . Users at terminals ,  utilized browsers, or other application programs, executed on their terminals to interact with a web application executed by data processors A. Thus, the terminals ,  display graphical user interfaces by rendering images with mark-up using executable electronic documents, such as web pages implemented using mark-up languages and scripts, composed by the data processors A, B, C, and accept and relay input signals from the terminals ,  to the server data processors A, B, C using protocols such as the hypertext transfer protocol HTTP, or other communication protocols suitable for the processes described herein.","A basic deployment architecture is illustrated in . This deployment architecture is representative of high traffic server farm implementations. The technology can be deployed in a single computer, or in many computers configured as suits a particular embodiment. In the basic deployment architecture illustrated in , a web application comprises logic performed by the data processors A which manages communications between the server system and users (e.g. 15), including establishing web sessions using a communication protocol such as HTTP, sending web pages composed with support of the presentation engine B, and responding to actions executed by the user which results in messages to the server, for initiation of interest nodes, refinement of interest nodes and in general navigating the information files presented. A profile database B stores user profiles that include interest nodes. A personalization engine B computes a \u201cnode result\u201d for each selected interest node, which consists of a filtered set of information files generated using the parameters of the interest nodes. In addition, it generates channel pages based on the node results of selected interest nodes, and other pages. A \u201cfront page\u201d format can be used which reflects node results for a plurality of interest nodes using a full user profile. The user operating at terminal , for example, reads the front page and channel pages in a browser and produces indications to initiate routines to create and refine interest nodes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["11","11","11","20","21","20","21","22","23","22"]},"The set of presentation functions (block ) composes graphical user interfaces in the form of electronic documents for rendering by user terminals. The graphical user interfaces are rendered and displayed using a browser, e-mail, the SMS communication system or otherwise that include a representation of a filtered set of information files with mark-up to support direct signals from the user to the server  in support of maintaining a user's profile data structure. Thus, a user can explicitly signal an update to an interest node within the user's profile data structure to add a specific target to the filtering process, and to cause the filtering process to produce more information about the specific target. The graphical user interface is managed to provide instant value to the user based on such direct signaling, as well as feedback on how use of a specific typed-attribute will affect future results sets.","In the set of analyze functions (block ), text analytic functions are performed on information files that are collected. These functions produce a rich set of mark-up including metadata fields and annotations that mark key elements, including typed-attributes, within the text of each information file. These metadata and annotations are utilized for matching and presenting information files to the user, and structuring the process of updating the user's interest profile data structure. The typed-attributes included in the metadata and annotations include for example, the following:\n\n","Some metadata and annotations are provided by some of the sources of information files, and such metadata and annotations can be parsed and included in marked up information files by the server . Information files are stored in a document format in the database suitable for use in the filtering process, such as a format consistent with industry-standard formats such as RSS 2.0, Atom 1.0, and the Universal Feed Parser.

Related information files are grouped and linked to support more effective presentation. For example, the analyze functions can provide same event clustering, by which information files about the same in event or happening are annotated as belonging to groups, such as when news items covered by many publications appear in the filtered set of information files. Also, related content clustering is used to group related items by annotating information files as belonging to a group, such as discussions, opinions and analysis articles, so on within a given time period. This can extend to current hot discussion topics as they arise on blogs and community sites which may be triggered by news events or initial articles within the blogs by individuals.

The interest nodes include parameters of the use of the profile referring to a range of needs and interests of the user which can be characterized using typed-attributes. The name and description of a particular interest node can be entered directly by a user. The Interest Nodes are composed of two types of elements, including targets which are typed-attributes indicating the \u201cwhats\u201d of interest, and qualifiers which are typed-attributes indicating representing other attributes of interest that affect the ranking, filtering, composition and delivery process. Targets can be classified for use by the matching algorithms as \u201crequired\u201d (must be matched in every file of result set), \u201cpreferred\u201d (not necessarily matched in all files) and excluded (must not be matched in the files of the result set).","This basic schema also includes a list of sources (\u201cSources\u201d) and lists of kinds of typed-attributes (\u201cTargets\u201d) which can be used as targets in an interest node.","Targets as used herein are arguments used by the personalize engine, implemented within the profile data structure and associated with specific Interest Nodes. Representative types of targets include entities, topics, phrases, and concepts which can be defined as follows:","Entities identify particular objects in the world. Entities within the entity type attribute are further typed and include both broad entity types like people, companies and products, and narrower or specialized types like sports teams, proteins or pathogens.","Topics identify subject matters. Topics can be drawn from any number of general and specialized taxonomies covering areas of content supported over time. For example, taxonomies can be provided for general interest, business, health, patents, areas of science and so on. Taxonomies can be actively curated to provide further adaptation the filtering process.","Phrases are free-form words, often phrases having more than one word, that are entered by a user as they might be entered in a typical search box or selected from displayed text. In general, Phrases may be matched literally or using straightforward transformations like stemming, spelling correction and so on.","Concepts are typed-attributes that have some properties of Phrases and some properties of topics, but allowing for a wider range of alternative forms for the concept. Concepts can be matched using a variety of additional related attributes. Unlike phrases, concepts are more statistically important in usage and the news, such \u201cglobal financial crisis\u201d, \u201ctobacco taxes,\u201d \u201cnational championships\u201d, etc. Unlike topics, concepts are not originated from static taxonomies. Concepts are produced by statistical text analysis of new articles and queries, to identify frequently occurring phrases or other attributes which suggest that the file given the particular concept type attribute is related to a larger concept.","Qualifiers are additional attributes associated with Interest Nodes in the profile data structure. Attributes usable as qualifiers can include both visible or hidden aspects of information files which can satisfy the user's interest as defined by the filtering engine. Qualifiers may be explicitly provided by a user using a graphical user interface, or learned by the system during use. Qualifiers can be used to increase relevance in general and to improve salience and clarity in the composition process by boosting or reducing the weight of certain factors. Qualifiers would be used to model factors related to breadth and depth of interest. Examples of qualification include the fact that the same targets may be in a plurality of interest nodes in different user profiles. However, one user profile may qualify the target by the fact that the user is a specialist in that area and may desire deeper content, such as content from a specialized group of sources filtered by provenance tags, form tags or genre tags. Alternatively, a qualifier might is to indicate a casual or light interest in a particular interest, such as for example photography. Although a number of articles may match the targets within a casual interest, the filtering and composition functions may pass only information files carrying tags indicating that they are particularly popular, or apply delivery rate functions to allow only the occasional articles for delivery and display.","Qualifiers also include presentation and delivery factors that relate to when the information is requested and where the information is delivered. The electronic documents produced using the result sets are composed using qualifiers that specify the platform to which it is to be delivered. For a full function browser at the user terminal, the web application is used to produce a rich page for large format display, for a cell phone or personal digital assistant browser, the web application is used to produce a reduced result set, or a page layout that is more suited to the small format display, for an instance of the user terminal that involves delivery within a web page, like a Facebook page, a blog, or another specialized cite, the personalization engine can apply the parameters that define the boundaries of the available channel, for an instance operating via email or another communication protocol, the personalization engine is used to adapt the content appropriately. Likewise, time qualifiers can be used to emphasize different interest nodes, or different targets within an interest node at different times of the day, different days of the week or publication cycles relevant to the interest node and the sources used by the interest node.","The particular interest nodes have a structure that is independent of the manner in which the nodes are created in this example. Typically the name and description of the interest node can be input by the user.","The system can include logic that keeps track of the history of the creation and modification of the parameters of interest nodes, the context of the action used for the creation and modification, and the mechanism used for that purpose.","Interest Nodes in the profile data structures can be created using a number of basic approaches. In many cases, the user creates the interest node incrementally and gets feedback as they update the interest nodes during future sessions. In a first technique, a user searches for information files related to an interest which the user would like to track. The user may enter targets of any type into a search box on a graphical user interface. The input targets are used by the filtering engine to produce a filtered set of information files, and then to present an instance of the filtered set for display to the user. The user then browses the results, using interactive tools provided by the mark-up in a graphical user interface to add targets to a current basket. The users given the option to save the basket of targets as a new interest node for future use.","A second technique for creation of Interest Nodes involves using the displayed results of a filtering operation, such as an overview page displaying results from a plurality of information nodes within a user's profile, or a page displaying a set of information items filtered by a chosen interest node, and giving tools to select targets of interest for addition to the corresponding interest node. This method allows a user to personalize generic categories, and\/or refine special-purpose categories over time.","The list of sources in the profile data structure is a set of sources that may limit or bias the interest node. A user's interest node is typically not source-constrained. However, in practical settings, a user can confine or bias filtering for particular interests by emphasizing or excluding particular sources. Sources can be used as qualifiers that affect the weight given to a particular information file used in ranking the file for selection in the electronic document presented to the user that results from the filtering.","The server provides tools to the user to perform interest node creation and editing by first analyzing the information files included in the filtered set of information files to be presented, to create metadata in the form of typed-attributes which are reflected in our characterized the information files. In the creation of the electronic document used at the user terminal to render the graphic user interface, the server adds markup that tags the typed-attributes within the display representations of the information files, and provides summary panes on the graphic user interface in which tag attributes of the filtered set of information files as a whole are listed and markup. The markup on the graphical user interface acts both as a prompt for the user to consider the typed-attributes as a candidate target or qualifier for the interest node, and as a tool which allows the user to automatically add or delete the typed-attribute from the interest node. In this way, interest nodes can be created and refined in the process of reading the pages delivered by the server to the user. They can be initiated using a number of the tools provided by the markup, and further refined immediately and over time as the user chooses.","The server composes an electronic document that is rendered at the user terminal to provide graphical user interface to the user by which the user is provided tools, such as hyperlinks, pop up menus, and the like, using markup and scripts to create and edit the contents of specific interest nodes within the user's profile data structure, by adding and deleting targets and qualifiers. The tools in the graphical user interface facilitate interaction to add and remove targets from an interest node in a user profile data structure. The tools are set up so that they become a natural part of obtaining relevant items and browsing the filtered set of information files currently being presented. Also, the tools are set up to provide additional relevant results in response to the user's steering of the content of interest nodes. In addition to explicit user steering, the server  may provide additional processes for automatic maintenance of interest nodes including for example the following:\n\n","The personalize engine  also provides filtering processes. In an example filtering process described here, the filtering consists of three steps. In the first step a set of information files are collected by matching an interest node against an index that includes the content and the metadata fields of information files. The candidate, filtered set of information files is scored and ordered based on relevance to the targets included in the interest node, as is done in typical search engines and enhanced by the processing of the information files and use of profile data structures as described herein. The second step computes an additional set of scores for each information file representing qualifiers for the information files such as authority or liveliness, which can be computed from a variety of available statistics associated as metadata or otherwise related to the information files and content analysis applied to the information files, including provenance, hit counts, timeliness, etc. In a third step the scores are collectively used by an algorithm to generate a small and balanced set of relevant information files to be included in the electronic documents for delivery to the user.","A data structure for representing the filtered set of information files output by the personalization engine  in a result set object format as shown below.

In this process, the user browses items on an overview page of recent content or on page is organized into pre-existing topic areas. The markup identifies sources and other typed-attributes suitable for use as targets within an information file. If a user clicks or otherwise selects a markup associated with particular attribute, a message is generated to the server identifying the selected markup and an interest node can be created including the attribute associated with that selected markup as part of the profile. The context of the information file can be used to provide additional elements for the initial definition of interest node. For example, the user can click on typed-attributes used for targets within pages focused on broad categories of news such as politics, sports or entertainment. From these broad categories, additional targets can be included in that interest node or proposed explicitly to the user for inclusion.","Also usable in node creation, the markup enables arrowing of specific information files.

Candidate typed-attributes can also be listed, and presented as markup on the display, and other settings that do not require user action. For example, recommended entities and topics are listed in the panes ,  of . Thus, lists of recommended typed-attributes can be identified by markup and presented to the user on a page focused on a specific channel or interest node, or when the recommendation is particularly strong based on analysis of the behavior of the user or other parameters in the interest node.","Generally, typed-attributes can be recommended as targets and sources for an interest node profile based on content metadata, usage data captured in the system for the particular user and aggregated over all users, and possibly other data from third-party sources through harvesting and other automated processes. Factors used to determine whether to recommend a typed-attribute include usage, content, editorial ratings, popularity and other users. Some examples include recommending typed-attributes as targets that are common across items matching the channel, that co-occur with existing targets frequently and other information files in the collection, that are associated with existing targets by processes such as efficient editorial review, and that are common and popular in channels across other users, particularly users that have similar interest nodes or profiles.","An algorithm executed by the server, for example in the personalization engine, can produce the typed-attributes to be presented to the user by processing the metadata associated with the identified information file, and the other information files that are included in the filtered set of information files presented for the current interest node. One algorithm for performing this analysis includes the following:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"],"b":["60","61","62","63","64"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["70","71","72","73","71","74","75","76","77"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["11","80","81","82","83","84","83"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["11","90","91","92","93","94","95","96"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 4"],"b":["11","150","105","151","152","153","154"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["11","160","161","162","163","164"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["11","170","171","172","173","174"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0115"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"b":["300","301","302","303","304","305","306","307","308","309"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"b":["350","351","352","353","354"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIGS. 3-8"],"b":["360","361","362","363"]},"Technology for open profile personalization for content delivery is provided that enables the users to leverage more sophisticated content analysis than possible and prior art, by surfacing various kinds typed-attributes of the information files and of sets of information files.
