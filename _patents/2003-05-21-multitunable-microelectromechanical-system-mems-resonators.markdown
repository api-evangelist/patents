Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a tunable MEMS resonator and a method for actively tuning a MEMS resonator.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Microelectromechnical systems (MEMS) are miniaturized devices that provide low power consumption, and high frequency and greater sensitivity. MEMS components may be etched from a single material, such as crystal silicon. Prior devices have incorporated the technology of MEMS to resonators.","However, prior MEMS resonators have several limitations. One limitation is that prior MEMS resonators may only have resonant frequency changed in one direction, i.e. an increase the resonant frequency, and do not have the capability to have resonant frequencies both increased and decreased from the natural resonant frequency. In addition, another limitation of prior MEMS resonators is that the bandwidth Q is inadvertently changed and reduced along with the change in resonant frequency. Prior MEMS resonators also have no capability to have the resonant frequency and bandwidth of the resonators independently tuned.","A characteristic problem of MEMS resonators is that resonant frequency and bandwidth, i.e. Q value, which are strongly set by the mechanical properties of the resonators require tuning in real environments. This problem limits the applicability of MEMS resonators.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a MEMS resonator and a method for tuning a MEMS resonator having a capability to increase and decrease the resonant frequency from the natural resonant frequency.","It is a further object to provide a MEMS resonator and a method for tuning a MEMS resonator in which the bandwidth of the resonator may be controlled as the resonant frequency is increased.","It is yet another object to provide a MEMS resonator and a method for tuning a MEMS resonator in which the resonant frequency and bandwidth of the resonator may be independently tuned.","Finally, it is an object of the invention to provide a MEMS resonator and a method for tuning a MEMS resonator in which tuning may be performed in real time or on the fly.","According to a first broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for tuning a vibratory device including a cantilevered resonator comprising the steps of increasing a voltage Vsupplied to the vibratory device to thereby increase the bandwidth of the vibratory device; and keeping the resonant frequency of the vibratory device at substantially that natural frequency of the cantilevered resonator, wherein the vibratory device comprises: a capacitor including a movable plate and a fixed plate spaced from each other, the movable plate being part of the cantilevered resonator; a voltage source connected to the capacitor for providing voltage Vacross the capacitor to produce an attractive force between movable plate and fixed plate; a circuit connecting the voltage source to the capacitor; and a load resistor in said circuit having a resistance Rsatisfying the following equation: \n\n\nwhere: \u03bc is at least 10; \u03c9is the beam constant for the cantilevered resonator; cis the capacitance for the capacitor; and \u03bb, which is the voltage dependent coupling parameter for voltage V, is no more than 0.05.\n","According to a second broad aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for tuning a vibratory device including a cantilevered resonator comprising the steps of: increasing a voltage Vsupplied to the vibratory device to thereby increase the bandwidth of the vibratory device; and simultaneously decreasing the resonant frequency of the vibratory device below the natural frequency of the cantilevered resonator, wherein the vibratory device comprises: a capacitor including a movable plate and a fixed plate spaced from each other, the movable plate being part of the cantilevered resonator; a voltage source connected to the capacitor for providing voltage Vacross the capacitor to produce an attractive force between movable plate and fixed plate; a circuit connecting voltage source to the capacitor; and a load resistor in the circuit having a resistance Rsatisfying the following equation: \n\n\nwhere: \u03bc is no more than 0.1; \u03c9is the beam constant for the cantilevered resonator; cis the capacitance for the capacitor; and \u03bb, which is the voltage dependent coupling parameter for voltage V, is no more than 0.05.\n","According to a third broad aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for tuning a vibratory device including a cantilevered resonator comprising the steps of: increasing a voltage Vsupplied to the vibratory device to thereby increase the bandwidth of the vibratory device; and varying the resonant frequency of the vibratory device by adjusting the self-inductance L of an inducer of the vibratory device, wherein the vibratory device comprises: a capacitor including a movable plate and a fixed plate spaced from each other, the movable plate being part of the cantilevered resonator; a voltage source connected to the capacitor for providing voltage Vacross the capacitor to produce an attractive force between movable plate and fixed plate; a circuit connecting the voltage source to the capacitor, the circuit including the inducer; and a load resistor in the circuit having a resistance Rsatisfying the following equation: \n\n\n\nwhere: \u03bc is no more than 0.1; \u03b4 is no more than 0.1; \u03c9is the beam constant for the cantilevered resonator; cis the capacitance for the capacitor; and \u03bb, which is the voltage dependent coupling parameter for voltage V, is no more than 0.05*\u03bc.\n","Other objects and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.","It is advantageous to define several terms before describing the invention. It should be appreciated that the following definitions are used throughout this application.","Where the definition of terms departs from the commonly used meaning of the term, Applicants intend to utilize the definitions provided below, unless specifically indicated.","For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201cvibratory device\u201d refers to any mechanical structure having at least one mechanical element that is capable of vibrating. A vibratory device may have an electrical component. A preferred vibratory device is a MEMS resonator that includes an RC or LRC based circuit.","For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201cresonator\u201d refers to any mechanical element that is vibrated. A resonator may include a cantilever beam, doubly clamped beams, membranes, comb drives, and simply supported beams.","For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201ccantilevered resonator\u201d refers to any resonator that is cantilevered, i.e. includes one or more projecting structures supported at one end.","For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201cmovable plate\u201d refers to an electrode of a capacitor that moves in a direction towards or away from the other electrode, the fixed plate, of a capacitor when a voltage is applied across the capacitor. Preferably, the movable plate is substantially parallel with the fixed plate of a capacitor.","For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201cfixed plate\u201d refers to an electrode of a capacitor that does not move when a voltage is supplied across a capacitor. Preferably, the fixed plate is substantially parallel with the movable plate of a capacitor.","For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201cbeam constant\u201d is defined by the following equation:\n\n\u03c9\n\nwherein: k is the spring constant of a cantilevered resonator and m is the mass of the cantilevered resonator.\n","For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201cvoltage dependent coupling parameter\u201d or \u03bb is defined by the following equation: \n\n\nwherein: k is the beam constant of the cantilevered resonator of a vibratory device; dis the distance between the movable plate and fixed plate a capacitor of a vibratory device of the present invention; and cis the capacitance of the capacitor.\n","Prior MEMS resonators applied a variable voltage to an electrode at the end of a cantilever beam to alter the vibration frequency of the beam, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,729,075, the entire contents and disclosure of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The device described in the '075 patent uses voltage control to alter the natural resonant frequency of a MEMS so that a higher chosen vibration frequency of the MEMS may be achieved. Prior art devices have the limitation of snapping down electrostatically for large voltage amplitudes. Another limitation is that the prior art devices only change the resonant frequency in one direction (i.e., increase) and do not have the capability to both increase and decrease the resonant frequency in changes from the natural mechanical resonant frequency of the devices. In addition, another limitation is that prior MEMs resonators have no control over bandwidth as the resonant frequency is increased. Prior MEMS resonators have no capability to tune independently the resonant frequency and the bandwidth. Prior MEMS resonators have has no capability to change the resonant frequency in both directions.","A method for tuning MEMS resonators of the present invention overcome these prior limitations by tuning the bandwidth of a MEMS resonator by an increase of more than an order of magnitude, i.e. the MEMS resonator's Q is reduced proportionally with the increase in the bandwidth BW, while the MEMS resonator's resonant frequency is independently tuned up or down by several percent to match a selected vibration frequency.","One advantage of the device of the present invention is the ability to precisely select resonant frequency and bandwidth. Preferably, a method for turning MEMS resonators of the present invention may correct for manufacturing variations in the MEMS resonator, as well as tune MEMS resonators on the \u201cfly\u201d or in real time as needed in by the field applications. Preferably, the tuning on the fly may be accomplished by adjusting to changing circumstances of the MEMS resonator.","A method for turning MEMS resonators of the present invention may provide the ability to tune separately bandwidth and resonant frequency of a MEMS resonator. The capability to tune both separately and on the \u201cfly\u201d is significant. For example, this capability is essential to perform acoustic spectrum analysis and voice recognition where an integrated array of MEMS resonators are to cover individually designated regions of the voice spectrum. This capability of being able to tune both bandwidth and resonant frequency independently increases the applicability of MEMS resonators in various applications.","A method of the present invention provides for making MEMS resonators electrically tunable in resonant frequency and bandwidth. A preferred method may correct for manufacturing variations on the MEMS resonator and may allows for active tuning. A method of the present invention may solve the problem of constructing MEMS resonators that are tunable to increased bandwidth, i.e. lower Q value, and that are tunable in resonant frequency. In addition, A method of the present invention may solve the problem of constructing an array of MEMS resonators that covers a large wide-band frequency spectrum such that each individual resonator is tunable to a particular narrow-band frequency bandwidth and resonant frequency.","A preferred MEMS resonator of the present invention that may have cantilever beams, doubly clamped beams, membranes, comb drives, and simply supported beams that are mechanical resonators in which the mechanical element comprises a movable plate of a capacitor structure that could be used to pull on the mechanical resonator element in a controlled way so as to vary independently the MEMS resonator's resonant frequency and bandwidth.","Generally, a RC or a LRC capacitor-based circuit provides a feedback control system that couples with the dynamics of the mechanical resonator for tuning the bandwidth and resonant frequency response of a cantilevered resonator.
