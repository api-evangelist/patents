Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the claimed subject matter is defined by the appended claims.","Features, functionality, and options of computing devices, such as personal computers, have rapidly advanced as technology provides increased processor speeds, storage capacity, connectivity, and interconnectivity, all at decreased cost. At the same time, software, programs, games, and procedures have similarly rapidly advanced. Additionally, rapid advances have been made in interconnectability and interoperability of computing devices and other devices, such as handheld devices and cell phones. These advances are intended to provide a user with many benefits. However, realization of these benefits may require that a user read and re-read manuals.","When new, a user may or many not take the trouble to read a manual. Manuals are sometimes considered too complex and troublesome to comprehend. As a result, the advances may be unused and the user dissatisfied. A user may benefit from being able to input a selection of an aspect of a computer relevant to a need or question through a user interface associated with the aspect, and then let the computer guide them from there using the same or another user interface of the computer.","Additionally, manuals are sometimes lost, misplaced, or unavailable, such as for example, when traveling. A user may further benefit by being able to obtain assistance directly from the computer of a nature often provided by a comprehensive user manual.","Further, as a result of rapidly advancing computer technology, computing devices are become smaller, more powerful, and cheaper. The advancing computing technology is moving beyond the personal computer and into everyday items and devices, providing embedded technology and connectivity. Almost any thing or item, from buildings to clothing, from telephones to tools, from appliances to cars, from homes to the human body, from personal information devices to a common a coffee mug, can have an embedded electronic device that includes a thin computing device. The embedded electronic device typically improves performance and capacity of a basic functionality of the item, and may connect the item with a network of other items or the Internet. These items with embedded electronic devices may be described using a variety of names, which may not have a bright line distinction between them. Commonly used names include a limited resource computing device, limited capacity computing device, ubiquitous computing device, pervasive computing device, digital appliance, and Internet appliance. Such items may be collectively referred to herein from time-to-time as \u201cpervasive computing,\u201d or a \u201cpervasive computing device\u201d for economy of words and to aid in reading and understanding embodiments disclosed herein.","Pervasive computing provides increased functionality, it often requires increased interaction between a user and a previously dumb device. Pervasive computing devices, such as conventional telephones, cell phones, smart phones, pocket organizers, and personal digital assistants, often present a user with widely varying user interface protocols. This may contribute to user confusion about an aspect of the pervasive computing device they are viewing, such as a particular button. As a result, simply finding appropriate aspects of the device related to a portion of the user manual may be difficult or impossible. Like a computer user, a pervasive computing device user may benefit from interactive assistance.","Rapidly advancing technology may also provide an opportunity for increased interaction between traditionally dumb items and user manuals. Many dumb items have become more complex and sophisticated to meet user demand. For example, simply adjusting an ergonomic chair requires complex instructions and location of knobs placed at odd locations. User manuals have correspondingly become more complex and sometimes confusing. As a result, simply finding appropriate aspects of the item related to a portion of the user manual may be difficult or impossible. A user may benefit from interactive assistance with these traditionally dumb items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["20","20","21","22","23","22","21","23","24","25","26","20","24","24","25","28","29","30","31"]},"A user may enter commands and information into the computing device  through input devices, such as a number of switches and buttons, illustrated as hardware buttons , connected to the system via a suitable interface .

For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.).","The herein described aspects depict different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
