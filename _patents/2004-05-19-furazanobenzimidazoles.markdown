Although a variety of drugs against neoplastic diseases have been developed and techniques are available such as surgery and radiation therapy, there is still a need for alternative and improved methods of treatment of neoplastic diseases.","Autoimmune diseases are associated with abnormal lymphoproliferation as a result of defects in the termination of lymphocyte activation and growth. Often, such diseases are associated with inflammation like rheumatoid arthritis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and the like. The treatment of such diseases is focused on anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs which in numerous cases show severe side effects. Hence, there is a need for alternative drugs with a new mode of action showing less side effects.","Apoptosis is a term used to describe a series of cellular events which occur to bring about programmed cell death. There are various apoptotic pathways, some of which have been characterized, whereas others remain to be elucidated. If the balance between cell division and apoptosis is disturbed, life-threatening diseases including cancer, autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases may occur.","In recent years it has become evident that programmed cell death (apoptosis) is as important to the health of a multicellular organism as cell division. By repeated cell division and differentiation throughout development or tissue repair, surplus or even harmful cells are generated. In order to maintain tissue homeostasis these cells have to be removed or killed. The delicate interplay between cell growth and apoptosis in an organism is mirrored in the complex molecular balance that determines whether an individual cell undergoes division, arrests in the cell cycle or commits to programmed cell death.","Dysregulation of cell proliferation, or lack of appropriate cell death, has wide ranging clinical implications. A number of diseases associated with such dysregulation involve hyperproliferation, inflammation, tissue remodeling and repair. Familiar indications in this category include cancers, restenosis, neointimal hyperplasia, angiogenesis, endometriosis, lymphoproliferative disorders, transplantation related pathologies (graft rejection), polyposis, loss of neural function in the case of tissue remodeling and the like. Such cells may lose the normal regulatory control of cell division, and may also fail to undergo appropriate cell death.","As apoptosis is inhibited or delayed in most types of proliferative, neoplastic diseases, induction of apoptosis is an option for treatment of cancer, especially in cancer types which show resistance to classic chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy (Apoptosis and Cancer Chemotherapy, Hickman and Dive, eds., Blackwell Publishing, 1999). Also in autoimmune and transplantation related diseases and pathologies compounds inducing apoptosis may be used to restore normal cell death processes and therefore can eradicate the symptoms and might cure the diseases. Further applications of compounds inducing apoptosis may be in restenosis, i.e. accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the walls of arteries, and in persistent infections caused by a failure to eradicate bacteria- and virus-infected cells. Furthermore, apoptosis can be induced or re-established in epithelial cells, in endothelial cells, in muscle cells, and in others which have lost contact with extracellular matrix. These cells are potentially able to colonize other organs and therefore can develop into pathologies like neoplasias, endometriosis and the like.","Recently, a patent application was published disclosing a number of structurally related compounds (WO 03\/066629). These compounds are described as being inhibitors of GSK-3 and LCK kinase, but have no relevance in apoptosis and medical conditions connected therewith.","Furazanobenzimidazoles of formula (I) are selectively inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, and can be used for the treatment of neoplastic and autoimmune diseases.

General growth conditions are 37\u00b0 C. and 7.5% CO.","The following mouse cell lines (either EGFP transfected or not) are being used: A20.2J (ATCC: TIB-208), MC57G (ATCC: CRL-2295).","The following human cell lines (either EGFP transfected or not) are being used: HeLa (ATCC: CCL-2), KB (ATCC: CCL-17), MCF7 (ATCC: HTB-22), SK-BR-3 (ATCC: HTB-30), SK-Mel 1 (ATCC: HTB-67), SK-Mel 28 (ATCC: HTB-72), PC-3 (ATCC: CRL-1435), SW 480 (ATCC: CCL-228), NCl-H460 (ATCC: HTB-177), NCl-H1792 (ATCC: CRL-5895), HT1080 (ATCC: CCL-21), Jurkat (ATCC: TIB-152), Ramos (ATCC: CRL-1596), Raji (ATCC: CCL-86), H9 (ATCC: HTB-176), Hut78 (ATCC: TIB-161), K562 (ATCC: CCL 243), HL-60 (ATCC: CCL 240), U-87MG (ATCC: HTB-14), HepG2 (ATCC: HB-8065), U-2 OS (ATCC: HTB-96), Saos-2 (ATCC: HTB-85), U937 (ATCC: CRL 1593), Hs 578T (ATCC: HTB 126), HBL-100 (ATCC: HTB 124), Molt-4 (ATCC: CRL 1582).","All the manipulations are performed under sterile conditions. The assays are being performed in commercially available 96 or 384 well flat bottom clear microtiter plates (Greiner, Germany) respectively, which are suitable for tissue culture techniques. A defined number of EGFP transfected adherent test cells (96 well plates: 10-10, 384 well plates: 1500-2*10) are plated out 24 hours before treatment either in 75 \u03bcl (96 well plates) or 60 \u03bcl (384 well plates) complete medium per well in order to ensure appropriate cell spreading. For this purpose a peristaltic pump (e.g. Multidrop by Thermo-Labsystems, Finland) or another suitable device is used. Cells in suspension are plated out according to the same procedure but 1 h prior to treatment. Between seeding out and treatment or addition of compounds the cells are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. under 7.5% CO. Subsequently, the compounds under investigation are added at defined concentrations (40-80 \u03bcM in either 25 \u03bcl (96 well plates) or 20 \u03bcl (384 well plates) complete medium containing max 4% DMSO) with an appropriate device (e.g. liquid handling system, multi channel pipette etc.) resulting in a final concentration in the test well of 10-20 \u03bcM compound in max 1% DMSO.","Immediately after the addition of the compounds to the cells the zero fluorescence value (t=0 h) is determined by using a fluorescence microplate reader in order to be able to normalize the fluorescence activities. Afterwards, the test plates are further incubated for a total of 48 h at 37\u00b0 C. under 7.5% COand are shortly removed only for the purpose of measurement at 8 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively.","Relative fluorescence activities of EGFP in compound treated test cells in relation to control cells and cells treated with standard drugs are measured by using a BMG Fluostar microplate fluorescence reader equipped with a filter pair for excitation\/emission at 485 nm\/520 nm. The optimum signal to noise ratio is detected by using the time-resolved mode of measurement with a delay of 20 \u03bcs and an integration time over 1 ms. The gain is adjusted in such a way that the control cells produce a fluorescence activity of 90% of the maximum. Kinetics is performed by measuring the relative fluorescence activities at t=0 h, 8 h, 24 h and 48 h. Crude fluorescence activities are individually normalized for different cell numbers and various optical activities of the test compounds\/plate-wells by dividing each value from t=8 h, 24 h and 48 h by the value of t=0 h resulting in E(8), E(24) and E(48) values. Subsequently, the E(x) values are further processed by forming the inverse (Q-value) of the products E(8)*E(24)*E(48) which result in numbers >1 for apoptotic\/necrotic activities of the compounds and numbers <1 for proliferative activities of the compounds. Controls (untreated) show values similar to 1. Compounds producing Q values >2 are being considered relevant in terms of apoptotic\/necrotic activity and are subsequently tested in the secondary screening setup.","All the manipulations are performed under sterile conditions. The assays are being performed in case of adherent cells in commercially available 24 well flat bottom tissue culture plates (Greiner, Germany) and in case of suspension cells in polypropylene tubes (P-tubes) 1.4 ml (Matrix, UK), respectively.","Adherent test cells: 2*10-4*10of EGFP transfected cells in 0.5 ml complete medium are plated out 24 h before treatment. At t=0 the medium is removed and 450 \u03bcl new complete medium is added. Subsequently, 50 \u03bcl complete medium containing the test compound in max. 5% DMSO is added resulting in final concentrations of 20 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM and 0.3 \u03bcM of the test compounds, respectively. After 48 h incubation the cells are harvested and analyzed with fluorescence activated cell scanning device (FACS Calibur\u2122, BD Biosciences) according to standard procedures.","Suspension cells: 10test cells in 450 \u03bcl complete medium are pipetted into P-tubes. 50 \u03bcl complete medium containing the compounds (see adherent cells) is added immediately. After 48 h of incubation the test cells are analyzed directly on a FACSCalibur\u2122.","By monitoring the EGFP fluorescence activity in FL1 on a FACSCalibur\u2122, it is possible to distinguish between proliferating cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells within the same cell population. The proliferating cells show a high GFP fluorescence activity, the apoptotic population shows an intermediate fluorescence activity whereas the necrotic cells demonstrate a residual fluorescence activity comparable to mock-transfected cells. Within the CellQuest Software (BD Biosciences) three regions are defined in the histogram: M1 comprising the proliferating cells, M2 comprising the apoptotic cell population and M3 comprising the necrotic cell population. As readout the relative abundance of the cells belonging either to M1, M2 or M3 are expressed. Compounds inducing M2 values >50% and M3 values <30% are being considered relevant and are further tested and characterized in the tertiary\/advanced screening setup.","A) Hoechst 33342 Nuclear Staining","This assay is performed in 96 well tissue culture plates. Appropriate number of cells (adherent cells: 3-5*10, suspension cells: 8-10*10) are being seeded out in 80 \u03bcl complete medium. Adherent cells are incubated for 24 h for proper spreading out before addition of test compounds while suspension cells are immediately treated with test compounds after seeding out. The test compounds are added in 20 \u03bcl complete medium containing max 5% DMSO. The final compound concentrations in the assays are 10 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM and 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively. After 24 h or 48 h incubation at culture conditions, 10 \u03bcl medium containing Hoechst 33342 dye (Sigma B-2261) at 2-5 \u03bcg\/ml are added to each well. The assay plates are then further incubated for 30 minutes and subsequently analyzed with a standard inverted fluorescence microscope.","The readout allows the determination of the fraction of apoptotic nuclei as well as other morphological criteria specific for apoptosis as a function of the treatment.

The cells (range: 1.5*10-10) are seeded out in 80 \u03bcl complete medium 24 h prior to compound treatment. The test compounds are added in 20 \u03bcl complete medium containing max 5% DMSO. The final compound concentrations in the assays are 10 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM and 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively. The assay plates are incubated for 72 h at culture conditions. The MTS reagent is prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega G1111). 20 \u03bcl MTS reagent are added to each well, the assay plates are quickly spun and incubated for another 3 h at culture conditions. Subsequently, the plates are shortly shaked and absorption measured with a microplate-reader at 492 nm.

The readout allows the detection of a possible direct or indirect influence of the tested compounds on the cell cycle. The following events can occur: a) Generation of a subG1 peak indicative for DNA fragmentation, b) increase of the cell population arrested in G2M phase. Both events are scored by 1 for weak and 2 for strong occurrence. 0 indicates no occurrence at all.

The analysis is performed on a FACSCalibur\u2122 by monitoring the fluorescence activity on FL3. The readout reflects DNA synthesis which is a hallmark for proliferation.","F) Caspase Dependencies","Caspase dependencies are being evaluated by combining the compound treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD or its control peptide zFA (ICN Pharmaceuticals # FK009 and FK029, respectively). Both peptides are being used at 20 \u03bcM concentration. In case of caspase dependencies a clear inhibition of the specific readout in all apoptosis tests should be detected. By comparing the readout of zVAD and zFA treated samples with the compound control it is possible to detect caspase resp. cystein proteinase dependencies. In case of inhibition by ZVAD but not by zFA a clear caspase dependency is obvious. An inhibition by zVAD as well as by zFA points towards the involvement of cystein proteinases In the apoptotic cascade.
