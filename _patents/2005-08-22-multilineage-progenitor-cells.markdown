No. 11\/110,299, filed Apr. 20, 2005, which claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Application No. 60\/564,687, filed on Apr. 23, 2004, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","The invention relates to multi-lineage progenitor cells (MLPC) from human blood and more particularly, to MLPC with the potential to differentiate into multiple tissue lineages and use of such cells for regenerative therapies.","Progenitor cells capable of hematopoietic reconstitution after myeloablative therapy have been identified in a number of sources including the bone marrow, umbilical cord and placental blood, and in the peripheral blood of subjects treated with stem cell-mobilizing doses of granulocyte-colony stimulation factor. These cells, often referred to as hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), are identified by the presence of cell surface glycoproteins such as CD34 and CD133. HSC represent a very small percentage of the total population of cells given as part of a \u2018bone marrow transplant\u2019 and are considered to be the life-saving therapeutic portion of this treatment responsible for the restoration of the blood-forming capacity of patients given myeloablative doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Stem cell therapies via bone marrow transplantation have become a standard treatment for a number of intractable leukemias and genetic blood disorders.","Recent studies have suggested the presence of a more primitive cell population in the bone marrow capable of self-renewal as well as differentiation into a number of different tissue types other than blood cells. These multi-potential cells were discovered as a minor component in the CD34-plastic-adherent cell population of adult bone marrow, and are variously referred to as mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (Pittenger, et al., 284:143-147 (1999)) or multi-potent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) cells (Furcht, L. T., et al., U.S. patent publication 20040107453 A1). MSC cells do not have a single specific identifying marker, but have been shown to be positive for a number of markers, including CD29, CD90, CD105, and CD73, and negative for other markers, including CD14, CD3, and CD34. Various groups have reported to differentiate MSC cells into myocytes, neurons, pancreatic beta-cells, liver cells, bone cells, and connective tissue. Another group (Wernet et al., U.S. patent publication 20020164794 A1) has described an unrestricted somatic stem cell (USSC) with multi-potential capacity that is derived from a CD45\/CD34 population within cord blood.","The invention is based on the identification of a rare undifferentiated cell population from human fetal blood that is capable of self-renewal and has the potential to differentiate into cells representing each of the three embryonic germ layers. These fetal blood-derived cells are referred to as multi-lineage progenitor cells (MLPC). As described herein, fetal blood MLPC are distinguished from bone marrow-derived MSC, HSC, and USSC on the basis of their immunophenotypic characteristics, gene expression profile, morphology, and distinct growth pattern. The invention provides methods for developing monotypic clonal cell lines from individual cells. The invention also provides methods for cryopreserving MLPC (e.g., for cord blood banking) and methods of using MLPC in regenerative therapies.","In one aspect, the invention features a purified population of human fetal blood (e.g., cord blood) MLPC, wherein the MLPC are positive for CD9 and CD45. The MLPC can display a leukocyte morphology. The MLPC can be further positive for SSEA-4 or CD34, as well as CD133, CD41, CD44, CD105, CD29, CD73, CD90, stem cell factor, SSEA-3, and CD13. The MLPC can be negative for CD15, CD38, glycophorin-A, CD2, CD3, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD14, CD4, HLA-DR, CD16, CD33, and CD61. The MLPC can attain a fibroblast-like morphology over time in culture. The MLPC also can adhere to a plastic surface when cultured. The MLPC are capable of differentiating into cells from all three embryonic germ layers, including, for example, cells having an osteocytic phenotype, cells having an adipocytic phenotype, cells having a neural stem cell phenotype, cells having a myocytic phenotype, cells having an endothelial phenotype, cells having a hepatocytic phenotype, and cells having a pancreatic phenotype. The MLPC can include an exogenous nucleic acid (e.g., an exogenous nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide).","In another aspect, the invention features a purified population of human fetal blood (e.g., cord blood) MLPC, wherein the MLPC are positive for CD9, negative for CD45, negative for CD34, and negative for SSEA-4.

The composition further can include a cryopreservative. In one embodiment, the cryopreservative is dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (e.g., 1 to 10% DMSO).

Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used to practice the invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.","Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims.","In general, the invention provides purified populations of MLPC from human fetal blood (e.g., umbilical cord blood (\u201ccord blood\u201d), placental blood, or the blood from a fetus) and clonal MLPC lines derived from individual MLPC. Fetal blood provides a source of cells that is more immature than adult bone marrow and has a higher percentage of cells bearing immature cell surface markers. Consequently, there may be advantages in the expansion and differentiation capacity of the progenitor cells from fetal blood. As described herein, MLPC have immunophenotypic characteristics and a gene expression profile distinct from bone marrow derived MSC's, bone marrow-derived HSC, and umbilical cord blood-derived HSC and USSC. The cells described herein have the capacity to self renew and differentiate into diverse tissue types similar to the bone marrow-derived MSC and MAPC cells. MLPC can be used to develop cellular therapies and establish cryopreserved cell banks for future regenerative medicine procedures. MLPC also can be modified such that the cells can produce one or more polypeptides or other therapeutic compounds of interest.","Cell Separation Compositions","MLPC can be isolated from fetal blood (e.g., cord blood) using the negative selection process and cell separation compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003-0027233-A1. Such cell compositions can include dextran and one or more antibodies against (i.e., that have binding affinity for) a cell surface antigen.","Dextran is a polysaccharide consisting of glucose units linked predominantly in alpha (1 to 6) mode. Dextran can cause stacking of erythrocytes (i.e., rouleau formation) and thereby facilitate the removal of erythroid cells from solution. Antibodies against cell surface antigens can facilitate the removal of blood cells from solution via homotypic agglutination (i.e., agglutination of cells of the same cell type) and\/or heterotypic agglutination (i.e., agglutination of cells of different cell types).","For example, a cell separation composition can include dextran and antibodies against glycophorin A, CD15, and CD9. Cell separation compositions also can contain antibodies against other blood cell surface antigens including, for example, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD72, CD16, CD41a, HLA Class I, HLA-DR, CD29, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD39, CD40, CD43, CD44, CDw49d, CD53, CD54, CD62L, CD63, CD66, CD67, CD81, CD82, CD99, CD100, Leu-13, TPA-1, surface Ig, and combinations thereof. Thus, cell separation compositions can be formulated to selectively agglutinate particular types of blood cells.","Typically, the concentration of anti-glycophorin A antibodies in a cell separation composition ranges from 0.1 to 15 mg\/L (e.g., 0.1 to 10 mg\/L, 1 to 5 mg\/L, or 1 mg\/L). Anti-glycophorin A antibodies can facilitate the removal of red cells from solution by at least two mechanisms. First, anti-glycophorin A antibodies can cause homotypic agglutination of erythrocytes since glycophorin A is the major surface glycoprotein on erythrocytes. In addition, anti-glycophorin A antibodies also can stabilize dextran-mediated rouleau formation. Exemplary monoclonal anti-glycophorin A antibodies include, without limitation, 107FMN (Murine IgG1 isotype), YTH89.1 (Rat IgG2b isotype), 2.2.2.E7 (Murine IgM isotype; BioE, St. Paul, Minn.), and E4 (Murine IgM isotype). See e.g., M. Vanderlaan et al., 20:1353 (1983); Telen M. J. and Bolk, T. A., 27: 309 (1987); and Outram S. et al., 12:651 (1988).","The concentration of anti-CD 15 antibodies in a cell separation composition can range from 0.1 to 15 mg\/L (e.g., 0.1 to 10, 1 to 5, or 1 mg\/L). Anti-CD15 antibodies can cause homotypic agglutination of granulocytes by crosslinking CD15 molecules that are present on the surface of granulocytes. Anti CD15 antibodies also can cause homotypic and heterotypic agglutination of granulocytes with monocytes, NK-cells and B-cells by stimulating expression of adhesion molecules (e.g., L-selectin and beta-2 integrin) on the surface of granulocytes that interact with adhesion molecules on monocytes, NK-cells and B-cells. Heterotypic agglutination of these cell types can facilitate the removal of these cells from solution along with red cell components. Exemplary monoclonal anti-CD15 antibodies include, without limitation, AHN1.1 (Murine IgM isotype), FMC-10 (Murine IgM isotype), BU-28 (Murine IgM isotype), MEM-157 (Murine IgM isotype), MEM-158 (Murine IgM isotype), 324.3.B9 (Murine IgM isotype; BioE, St. Paul, Minn.), and MEM-167 (Murine IgM isotype). See e.g., (1989); (1984); (1995); Solter D. et al., 75:5565 (1978); Kannagi R. et al., 257:14865 (1982); Magnani, J. L. et al., 233:501 (1984); Eggens I. et al., 264:9476 (1989).","The concentration of anti-CD9 antibodies in a cell separation composition can range from 0.1 to 15, 0.1 to 10, 1 to 5, or 1 mg\/L. Anti-CD9 antibodies can cause homotypic agglutination of platelets. Anti-CD9 antibodies also can cause heterotypic agglutination of granulocytes and monocytes via platelets that have adhered to the surface of granulocytes and monocytes. CD9 antibodies can promote the expression of platelet p-selectin (CD62P), CD41\/61, CD31, and CD36, which facilitates the binding of platelets to leukocyte cell surfaces. Thus, anti-CD9 antibodies can promote multiple cell-cell linkages and thereby facilitate agglutination and removal from solution. Exemplary monoclonal anti-CD9 antibodies include, without limitation, MEM-61 (Murine IgG1 isotype), MEM-62 (Murine IgG1 isotype), MEM-192 (Murine IgM isotype), FMC-8 (Murine IgG2a isotype), SN4 (Murine IgG1 isotype), 8.10.E7 (Murine IgM isotype; BioE, St. Paul, Minn.), and BU-16 (Murine IgG2a isotype). See e.g., (1995); (1984); Von dem Bourne A. E. G. Kr. and Moderman P. N. (1989) In (ed. W. Knapp, et al), pp. 989-92, Oxford University Press, Oxford; Jennings, L. K., et al. In , ed. S. F. Schlossmann et al., pp. 1249-51, Oxford University Press, Oxford (1995); Lanza F. et al., 266:10638 (1991); Wright et al., 15:588 (1994); Rubinstein E. et al., 21:10 (1995).","In some embodiments, a cell separation composition contains antibodies against CD41, which can selectively agglutinate platelets. In some embodiments, a cell separation composition contains antibodies against CD3, which can selectively agglutinate T-cells. In some embodiments, a cell separation composition contains antibodies against CD2, which can selectively agglutinate T-cells and NK cells. In some embodiments, a cell separation composition contains antibodies against CD72, which can selectively agglutinate B-cells. In some embodiments, a cell separation composition contains antibodies against CD16, which can selectively agglutinate NK cells and neutrophilic granulocytes. The concentration of each of these antibodies can range from 0.01 to 15 mg\/L. Exemplary anti-CD41 antibodies include, without limitation, PLT-1 (Murine IgM isotype), CN19 (Murine IgGisotype), and 8.7.C3 (Murine IgG1 isotype). Non-limiting examples of anti-CD3 antibodies include OKT3 (Murine IgG), HIT3a (Murine IgG2a isotype), SK7 (Murine IgG) and BC3 (Murine IgG). Non-limiting examples of anti-CD2 antibodies include 7A9 (Murine IgM isotype), T11(Murine IgGisotype), and Leu5b (Murine IgGIsotype). Non-limiting examples of anti-CD72 antibodies include BU-40 (Murine IgGisotype) and BU-41 (Murine IgGisotype). Non-limiting examples of anti-CD16 antibodies include 3G8 (Murine IgG).","As mentioned above, cell separation compositions can be formulated to selectively agglutinate particular blood cells. As an example, a cell separation composition containing antibodies against glycophorin A, CD15, and CD9 can facilitate the agglutination of erythrocytes, granulocytes, NK cells, B cells, and platelets. T cells, NK cells and rare precursor cells such as MLPC then can be recovered from solution. If the formulation also contained an antibody against CD3, T cells also could be agglutinated, and NK cells and rare precursors such as MLPC could be recovered from solution.","Cell separation compositions can contain antibodies against surface antigens of other types of cells (e.g., cell surface proteins of tumor cells). Those of skill in the art can use routine methods to prepare antibodies against cell surface antigens of blood, and other, cells from humans and other mammals, including, for example, non-human primates, rodents (e.g., mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and guinea pigs), swine, bovines, and equines.","Typically, antibodies used in the composition are monoclonal antibodies, which are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular epitope contained within an antigen. Suitable monoclonal antibodies are commercially available, or can be prepared using standard hybridoma technology. In particular, monoclonal antibodies can be obtained by techniques that provide for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture, including the technique described by Kohler, G. et al., 1975, 256:495, the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kosbor et al., 4:72 (1983); Cole et al., 80:2026 (1983)), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., \u201cMonoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy,\u201d Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96 (1983)).","Antibodies can be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, IgD, and any subclass thereof. Antibodies of the IgG and IgM isotypes are particularly useful in cell separation compositions of the invention. Pentameric IgM antibodies contain more antigen binding sites than IgG antibodies and can, in some cases (e.g., anti-glycophorin A and anti-CD15), be particularly useful for cell separation reagents. In other cases (e.g., anti-CD9 antibodies), antibodies of the IgG isotype are particularly useful for stimulating homotypic and\/or heterotypic agglutination.","Antibodies against cell surface antigens can be provided in liquid phase (i.e., soluble). Liquid phase antibodies typically are provided in a cell separation composition at a concentration between about 0.1 and about 15 mg\/l (e.g., between 0.25 to 10, 0.25 to 1, 0.5 to 2, 1 to 2, 4 to 8, 5 to 10 mg\/l).","Antibodies against cell surface antigens also can be provided in association with a solid phase (i.e., substrate-bound). Antibodies against different cell surface antigens can be covalently linked to a solid phase to promote crosslinking of cell surface molecules and activation of cell surface adhesion molecules. The use of substrate-bound antibodies can facilitate cell separation (e.g., by virtue of the mass that the particles contribute to agglutinated cells, or by virtue of properties useful for purification).","In some embodiments, the solid phase with which a substrate-bound antibody is associated is particulate. In some embodiments, an antibody is bound to a latex microparticle such as a paramagnetic bead (e.g., via biotin-avidin linkage, covalent linkage to COO groups on polystyrene beads, or covalent linkage to NHgroups on modified beads). In some embodiments, an antibody is bound to an acid-etched glass particle (e.g., via biotin-avidin linkage). In some embodiments, an antibody is bound to an aggregated polypeptide such as aggregated bovine serum albumin (e.g., via biotin-avidin linkage, or covalent linkage to polypeptide COO groups or NHgroups). In some embodiments, an antibody is covalently linked to a polysaccharide such as high molecular weight (e.g., >1,000,000 M) dextran sulfate. In some embodiments, biotinylated antibodies are linked to avidin particles, creating tetrameric complexes having four antibody molecules per avidin molecule. In some embodiments, antibodies are bound to biotinylated agarose gel particles (One Cell Systems, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A.) via biotin-avidin-biotinylated antibody linkages. Such particles typically are about 300-500 microns in size, and can be created in a sonicating water bath or in a rapidly mixed water bath.","Cell-substrate particles (i.e., particles including cells and substrate-bound antibodies) can sediment from solution as an agglutinate. Cell-substrate particles also can be removed from solution by, for example, an applied magnetic field, as when the particle is a paramagnetic bead. Substrate-bound antibodies typically are provided in a cell separation composition at a concentration between about 0.1 and about 50.0\u00d710particles\/l (e.g., between 0.25 to 10.0\u00d710, 1 to 20.0\u00d710, 2 to 10.0\u00d710, 0.5 to 2\u00d710, 2 to 5\u00d710, 5 to 10\u00d710, and 10 to 30\u00d710particles\/l), where particles refers to solid phase particles having antibodies bound thereto.","Cell separation compositions also can contain divalent cations (e.g., Caand Mg). Divalent cations can be provided, for example, by a balanced salt solution (e.g., Hank's balanced salt solution). Caions reportedly are important for selectin-mediated and integrin-mediated cell-cell adherence.","Cell separation compositions also can contain an anticoagulant such as heparin. Heparin can prevent clotting and non-specific cell loss associated with clotting in a high calcium environment. Heparin also promotes platelet clumping. Clumped platelets can adhere to granulocytes and monocytes and thereby enhance heterotypic agglutination more so than single platelets. Heparin can be supplied as a heparin salt (e.g., sodium heparin, lithium heparin, or potassium heparin).","Populations and Clonal Lines of MLPC","MLPC can be purified from human fetal blood using a cell separation composition described above. As used herein, \u201cpurified\u201d means that at least 90% (e.g., 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99%) of the cells within the population are MLPC. As used herein, \u201cMLPC\u201d refers to fetal blood cells that are positive for CD9 and typically display a constellation of other markers such as CD13, CD73, and CD105. \u201cMLPC population\u201d refers to the primary culture obtained from the human fetal blood and uncloned progeny thereof. \u201cClonal line\u201d refers to a cell line derived from a single cell. As used herein, a \u201ccell line\u201d is a population of cells able to renew themselves for extended periods of times in vitro under appropriate culture conditions. The term \u201cline,\u201d however, does not indicate that the cells can be propagated indefinitely. Rather, clonal lines described herein typically can undergo 75 to 100 doublings before senescing.","Typically, an MLPC population is obtained by contacting a fetal blood sample with a cell separation composition described above and allowing the sample to partition into an agglutinate and a supernatant phase. For example, the sample can be allowed to settle by gravity or by centrifugation. Preferably, MLPC are purified from an umbilical cord blood sample that is less than 48 hours old (e.g., less than 24, 12, 8, or 4 hours post-partum). After agglutination, unagglutinated cells can be recovered from the supernatant phase. For example, cells in the supernatant phase can be recovered by centrifugation then washed with a saline solution and plated on a solid substrate (e.g., a plastic culture device such as a chambered slide or culture flask), using a standard growth medium with 10% serum (e.g., DMEM with 10% serum; RPMI-1640 with 10% serum, or mesenchymal stem cell growth medium with 10% serum (catalog # PT-3001, Cambrex, Walkersville, Md.). MLPC attach to the surface of the solid substrate while other cells, including T cells, NK cells and CD34 HSC, do not and can be removed with washing. The MLPC change from the leukocyte morphology to the fibroblastic morphology between 3 days and 2 weeks post initiation of culture after which the cells enter logarithmic growth phase and will continue growing logarithmically as long as cultures are maintained at cell concentrations of less than about 1.5\u00d710cells\/cm.","Clonal lines can be established by harvesting the MLPC then diluting and re-plating the cells on a multi-well culture plate such that a single cell can be found in a well. Cells can be transferred to a larger culture flask after a concentration of 1 to 5\u00d710cells\/75 cmis reached. Cells can be maintained at a concentration between 1\u00d710and 5\u00d710cells\/75 cmfor logarithmic growth.","MLPC can be assessed for viability, proliferation potential, and longevity using techniques known in the art. For example, viability can be assessed using trypan blue exclusion assays, fluorescein diacetate uptake assays, or propidium iodide uptake assays. Proliferation can be assessed using thymidine uptake assays or MTT cell proliferation assays. Longevity can be assessed by determining the maximum number of population doublings of an extended culture.","MLPC can be immunophenotypically characterized using known techniques. For example, the cell culture medium can be removed from the tissue culture device and the adherent cells washed with a balanced salt solution (e.g., Hank's balanced salt solution) and bovine serum albumin (e.g., 2% BSA). Cells can be incubated with an antibody having binding affinity for a cell surface antigen such as CD9, CD45, CD13, C73, CD105, or any other cell surface antigen. The antibody can be detectably labeled (e.g., fluorescently or enzymatically) or can be detected using a secondary antibody that is detectably labeled. Alternatively, the cell surface antigens on MLPC can be characterized using flow cytometry and fluorescently labeled antibodies.","As described herein, the cell surface antigens present on MLPC can vary, depending on the stage of culture. Early in culture when MLPC display a leukocyte-like morphology, MLPC are positive for CD9 and CD45, SSEA-4 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-4), CD34, as well as CD13, CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, stem cell factor, STRO-1 (a cell surface antigen expressed by bone marrow stromal cells), SSEA-3 (galactosylgloboside), and CD133, and are negative for CD15, CD38, glycophorin A (CD235a), and lineage markers CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD11b, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD33, CD36, CD41, CD61, CD62E, CD72, HLA-DR, and CD102. After transition to the fibroblastic morphology, MLPC remain positive for CD9, CD13, CD29, CD73, CD90, and CD105, and become negative for CD34, CD41, CD45, stem cell factor, STRO-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, and CD133. At all times during in vitro culture, the undifferentiated MLPC are negative for CD15, CD38, glycophorin A (CD235a), and lineage markers CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD11b, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD33, CD36, CD41, CD61, CD62E, CD72, HLA-DR, and CD102.","Bone marrow-derived MSC and MAPC as well as the cord blood-derived USSC have been described as being derived from a CD45\/CD34 cell population. MLPC are distinguished from those cell types as being a CD45+\/CD34+ derived cell. Additionally, the presence and persistence of CD9 on the fetal blood-derived MLPC at all stages of maturation further distinguishes MLPC from MSC and MAPC, which do not possess CD9 as a marker. CD9 is expressed as a marker on human embryonic stem cells. MLPC, which share the hematopoietic markers CD45, CD133, CD90 and CD34 during their leukocyte morphology phase, can be distinguished from HSC by their obligate plastic adherence and the presence of mesenchymal associated markers CD105, CD29, CD73, CD13 and embryonic associated markers SSEA-3 and SSEA-4. Additionally using currently available technology, HSC are unable to be cultured in vitro without further differentiation while MLPC can be expanded for many generations without differentiation. MLPC also differ from MSC and USSC by their more gracile in vitro culture appearance, thread-like cytoplasmic projections and their preference for low density culture conditions for optimal growth.","MLPC also can be characterized based on the expression of one or more genes. Methods for detecting gene expression can include, for example, measuring levels of the mRNA or protein of interest (e.g., by Northern blotting, reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR, microarray analysis, Western blotting, ELISA, or immunohistochemical staining). As described in Example 12, the gene expression profile of MLPC is significantly different than other cell types. Microarray analysis indicated that the MLPC lines have an immature phenotype that differs from the phenotypes of, for example, CD133+ HSC, lineage negative cells (Forrz et al., 22(1):100-108 (2004)), and MSC (catalog #PT-2501, Cambrex, Walkersville; Md., U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,359), which demonstrate a significant degree of commitment down several lineage pathways.","Comparison of the gene expression profile of MLPC and MSC demonstrates MSC are more committed to connective tissue pathways. There are 80 genes up-regulated in MSC, and 152 genes up-regulated in MLPC. In particular, the following genes were up-regulated in MLPC when compared with MSC, i.e., expression was decreased in MSC relative to MLPC: ITGB2, ARHGAP9, CXCR4, INTEGRINB7, PECAM1, PRKCB1, PRKCB3, IL7R, AIF1, CD45_EX10-11, PLCG2, CD37, PRKCB2, TCF21, RNF138, EAAT4, EPHA1, RPLP0, PTTG, SERPINA12, ITGAX, CD24, F11R, RPL4, ICAM1, LMO2, HMGB2, CD38, RPL7A, BMP3, PTHR2, S100B, OSF, SNCA, GRIK1, HTR4, CHRM1, CDKN2D, HNRPA1, IL6R, MUSLAMR, ICAM2, CSK, ITGA6, MMP9, DNMT1, PAK1, IKKB, TFRC_MIDDLE, CHI3L2, ITGA4, FGF20, NBR2, TNFRSF1B, CEBPA3, CDO1, NFKB1, GATA2, PDGFRB, ICSBP1, KCNE3, TNNC1, ITGA2B, CCT8, LEFTA, TH, RPS24, HTR1F, TREM1, CCNB2, SELL, CD34, HMGIY, COX7A2, SELE, TNNT2, SEM2, CHEK1, CLCN5, F5, PRKCQ, ITGAL, NCAM2, ZNF257-MGC12518-ZNF92-ZNF43-ZNF273-FLJ90430, CDK1, RPL6, RPL24, IGHA1-IGHA2_M, PUM2, GJA7, HTR7, PTHR1, MAPK14, MSI21, KCNJ3, CD133, SYP, TFRC5PRIME, TDGF1-TDGF32, FLT3, HPRT, SEMA4D, ITGAM, KIAA01523, ZFP42, SOX20, FLJ21190, CPN2, POU2F2, CASP81, CLDN10, TREM2, TERT, OLIG1, EGR2, CD44_EX3-5, CD33, CNTFR, OPN, COL9A12, ROBO4, HTR1D1, IKKA, KIT, NPPA, PRKCH, FGF4, CD68, NUMB, NRG3, SALL2, NOP5, HNF4G, FIBROMODULIN, CD58, CALB1, GJB5, GJA5, POU5F1, GDF5, POU6F1, CD44_EX16-20, BCAN, PTEN1-PTEN2, AGRIN, ALB, KCNQ4, DPPA5, EPHB2, TGFBR2, and ITGA3.","MLPC express a number of genes associated with \u201csternness,\u201d which refers to the ablility to self-renew undifferentiated and ability to differentiate into a number of different cell types. Genes associated with \u201cstemness\u201d include the genes known to be over-expressed in human human embryonic stem cells, including, for example, POU5F (October 4), TERT, and ZFP42. For example, 65 genes associated with protein synthesis are down-regulated, 18 genes linked with phosphate metabolism are down-regulated, 123 genes regulating proliferation and cell cycling are down-regulated, 12 different gene clusters associated with differentiation surface markers are down-regulated, e.g., genes associated with connective tissue, including integrin alpha-F, laminin and collagen receptor, ASPIC, thrombospondins, endothelium endothelin-1 and -2 precursors, epidermal CRABP-2, and genes associated with adipocytes, including, for example, the leptin receptor, and 80 genes linked to nucleic acid binding and regulation of differentiation are up-regulated. Thus, the immaturity of a population of MLPC can be characterized based on the expression of one or more genes (e.g., one or more of CXCR4, FLT3, TERT, KIT, POU5F, or hematopoietic CD markers such as CD9, CD34, and CD133).","MLPC can be cryopreserved by suspending the cells (e.g. 5\u00d710to 2\u00d710cells\/mL) in a cryopreservative such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, typically 1 to 10%) or in fetal bovine serum, human serum, or human serum albumin in combination with one or more of DMSO, trehalose, and dextran. For example, (1) fetal bovine serum containing 10% DMSO; (2) human serum containing 10% DMSO and 1% Dextran; (3) human serum containing 1% DMSO and 5% trehalose; or (4) 20% human serum albumin, 1% DMSO, and 5% trehalose can be used to cryopreserve MLPC. After adding cryopreservative, the cells can be frozen (e.g., to \u221290\u00b0 C.). In some embodiments, the cells are frozen at a controlled rate (e.g., controlled electronically or by suspending the cells in a bath of 70% ethanol and placed in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen storage tank. When the cells are chilled to \u221290\u00b0 C., they can be placed in the liquid phase of the liquid nitrogen storage tank for long term storage. Cryopreservation can allow for long-term storage of these cells for therapeutic use.","Differentiation of MLPC","MLPC are capable of differentiating into a variety of cells, including cells of each of the three embryonic germ layers (i.e., endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm). As used herein, \u201ccapable of differentiating\u201d means that a given cell, or its progeny, can proceed to a differentiated phenotype under the appropriate culture conditions. For example, MLPC can differentiate into cells having an osteocytic phenotype, cells having an adipocytic phenotype, cells having a neurocytic phenotype, cells having a myocytic phenotype, cells having an endothelial phenotype, cells having a hepatocytic\/pancreatic precursor phenotype (also known as an oval cell) as well as other cell types. Differentiation can be induced using one or more differentiation agents, including without limitation, Ca, an epidermal growth factor (EGF), a platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), a keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a transforming growth factor (TGF), cytokines such as an interleukin, an interferon, or tumor necrosis factor, retinoic acid, transferrin, hormones (e.g., androgen, estrogen, insulin, prolactin, triiodothyronine, hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone), sodium butyrate, TPA, DMSO, NMF (N-methyl formamide), DMF (dimethylformamide), or matrix elements such as collagen, laminin, heparan sulfate).","Determination that an MLPC has differentiated into a particular cell type can be assessed using known methods, including, measuring changes in morphology and cell surface markers (e.g., by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry), examining morphology by light or confocal microscopy, or by measuring changes in gene expression using techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or gene-expression profiling.","For example, MLPC can be induced to differentiate into cells having an osteocytic phenotype using an induction medium (e.g., Osteogenic Differentiation Medium, catalog # PT-3002, from Cambrex) containing dexamethasone, L-glutamine, ascorbate, and \u03b2-glycerophosphate (Jaiswal et al., 64(2):295-312 (1997)). Cells having an osteocytic phenotype contain deposits of calcium crystals, which can be visualized, for example, using Alizarin red stain.","MLPC can be induced to differentiate into cells having an adipocytic phenotype using an induction medium (e.g., Adipogenic Differentiation Medium, catalog # PT-3004, from Cambrex) containing insulin, L-glutamine, dexamethasone, indomethacin, and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine. Cells having an adipocytic phenotype contain lipid filled liposomes that can be visualized with Oil Red stain. Such cells also contain trigycerides, which fluoresce green with Nile Red stain (Fowler and Greenspan, 33:833-836 (1985)).","MLPC can be induced to differentiate into cells having a myocytic phenotype using an induction medium (e.g., SkGM\u2122, catalog # CC-3160, from Cambrex) containing EGF, insulin, Fetuin, dexamethasone, and FGF-basic (Wernet, et al., U.S. patent publication 20020164794 A1). Cells having a myocytic phenotype express fast skeletal muscle myosin and alpha actinin.","MLPC can be induced to differentiate into cells having a neural stem cell phenotype (neurospheres) using an induction medium (e.g., NPMM\u2122\u2014Neural Progenitor Maintenance medium, catalog #CC-3209, from Cambrex) containing human FGF-basic, human EGF, NSF-1, and FGF-4 and a culture device pre-coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin (e.g., from BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, catalog #354688). Once cells have been differentiated into neurospheres, they can be further differentiated into motor neurons with the addition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), astrocytes with the addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), retinoic acid and ciliary neurotrophic factor, and oligodendrocytes with the addition of 3,3\u2032,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). Neurocytic differentiation can be confirmed by the expression of nestin, class III beta-tubulin (tubulin \u03b2-4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and galactocerebroside (GalC). Neurospheres are positive for all such markers while some differentiated cell types are not. Differentiation into oligodendrocytes can be confirmed by positive staining for myelin basic protein (MBP).","MLPC can be induced to differentiate into cells having an endothelial phenotype using an endothelial growth medium (e.g., EGM\u2122-MV, catalog # CC-3125, from Cambrex) containing heparin, bovine brain extract, epithelial growth factor (e.g., human recombinant epithelial growth factor), and hydrocortisone. Endothelial differentiation can be confirmed by expression of E-selectin (CD62E), ICAM-2 (CD102), CD34, and STRO-1.","MLPC can be induced to differentiate into cells having a hepatocyte\/pancreatic precursor cell phenotype using an induction medium (e.g., HCM\u2122\u2014hepatocyte culture medium, catalog # CC-3198, from Cambrex) containing ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone, transferrin, insulin, EGF, hepatocyte growth factor, FGF-basic, fibroblast growth factor-4, and stem cell factor. Liver and pancreas cells share a common progenitor. Hepatocyte differentiation can be confirmed by expression of hepatocyte growth factor and human serum albumin. Pancreatic cell differentiation can be confirmed by production of insulin and pro-insulin.","Modified Populations of MLPC","MLPC can be modified such that the cells can produce one or more polypeptides or other therapeutic compounds of interest. To modify the isolated cells such that a polypeptide or other therapeutic compound of interest is produced, the appropriate exogenous nucleic acid must be delivered to the cells. In some embodiments, the cells are transiently transfected, which indicates that the exogenous nucleic acid is episomal (i.e., not integrated into the chromosomal DNA). In other embodiments, the cells are stably transfected, i.e., the exogenous nucleic acid is integrated into the host cell's chromosomal DNA. The term \u201cexogenous\u201d as used herein with reference to a nucleic acid and a particular cell refers to any nucleic acid that does not originate from that particular cell as found in nature. In addition, the term \u201cexogenous\u201d includes a naturally occurring nucleic acid. For example, a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide that is isolated from a human cell is an exogenous nucleic acid with respect to a second human cell once that nucleic acid is introduced into the second human cell. The exogenous nucleic acid that is delivered typically is part of a vector in which a regulatory element such as a promoter is operably linked to the nucleic acid of interest.","Cells can be engineered using a viral vector such as an adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), retrovirus, lentivirus, vaccinia virus, measles viruses, herpes viruses, or bovine papilloma virus vector. See, Kay et al. (1997) 94:12744-12746 for a review of viral and non-viral vectors. A vector also can be introduced using mechanical means such as liposomal or chemical mediated uptake of the DNA. For example, a vector can be introduced into an MLPC by methods known in the art, including, for example, transfection, transformation, transduction, electroporation, infection, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE dextran, calcium phosphate precipitation, liposomes, LIPOFECTIN\u2122, lysosome fusion, synthetic cationic lipids, use of a gene gun or a DNA vector transporter.","A vector can include a nucleic acid that encodes a selectable marker. Non-limiting examples of selectable markers include puromycin, adenosine deaminase (ADA), aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (neo, G418, APH), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), hygromycin-B-phosphtransferase, thymidine kinase (TK), and xanthin-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (XGPRT). Such markers are useful for selecting stable transformants in culture.","MLPC also can have a targeted gene modification. Homologous recombination methods for introducing targeted gene modifications are known in the art. To create a homologous recombinant MLPC, a homologous recombination vector can be prepared in which a gene of interest is flanked at its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends by gene sequences that are endogenous to the genome of the targeted cell, to allow for homologous recombination to occur between the gene of interest carried by the vector and the endogenous gene in the genome of the targeted cell. The additional flanking nucleic acid sequences are of sufficient length for successful homologous recombination with the endogenous gene in the genome of the targeted cell. Typically, several kilobases of flanking DNA (both at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends) are included in the vector. Methods for constructing homologous recombination vectors and homologous recombinant animals from recombinant stem cells are commonly known in the art (see, e.g., Thomas and Capecchi, 198751:503; Bradley, 19912:823-29; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 90\/11354, WO 91\/01140, and WO 93\/04169.","Methods of Using MLPC","The MLPC can be used in enzyme replacement therapy to treat specific diseases or conditions, including, but not limited to lysosomal storage diseases, such as Tay-Sachs, Niemann-Pick, Fabry's, Gaucher's, Hunter's, and Hurler's syndromes, as well as other gangliosidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, and glycogenoses.","In other embodiments, the cells can be used as carriers in gene therapy to correct inborn errors of metabolism, adrenoleukodystrophy, cystic fibrosis, glycogen storage disease, hypothyroidism, sickle cell anemia, Pearson syndrome, Pompe's disease, phenylketonuria (PKIJ), porphyrias, maple syrup urine disease, homocystinuria, mucoplysaccharide nosis, chronic granulomatous disease and tyrosinemia and Tay-Sachs disease or to treat cancer, tumors or other pathological conditions.","MLPC can be used to repair damage of tissues and organs resulting from disease. In such an embodiment, a patient can be administered a population of MLPC to regenerate or restore tissues or organs which have been damaged as a consequence of disease. For example, a population of MLPC can be administered to a patient to enhance the immune system following chemotherapy or radiation, or to repair heart tissue following myocardial infarction.","The cells also can be used in tissue regeneration or replacement therapies or protocols, including, but not limited to treatment of corneal epithelial defects, cartilage repair, facial dermabrasion, mucosal membranes, tympanic membranes, intestinal linings, neurological structures (e.g., retina, auditory neurons in basilar membrane, olfactory neurons in olfactory epithelium), burn and wound repair for traumatic injuries of the skin, or for reconstruction of other damaged or diseased organs or tissues.","MLPC also can be used in therapeutic transplantation protocols, e.g., to augment or replace stem or progenitor cells of the liver, pancreas, kidney, lung, nervous system, muscular system, bone, bone marrow, thymus, spleen, mucosal tissue, gonads, or hair.","Compositions and Articles of Manufacture","The invention also features compositions and articles of manufacture containing purified populations of MLPC or clonal lines of MLPC. In some embodiments, the purified population of MLPC or clonal line is housed within a container (e.g., a vial or bag). In some embodiments, the clonal lines have undergone at least 3 doublings in culture (e.g., at least 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 doublings). In other embodiments, a culture medium (e.g., MSCGM\u2122 medium) is included in the composition or article of manufacture. In still other embodiments, the composition or article of manufacture can include one or more cryopreservatives or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. For example, a composition can include serum and DMSO, a mixture of serum, DMSO, and trehalose, or a mixture of human serum albumin, DMSO, and trehalose.","Purified populations of MLPC or clonal MLPC lines can be combined with packaging material and sold as a kit. The packaging material included in a kit typically contains instructions or a label describing how the purified populations of MLPC or clonal lines can be grown, differentiated, or used. A label also can indicate that the MLPC have enhanced expression of, for example, CXCR4, FLT3, or CD133 relative to a population of MSC. Components and methods for producing such kits are well known.","An article of manufacture or kit also can include one or more reagents for characterizing a population of MLPC or a clonal MLPC line. For example, a reagent can be a nucleic acid probe or primer for detecting expression of a gene such as CXCR4, FLT3, CD133, CD34, TERT, KIT, POU5F, ICAM2, ITGAX, TFRC, KIT, IL6R, IL7R, ITGAM, FLT3, PDGFRB, SELE, SELL, TFRC, ITGAL, ITGB2, PECAM1, ITGA2B, ITGA3, ITGA4, ITGA6, ICAM1, CD24, CD44, CD45, CD58, CD68, CD33, CD37, or CD38. Such a nucleic acid probe or primer can be labeled, (e.g., fluorescently or with a radioisotope) to facilitate detection. A reagent also can be an antibody having specific binding affinity for a cell surface marker such as CD9, CD45, SSEA-4, CD34, CD13, CD29, CD41, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, stem cell factor, STRO-1, SSEA-3, CD133, CD15, CD38, glycophorin A (CD235a), CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD11b, CD13, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD29, CD33, CD36, CD41, CD61, CD62E, CD72, CD73, CD90, HLA-DR, CD102, or CD105. An antibody can be detectably labeled (e.g., fluorescently or enzymatically).","The invention is further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.","This example describes the general method by which cells were separated using the cell separation reagents described below. Equal volumes of a cell separation reagent (see Table 1) and an acid citrate dextrose (ACD), CPDA (citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine) or heparinized umbilical cord blood sample were combined (25 ml each) in a sterile closed container (e.g., a 50 ml conical tube). Samples containing white blood cell counts greater than 20\u00d710cells\/ml were combined one part blood with two parts cell separation reagent. Tubes were gently mixed on a rocker platform for 20 to 45 minutes at room temperature.

Many cells still exhibit the small round cell morphology that these cells would exhibit in circulation. As culture continues, the leukocyte-like cells start to change their morphology from the leukocyte-like appearance to a flatter, darker more fibroblast-like appearance (see ). When cells are dividing, they round up, divide, and then reattach to the culture vessel surface and spread out again.

Shortly after the initiation of the culture, the cells began to spread and flatten, taking on a morphology consistent with fibroblasts. Eventually, upon confluency, the cells grew in largely parallel orientation.

Cells were harvested as described above and replated at 0.8\u00d710cells per chamber in 4-chamber slides that were pre-coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, catalog #354688) in 0.5 mL of NPMM\u2122 (catalog #CC-3209, Cambrex) containing huFGF-basic, huEGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neural survival factor-1, fibroblast growth factor-4 (20 ng\/mL), and 200 mM GlutaMax I Supplement (catalog #35050-061, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The medium was changed every 2-3 days for 21 days. Neurospheres developed after 4 to 20 days. Transformation of MLPC to neural lineage was confirmed by positive staining for nestin (monoclonal anti-human nestin antibody, MAB1259, clone 196908, R&D Systems), class III beta-tubulin (tubulin b-4) (monoclonal anti-neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin antibody, MAB 1195, Clone TuJ-1, R&D Systems), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (monoclonal anti-human GFAP, HG2b-GF5, clone GF5, Advanced immunochemical, Inc.), and galactocerebroside (GalC) (mouse anti-human GalC monoclonal antibody MAB342, clone mGalC, Chemicon).","Cells were further differentiated into neurons by the addition of 10 ng\/mL BDNF (catalog #B3795, Sigma Chemical Co.) and 10 ng\/mL NT3 (catalog #N1905, Sigma Chemical Co.) to the neural progenitor maintenance medium and further culturing for 10-14 days. Neurospheres were further differentiated into astrocytes by the addition of 10M retinoic acid (catalog #R2625, Sigma Chemical Co.), 10 ng\/mL LIF (catalog #L5158, Sigma Chemical Co.) and 10 ng\/mL CNTF (catalog #C3710, Sigma Chemical Co.) to the neural progenitor maintenance medium and further culturing for 10-14 days. Neurospheres were further differentiated into oligodendrocytes by the addition of 10M T3 (catalog #T5516, Sigma Chemical Co.) to the neural progenitor maintenance medium and further culturing for 10-14 days. Differentiation to oligodendrocytes was confirmed by positive staining for myelin basic protein (MBP) (monoclonal anti-MBP, catalog #ab8764, clone B505, Abcam).","MLPC were plated at 1.9\u00d710cells per well within a 4-chamber slide (2 cm). Cells were fed with 1 ml of endothelial growth medium-microvasculature (EGM\u2122-MV, catalog #CC-3125, Cambrex) containing heparin, bovine brain extract, human recombinant epithelial growth factor and hydrocortisone. The cells were fed by changing the medium every 2-3 days for approximately 21 days. Morphological changes occurred within 7-10 days. Differentiation of MLPC's to endothelial lineage was assessed by staining for CD62E [E-selectin, mouse anti-human CD62E monoclonal antibody, catalog #551145, clone 68-5H11, BD Pharmingen] and CD102 [ICAM-2, monoclonal anti-human ICAM-2, MAB244, clone 86911, R&D Systems], CD34 [BD Pharmingen] and STRO-1 (R&D Systems]. Control MLPC cultures grown in MSCGM for 14 days were negative for CD62E staining and CD102, CD34 and STRO-1, while differentiated cultures were positive for both CD62E, CD102, CD34, and STRO-1.","MLPC were plated at a concentration of 1\u00d710cells\/cmin vitro in HCM\u2122 medium (catalog #CC-3198, Cambrex) containing ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone, transferrin, insulin, huEGF, recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (40 ng\/mL), huFGF-basic (20 ng\/mL), recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-4 (20 ng\/mL), and stem cell factor (40 ng\/mL). Cells were cultured for 29 or more days to induce differentiation to precursor cells of both hepatocytes and pancreatic cells lineage. MLPC changed from a fibroblast morphology to a hepatocyte morphology, expressed cell surface receptors for Hepatocyte Growth Factor, and produced both human serum albumin, a cellular product of hepatocytes, and insulin, a cellular product of pancreatic islet cells, both confirmed by intracellular antibody staining on day 30.","In order to determine the relationship between MLPC and various other cell types at various stages of lineage commitment, the relative expression of 942 genes associated with \u201cstemness\u201d and differentiating capacity was assessed by high definition microarray. The phenotype of MLPC (E8 clone, passage 8, see Example 5) was compared to human umbilical cord mononuclear cells (MNC), PrepaCyte\u00ae-MLPC isolated cord blood cells, CD133+ positively selected cord blood progenitor cells, lineage negative cord blood cells, and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC, Cambrex, Walkersville, Md.). The MNC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation method on Ficoll. Cells were mature terminally differentiated lymphocytes and monocytes with some minor contamination with platelets and granulocytes. The PrepaCyte isolated cells were human umbilical cord blood cells isolated by PrepaCyte-MLPC method. Cells were mainly lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, and MLPC with some minor contamination with monocytes, granulocytes, and platelets. CD133+ selected cells were human umbilical cord blood cells separated by Ficoll density gradient separation then positively selected using anti-CD133 coated paramagnetic particles (Miltenyi). These cells are consistent with hematopoietic stem cells. Lineage Negative cells were isolated from human umbilical cord blood cells by Ficoll density gradient separation then negatively selected by depletion with anti-CD45, anti-CD7, and anti-glycophorin A-coated paramagnetic particles. These cells have been demonstrated to have some multi-lineage differentiating capacity. See, Forrz et al., 22(1):100-108 (2004). MSC were purchased from Cambrex (catalog # PT-2501).","Methods: Total RNA was extracted from each cell population using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). Complementary DNAs (cDNA) were derived from the total RNA samples and the cDNA labeled with Cy3 (MLPC) or Cy5 (other cell types) according to the PIQOR\u2122 Instruction Manual. The labeled samples then were hybridized to the PIQOR\u2122 942 gene Stem Cell Human Antisense Microarray platform (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the PIQOR\u2122 Instruction Manual. Thus, a total of five hybridizations were done: MLPC and PrepaCyte cells (designated hybridization B), MLPC and MNC (designated hybridization C), MLPC and CD133+ selected cells (designated hybridization D), MLPC and MSC (designated hybridization E), and MLPC and LinNeg cells (designated hybridization F). After hybridization, the intensity of the Cy3 and Cy5 labels was assessed on each microarray. Comparative over-expression of genes in MLPC resulted in a green spot, over-expression of genes in the comparative cell group resulted in a red spot. Equal expression resulted in a yellow spot. The ratio of green to red fluorescence allowed the determination of over- or under-expression. Analysis of the microarrays was performed by the Memorec division of Miltenyi Biotec in a blinded analysis.","Genes that did not reach an at least 1.4-fold differential expression in at least one experiment were excluded from further analyses. The resulting dataset included 631 genes that were >1.4 fold up- or down-regulated between MLPC and any one or more of the other five cell groups (see ; shaded text refers to over-expression of the gene in the comparative cell group; bold text refers to over-expression of genes in MLPC; the values represent the ratio of the signal intensity for the comparative cell group to the signal intensity of the MLPC, i.e., for uniq ID 43, signal intensity of B\/signal intensity of MLPC is 0.68). To identify the discriminatory genes, genes were selected that had their maximum expression value in hybridizations B, C, D, E, or F. Genes were removed where the \u2018maximum expression\u2019 was just due to a less pronounced down-regulation relative to the other experiments. The difference between the highest and the second-best expression value was determined for each gene and used as an indicated for its suitability to separate between the different conditions. A corresponding procedure was performed to identify the down-regulated genes most suitable for the discrimination of the different cell populations.","Pathway and signal network analysis delineated numerous biological pathways characterizing MLPCs unique features. During this procedure, each group was screened for significant enrichment of genes belonging to a common pathway or sharing other biological properties.","MLPC vs. PrepaCyte Cells","Sixty-five (65) genes were up-regulated in the PrepaCyte cells relative to the MLPC: PF4-PF4V1, CLDN5, IL7R, CHI3L2, CD38, RBL2, MAD1, INTEGRINB7, CD7, DRD3, HIST1H2AC, PBXIP1, ITGAL, FKHR, CDKN2B, RPL13A, MMRN, KCNQ22, MFHI, BMP6, ABCC8, MUSLAMR, ALCAM, CDKN1B, ANGPT2, RPL24, FLJ10884, ICAM2, FOXG1A-FOXG1B, PLCG1, ERBB2, DAB1, RPL6, RPLP0, MMP21-22-23, RPL4, RPL7A, SMAD2, RPS24, ATM, CDO1, SELE, SELL, GRIK1, VEGFB, KCNQ4, TGFBR1, TFP1, KIAA01523, COL4A5, MAP-2, FAST1, TBX3, PRKCH, HNF4A, SEMA3C, TEAD1, NFKB2, COL4A6, HNF4G, DPPA5, LEFTA, FGF20, OSF, RPSA, and ITGA2B. Among the 65 genes, 8 were annotated as ribosomal subunits (RPLP0 (genno. 19690), RPL6 (genno. 22801), RPS24 (genno. 27255), RPL24 (genno. 28658), RPL13A (genno. 31144), RPL4 (genno. 32719), RPSA (genno. 3929), and RPL7A (genno. 7951). This enrichment may point to an enhancement of protein synthesis relative to the MLPC and also shows that the PrepaCyte cells are a heterogeneous group of cells, many of which are mature.","Fifty-five (55) genes were down-regulated relative to MLPC, including PROX1, DLK1, CRABP1, HNF3G, CSPG21, TIMP2, CD44_EX10-12, ANPEP, ZNF117, IFNGR1, COL4A31, ATF4, LAMB3, ELAVL4, IFNGR2, CTNNA1, CDC25C, S100A11, CRABP2, MMP11, PAFAH1B1, MTHFD2, BRACHYURY, BMPRIA, KCNA4, TUBA, TTR, ACVR2B, KCNJ6, ADH4, VLDLR, GAPD, RACK17, MCAM, HNF3B, TNFR1, JAM2, IL3RA, FGF1, VGR3, ORP150, SNA12, GPC4, KIF4A, TC10-PIGF, RAC1, CYP3A4, THBD, CHEK2, VEGF 1, AMBP, TCF3, KCNQ5, DDX21, and LAPTM4B. Thus, MLPC and PrepaCyte cells have different profiles.","MLPC vs. MNC","MLPC and MNC also have different profiles. One hundred and eight (108) genes were up-regulated in the MNC, including: PROX1, KCNJ15, IL1R2, SNCA, HBZ, F7, MYL4, CDKN2D, BMPR1B, TCF21, RXRA, CLCN5, SOX6, SLC2A1, TAL1, CLCN3, SALL2, POU6F1, IGHA1-IGHA2, MAT1A, EGR2, HDAC2, FGFR3, TREM1, MAP3K3, PRKCZ, PUM2, BMP4, PTEN1-PTEN2, KCNQ3, SYP, CD44_EX8-10, IL4R, ACVRL1, CDC25B, ODC1, SLC16A1, PGH2, EDNRA, TRK-C, CDH5, COL10A1, PIK3CG, NEUROG1, AKT2, ITGA3, CXCR4, DLX2, IL6R, KCNJ1, SLIT-1, IKKA, GDF5, ITGB3, CASP81, FIBROMODULIN, AGRIN, TENASCINX, KIT, CD44_EX7-9, TERT, ZFP42, MS121, ACVR2B, CDC421, POU5F1, CPN2, RARA1, TNFSF4, ROBO4, SEM2, CLDN1, TDGF1-TDGF32, PRKCQ, COL9A12, ELAVL4, EPHB2, ELOVL6, PAK1, SOX20, BRACHYURY, NOTCH1, LRRN1, SEMA4D, ARL8, HGF, PRKCB2, BMP3, WNT10B, BCRP, NKX2-2, FGFR2, HAND1, PLAUR, CSK, PDGFRB, COL18A11, CCNG2, ITGA3-5PRIME, CD45_EX10-11, PTHR1, SEMAL, MAPK3, TNNT2, NBR2, APC3, PTHLH, and HTR6. Table 5 lists the 23 genes identified as belonging to a particular pathway or family (\u201cA\u201d refers to a kinase and \u201cB\u201d refers to phosphate metabolism).","Eighteen genes were identified as belonging to the family of protein kinases (ACVR2B, ACVRL1, BMPR1B, EPHB2, PRKCZ, PRKCQ, MAPK3, AKT2, PPKCB, PAK1, MAP3K3, CSK, KIT, PDGFRB, IKKA, FGFR2, NTRK3, and FGFR3). Five genes (CD45, PIK3CG, PTEN1-PTEN2, CDC25B, and TDGF1-TDGF3) were identified as being involved in phosphate metabolism in general, e.g., as phosphatases. The PIQOR probes PTEN1-PTEN2 or TDGF1-TDGF3 are specific for two different, highly similar genes each. Among these kinases, growth factor receptors like, e.g., FGFR2, FGFR3, PDGFRB, KIT, and NTRK3, and two activin receptors, ACVR2B and ACVRL1 can be found.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0130"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"350pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

and quiescence: down regulation of 65 genes associated with active protein synthesis (i.e.\u2014ribosomal subunits), 18 genes linked with phosphate metabolism (e.g., kinases and phosphatases), 123 genes regulating proliferation and cell cycling (e.g., cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and checkpoint proteins). MLPCs exhibited a very high degree of differentiation multipotentiality as seen in the down-regulation of 12 different clusters of genes associated with differentiation surface marker genes (e.g., epithelium and endothelium) and up-regulation of 80 genes involved in nucleic acid binding and transcription factors that regulate differentiation of tissues from all three germinal layers. Additionally 10 genes associated with maintenance of sternness in embryonic stem cells were overexpressed in MLPC compared to the other cell groups. In particular, MSCs were shown to over-express genes associated with connective and stromal tissue and were strongly committed to that lineage by array analysis.","The karyotype of MLPC (clone UM081704-1 E8, Example 5) was assessed at 20 doublings and >80 doublings and compared with the karyotype of MSC (Cambrex), normal MNC, and the KG-1 cell line, a myeloid leukemia line. MNCs were the reference cell for the other karyotypes. MLPC have a normal karyotype with complete stability through >80 doublings. No deletions, translocations, or suspicious single nucleotide polymorphisms were observed. MSC had deletions and potential epigenic changes after 20 doublings. KG-1 cells, as expected in their role as a positive neoplastic control, had major deletions and substitutions.","While the invention has been described in conjunction with the foregoing detailed description and examples, the foregoing description and examples are intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims.
