The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61\/357,477, filed Jun. 22, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","Many therapeutics used to treat diseases, for example cancer, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, exhibit toxicity or confer undesirable side effects at doses that limit the amount of the therapeutic that can be safely administered and therefore limit the benefit provided by such therapeutics. It would be preferable if such drugs could be administered in a prodrug form that masked the inherent toxicity of the compounds from healthy tissues, and yet released the fully active drug species at the desired site of action. Such a technology would have the potential to increase the therapeutic window of a variety of drugs, possibly allowing them to be used safely at a more efficacious dose, and with reduced incidence of undesired side-effects for the patient. The use of prodrugs to confer improved properties such as increased bioavailability or aqueous solubility is a well established concept in the art of pharmaceutical research.","Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a ubiquitous class of zinc(II)-dependent hydrolytic enzymes that have been associated with a wide range of pathologies including cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and stroke.Clinical trials of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPi) have frequently been hampered by the onset of musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS), which manifests as severe joint pain, and has been attributed to non-specific, systemic inhibition of MMPs and other metalloenzymes.","Provided herein are compositions and methods that address these and other problems in the art.","In a first aspect, a method of treating a disease in a patient in need of such treatment is provided. The method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of an oxidatively-sensitive prodrug to the patient. In an embodiment, the oxidatively-sensitive prodrug includes a drug moiety covalently linked to an oxidatively-sensitive prodrug moiety. In one embodiment, the drug moiety includes a moiety known to be useful for treating the disease for which the prodrug is administered (e.g. the drug moiety is capable of forming a drug known to be useful for treating the disease for which the prodrug is administered).","In a second aspect, a method of inhibiting the activity of a metalloprotein is provided. In one embodiment, the method includes contacting the metalloprotein with a metal binding moiety formed from the reaction of an oxidatively-sensitive prodrug and a reactive oxygen species.","In a third aspect, a compound is provided having the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"195.16mm","wi":"65.87mm","file":"US08889638-20141118-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","1 ","1 ","13B","7B","8B","7B","8B","7B","8B","7B","8B","9B","10B","11B","12B","13B"],"sub":["2","2","3","4","2","2","2","m"]},"R, R, R, R, R, R, and Rare independently hydrogen, halogen, \u2014CN, \u2014OH, \u2014NH, \u2014COOH, \u2014CONH, \u2014NO, \u2014SH, \u2014SOCl, \u2014SOH, \u2014SOH, \u2014SONH, \u2014NHNH, \u2014ONH, \u2014NHC\u2550(O)NHNH, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, peptidyl or peptidomimetic moiety.","Ris independently hydrogen, halogen, \u2014CN, \u2014SR, \u2014SOCl, \u2014SOH, \u2014SOH, \u2014SONRR, \u2014NHNH, \u2014ONRR, \u2014NHC\u2550(O)NHNH, \u2014NHC\u2550(O)NRR, \u2014N(O), \u2014NRR, \u2014C(O)R, \u2014C(O)\u2014OR, C(O)NRR, \u2014OR, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (e.g. methyl), substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, an electron withdrawing group, peptidyl, or peptidomimetic moiety.

The chemical structures and formulae set forth herein are constructed according to the standard rules of chemical valency known in the chemical arts.","Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., \u2014CHO\u2014 is equivalent to \u2014OCH\u2014.","The term \u201cor\u201d as used herein should in general be construed non-exclusively. For example, an embodiment of \u201ca formulation including A or B\u201d would typically present an aspect with a formulation including both A and B. \u201cOr\u201d should, however, be construed to exclude those aspects presented that cannot be combined without contradiction.","The term \u201calkyl,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight (i.e., unbranched) or branched carbon chain (or carbon), or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C-Cmeans one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. An alkoxy is an alkyl attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen linker (\u2014O\u2014).","The term \u201calkylene,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from an alkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, \u2014CHCHCHCH\u2014. Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A \u201clower alkyl\u201d or \u201clower alkylene\u201d is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms. The term \u201calkenylene,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from an alkene.","The term \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atom and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of B, O, N, P, Si, and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized, and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) B, O, N, P, S, and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to: \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014O\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014N(CH)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014S(O)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014S(O)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014O\u2014CH, \u2014Si(CH), \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2550N\u2014OCH, \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014N(CH)\u2014CH, \u2014O\u2014CH, \u2014O\u2014CH\u2014CH, and \u2014CN. Up to two or three heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, \u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014OCHand \u2014CH\u2014O\u2014Si(CH).","Similarly, the term \u201cheteroalkylene,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014 and \u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014CH\u2014. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula \u2014C(O)R\u2032\u2014 represents both \u2014C(O)R\u2032\u2014 and \u2014R\u2032C(O)\u2014. As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)NR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OR\u2032, \u2014SR\u2032, and\/or \u2014SOR\u2032. Where \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 or the like.","The terms \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d and \u201cheterocycloalkyl,\u201d by themselves or in combination with other terms, mean, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of \u201calkyl\u201d and \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. A \u201ccycloalkylene\u201d and a \u201cheterocycloalkylene,\u201d alone or as part of another substituent, means a divalent radical derived from a cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.","The terms \u201chalo\u201d or \u201chalogen,\u201d by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as \u201chaloalkyl\u201d are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term \u201chalo(C-C)alkyl\u201d includes, but is not limited to, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.","The term \u201cacyl\u201d means, unless otherwise stated, \u2014C(O)R where R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.","The term \u201caryl\u201d means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent, which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings) that are fused together (i.e., a fused ring aryl) or linked covalently. A fused ring aryl refers to multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is an aryl ring. The term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain at least one heteroatom such as B, N, O, or S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. Thus, the term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d includes fused ring heteroaryl groups (i.e., multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is a heteroaromatic ring). A 5,6-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 5 members and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. Likewise, a 6,6-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. And a 6,5-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 5 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below. An \u201carylene\u201d and a \u201cheteroarylene,\u201d alone or as part of another substituent, mean a divalent radical derived from an aryl and heteroaryl, respectively.","A fused ring heterocyloalkyl-aryl is an aryl fused to a heterocycloalkyl. A fused ring heterocycloalkyl-heteroaryl is a heteroaryl fused to a heterocycloalkyl. A fused ring heterocycloalkyl-cycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl fused to a cycloalkyl.

Fused ring heterocycloalkyl-aryl, fused ring heterocycloalkyl-heteroaryl, fused ring heterocycloalkyl-cycloalkyl, or fused ring heterocycloalkyl-heterocycloalkyl may each independently be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of the substitutents described herein.","The term \u201coxo,\u201d as used herein, means an oxygen that is double bonded to a carbon atom.","The term \u201calkylsulfonyl,\u201d as used herein, means a moiety having the formula \u2014S(O)\u2014R\u2032, where R\u2032 is an alkyl group as defined above. R\u2032 may have a specified number of carbons (e.g., \u201cC-Calkylsulfonyl\u201d).","Each of the above terms (e.g., \u201calkyl,\u201d \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d \u201caryl,\u201d and \u201cheteroaryl\u201d) includes both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.","Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to, boronic esters, boronic acids, \u2014OR\u2032, \u2550O, \u2550NR\u2032, \u2550N\u2014OR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014SR\u2032, -halogen, \u2014SiR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014C(O)NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033)\u2550NR\u2033\u2033, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033)\u2550NR\u2032\u2033, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NRSOR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014ONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2032C\u2550(O)NR\u2033NR\u2032\u2033R\u2033\u2033, \u2014CN, \u2014NO, peptidyl, and peptidomimetic moiety, in a number ranging from zero to (2 m\u2032+1), where m\u2032 is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R, R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033, and R\u2033\u2033 each preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy, or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033, and R\u2033\u2033 group when more than one of these groups is present. When R\u2032 and R\u2033 are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 includes, but is not limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term \u201calkyl\u201d is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., \u2014CFand \u2014CHCF) and acyl (e.g., \u2014C(O)CH, \u2014C(O)CF, \u2014C(O)CHOCH, and the like).","Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, for example: \u2014OR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014SR\u2032, -halogen, \u2014SiR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014C(O)NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033)\u2550NR\u2033\u2033, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033)\u2550NR\u2032\u2033, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NRSOR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014ONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2032C\u2550(O)NR\u2033NR\u2032\u2033R\u2033\u2033, \u2014CN, \u2014NO, \u2014R\u2032, \u2014N, \u2014CH(Ph), fluoro(C-C)alkoxy, and fluoro(C-C)alkyl, peptidyl, and peptidomimetic moiety, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033, and R\u2033\u2033 are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033, and R\u2033\u2033 groups when more than one of these groups is present.","Two or more substituents may optionally be joined to form aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl groups. Such so-called ring-forming substituents are typically, though not necessarily, found attached to a cyclic base structure. In one embodiment, the ring-forming substituents are attached to adjacent members of the base structure. For example, two ring-forming substituents attached to adjacent members of a cyclic base structure create a fused ring structure. In another embodiment, the ring-forming substituents are attached to a single member of the base structure. For example, two ring-forming substituents attached to a single member of a cyclic base structure create a spirocyclic structure. In yet another embodiment, the ring-forming substituents are attached to non-adjacent members of the base structure.","Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally form a ring of the formula -T-C(O)\u2014(CRR\u2032)\u2014U\u2014, wherein T and U are independently \u2014NR\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, \u2014CRR\u2032\u2014, or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH)\u2014B\u2014, wherein A and B are independently \u2014CRR\u2032\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, \u2014NR\u2014, \u2014S\u2014, \u2014S(O)\u2014, \u2014S(O)\u2014, \u2014S(O)NR\u2032\u2014, or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4.

When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, oxalic, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., \u201cPharmaceutical Salts\u201d, 1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.","Thus, the compounds of the present invention may exist as salts, such as with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The present invention includes such salts. Examples of such salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, methanesulfonates, nitrates, maleates, acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates (e.g., (+)-tartrates, (\u2212)-tartrates, or mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures), succinates, benzoates, and salts with amino acids such as glutamic acid.

A produg includes a prodrug moiety and a drug moiety (e.g. a metal binding moiety such as a zinc binding moiety). A \u201cprodrug moiety,\u201d is a portion of a prodrug that is modified or removed (either partially or wholly) when the prodrug undergoes the chemical reaction (including enzymatic reaction) thereby producing an active drug. The presence of a prodrug moiety is responsible for the inactivity, or reduced activity, of the prodrug. Likewise, the \u201cdrug moiety\u201d is a portion of the prodrug that forms, in combination with a chemical moiety (e.g. \u2014OH, or \u2014NH) produced from the modification or removal of the prodrug moiety, a drug.

As used herein, the term \u201cdrug\u201d, \u201cmedicine\u201d, and \u201cmedication\u201d are interchangeable.","Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.","As used herein, the term \u201csalt\u201d refers to acid or base salts of the compounds used in the methods of the present invention. Illustrative examples of acceptable salts are mineral acid (hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, and the like) salts, organic acid (acetic acid, propionic acid, glutamic acid, citric acid and the like) salts, quaternary ammonium (methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, and the like) salts.","Certain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical or chiral centers) or double bonds; the enantiomers, racemates, diastereomers, tautomers, geometric isomers, stereoisometric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)- or, as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids, and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention do not include those which are known in art to be too unstable to synthesize and\/or isolate. The present invention is meant to include compounds in racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers.","As used herein, the term \u201cisomers\u201d refers to compounds having the same number and kind of atoms, and hence the same molecular weight, but differing in respect to the structural arrangement or configuration of the atoms.","The term \u201ctautomer,\u201d as used herein, refers to one of two or more structural isomers which exist in equilibrium and which are readily converted from one isomeric form to another.","It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that certain compounds of this invention may exist in tautomeric forms, all such tautomeric forms of the compounds being within the scope of the invention.","Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all stereochemical forms of the structure; i.e., the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center. Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention.","Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by C\u2014 or C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention.","The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (H), iodine-125 (I), or carbon-14 (C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.","The symbol \u201c\u201d denotes the point of attachment of a chemical moiety to the remainder of a molecule or chemical formula.","It should be noted that throughout the application that alternatives are written in Markush groups, for example, each amino acid position that contains more than one possible amino acid. It is specifically contemplated that each member of the Markush group should be considered separately, thereby comprising another embodiment, and the Markush group is not to be read as a single unit.","The terms \u201cpeptide,\u201d \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues.","The term \u201cpeptidyl\u201d and \u201cpeptidyl moiety\u201d means a monovalent peptide.","The term \u201camino acid\u201d refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, \u03b3-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an \u03b1-carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid. An oligomer comprising amino acid mimetics is a peptidomimetic. A peptidomimetic moiety is a monovalent peptidomimetic.","Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes.","An amino acid or nucleotide base \u201cposition\u201d is denoted by a number that sequentially identifies each amino acid (or nucleotide base) in the reference sequence based on its position relative to the N-terminus (or 5\u2032-end). Due to deletions, insertions, truncations, fusions, and the like that must be taken into account when determining an optimal alignment, in general the amino acid residue number in a test sequence determined by simply counting from the N-terminus will not necessarily be the same as the number of its corresponding position in the reference sequence. For example, in a case where a variant has a deletion relative to an aligned reference sequence, there will be no amino acid in the variant that corresponds to a position in the reference sequence at the site of deletion. Where there is an insertion in an aligned reference sequence, that insertion will not correspond to a numbered amino acid position in the reference sequence. In the case of truncations or fusions there can be stretches of amino acids in either the reference or aligned sequence that do not correspond to any amino acid in the corresponding sequence.","The terms \u201cnumbered with reference to\u201d or \u201ccorresponding to,\u201d when used in the context of the numbering of a given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence, refers to the numbering of the residues of a specified reference sequence when the given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence is compared to the reference sequence.","A \u201cconservative substitution\u201d as used with respect to amino acids, refers to the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Amino acid substitutions which often preserve the structural and\/or functional properties of the polypeptide in which the substitution is made are known in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R. L. Hill, 1979, in \u201cThe Proteins,\u201d Academic Press, New York. The most commonly occurring exchanges are isoleucine\/valine, tyrosine\/phenylalanine, aspartic acid\/glutamic acid, lysine\/arginine, methionine\/leucine, aspartic acid\/asparagine, glutamic acid\/glutamine, leucine\/isoleucine, methionine\/isoleucine, threonine\/serine, tryptophan\/phenylalanine, tyrosine\/histidine, tyrosine\/tryptophan, glutamine\/arginine, histidine\/asparagine, histidine\/glutamine, lysine\/asparagine, lysine\/glutamine, lysine\/glutamic acid, phenylalanine\/leucine, phenylalanine\/methionine, serine\/alanine, serine\/asparagine, valine\/leucine, and valine\/methionine. The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W); 7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and 8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (see, e.g., Creighton, (1984)). In some embodiments, there may be at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 35, or at least 40 conservative substitutions. In some embodiments, there may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 conservative substitutions.","The term \u201camino acid substitution set\u201d or \u201csubstitution set\u201d refers to a group of amino acid substitutions. A substitution set can have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or more amino acid substitutions.","The term \u201cisolated\u201d refers to a nucleic acid, polynucleotide, polypeptide, protein, or other component that is partially or completely separated from components with which it is normally associated (other proteins, nucleic acids, cells, etc.). In some embodiments, an isolated polypeptide or protein is a recombinant polypeptide or protein.","A nucleic acid (such as a polynucleotide), a polypeptide, or a cell is \u201crecombinant\u201d when it is artificial or engineered, or derived from or contains an artificial or engineered protein or nucleic acid (e.g. non-natural or not wild type). For example, a polynucleotide that is inserted into a vector or any other heterologous location, e.g., in a genome of a recombinant organism, such that it is not associated with nucleotide sequences that normally flank the polynucleotide as it is found in nature is a recombinant polynucleotide. A protein expressed in vitro or in vivo from a recombinant polynucleotide is an example of a recombinant polypeptide. Likewise, a polynucleotide sequence that does not appear in nature, for example a variant of a naturally occurring gene, is recombinant.","\u201cIdentity\u201d or \u201cpercent identity,\u201d in the context of two or more polypeptide sequences, refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues that are the same (e.g., share at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 88% identity, at least about 89%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% identity) over a specified region to a reference sequence, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using a sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection.","Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison and determination of sequence identity can be determined by a sequence comparison algorithm or by visual inspection (see, generally, Ausubel et al., infra). When optimally aligning sequences and determining sequence identity by visual inspection, percent sequence identity is calculated as the number of residues of the test sequence that are identical to the reference sequence divided by the number of non-gap positions and multiplied by 100. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters as known in the art, for example BLAST or BLAST 2.0. For example, comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, 19812:482, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, 197048:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, 198885:2444, or by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.). Thus alignment can be carried out for sequences that have deletions and\/or additions, as well as those that have substitutions, as well as naturally occurring, e.g., polymorphic or allelic variants, and man-made variants.","The phrase \u201csubstantial sequence identity\u201d or \u201csubstantial identity,\u201d in the context of two polypeptide sequences, refers to a sequence that has at least 70% identity to a reference sequence. Percent identity can be any integer from 70% to 100%. Two polypeptide sequences that have 100% sequence identity are said to be \u201cidentical.\u201d A polypeptide sequence is said to have \u201csubstantial sequence identity\u201d to a reference sequence when the sequences have at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% or greater sequence identity as determined using the methods described herein, such as BLAST using standard parameters as described above.","The term \u201cexpression\u201d includes any step involved in the production of the polypeptide including, but not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation, post-translational modification, and secretion.","An amino acid or peptide is \u201cheterologous\u201d to another sequence with which it is operably linked if the two sequences are not associated in nature.","A combinatorial chemical library is a collection of diverse chemical compounds generated by either chemical synthesis or biological synthesis, by combining a number of chemical \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d such as reagents. For example, a linear combinatorial chemical library such as a polypeptide library is formed by combining a set of chemical building blocks (amino acids) in every possible way for a given compound length (i.e., the number of amino acids in a polypeptide compound). Millions of chemical compounds can be synthesized through such combinatorial mixing of chemical building blocks.","Preparation and screening of combinatorial chemical libraries is well known to those of skill in the art.

The entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.","Pharmaceutical compositions provided by the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredient is contained in a therapeutically effective amount, i.e., in an amount effective to achieve its intended purpose. The actual amount effective for a particular application will depend, inter alia, on the condition being treated. When administered in methods to treat a disease, such compositions will contain an amount of active ingredient effective to achieve the desired result, e.g., modulating the activity of a target molecule (e.g. metalloprotein or metalloprotease), and\/or reducing, eliminating, or slowing the progression of disease symptoms. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure herein.","The dosage and frequency (single or multiple doses) administered to a mammal can vary depending upon a variety of factors, for example, whether the mammal suffers from another disease, and its route of administration; size, age, sex, health, body weight, body mass index, and diet of the recipient; nature and extent of symptoms of the disease being treated (e.g., stroke), kind of concurrent treatment, complications from the disease being treated or other health-related problems. Other therapeutic regimens or agents can be used in conjunction with the methods and compounds of Applicants' invention. Adjustment and manipulation of established dosages (e.g., frequency and duration) are well within the ability of those skilled in the art.","For any compound described herein, the therapeutically effective amount can be initially determined from cell culture assays. Target concentrations will be those concentrations of active compound(s) that are capable of achieving the methods described herein, as measured using the methods described herein or known in the art.","As is well known in the art, therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans can also be determined from animal models. For example, a dose for humans can be formulated to achieve a concentration that has been found to be effective in animals. The dosage in humans can be adjusted by monitoring compounds effectiveness and adjusting the dosage upwards or downwards, as described above. Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy in humans based on the methods described above and other methods is well within the capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan.","Dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the compound being employed. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. In one embodiment, the dosage range is 0.001% to 10% w\/v. In another embodiment, the dosage range is 0.1% to 5% w\/v.","Dosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide levels of the administered compound effective for the particular clinical indication being treated. This will provide a therapeutic regimen that is commensurate with the severity of the individual's disease state.","Utilizing the teachings provided herein, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned that does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is effective to treat the clinical symptoms demonstrated by the particular patient. This planning should involve the careful choice of active compound by considering factors such as compound potency, relative bioavailability, patient body weight, presence and severity of adverse side effects, preferred mode of administration and the toxicity profile of the selected agent.","The ratio between toxicity and therapeutic effect for a particular compound is its therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio between LD(the amount of compound lethal in 50% of the population) and ED(the amount of compound effective in 50% of the population). Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. Therapeutic index data obtained from cell culture assays and\/or animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds preferably lies within a range of plasma concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. See, e.g. Fingl et al., In: TPBT, Ch. 1, p. 1, 1975. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition and the particular method in which the compound is used.","The compositions of the present invention can be delivered by transdermally, by a topical route, formulated as applicator sticks, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, gels, creams, ointments, pastes, jellies, paints, powders, and aerosols.","The compositions of the present invention can also be delivered as microspheres for slow release in the body. For example, microspheres can be administered via intradermal injection of drug-containing microspheres, which slowly release subcutaneously (see Rao, 7:623-645, 1995; as biodegradable and injectable gel formulations (see, e.g., Gao 12:857-863, 1995); or, as microspheres for oral administration (see, e.g., Eyles, 49:669-674, 1997). Both transdermal and intradermal routes afford constant delivery for weeks or months.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be provided as a salt and can be formed with many acids, including but not limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic solvents that are the corresponding free base forms.

The formulations for administration will commonly comprise a solution of the compositions of the present invention dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water and Ringer's solution, an isotonic sodium chloride. In addition, sterile fixed oils can conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can likewise be used in the preparation of injectables. These solutions are sterile and generally free of undesirable matter. These formulations may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization techniques. The formulations may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, toxicity adjusting agents, e.g., sodium acetate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium lactate and the like. The concentration of the compositions of the present invention in these formulations can vary widely, and will be selected primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, body weight, and the like, in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected and the patient's needs. For IV administration, the formulation can be a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension.

After 1 h, a 400 \u03bcL, aliquot was collected and filtered through a microcentrifuge filter (30 kDa MWCO, PLTK cellulosic membrane) to remove \u03b2-glucosidase prior to injection on the HPLC. For the full-length inhibitor 8, a 1 mL sample in HEPES buffer at a concentration of 1 mM was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 250 U of \u03b2-glucosidase (1 U\/\u03bcL) for 5 h. A 200 \u03bcL, aliquot was collected every hour and filtered through a microcentrifuge filter prior to injection on the HPLC.","Inhibition Assays.","MMP-9 (catalytic domain, human, recombinant), MMP-8 (catalytic domain, human, recombinant), and the assay kit were purchased from BIOMOL International. The assays were carried out according to the procedure provided with the kit. MMP activity was measured in 96-well plates using a Bio-Tek Flx 800 fluorescent plate reader. The ZBGs and their protected analogs were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) to a concentration of 10 mM for 1-2, 40 mM for 3-4, and 1.25 mM for 5-6. Each well contained 20 \u03bcL, of MMP-9 (0.45 U\/mL), inhibitor (10 \u03bcL, of 1-6), 5 \u03bcL, of \u03b2-glucosidase (1 U\/\u03bcL) when used, and buffer for a total volume of 99 \u03bcL. These were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. A control sample containing just \u03b2-glucosidase (5 \u03bcL at 5 U\/\u03bcL) with MMP-9 (20 \u03bcL) was also prepared to confirm that the \u03b2-glucosidase did not inhibit of MMP-9. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 \u03bcL (400 \u03bcM) of the fluorescent substrate (Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 where Mca=(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-acetyl and Dpa=N-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-\u03b1-\u03b2-diaminopropionyl)) and kinetic activity was measured every minute for 30 min with excitation and emission wavelengths at 335 nm and 405 nm, respectively. Enzyme activity with inhibitor was calculated with respect to the control experiment (no inhibitor present). Measurements were performed in duplicate in two independent experiments.","For Cmpds 7 and 8, 1 mL sample in HEPES buffer at a concentration of 1 mM was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 250 U of \u03b2-glucosidase (1 U\/\u03bcL) for 4 h giving a final concentration of 0.8 mM of the inhibitor. After 4 h, a 200 \u03bcL aliquot was collected and filtered through a microcentrifuge filter. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy was to verify that the concentration of 1,2-HOPO-2 was 0.71\u00b10.2 mM in each of the samples using the extinction coefficient for 1,2-HOPO-2 (7) calculated at 346 nm (4,279.3\u00b1372 M-1 cm-1). Each well was made up with 20 \u03bcL of MMP-9 (0.45 U\/mL), inhibitor (2 \u03bcL, for 7 and 8), and buffer for a total volume of 99 \u03bcL. These were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. For MMP-8 inhibition assays, each of the samples was diluted to 1 \u03bcM in HEPES buffer and 15 \u03bcL of each were added to 20 \u03bcL of MMP-8 (0.092 U\/mL) and buffer for a total of 99 \u03bcL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 \u03bcL (400 \u03bcM) of the fluorescent substrate and kinetic activity was measured every minute for 30 min with excitation and emission wavelengths at 335 nm and 405 nm, respectively. Enzyme activity with inhibitor was calculated with respect to the control experiment (no inhibitor present). A control sample was also performed, in which an aliquot of 250 U of \u03b2-glucosidase (1 U\/\u03bcL) with 1 mL of HEPES buffer was incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0 C., filtered through a microcentrifuge filter, and evaluated in the MMP assay to confirm that no inhibition is observed with \u03b2-glucosidase. Measurements were performed in duplicate in two independent experiments.","IC50 values were obtained for compounds 1-8 against MMP-9 and for compounds 7 and 8 against MMP-8. Serial dilutions of the compounds in DMSO were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes with 20 \u03bcL of the appropriate MMP (0.45 U\/mL for MMP-9 and 0.092 U\/mL for MMP-8) and HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) for a total volume of 99 \u03bcL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 \u03bcL (400 \u03bcM) of the fluorescent substrate and kinetic activity was measured every minute for 20 min with excitation and emission wavelengths at 335 nm and 405 nm, respectively. Enzyme activity with inhibitor was calculated with respect to the control experiment (no inhibitor present). Measurements were performed in duplicate. The percent inhibition is plotted versus the inhibitor concentration. A linear fit of the data for each experiment gives the 1050 value of the inhibitor where y=50%.","Building on the strategy of glycosidic protecting groups, we first focused our attention on the development of glucose-protected non-hydroxamate zinc-binding groups (ZBGs)that can be activated by enzymatic cleavage of the protecting group with \u03b2-glucosidase to release the ZBG and glucose (). The synthesis of the protected ZBGs (2, 4, and 6) was accomplished following a literature procedure used by Orvig and coworkers for enzyme-activated metal-binding chelators (Scheme 1 following).. The ZBG was protected with acetobromo-\u03b1-D-glucose in a 1:1 solution of 1.0 M NaOH and CHClin the presence of (nBu)NBr.

To a solution of the protected ZBG in HEPES buffer was added \u03b2-glucosidase and the change in absorbance was monitored over time. As can be seen in  for compound 2, the absorbance over time shows a decrease at 292 nm while a band at 312 nm emerges, indicative of the deprotected ZBG 1-hydroxy-2-pyridin-2(1H)-one (1). Similar spectra were observed for the hydroxypyrone derivatives 4 and 6 (). In addition, cleavage of the protected ZBGs was confirmed by HPLC analysis (). These studies demonstrate that in aqueous buffer at room temperature, the glucose-protected ZBGs can be readily activated in the presence of \u03b2-glucosidase providing compelling evidence that hydroxypyridinone and hydroxypyrone ZBGs are well suited for the development of enzyme-activated MMP proinhibitors.","Having demonstrated the use of glucose as an effective protecting group for the aforementioned ZBGs, we aimed to incorporate a glucose protecting group into a full-length MMPi (matrix metalloprotease inhibitor) to develop an MMP proinhibitor. We selected the full-length inhibitor 1,2-HOPO-2 (7), a potent non-hydroxamate inhibitor of MMPs that uses a 1-hydroxy-2-pyridin-2(1H)-one (1) ZBG.Synthesis of the MMP proinhibitor was achieved by addition of acetobromo-\u03b1-D-glucose and CsCOto 7 in DMF at room temperature to give 8a in high yields (>80%, Scheme 2). These reaction conditions were a vast improvement in yield over the aqueous reaction conditions used to protect the ZBGs. Surprisingly, these high-yield reaction conditions did not produce the desired products with the ZBGs (1, 3, and 5). The final proinhibitor (8) was obtained by deprotection of the glucose acetate groups with NaOMe in MeOH at 0\u00b0 C. for one hour.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0470","num":"0473"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00061","num":"00061"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00061","he":"142.92mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08889638-20141118-C00061.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The MMP proinhibitor 8 was first evaluated for activation by \u03b2-glucosidase using electronic spectroscopy and HPLC analysis (). Results from these studies indicate that while cleavage of 8 to produce the active MMPi 1,2-HOPO-2 (7) goes to completion, the kinetics of the reaction are noticeably slower than that observed for the protected ZBGs. Complete conversion of 8 to 7 required \u02dc4 h at 37\u00b0 C.; a Kvalue of 210 \u03bcM was determined (). Notably, compound 8 was not cleaved under acidic conditions (0.1 M HCl) over 24 h (). Overall, this is the first example of a glucosidase proinhibitor that can be enzymatically cleaved to yield the active MMPi.","The ability of the protected compounds to inhibit MMP-9 (gelatinase-B) in the presence of \u03b2-glucosidase was evaluated using a fluorescence-based assay.. Compounds 1-8 were evaluated at a concentration close to their reported ICvalues in the presence and absence of \u03b2-glucosidase (). The percent inhibition of MMP-9 with the ZBGs (1, 3, and 5) is close to 50% when tested with and without \u03b2-glucosidase indicating that the presence of low concentrations of \u03b2-glucosidase in the assay has little effect on MMP inhibition. The protected ZBGs (2, 4, and 6) show attenuated inhibition when evaluated without the activating enzyme and complete restoration of inhibition when exposed to \u03b2-glucosidase. Compounds 2, 4, and 6 do show some inhibition of MMP-9 which is likely due to non-specific binding at the high concentrations of the ZBGs (0.125-4 mM) used in these experiments.","In the absence of \u03b2-glucosidase, the complete MMPi 8 (16 \u03bcM) displays very little inhibition of MMP-9, but upon activation, MMP-9 activity is inhibited by 73%, which is essentially identical to an authentic sample of inhibitor 7. Even greater potency was observed against MMP-8, where MMPi 8 could be activated with \u03b2-glucosidase to obtain 33% inhibition at only 150 nM (), representing a >1000-fold increase in activity upon enzymatic activation. The factor of 1000 difference in the quotient IC(ICvalue of proinhibitor in the presence and absence of enzyme) has been reported as an optimal value for the ADEPT approach to targeted therapy,and hence MMPi 8 exceeds this threshold with MMP-8. The higher activity against MMP-8 is consistent with the potency of the cleavage product (7) against this metalloenzyme.The results for 8 show that incorporation of a ZBG protection strategy into an MMPi gives near complete abolition and recovery of inhibitory activity with these enzyme inhibitors.","In summary, there has been demonstrated passivation of an MMPi as a proinhibitor, activation thereof through an enzymatic reaction, and inhibition of MMPs in a controlled manner. We have shown that protection of the metal-binding moiety of MMPi can be achieved and enzymatically removed to release an active, intact MMPi.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0475","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.

Previous studies utilizing fluorescent probes have shown sulfonate esters to be suitable protecting groups of hydroxyl groups that show a turn-on response upon exposure to ROS, including HOand superoxide anion [35-37]. To investigate the use of sulfonate ester protecting groups for the development of ROS-activated proMMPi, a small library of compounds was synthesized. As shown in , sulfonate esters with varying substituents were appended to 1,2-hydroxypyridinone (1,2-HOPO, ZBG-1), 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one (maltol, ZBG-2), 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4(1H)-one (3,4-HOPO, ZBG-3), and tropolone (ZBG-4) to evaluate which protected ZBGs provided efficient activation in the presence of HO. These protected ZBGs (PZBGs) were readily prepared by combining a ZBG with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride in pyridine. In total, 17 PZBGs (1a-e, 2a-d, 3a-d, and 4a-d) were prepared and tested for cleavage in the presence of HO.","To evaluate cleavage of the compounds by ROS, a sample of each PZBG in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) was activated with excess HO(0.9 M, 18 equiv) and the change in absorbance was monitored over time via electronic spectroscopy. Surprisingly, only compounds derived from ZBG-1 (1,2-HOPO) showed a change in absorption (corresponding to the formation of the free ZBG) upon exposure to HO. The fact that only the five PZBG-1 derivatives (out of 17 total combinations) were cleaved in the presence of HOsuggests that the N\u2014O group is important for the observed reactivity.  shows representative absorption spectra of PZBG-1a in the presence of HO. A decrease in absorption at 298 nm over time is noted, representing the disappearance of the PZBG-1a and a gradual increase in absorption at 312 nm is observed, indicating the emergence of ZBG-1. In addition, analytical HPLC was used to confirm that ZBG-1 was the product after reaction with HO(). Upon the addition of HOto PZBG-1a for 60 min, a peak with a retention time of 5.0 min was observed, which is identical to an authentic sample of ZBG-1. Similarly, treatment of PZBG-1b with HOresulted in nearly identical spectra as found with PZBG-1a, while PZBG-1c showed rapid hydrolysis upon the addition of HO(data not shown). It should be noted that the absorption spectra of PZBG-1d was not readily interpreted, due to the overlapping of absorption profiles of the protecting group and the free ZBG; however, thin-layer chromatography showed the emergence of the free ZBG, demonstrating rapid hydrolytic cleavage of the protecting group (even in the absence of HO). These findings taken together prompted the synthesis of PZBG-1e, a more water-soluble alternative to PZBG-1c, with a carboxylic acid attached to the para position of the sulfonate ester. A substantial increase in solubility in buffered solution was noted, and the cleavage behavior was similar to the other compounds reported (see below), making PZBG-1e an attractive candidate for development into a full length proMMPi. As mentioned above, sulfonate ester derivatives of ZBG-2a-d, ZBG-3a-d, and ZBG-4-a-d did not show any change in absorbance over a period of 1 h with an 18 molar excess of HO. These findings suggest that the N\u2014O bond in ZBG-1 is important for facile cleavage of the sulfonate ester group in this series of ligands, although this will require verification by additional studies. It is interesting to note that the compounds tested that did not contain the N\u2014O moiety (those based off of PZBG-2, PZBG-3, and PZBG-4) appeared to be stable in aqueous buffer (over at least a 1 h time period).","One key factor for any prodrug approach is the stability of the protecting group in the absence of the triggering stimuli. In order to test the stability of the sulfonate esters in buffer, absorption spectra for PZBG-1a, b, and e were collected over 24 h. These stability studies showed \u02dc50% cleavage of PZBG-1a and PZBG-1e in 6 h, while PZBG-1b was \u02dc30% cleaved in 24 h. The rates of conversion of PZBG-1a, b, and e were determined by monitoring the change in absorption using pseudo-first order reaction conditions with an excess of HOas previously reported [20]. The calculated rate constants indicate that PZBG-1e had the fastest rate constant at 1.3 Msec, while rate constants of 0.7 Msecand 0.3 Msecwere determined for PZBG-1a and b, respectively. It should be noted that the determined rate constants do take into account background hydrolysis and reactivity with HO; however, all kinetic experiments were taken over a 15-30 min time period, which is before a measurable amount of hydrolysis was observed. Experiments with PZBG-1c and PZBG-1d showed the fastest cleavage kinetics upon exposure to HO, with complete dissociation achieved in <3 min (no rate constants determined). The rates of conversion for the PZBG-1 compounds are consistent with the nature of the respective substituents on the leaving groups. When substituents are varied on an aromatic ring, the change in free energy of activation for a given reaction is proportional to the change in Gibbs free energy, as summarized by the Hammett equation [39]. Of the molecules for which rate constants were obtained, PZBG-1e that contains an electron-withdrawing group (\u2014COH) in the para position, dissociates the fastest. PZBG-1b, on the other hand, with an electron-donating group (\u2014CH) in the para position had the slowest rate of the compounds tested. PZBG-1a, with no substituents had a cleavage rate falling between the others, consistent with the Hammett relationship. The results with PZBG-1c and PZBG-1d are also consistent with this relationship, with the strongly electron withdrawing nitro groups producing the fastest rates, resulting in the inability to acquire precise values.","Development of Full-Length proMMPi.","Having demonstrated the ability of sulfonate esters to act as cleavable protecting groups for ZBG-1, this chelator was incorporated into a full-length proMMPi. The corresponding full-length inhibitor of ZBG-1 with a hydrophobic biphenyl backbone, 1,2-HOPO-2, has been previously prepared and studied [38]. 1,2-HOPO-2 is an effective inhibitor of MMP-3, MMP-8 and MMP-12 with ICvalues under 100 nM [38]. Two full length MMPi (1,2-HOPO-2 and PY-2) were prepared by previously reported procedures and then protected in pyridine with an excess of the appropriate sulfonyl chloride to generate proMMPi PZBG5a, PZBG5b, and PZBG6a. The products were generally purified via silica gel chromatography affording the desired product. The proMMPi PZBG5a and PZBG5b were evaluated for activation by HOvia electronic spectroscopy in the same manner as with the PZBG compounds. As shown in  (Top), the activation of PZBG5a and PZBG5b to the known MMPi 1,2-HOPO-2 is achieved upon the addition of HO.  shows the absorption spectra of PZGB5b in which a decrease at 310 nm over time is observed, indicating the disappearance of the protected MMPi while a gradual increase in absorption at 350 nm is observed, demonstrating the emergence of 1,2-HOPO-2. Pseudo-first order rate constants were determined with an excess of HOas described above. Rate constants of 0.3 Msand 1.1 Mswere obtained for PZBG5a and PZBG5, respectively, which is in good agreement with the rate constants determined for the protected chelators PZBG-1a and PZBG-1e. To evaluate the stability of the sulfonate esters, absorption spectra of PZBG5a and PZBG5 were collected in buffer alone. Compounds PZBG5a and PZBG5 showed \u02dc50% hydrolysis after 9 h and 3 h, respectively.","In order to further confirm that the behavior of the protected chelators (PZBG) was readily translated to a complete proMMPi, a proinhibitor based on PZBG-2a was synthesized. Compound PZBG6a, which contains a biphenyl backbone like PZBG5a, was prepared. Upon cleavage of the protecting group, PZBG6a should produce PY-2, a known inhibitor of several MMPs [38]. Treatment of PZBG6a with excess HOover the course of 60 min did not result in cleavage of the sulfonate ester (Scheme 1), as evidenced by absorption spectroscopy (data not shown). This negative result is consistent with all of the findings described above, showing that the cleavage behavior of the PZBG is retained in its full-length proMMPi.","MMP Inhibition Studies.","To monitor the ability of the protected compounds to inhibit MMP-12 in the presence of HO, a fluorescence-based assay was used [40]. Compounds PZBG-5a, PZBG-5b, and PZBG-6a were tested at concentrations close to the ICvalues of their active parent molecules, 1,2-HOPO-2 and PY-2, against MMP-12. The percent inhibition of proinhibitors PZBG-5a, PZBG-5b, and PZBG-6aat 50 nM were evaluated after 30 min of incubation with and without HO(). Before treatment with HO, PZBG5a and PZBG5 were shown to exhibit \u02dc20% and \u02dc30% inhibition of MMP-12, respectively. This significant level of inhibition is likely due to the hydrolysis of these compounds to the active MMPi during the incubation period, as described in the stability studies above. In addition, the inhibition assays are performed at a higher temperature then our kinetic experiments, which may result in an increase in the rate of hydrolysis and therefore lead to higher inhibition than might otherwise be expected. After treatment with 100 \u03bcM HO, the percent inhibition by proinhibitors PZBG5a and PZBG5 increased to \u02dc30% and \u02dc50% respectively, indicative of activation to 1,2-HOPO-2. Proinhibitor PZBG6a was used as a negative control, and as expected, displayed no significant change in inhibitory activity upon exposure to HO.","In an effort to develop broadly applicable methods to metalloprotein prodrugs, we have focused on developing \u2018proinhibitors\u2019 of the zinc(II)-dependent matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a canonical metalloprotein target of medicinal interest.MMP inhibitors (MMPi), like most metalloprotein inhibitors, generally employ a metal-binding group (MBG), which if blocked abolishes inhibitory activity. Prodrug matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (\u2018proMMPi\u2019) have been developed using enzymatic activation or activation by reactive oxygen species (ROS).The development of ROS-activated proMMPi proved particularly intriguing, because: a) these were the first ROS-activated prodrugs of any kind reported, and b) these proMMPi can simultaneously result in targeted delivery of an MMPi while scavenging tissue-damaging ROS.This \u2018dual mode\u2019 of action is particularly relevant to ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with stroke, where an increase in ROS (e.g. HO) and the concurrent activation of MMPs during the inflammatory response leads to the breakdown of the protective blood-brain barrier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0496","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.

To a 1.0 mL solution at 0.05 mM concentration in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) was added HO(10 uL (0.09 M) in HEPES for compounds B1-B12 and B14-B16, 10 uL (0.9 M) in HEPES for compound B3, and 2.8 uL (0.09 M) in HEPES for compound B13). Spectra were monitored over time at room temperature. Absorption spectra of compounds B17-B21 were taken on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 UV-visible spectrophotometer. To a 1.0 mL solution at 0.05 mM concentration of compounds 1-7 in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH=7.5) was added HO(10 uL, 0.09 M in HEPES) or KO(0.10 mM) with catalase (5 U). Hydrolytic stability was measured by monitoring samples of B19-B21 in HEPES buffer for a 24 h time period. Spectra were monitored over time at room temperature.","Calculation of Rate Constant.","The pseudo-first order rate constant was calculated by monitoring the absorption spectra over time in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide. To a 1.0 mL solution of compounds B1-B3 and B10-B14 in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) at 50 \u03bcM was added HOto final concentrations of 150 \u03bcM, 250 \u03bcM, 500 \u03bcM, 750 \u03bcM, and 900 \u03bcM. Spectra were monitored over 15-30 min at room temperature with at least 50 spectra recorded. The change in absorption at 302 nm for B1-B3, 272 nm for B10, 312 nm for B11, 268 for B12, 306 nm for B13, and 303 nm for B14 were monitored. For compounds B1-B3 and B10-B11, the rate constant (k) was found from monitoring the appearance of the monitored absorption peak by plotting the linear slope of ln [(A\u2212A)\/(A)] vs. time (where A is the absorbance of a 50 \u03bcM sample of the methyl salicylate for B1-B3, maltol for B10, and 1,2-HOPO for B11). For compounds B12-B14 the rate constant (k) was found from monitoring the disappearance of the monitored absorption peak by plotting the linear slope of ln [(A\u2212A)\/(A\u2212A)] vs. time (where Ais the absorbance of a 50 \u03bcM sample of the ZBG and Ais the initial absorbance of B3-B5).The rate of conversion was determined from the slope of the line of kvs. [HO]. The pseudo-first order rate constant was calculated following literature procedure. To a 1.0 mL solution of compounds B19-B21 in HEPES buffer at 50 \u03bcM was added HOto final concentrations of 150 \u03bcM, 250 \u03bcM, 500 \u03bcM, 750 \u03bcM, and 900 \u03bcM. Spectra were monitored over 15-30 min at room temperature with at least 50 spectra recorded. The change in absorption at 292 nm for B19 and 252 nm for B20 and B21 were monitored.

The rate of conversion was determined from the slope of the line of kvs. [HO].","HPLC.","Analytical HPLC was performed on a HP Series 1050 system equipped with a Vydac\u00ae C18 reverse phase column (218 TP, 250\u00d74.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm). Separation was achieved with a flow rate of 1 mL\/min and the following solvents: solvent A is 5% MeOH and 0.1% formic acid in HO and solvent B is 0.1% formic acid in MeOH. Starting with 95% A and 5% B, an isocratic gradient was run for 15 min to a final solvent mixture of 5% A and 95% B, which was held for 5 min before ramping back down to 95% A and 5% B in 2 min and holding for an additional 4 min. Compounds were prepared in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) at a concentration of 1 mM. Retention times of compounds were determined under identical HPLC conditions prior to and after reaction with HO. LC-MS(+) was performed on compounds B6, B15 and B16 to confirm cleavage of the boronic ester to the phenolic moiety.","Inhibition Assays.","MMP-9 (catalytic domain, human, recombinant) and MMP-12 (catalytic domain, human, recombinant) were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. The assays were carried out in 96-well plates using a Bio-Tek Flx 800 plate reader. ICvalues were obtained for proinhibitors B17 and B18 against MMP-9 and MMP-12. Serial dilutions of the compounds dissolved in DMSO were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes with 20 \u03bcL of the appropriate MMP (0.45 U\/mL for MMP-9 and 0.35 U\/mL for MMP-12) in MMP assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM CaCl, 0.10% Brij-35, pH 7.5), for a total volume of 99 pt. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 \u03bcL (400 \u03bcM) of the fluorescent substrate (Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NHwhere Mca=(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-acetyl and Dpa=N-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-\u03b1-\u03b2-diaminopropionyl)) and kinetic activity was measured every minute for 20 min with excitation and emission wavelengths at 335 nm and 405 nm, respectively. Measurements were performed in duplicate. The percent inhibition was plotted versus the inhibitor concentration. A linear fit of the data for each experiment gives the ICvalue of the inhibitor where y=50%.","MMP activity in the presence of HOwas evaluated with both MMP-9 and MMP-12 with 1 h of activation at concentrations close to their ICvalues. Using the calculated rate constants for the protected ZBGs B19 and B20, it was determined that 1 h of activation time for each proinhibitor with 100 \u03bcM HOwill provide enough 1,2-HOPO-2 or PY-2 to inhibit the MMPs at 50%. For example, for proinhibitor B17 with MMP-9, if the rate=k[B17][HO] and k=3.9 Ms, [B17]=10 \u03bcM, and [HO]=100 \u03bcM, the rate of conversion would be 3.9\u00d710M\/s. Therefore, activation for 1 h would release 14 \u03bcM 1,2-HOPO-2, or enough inhibitor to provide approximately 50% inhibition of MMP-9 (ICvalue for 1,2-HOPO-2 against MMP-9 is \u02dc6 \u03bcM).","In each well, 1 \u03bcL of proinhibitors B17 and B18 and the inhibitors 1,2-HOPO-2 and PY-2 in DMSO (1 mM for MMP-9 or 5 \u03bcM for MMP-12) were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. with 10 \u03bcL HO(1 mM in HEPES buffer, pH 7.5) in MMP assay buffer for a total volume of 79 pt. A control sample containing 10 \u03bcL HO(1 mM in HEPES buffer, pH 7.5) in MMP assay buffer was also prepared to confirm that HOdid not inhibit MMP-9 or MMP-12. After activation of the proinhibitors, 20 \u03bcL of the appropriate MMP (0.45 U\/mL for MMP-9 and 0.35 U\/mL for MMP-12) was added and incubated for an additional 30 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 pt (400 \u03bcM) of the fluorescent substrate and kinetic activity was measured every minute for 20 min with excitation and emission wavelengths at 335 nm and 405 nm, respectively. Enzyme activity with inhibitor was calculated with respect to the control experiment (no inhibitor present). Measurements were performed in duplicate in two independent experiments.","In the development of ROS-activated proMMPi, we employed a relatively underutilized self-immolative protecting group with several apparent advantages over previously described systems. The use of self-immolative linkers has become increasingly popular in drug development, molecular sensors, and polymeric delivery systems.Linkers that undergo self-immolative elimination upon removal of the protecting group can release an active species through a 1,6-benzyl elimination (). This reaction is thermodynamically driven by the release of COwhen a carbonate or carbamate ester linkage is employed.However, in the development of proMMPi, it was found that the use of an ether linkage between the activating group and the inhibitor was preferred over the more commonly used carbonate ester linkage (compare compound B1 vs. B2 in ) due to better synthetic accessibility, superior hydrolytic stability, and comparably fast cleavage kinetics. Recently, this ether linkage was utilized in studies on ROS-sensitive luciferase probesand protease-sensitive fluorophores.Nonetheless, there are essentially no studies on the generality and utility of this promising linking strategy. This report investigates the scope of this ether-connected, self-immolative proinhibitor strategy with a variety of functional groups and MBGs.","Here we further investigate the behavior of different activation strategies using related, but distinct self-immolative linkers for coupling to the MBGs. All of the strategies studied here use boronic ester protecting groups that can be selectively removed by HO. A series of methyl salicylate derivatives containing phenol, thiophenol, aniline, and benzylamine leaving groups were investigated using either an ether linkage, a carbonate\/carbamate ester linker, or no linker to the boronic ester protecting group ( and ). In addition, we looked at a variety of MBGs protected with a boronic ester self-immolative leaving group to expand our inventory of MBGs for use in novel metalloprotein prodrugs.","Compounds B1-B3 were designed to release methyl salicylate in the presence of HOusing a self-immolative ether linkage (B1), a carbonate ester linkage (B2), or no self-immolative linker (B3) to directly compare three possible designs of a prodrug scaffold. The syntheses of these compounds are described in Example 3. Compounds B1-B3 were first examined for activation in the presence of HOusing UV-Vis spectroscopy. To a solution of the boronic ester derivative in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) was added HOand the change in absorbance was monitored over time. As shown in  for compound B1, the absorbance over time shows an increase at 302 nm indicative of the emergence of methyl salicylate with a clear isobestic point at 293 nm. Similar results were obtained with compounds B2 and B3. While compounds B1 and B2 achieved >90% cleavage within 45 min using an 18-fold excess of HO(), deprotection of compound B3 required a 180-fold excess of HOto realize cleavage in a comparable time frame. Release of methyl salicylate for all three compounds was confirmed by HPLC ().","The rates of conversion to methyl salicylate were determined by monitoring the change in absorbance under pseudo first-order reaction conditions with an excess of HO. The calculated rate constants are presented in Table 2. Consistent with earlier reports, the carbonate ester derivative B2 displayed the fastest rate of conversion, but B2 also underwent spontaneous hydrolytic cleavage in buffer, whereas compound B1 was stable in buffer over a 4 h period (data not shown). Introduction of the carbonate group into the self-immolative linker of B2 leads to hydrolytic instability facilitated by nucleophilic attack of water at the carbonyl position which is not possible in compound B1.Interestingly, while the hydrolytic stability of B3 was comparable to the ether linkage used in B1, the rate of conversion for B3 was about two orders of magnitude slower than either B1 or B2, suggesting that use of self-immolative linker facilitates conversion to the desired active compound.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0511","num":"0591"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Pseudo first-order rate constants calculated with an excess of HO."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Compound","k (Ms)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"B1","1.12 \u00b1 0.04"]},{"entry":[{},"B2","2.7 \u00b1 0.1"]},{"entry":[{},"B3","0.031 \u00b1 0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"B10","3.1 \u00b1 0.5"]},{"entry":[{},"B11","5.9 \u00b1 0.2"]},{"entry":[{},"B12","3.5 \u00b1 0.3"]},{"entry":[{},"B13","2.9 \u00b1 0.1"]},{"entry":[{},"B14","4.1 \u00b1 0.2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Based on the behavior of compounds B1-B3, the most promising linking strategy is the benzyl ether linkage seen in compound B1. The benzyl ether linkage shows excellent stability in buffer while maintaining rapid cleavage kinetics upon activation. Therefore, we investigated the use of this motif with other leaving groups. Compounds B4-B7 were synthesized to study the effects of using sulfur (B4), aniline (B5-B6), or benzyl amine (B7) leaving groups. Evaluation with UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy of B4-B7 in the presence of HOshowed no cleavage of the protecting group (). Further evaluation with LC-MS showed that the boronic ester of compound 6 was cleaved to the phenol group, but that the cascade reaction did not proceed as expected to release the aniline group (). This may reflect the general robustness of these amine derivatives and their ionization potential.Compounds B8 and B9 were then evaluated to investigate the use of a carbamate ester linkage. Unlike compound B7, the carbamate self-immolative linkers in B8 and B9 showed that the desired benzyl amine is released in the presence of HO, thermodynamically driven by the release of CO(). This suggests that for the release of nitrogen-derived leaving groups, the carbamate linkage may still be preferable for prodrug development.","To validate our observations in the context of MBGs, a series of activatable MBGs (prochelators)were synthesized (compounds B10-B14, ) and evaluated. Compounds B10 and B11 were designed with a boronic acid protecting group to improve water solubility of the protected MBGs.Several other protected MBGs were examined including the oxygen-binding 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4(1H)-one (B12), tropolone (B13), and 8-hydroxyquinoline (B14). Compounds B10-B14 showed rapid cleavage to the desired MBG in the presence of HO, as determined by absorption spectroscopy (Table 2), thus confirming the broader utility of the benzyl ether self-immolative strategy for designing metalloprotein proinhibitors (). Additionally, use of the boronic acid derivative in B10 and B11 shows both improved solubility and an increase in the rate of cleavage when compared to their boronic ester counterparts.The pinacol boronic ester analog of B10 had a rate constant of 2.9 Ms, which is comparable to B10. However; compound B11 showed a notable improvement in rate, increasing from 4.0 Msfor the pinacol boronic ester to 5.9 Msfor B11. This rate approaches that of the reported rate of 6.7 Msfor the carbonate ester-linked boronic ester protected MBG.Compound B15 was synthesized and did not show cleavage in the presence of HO, confirming that this protection strategy is not effective with nitrogen-based MBGs.In the presence of HO, B15 shows similar deprotection of the boronic ester to the phenolic group as B6 and B7, but does not undergo release of the protecting group (). Overall, the results validate our findings that benzyl-ether linkages are best suited for oxygen-based MBGs.","Hydroxamic acid MBGs are the most prevalent metal chelators in metalloprotein inhibitors, including MMPi, yet attempts to develop proMMPi using hydroxamic acid MBGs have not generally been successful.Therefore, compound B16, which is comprised of phenyl hydroxamic acid protected with the boronic-ester self-immolative linker, was synthesized and evaluated. In the presence of HOcompound B16 showed no release of the desired hydroxamic acid ligand. HPLC indicates exposure to HOresults in boronic ester cleavage to a phenol group, but no further cascade reaction occurs to release the hydroxamic acid (vide supra, ).","A thorough investigation of boronic ester prochelators shows that the use of benzyl ether self-immolative linkers provides a superior platform for the development of metalloprotein proinhibitors with oxygen-based leaving groups. These compounds show excellent hydrolytic stability as well as fast rates of cleavage to the active compounds in the presence of HO. The use of boronic acids (instead of esters) results in even faster cleavage and better aqueous solubility with no loss in hydroylic stability. These findings are significant in the development of triggered metalloprotein proinhibitors, HO-activated prodrugs.\n\n","A promising strategy in MMPi is through the development of MMP prodrugs or \u2018proinhibitors\u2019 that offer the ability to selectively control inhibitory activity. Metalloenzyme inhibitors such as MMPi are particularly suitable to the proinhibitor approach because such compounds generally contain a metal-binding group that can be blocked, which strongly attenuates their inhibitory activity. In the presence of the appropriate stimuli, the protecting group can be removed from the metal-binding group to release the MMPi at the site of activation, and thereby avoiding systemic inhibition of MMPs (which are necessary for normal physiological processes). However, metalloenzyme proinhibitors have not been widely investigated, especially in the case of MMP proinhibitors. MMP proinhibitors are shown to be activated by HOfor use as protective therapeutics following ischemia and reperfusion injury during stroke (). As described below, the proinhibitors reported can protect the blood brain barrier (BBB) in two ways, taking advantage of both the triggering mechanism and the resulting MMPi. First, the proinhibitors will consume damaging ROS (e.g. HO), which would otherwise directly attack the BBB and also activate pathogenic MMPs. Second, the resulting active MMPi serves to inhibit any remaining MMP activity that might damage the BBB. Thus, this unprecedented class of proinhibitors has a dual mode of action: reducing the amount of ROS available to activate MMPs, while also generating an active MMPi.","Two MMPi, the pyridinone-based molecule 1,2-HOPO-2 and the pyrone-based molecule PY-2, were selected for this study. Both compounds are potent, semi-selective MMPi that have been previously described. The hydroxyl group of the zinc-binding group (ZBG) of each inhibitor was protected with a self-immolative protecting group containing a boronic ester as the ROS-sensitive trigger (). In the presence of HO, the boronic ester is cleaved by nucleophilic attack of HO, facilitating a spontaneous reaction to release the active MMPi through a 1,6-benzyl elimination (). Boronic esters as HO-reactive protecting groups has been well documented in the literature for HO-activated fluorophores and in the generation of triggered Fe(III) and Cu(II) chelates.","The ROS-triggered self-immolative protecting group can be attached to the MMPi by using either an ether (B19, B20) or carbonate ester (B21) linkage at the hydroxyl group of the ZBG (). To determine which linker strategy provided the best overall approach, both the cleavage kinetics and solution stability of protected B19, B20, B21 were examined. The ability of these compounds to be activated by HOwas evaluated by using electronic spectroscopy. A sample of each compound in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) was activated with an excess (18 equiv) of HOand the change in absorbance was monitored over time. In all cases, the spectra of the protected ZBG compounds decreased over time while the spectra of the free ZBG appeared, demonstrating the expected cleavage reaction. To confirm that the boronic ester moiety was necessary for HOcleavage, the ZBGs were prepared with benzyl protecting groups without the boronic ester. For these compounds, no change in absorbance was observed over time in the presence of HO. Additionally, the selectivity of the boronic ester towards HOwas confirmed by examining cleavage in the presence of KOand catalase. As expected, the superoxide anion was unable to activate the protected ZBGs.","The rates of conversion of compounds B19-B21 their respective activated ZBGs were then determined by monitoring the change in absorption using pseudo-first order reaction conditions with an excess of HO. The calculated rate constants indicated that the carbonate ester linkage in compound B21 provided the fastest conversion with a rate constant of 6.7 Ms, while rate constants of 4.0 Msand 2.9 Mswere found for compounds B19 and B20, respectively. Upon examination of the solution stability of these compounds, B19 and B20 were stable in buffer over a 24 h time period, while B21 showed >50% hydrolysis. Although the use of carbonate and carbamate ester linkages in self-immolative systems are more common (due to the additional thermodynamic driving force from the release of COin the cascade reaction).","After establishing a strategy for the addition of HOactivated protecting groups to the appropriate ZBGs, the full-length inhibitors 1,2-HOPO-2 and PY-2 were protected with 4-bromomethylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester in the presence of KCOin DMF to yield compounds B17 and B18, respectively. Activation of B17 and B18 by HOto release 1,2-HOPO-2 and PY-2 was confirmed by absorption spectroscopy. Similar spectra were obtained under the same reaction conditions as those used for compounds B19 and B20 indicating that the cleavage rates for the proinhibitors B17 and B18 would have comparable rate constants. The ICvalues of the proinhibitors B17 and B18 against MMP-9 were found to be greater than 1 mM, representing a >100 fold-increase than the active inhibitor (). When B17 and B18 were tested against MMP-12, their ICvalues were found to be in the micromolar range (), which was again >100-fold less effective than their activated counterparts. Both sets of experiments show that when the ZBG of the inhibitor is protected, the ability of the compounds to inhibit MMPs is severely attenuated.","Having established that proinhibitors B17 and B18 could be effectively protected and activated in the presence of HO, the ability of these compounds to inhibit MMPs after activation was evaluated. Using a fluorescence-based assay, compounds B17 and B18 were tested with MMP-9 and MMP-12 in the presence of HOat concentrations close to their reported ICvalues. MMP-9 is considered a high-value MMP target in the context of ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with stroke. The percent inhibition of proinhibitors B17 and B18 were evaluated after one hour of activation with and without HO. As expected, when there is no hydrogen peroxide present, there is little inhibition observed for the proinhibitors (). However, after activation with 100 \u03bcM HO, the percent inhibition observed for B17 was similar to that observed for the active inhibitor 1,2-HOPO-2. Assuming that the rate constants found for the cleavage of B19 and B20 are essentially the same when incorporated into B17 and B18, then the 50% inhibition observed is consistent with the calculated amount of active inhibitor present when exposed to 100 \u03bcM HOfor 1 h.","The proinhibitors introduced in this work demonstrate an effective means to passivate MMPi and activate them in the presence of HO. Through addition of a boronic ester protecting group to the metal-binding moiety of MMPi via a self-immolative linker, proinhibitors based on two different ZBGs were developed. These compounds were found to be sufficiently stable in buffer and were found to have high rates of cleavage allowing for efficient activation with HO. These compounds should display a dual mode of action in the prevention of reperfusion injury, by neutralizing ROS and generating an active MMPi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a HOactivated prodrug which offers a novel way to provide both spatial and temporal control over MMP inhibition for use in reperfusion injury.\n\n","It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.
