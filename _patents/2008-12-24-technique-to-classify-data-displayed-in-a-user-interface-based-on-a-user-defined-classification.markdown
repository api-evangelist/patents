{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention generally relates to the field of generating user interfaces. More particularly, the invention relates to classifying data displayed in a user interface based on a user defined classification.","Due to the large volume of the content available in information systems these days, there is a need to display the content to end users in a structured and intuitive way. For example, the information on a news website has to be classified before it can be displayed to the user. So, the news regarding software companies may appear under the category \u201cNews\u2192Industry News By Industry\u2192Infotech\u2192Software\u201d in a particular news website. In another news website, it may be classified as \u201cNews\u2192Technology\u2192Software\u201d. Such classifications however may not agree with a user's own preferences or interests. Therefore, it may be time consuming for the user to find the news of his interest in different websites.","While content classification is an important tool to manage complexity, very often it can become the source of further complexity to the end user. Consider another situation, wherein a company portal containing organizational information is migrated from one version to another or is frequently updated causing the information to be moved from one category to another. This causes inconvenience to the employees as they have to search for the information. The paucity of time available to employees does not allow them to spend time learning the content classification mechanism to use it effectively. As a result, inefficiency in information dissemination and productivity losses occur.","Personalization features available in the current user interfaces is typically limited to features such as changing the position of the user interface elements, changing the colors of the user interface elements, changing the font of the text and changing a type of the charts displayed. Basically, the personalization feature is just limited to the features that are provided by the user interface itself and cannot accommodate all preferences of a user.","Described are methods and systems for classifying data displayed in a user interface based on a user defined classification and generating the user interface to display the data based on the user defined classification. The method includes importing a folder structure from a folder structure container wherein the folder structure depicts a user defined classification of the data including any new user interface objects for displaying the data according to user preferences. The data displayed in the user interface is mapped to the folder structure, the user interface object in the user interface is created for the folder and the mapped data is presented in the user interface object.","The system includes a folder structure container having a folder structure depicting the user defined classification. An importing tool imports the folder structure and provides the folder structure to a mapping tool. The mapping tool extracts data objects containing the data displayed in the user interface and provides them to the user. The user may map the data objects to a folder in the folder structure and regenerate the user interface to display the mapped data according to the folder structure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","110","115","100","120"]},"The user may find it tedious or time consuming to navigate through three levels of tabs to find the news that is of interest to him. For example, to read the news under \u201cAuto\u201d category, the user has to navigate through all the three levels of tabs as follows: \u201cNews (first level tab )\u2192News By Industry (second level tab )\u2192Auto (third level tab )\u201d. The user may be interested in reading the news  quite often. So, the user may prefer to obtain it with as less navigation as possible. In order to do the above, the user may want to reclassify the news displayed in the web page  so as to read the news that is of interest to him in an easier way.","In an embodiment, the user may reclassify the information by creating bookmarks or links, for example, in the \u201cFavorites\u201d folder of a web browser. The user may create a link such as \u201cAuto\u201d in the \u201cFavorites\u201d folder and link to a uniform resource locator (URL) of the auto news presented in \u201cNews\u2192News By Industry\u2192Auto\u201d category in web page . But the problem with this type of classification is that the \u201cAuto\u201d link would be available only in the system in which the link is created.","In another embodiment, the user could use a personalization feature in the user interface to organize the information. But, the personalization feature in the user interface is typically limited to features such as changing the position of tab controls, changing the color of tab controls, adding more tabs in the user interface by choosing from a list of tabs provided by the personalization feature, changing the font of the information, changing tab controls to tree control and changing the layout of the user interface. So the personalization feature may not allow the user to present the information displayed under a tab control in another tab control of his choice. For example, the personalization feature does not allow the user to present the news  displayed in \u201cNews\u2192News By Industry\u2192Auto\u201d tab control in new tabs \u201cMy News\u2192Auto\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","205","205","205","100","205"]},"The mapping tool  displays the classification of the web page  according to a source classification  and folders from the folder structure  depicting the user classification . In an embodiment, the mapping tool  obtains source classification  by reading a user interface metadata file, for example, an extensible markup language (XML) file having the details of user interface objects of the web page . The user may map the classification from source classification  to the folders in user classification  using a \u201cMap To\u201d  button. The user may remove the mapping using the \u201cUnmap\u201d  button. In the mapping tool , the \u201cNews By Industry\u201d classification from source classification  is mapped to \u201cMy News\u201d folder in the user classification  as depicted by the mapping . The mapping  causes the news  displayed under \u201cNews\u2192News By Industry\u201d category in the web page  to now be displayed under the \u201cMy News\u201d section of the user classification  in a newly generated web page. Similarly, the \u201cNews\u2192News By Industry\u2192Auto\u201d classification is mapped to \u201cMy News\u2192Auto\u201d, \u201cNews\u2192Economy\u201d to \u201cMyNews\u2192Economy\u201d, \u201cNews\u2192Economy\u2192Foregin Trade\u201d to \u201cMyNews\u201d, and \u201cNews\u2192Infotech\u201d, \u201cNews\u2192Infotech\u2192Hardware\u201d, and \u201cNews\u2192Infotech\u2192Hardware\u201d to \u201cTech News\u201d.","The source classification  has corresponding data objects provided by an application associated with the web page . The data objects contain the data to be displayed in the user interface. For example, \u201cNews\u2192News By Industry\u201d category has a corresponding data object news.newsByIndustry that contains the data, news . The data object is obtained by accessing an application programming interface of the application.","In one embodiment, when the folder structure  is imported in to the mapping tool , corresponding data objects are created for the mapped folders in the folder structure  to provide the data to be displayed in the reconfigured web page. After the data objects are created, the mapping is executed in the application by mapping the data object of a classification in the source classification  to the data object of the folder in user classification . For example, in the mapping , news.newsByIndustry data object is mapped to the newly created \u201cMy News\u201d data object. The tab objects in the user interface obtain the data to be displayed in the user interface from the data objects. Obtaining news  from a URL is not always reliable because, if the classification of news  in the user interface changes, the URL of the news  also changes. For example, if the original URL of news  under classification \u201cNews\u2192News By Industry\u201d is \u201chttp:\/\/timesofworld.com\/news\/newsbyindustry\/index.html\u201d and the classification changes to \u201cNews\u2192World\u2192News By Industry\u201d, the URL may also change to \u201chttp:\/\/timesofworld.com\/world\/news\/newsbyindustry\/index.html\u201d. This makes the original URL obsolete. This problem can be eliminated by obtaining the data from the data object instead of the URL.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","220","315","320","305","310","220","305","310","220","315","320","220","310","315","220","310","210","220"]},"A user interface object is created for the mapped folders in the user classification . For example, the tab \u201cMy News\u201d  is created for the folder \u201cMy News\u201d. The user interface object represents the user defined classification in \u201cMy News\u201d web page . The user interface object has the name of the folder it is created for.","Because of the mapping , the tab \u201cMy News\u201d  displays news  same as news  since \u201cNews By Industry\u201d in source classification  is mapped to \u201cMy News\u201d folder in user classification . The tab \u201cMy News\u201d  obtains the news  from the data object \u201cMy News\u201d. The tabs \u201cMy News\u2192Economy\u201d and \u201cMy News\u2192Foreign Trade\u201d in the \u201cMy News\u201d web page  displays the news originally displayed under \u201cNews\u2192Economy\u201d, and \u201cNews\u2192Economy\u2192Foreign Trade\u201d respectively in the web page .","In an embodiment, the folder \u201cMy News\u201d in user classification  is created as a \u201cMy News\u201d  tab in \u201cMy News\u201d web page . In another embodiment, the folder \u201cMy News\u201d may be created as a node in a tree hierarchy, or an item in the menu based on how the classifications are originally displayed in the web page .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","220","505","220","510","210","220","505","220"]},"The tabs \u201cTech News\u2192Hardware\u201d and \u201cTech News\u2192Software\u201d in the \u201cTech News\u201d web page  display the news originally displayed under \u201cNews\u2192Infotech\u2192Hardware\u201d and \u201cNews\u2192Infotech\u2192Software\u201d, respectively in web page .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","610","600","605"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","205","205","220","205","220"]},"At process block , the data displayed in the user interface such as web page  is mapped to a folder in the folder structure, for example, folder structure  imported into the mapping tool . The mapping tool  obtains the data objects containing the data displayed in the web page  and performs the mapping  between the data objects and the folder in the user classification . The user may map more than one data in source classification  to a folder in the user classification . But, a data in source classification  may not be mapped to more than one folder in the user classification .","At process block , a user interface object, for example a tab object, is created in the web page  for the mapped folders in the user classification . The tab object represents the user classification of data. The type of the user interface object created depends on how the classification is presented in the web page . If the web page  had displayed the classification of data as a tree hierarchy instead of tabs, then a node in a tree hierarchy is created for the folder. In another embodiment, if the classifications are displayed as a menu, then an item in a menu is created for the folder.","At process block , the mapped data is displayed in newly created user interface object, for example, tab \u201cMy News\u201d  in \u201cMy News\u201d web page . Now, based on the mapping, the tab \u201cMy News\u201d  displays news  which was originally displayed as news  under \u201cNews\u2192News By Industry\u201d category in web page .","The \u201cMy News\u201d web page  may be customized to enable or disable user defined classification of the data displayed. Also, the tabs created based on the user defined classification, for example, \u201cMy News\u201d  and \u201cTech News\u201d  may be differentiated from the original tabs \u201cHome\u201d and \u201cNews\u201d in a number of ways including generating the \u201cMy News\u201d  and \u201cTech News\u201d  in different font, color, tab shape etc. In another embodiment, the \u201cMy News\u201d web page  may be customized to have only the tabs \u201cMy News\u201d  and \u201cTech News\u201d  and not the original tabs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","820","820","820"]},"An importing tool  imports the folder structure from the folder structure container  and provides the folder structure to a mapping tool .
