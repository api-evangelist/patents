{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example Embodiments"],"p":["Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a base transceiver station (BTS) and a wireless mobile device. Some wireless devices communicate using an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) digital modulation scheme via a physical layer. OFDM standards and protocols can include the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m), which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMax (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access), and the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi. In LTE systems, the BTS can be a combination of evolved Node Bs (also commonly denoted as enhanced Node Bs, eNode Bs, or eNBs) and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs) in a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), which communicates with the wireless mobile device, known as a user equipment (UE). Both the BTS and wireless mobile device can transmit and receive data. The transmitting station (Transmitter or Tx) can transmit data via a signal on a channel to a receiving station (Receiver or Rx), where a channel uses a specified frequency bandwidth. The transmitted signal on the channel from the transmitter can vary from the received signal at the receiver due to noise and interference. Estimating the effects of the channel in an OFDM signal can improve data transmission between wireless devices.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence. The term matrix and vector may be used interchangeably. A matrix (plural matrices) can be a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions. A vector (or vector space) can be a mathematical structure formed by a collection of vectors: objects that may be added together and multiplied (\u201cscaled\u201d) by numbers, called scalars.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Data in wireless mobile communication can be transmitted on the physical (PHY) layer by the transmitting station (Transmitter or Tx) to the receiving station (Receiver or Rx) using a generic long term evolution (LTE) frame structure, as illustrated in . While a LTE frame structure is illustrated, a frame structure for an IEEE 802.16 standard (WiMax), an IEEE 802.11 standard (WiFi), or another type of communication standard using OFDM may also be used.","In the example illustrated in , a radio frame  of a signal used to transmit the data can be configured to have a duration, T, of 10 milliseconds (ms). Each radio frame can be segmented or divided into ten subframes that are each 1 ms long. Each subframe can be further subdivided into two slots and , each with a duration, T, of 0.5 ms. Each slot for a component carrier (CC) used by the transmitting station and the receiving station can include multiple resource blocks (RBs) , , , , and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. Each RB can include 12-15 kHz subcarriers  (on the frequency axis) and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols  (on the time axis) per subcarrier. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements (REs) using short or normal cyclic prefixing, or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs (not shown) using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol  by one subcarrier (i.e., 15 kHz) . Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Other types of modulation may be used to transmit greater or fewer bits in each RE.","Reference signals can be transmitted by OFDM symbols via resource elements in the resource blocks. Reference signals (or pilot signals or tones) can be a known signal used to estimate a channel and\/or noise in the channel. As illustrated in , a RB may include reference signal (RS) REs (reference signal OFDM symbols)  used for transmitting reference signals for a specific antenna port and unused REs (unused OFDM symbols)  not used for transmission on the specific port, which allow other antenna ports to transmit their reference signals. The number of reference signal REs and unused REs used in the RB can depend on the number of antenna ports. For example, a two antenna port configured RB  can include four reference signal REs (R) and four unused REs (X), as illustrated for a first antenna port in . A four antenna port configured RB  can include four reference signal REs (R) and eight unused REs (X), as illustrated for a first antenna port in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D"],"b":["310","330","310","340","320","330","320","340"]},"A wireless communication system can be subdivided into various sections referred to as layers. In the LTE system, communication layers can include the physical (PHY), media access control (MAC), radio link control (RLC), packet data convergence protocol (PDCP), and radio resource control (RRC) layers. The physical layer can include the basic hardware transmission components of a wireless communication system , as illustrated in . For example, at the transmitter , binary input data  can be protected through encoding using a channel encoder , interleaved against fading phenomenon using an interleaver , and mapped to improve reliability using a mapper . The mapped data can be OFDM modulated into OFDM symbols using a modulator . The modulator can use an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) algorithm to compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) to generate a modulated signal (vector x). The modulated signal can be converted to an analog signal with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) . The analog signal can be transmitted via a radio frequency (RF) transmitter (Tx)  configured to send the signal to a transmitter antenna  operable to communicate the signal. The analog signal will follow a path referred to as a channel. The analog signal travelling through that path can be referred to as a channel  signal. The physical layer can include other components (not shown), such as series-to-parallel (S\/P) converters, parallel-to-serial (P\/S) converters, cyclic prefix (CP) inserters and deleters, guardband inserters and deleters.","The transmitted channel  signal can be subject to noise  and interference. The noise and interference is represented as an addition  to the channel signal, which can be received by a receiver antenna  and a radio frequency (RF) receiver (Rx)  at the receiver . The channel signal combined with the noise and interference can be converted to a digital modulated signal with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) . The digital signal can be OFDM demodulated using a demodulator . The demodulator can use a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to generate a demodulated signal (vector y). A channel estimator  and\/or noise estimation filter  can use the demodulated signal to estimate the noise and interference that occurs in the channel  and provide noise estimation, respectively. The demodulated signal can be demapped using a demapper , deinterleaved using a deinterleaver , and decoded by a channel decoder  to generate binary output data  that can be used by other layers of the receiving station.","The channel estimator  may be used to estimate the original channel in an OFDM transmission. The noise estimation filter  can be used to estimate the noise level of noise associated with an OFDM channel. The estimated noise level can be used as an input for a channel quality indicator (CQI) report, a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) report, a transmission rank indicator (RI) report, and other feedback reports. The estimated noise level can also be used in interference mitigation and spatial whitening of the OFDM signal.","In channel estimation, as illustrated in , channel conditions can be represented by the reference signal vector y , which can be a channel coefficient vector h added to a noise vector v. Reference signal vector y can be comprised of a plurality of reference signals, such as the R illustrated in . An estimated channel coefficient vector E{h} 520 can be generated by multiplying the reference signal vector y by a channel estimation matrix with C coefficients . An estimated noise vector E{v} 522 can be generated by subtracting the estimated channel coefficient vector E{h} from the reference signal vector y. The square of the absolute value  of the estimated noise vector E{v} can be normalized with bias using bias normalization  to generate an estimated noise level .","Channel and noise estimation using a channel estimator can have a significant signal \u201cleakage\u201d into the noise estimate, thus in high signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) conditions, the estimate from the channel estimator described in  can be inaccurate. A dedicated filter for noise estimation, independent from the channel estimator can provide a mechanism for generating an estimated noise level that may not be dependent on the channel estimate. Channel estimation can be optimized for channel performance, not necessarily noise estimation performance, so an optimized channel performance may generate distortion in the estimation of noise. A dedicated noise estimation filter can assist in generating a more accurate noise signal for use in CQI\/PMI\/RI reports based on cell-specific reference signals in the whole subframe, where channel estimation for demodulation may be based on cell-specific or user-specific reference signals and may be applied in parts of the subframe.","An OFDM system can be equivalent to a transmission of data over a set of parallel channels. As a result, the fading channel of an OFDM system can be viewed as a two dimensional lattice in a time-frequency plane.  illustrates a noise estimation filter which can be a normalized filter (un-biased) with minimal distortion (after normalization) and minimal relative variance of two dimensional (2D) noise estimation over the time and frequency plane. The noise estimation filter can provide better noise estimation performance in cases with a small number of symbols and\/or signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The noise estimation filter can generate a vector z , which can be a \u201cdiagonalization\u201d of a reference signal vector y , by multiplying the reference signal vector y by a filter bank of U coefficients  (pre-computed vector coefficients). The U coefficients will be discussed in greater detail in the discussion that follows.","The filter bank of U coefficients  can multiply a unitary vector by the reference signal vector y to generate scalar products (vector z)  of the reference signal vector y. Single estimates  of the scalar products can be generated by taking the square of the absolute values  of the scalar products of the vector z. The single estimates can be multiplied  by D coefficients  (pre-computed combining coefficients) to generate multiple weighted single estimates . The D coefficients will be discussed in greater detail in the discussion that follows. The weighted single estimates can be summed  together to obtain an estimate for the interference and noise power .","The reference signal vector y  can be a vector of reference signals with a length of n numbers of reference signals, wherein n is a positive integer. The unitary vector and D coefficients can be pre-computed (computed prior to the reception of the reference signal vector y). The filter bank of U coefficients or unitary vector can be an Eigen vector matrix of a channel covariance matrix. The channel covariance matrix can be based on a generalized channel model, channel statistics, and\/or other assumptions. The channel statistics can be generated based on long-term statistics, so a recalculation of the unitary vector and D coefficients occurs infrequently. The D coefficients can be optimized by generating normalized combining coefficients that can minimize the sum of distortion (bias) caused by the signal and variance of the estimator. In one embodiment, Lagrange multipliers can be used to optimize the D coefficients. The D coefficients can be noise coefficients, which can be a positive constant represented by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msup":{"mi":"\u03b4","mn":"2"}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mi":["hh","i"],"mo":","}}}},{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msup":{"mi":"\u03b4","mn":"4"}},"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mi":["hh","i"],"mo":","}},"mo":"+","msup":{"mi":"\u03b4","mn":"2"}}},"mn":"2"}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"Expression","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"\u2265","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msup":{"mi":"\u03b4","mn":"2"}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mi":["hh","i"],"mo":","}}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"In Expression 1, the variable i represents a reference signal 1 to n where n is a positive integer, \u03bb is a Lagrange multiplier, dis an Eigenvalue of a channel covariance matrix \u039b, and \u03b4is the variance of the noise.

The noise estimation filter can be included in link adaption, interference mitigation, and\/or a digital demodulator.","The noise estimation filter can provide noise estimation over a modulated signal and can provide a distinction between the noise and the modulated signal, after passing through an unknown channel. The estimation of noise can be based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the reference (pilot) signal (i.e. decomposition of the signal into orthogonal components). A few PCA components can be used where the signal is weakest to estimate the noise and\/or interference. The noise estimation filter and associated method can provide for a selection of combining of PCA components for a noise and\/or interference estimation.","The noise estimation filter can use a quadratic estimator for noise and\/or interference. Before a measurement time (a time at which reference signals are received), PCA components can be pre-computed as the Eigenvectors of an a priori channel covariance matrix at the reference signals locations. For each PCA component, a weight coefficient can also be pre-computed. A PCA component with non-zero weight can be referred to as a \u201cnoise filter\u201d or simply a \u201cfilter\u201d.
