title: Ramp blanket
abstract: Vari ramp blankets holding X-ray file, 14″ by 17″ in dimensions, in pockets on top of the vari-ramp inlets on an F-15 aircraft have been used by us for the detection of foreign objects, i.e. washers, bolts, safety wire. These blankets ensure inspection consistency each and every time the aircraft is X-rayed when it is grounded after flight or is in phase. The blankets are placed on top of the F-15 vari-ramp, taped securely in place and film is placed individually in the pockets. The placement and the consistency of results that the blankets provide enhances the accuracy and duplicability of the overall X-ray process.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","The present invention relates generally to aircraft inspection systems and more specifically to a vari ramp blanket of pockets for X-ray film for consistent X-ray inspection of an aircraft.","Aircraft structures and parts are commonly X-rayed to ascertain structural integrity. Samples of X-ray inspection systems are described in the following U.S. Patents, the disclosures of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference:\n\n","While the above-cited references are instructive, a need remains to ensure inspection consistency each and every time an aircraft is X-rayed. The present invention is intended to satisfy that need.","Vari ramp blankets holding X-ray film, 14\u2033 by 17\u2033 in dimensions, in pockets on top of the vari-ramp inlets of an F-15 aircraft have been used by us for the detection of foreign objects, i.e. washers, bolts, safety wire. These blankets ensure inspection consistency each and every time the aircraft is X-rayed when it is grounded after flight or is in phase. The blankets are placed on top of the F-15 vari-ramp, taped securely in place and film is placed individually in the pockets. The placement and the consistency of results that the blankets provide enhances the accuracy and duplicability of the overall X-ray process. They also reduce training time for inspection technicians as their use is easily taught. The use of these blankets is a very straightforward inspection method and one can easily see how they are placed on an aircraft.","The blankets have been shown to ensure reliability and consistency in aircraft inspection methods. After film processing, each prior film slide can be easily compared with the new X-ray slides of the same area. As for, detection of foreign objects, it is easier to identify the location of such objects in that each film package with the proper numbering can be easily located, retrieved and compared. The blankets are 12 feet 4 inches long and 2 feet 9\u00bd inches wide to accommodate 14 inch by 17 inch film, and they hold such film securely in specific locations about the blanket surface by means of \u201cpockets\u201d sewn into the blanket material.","The present invention is a blanket fabrication that serves as a multi-frame X-ray film holder that is used to hold a plurality of 14 inch by 17 inch X-ray films in place in predetermined locations on an aircraft while the aircraft structure is being inspected by X-rays for flaws, cracks and foreign objects. The reader's attention is directed towards , which shows the use of the blanket in the variable Air inlet Assembly in inspection for foreign objects. As shown in , a total of 24 X-ray films are held in place by a blanket frame the way frames of glass are held in picture window. After the film slides are placed in individual pockets, the blanket is placed in a predetermined position to hold the set of film slides in place for tests and retests, then the films are reviewed and compared for the detection of abnormalities and defects in or on the aircraft so scanned. Note that the basic idea of this invention is not limited to aircraft but may be used on any object of interest.","Many variations of the present invention are possible, but in one embodiment the basic process of making a ramp blanket has the following five fabrication steps.","Step 1. Roll out 12 feet 4 inches in length and 33\u215e inches in width of Blue \u201cHerculite\u201d or Blue Vinyl on a table or other flat surface sufficiency large enough to accommodate the piece to be worked upon.","Step 2. Construct a lip on the under side of the sheet to hook to the leading edge of the Vari Ramp itself by folding and sewing the larger sheet. The actual lip that we used was 7\u00be inches wide with only the sides sewn in.","Step 3. Forty eight inches or 4 feet from the leading edge, make a first pocket on the top side of the sheet. Sew 3 sides closed, leaving room for the placement of the film inside the actual pocket. The pocket may be made by placing a vinyl cut-out on the sheet and sewing it on or using any other slide-holding techniques currently in use.","Step 4. Measure down 11\u00bd inches from the bottom of the first pocket and succeeding higher pockets to the bottom of the next and lower pocket, so that this and the 9 subsequent pockets from a column 12 feet 4 inches in length. Refer to FIG. . Repeat this sewing process to produce as many columns of pockets on the surface of each blanket as desired. One way to envision making this pattern on the blanket is that there must be some small space between the pockets not one or more slides, so the film (7\u00bd inches) can protrude.","Step 5. Place a piece of 14 inch by 17 inch piece of Kodak AA film inside each pocket so constructed to ensure that approximately 7\u00bd inches of film are being shown. Once this has been done, the Vari Ramp blankets are ready for use on the aircraft Vari Ramp to detect the presence of foreign objects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","201","213"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"While the invention has been described in its presently preferred embodiment, it is understood that the words which have been used are words of description rather than words of limitation and that changes within the purview of the appended claims may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention in its broader aspects."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 through 3"}},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
