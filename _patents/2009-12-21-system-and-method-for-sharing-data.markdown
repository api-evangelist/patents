{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to data management. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system for sharing data.","Mobile devices are ubiquitous today. Many people have even cancelled traditional landline telephone services at their residences and\/or businesses, and have adopted mobile phones as their primary means of communications. Accordingly, many people typically carry such mobile devices with them wherever they go. For purposes of the discussion hereinbelow, mobile devices include mobile telephones, personal digital assistants, and other portable computing devices that have a network communications interface, an input interface such as a keypad or keyboard, and an output interface such as a display. Mobile devices can include a subscriber identification module (\u201cSIM\u201d) card that can provide additional capabilities and\/or capacity.","The capabilities of such mobile devices have increased with increases in their processing power, memory, screen size, etc. Even with such advances, it can still be disadvantageous to retrieve and store certain data on the mobile device. While the memory capacity of newer mobile devices is significantly larger in size than that of previous generation mobile devices, it is still limited or desired for use for other functionality, such as the storage of music, video, email, etc. Additionally, if the data is downloaded to the mobile device over a cellular network, the charges can be significant.","Once the data is on the mobile device, sharing of the data can be onerous. The user must select the particular files that he wishes to share, then transmit them to another party via email, file transfer protocol (\u201cFTP\u201d) or the like. Again, the charges for the data transfer over a cellular network can be significant. Further, if the user is sharing the data with multiple parties, the amount of data transmitted over the cellular network spirals.","It is an object of this invention to provide a novel method and system for sharing data.","In an aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for sharing data, comprising:","receiving a request from a mobile device to transfer a set of data to a recipient, said set of data being stored by a server and controlled by a user of said mobile device;","authenticating said request;","encrypting said set of data; and","transmitting said set of data to a recipient specified by said user via said mobile device.","The set of data can be transmitted to the recipient via email. The set of data can be compressed before transmission. The set of data can be encrypted using a pass phrase provided by the user via the mobile device.","The method can further comprise:","generating a pass phrase for encrypting said set of data; and","transmitting said pass phrase to said user via said mobile device,","wherein said set of data is encrypted using said pass phrase.","The set of data can be represented by metadata stored on the mobile device.","The request can include a one-time password, and the authenticating can include authenticating the one-time password.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer system for sharing data, comprising:","a database maintained in storage of a server for storing data and security credentials associated with users that can control said data;","an authentication module for retrieving said security credentials stored in said database and authenticating communications received from mobile devices using said security credentials;","an encryption module for encrypting said data; and","a network interface for receiving a request from one of said mobile devices for transmitting a set of said data to a recipient, said set of said data being controllable by the user of said one mobile device, and for transmitting said set of said data to said recipient after encryption by said encryption module.","The network interface can transmit the set of the data to the recipient via email. The set of the data can be compressed before transmission to the recipient.","The encryption module can encrypt the set of the data using a pass phrase provided by the user via the one mobile device.","The system can generate a pass phrase used by the encryption module to encrypt the set of the data. The system can communicate the pass phrase to the one mobile device so that the user can communicate said pass phrase to the recipient via another channel of communication.","The set of the data is represented by metadata stored on the mobile device.","The communications can include one-time passwords generated by the mobile device, and the authentication module can authenticate the communications by authenticating the one-time passwords.","In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for sharing data, comprising:","receiving a request from a mobile device to transfer a set of data to a recipient, said set of data being stored by a server and controlled by a user of said mobile device;","authenticating said request; and","making said set of data available to a recipient specified by said user via said mobile device.","The making can include transmitting the set of data to the recipient via email. The set of data can be encrypted before the transmitting. The set of data can be compressed before the transmitting. The set of data can be access-controlled and can be accessible using a pass phrase provided by the user via the mobile device.","The method can further include:","generating a pass phrase for accessing said set of data; and","transmitting said pass phrase to said user via said mobile device.","The set of data can be represented by metadata stored in a data management application on the mobile device.","The making can include enabling the recipient to download the set of data. A link for downloading the set of data can be transmitted to the recipient.","A one-time password can be transmitted with the request, and the authenticating can include authenticating the one-time password.","The invention provides a system and method for sharing data. Data is stored by a server computer in a database maintained in storage thereof. Users who have access-control over data stored by the system can manage the data via an application executing on a mobile device. The user can share selected data with a recipient via the application executing on the mobile device. In response, the application transmits a request to the server to share the selected data. The server authenticates the request upon receipt and makes the data available to the recipient if the request is authenticated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The request to share data is sent by the application on the mobile device to the server. The server authenticates the request and, if authenticated, generates an encrypted, compressed archive from the set of data. The pass phrase used to encrypt the set of data is either selected by the user via the mobile device or by the server. As used herein, the term \u201cpass phrase\u201d means any string of characters that can be used to provide access to access-controlled data. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that some restrictions may apply to the type of pass phrase used based on the access-control method employed. The server emails the encrypted, compressed archive including the set of data to the recipient, and transmits the pass phrase to the user's mobile device for communication to the recipient out-of-channel.","As shown in , the system includes a server  that stores data that is access-controlled by users in a database. While only one server  is shown, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the data management functionality\/service provided by the server  in the described embodiment can be provided by two or more server computers. Where there is more than one server, the servers can be in communication with one another over a local area network, or can be distributed remotely and in communication with each other via one or more communication networks.","The server  is in communication with a large, public network, such as the Internet . A mobile device  is also in communication with the Internet  via a cellular communications tower . In particular, the mobile device  communicates via cellular communications with the cellular communications tower  that, in turn, is in communication with the Internet  via a number of intermediate servers operated by one or more cellular communications carriers (not shown). A personal computer  in communication with the Internet  is used by an intended recipient of the data to be shared.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","40","44","48","52","56","60","40","40","44","40","48","52","28","56","64","20"]},"Referring to , a number of components of the mobile device  are shown. As illustrated, in this embodiment, the mobile device  is a typical mobile phone having basic functions. The mobile device  has an input interface  for receiving input from a user, a display  is provided for presenting information visually to the user, and a speaker  for playing audio notifications or other audio output, including voice output, to the user. The mobile device  also includes memory  for storing an operating system that controls the main functionality of the mobile device , along with a number of applications that are run on the mobile device , and data. A processor  executes the operating system and applications. A SIM card  provides additional memory for storing applications and data, and has a microprocessor for executing them. Additionally, the SIM card  has a unique hardware identification code that permits identification of the mobile device . When installed, the SIM card  forms part of the mobile device . Other types of mobile devices can have encrypted device memory in place of the SIM card  that offers the equivalent functionality. A communications interface  permits communications with a cellular network for voice and data. The communications interface  also enables communications via other wireless and wired channels, such as Bluetooth and universal serial bus (\u201cUSB\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","28","20","20","20"]},"In order to enable the user of the mobile device  to share data using the system, the user registers with the data management service via a Web page, either on the mobile device  or elsewhere (step ). The Web page is part of a registration and administration interface for the data management service that is Web-based. During registration, the user provides his name and address, basic healthcare information, a login name and password, and the telephone number associated with the mobile device  that he wishes to access the service with. In addition, the user is asked to accept an end-user license agreement (\u201cEULA\u201d) and privacy policy for the data management service. Once registration is complete, the server  sends a short message service (\u201cSMS\u201d) message to the mobile device  that includes a link for downloading an application (step ). The SMS message is sent to the mobile device  via the telephone number provided by the user at step . Upon receipt of the SMS message and activation of the link, the mobile device  downloads the application, after which it is installed on the mobile device  (step ).","Once the application is installed on the mobile device  and started up for the first time, the user is prompted for his login name and password (step ). The application transmits the user's login name and password securely to the server  and, once approved, the server  commences the process of provisioning the application executing on the mobile device  (step ). During provisioning, the server  generates and sends security elements to the mobile device  for storage in the memory thereof. In particular, the security elements are a shared secret and a shared counter that are used to generate one-time passwords (\u201cOTPs\u201d). In addition, a token ID is provided to identify the shared secret and the shared counter. The server  stores a copy of the user credentials and security credentials, together with the token ID, in the database . Once provisioning of the mobile device  is complete, cards representing the user's data are downloaded from the server  to the application (step ). Upon completion of downloading of the cards, the application is ready to use on the mobile device  to enable sharing data via the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","28","210","220","20","28","20","230","20","64","20","240","20","20","28","250","20","260","20","20","270","280"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["300","300","200","300","28","310","320","20","28","20","330","20","64","20","340","20","20","28","350","20","360","20","20","370","280","20","20"]},"In another alternative embodiment, the shared data can be made available to other users of a Web-based service for viewing or otherwise accessing data that is shared. A user can enabling others to access data on a server in a Web-based service by providing them a pass phrase that permits temporary or permanent access to the shared data, or can simply direct the server to enable access to another user by selecting metadata on their mobile device and identifying the other user.","While the invention has been described with specificity to enabling data sharing via email, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention can also be applied to making data to be shared accessible via other methods.","The metadata maintained by the application on the mobile device can merely represent data on the server, or can include some or all of the data on the server.","Instead of having the user select a pass phrase for accessing the shared data, the pass phrase for accessing the data to be shared can be generated by the server and transmitted to the mobile device.","While the embodiments above describe the implementation of the invention for sharing health care data, other types of data can be shared. For example, the shared data can relate to financial information, business information, identity credentials, media content, etc.","The above-described embodiments are intended to be examples of the present invention and alterations and modifications may be effected thereto, by those of skill in the art, without departing from the scope of the invention which is defined solely by the claims appended hereto."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the attached Figures, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
