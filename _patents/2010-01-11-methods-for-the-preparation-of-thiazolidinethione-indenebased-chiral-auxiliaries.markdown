No. 61\/144,138, filed Jan. 12, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein was made in part with government support under grant number EEC-0310689 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention described herein describes methods of synthesis of thiazolidinethione thione chiral auxiliary compounds and intermediate compounds for preparation of the chiral auxiliaries.","The asymmetric aldol addition mediated by a chiral auxiliary is one of the most commonly used reactions to form a carbon-carbon bond and two chiral carbons adjacent to a carbonyl group stereoselectively (see, Arya and Qin, 2000, 56, 917-947; Evans et al., 1982, 13, 1-115; Ager et al., 1996, 96, 835-875). Several methodologies and chiral auxiliaries have been developed for this endeavor; particularly dibutylboron enolates of N-acyloxazolidinones have been valuable to prepare the Evans syn-propionate aldol products (see, Evans et al., 1981, 103, 2127-2129; Oppolzer et al., 1990, 112, 2767-2772; and Sibi et al., 1995, 36, 8965-8968). Utilizing the same chiral auxiliary, titanium(IV) enolates of N-acyloxazolidinones were shown to provide the non-Evans syn-propionate aldol products (see, Walker and Heathcock, 1991, 56, 5747-5750; Bonner and Thornton, 1991, 113, 1299-1308; and Yan et al., 1993, 115, 2613-2621). Recent reports suggest that by using chlorotitanium(IV) enolates of N-propionate thiazolidinethiones we can access the Evans syn-aldol product when adding one equivalent of sparteine, and the non-Evans syn-aldol product when adding two equivalents of the same base (see, Crimmins et al., 1997, 119, 7883-7884; and Crimmins et al., 2001, 66, 894-902). This change in facial selectivity is the result of switching mechanistic pathways between chelated and non-chelated transition states. Evans reported the anti-aldol reaction promoted by catalytic amounts of magnesium halide in the presence of triethylamine and chlorotrimethylsilane. (see, Evans et al., 2002, 124, 392-393; and Evans et al., 2002, 4, 1127-1130). These conditions deliver the Evans anti-aldol product when using an oxazolidinone, and the opposite aldol product when using a thiazolidinethione.","Chiral auxiliary driven acetate-type aldol reactions have proven more difficult than the corresponding propionate reactions. N-Acetate oxazolidinones and other chiral auxiliaries did not provide the diastereoselectivities achieved with the corresponding N-propionates (see, Nerz-Stormes and Thornton, 1986, 27, 897-900; Masamune et al., 1985, 24, 1-XX; and Braun, 1987, 26, 24-37). Several methods and strategies have been realized to solve this problem. Among them, Nagao's acetate aldol reaction with tin enolate of N-acetyl thiazolidinethione delivered high diastereoselectivities (see, Nagao et al., 1985, 1418; Nagao et al., 1986, 51, 2391-2393; Velasquez and Olivo, 2002, 6, 303-340; and Ortiz and Sansinenea, 2007, 28, 109-147). However, the high price and irreproducibility of tin triflate prompted others to investigate other Lewis acids for this aldol reaction. The more economic titanium(IV) enolate was found to be highly efficient (see, Yan et al., 1995, 60, 3301-3306; Gonzalez et al., 1996, 37, 8949-8952; Crimmins et al., 1999, 1, 2029-2032; Romero-Ortega et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 6439-6441; and Hodge and Olivo, 2004, 60, 9397-9403). More sterically encumbered thiazolidinethiones and oxazolidinethiones have also been prepared to deliver higher diastereoselectivities, albeit at a higher price for starting materials and or longer reaction sequences (see, Guz and Phillips, 2002, 4, 2253-2256; Zhang et al., 2004, 6, 23-25; Zhang and Sammakia, 2004, 6, 3139-3141; and Crimmins and Shamszad, 2007, 9, 149-152).","Therefore, there exists a need in the art to address the preceding shortcomings of the art, in particular with respect to the facile and lower-cost preparation of chiral auxiliaries which show diastereoselectivity when utilized as N-acetate enols.","In a first aspect, the invention provides methods for preparing a compound comprising","(A) contacting a compound of formula (I),",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"27.43mm","wi":"55.46mm","file":"US08309738-20121113-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["wherein","R-Rare each independently hydrogen, cyano, halo, nitro, Calkyl, Calkenyl, Calkynyl, Ccycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, aryl, or heteroaryl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, aryl, and heteroaryl groups are each optionally substituted with one or more groups which are each independently cyano, halo, nitro, Calkyl, Calkenyl, Calkynyl, Ccycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, aryl, or heteroaryl;","Rand Rare each independently hydrogen, Calkyl, or phenyl, wherein the alkyl and phenyl groups are each optionally substituted with one or more groups which are each independently halo or Calkyl;","or one or more of\n        \n        "]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"13.46mm","wi":"50.04mm","file":"US08309738-20121113-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":["in the presence of an alkali hydroxide, wherein","M is lithium, sodium, potassium, or ammonium;

The reaction mixture, which gradually became yellow, was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with CHCl(50 mL). The organic layer was collected and washed with HO (2\u00d750 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous NaSOand evaporated to give a brown-yellow solid. The crude residue was purified by silica gel flash column chromatography on a silica gel column (3 cm\u00d710 cm).
