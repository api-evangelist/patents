More specifically, it relates to an aqueous sizing composition which is provided in the form of a physical gel having a rheological behaviour of the thixotropic type.","Reinforcing glass strands are conventionally prepared by mechanically drawing molten glass streams flowing by gravity from the multiple orifices of bushings filled with molten glass, to form filaments which are gathered together into base strands, which strands are then collected.","During the drawing, and before they are gathered together into strands, the glass filaments are coated with a sizing composition, generally an aqueous sizing composition, by passing over a sizing member.","The role of the size is essential in two respects.","During the manufacture of the strands, the size protects the filaments from the abrasion resulting from the rubbing of the latter at high speed over the members of the process, acting as lubricant. It also makes it possible to remove the electrostatic charges generated during this rubbing. Finally, it gives cohesion to the strand by providing bonding of the filaments to one another.","During the use for the purpose of producing composite materials, the size improves the wetting of the glass and the impregnation of the strand by the material to be reinforced and it promotes the adhesion between the glass and the said material, thus resulting in composite materials having improved mechanical properties.","The glass strands in their various forms (continuous, chopped or milled strands, mats of continuous or chopped strands, meshes, wovens, knits, and the like) are commonly used to effectively reinforce matrices of varied natures, for example thermoplastic or thermosetting materials and cement.","The most commonly employed sizing compositions are aqueous compositions, in particular \u201cplastic\u201d sizing compositions including a film-forming agent of the polymer type which exhibits in particular the advantage of giving mechanical cohesion to the final size and of protecting the strands against mechanical damage and attacks from chemicals and the environment.","These sizing compositions are composed to more than 80% by weight of water and consequently have a low viscosity, generally at most equal to 5 mPa\u00b7s, which makes it possible to be able to easily deposit them with relatively simple sizing devices, for example using a sizing roll over which the glass filaments pass at high speed. The conditions of the process are adjusted so that the desired amount of size is deposited during the passage of the strand over the sizing device.","However, the presence of water in such a high amount in the sizing composition exhibits disadvantages.","Owing to the fact that it is not very viscous, the sizing composition does not hold well to the glass when the strand comes into contact with the various elements which act to guide it up to the winder. A draining phenomenon occurs, followed by centrifugal projection of the size under the effect of the drawing speed. A portion of the sizing composition is also lost under the effect of the centrifugal force during the winding of the strand. The loss can range up to 50%, depending on the sizing compositions.","Furthermore, water is harmful to the mechanical properties of the final composite as it reduces adhesion between the glass strands and the material to be reinforced. The water consequently has to be removed, which conventionally takes place by drying the packages of strands in a large chamber heated to a temperature of the order of 100 to 150\u00b0 C. for 10 to 20 hours, depending on the weight of the package and its initial water content. Apart from the fact that it is expensive and lengthy, the drying operation brings about selective migration of the constituents of the size as a function of their affinity for water and their molecular weight, essentially from the inside to the outside of the package, and a significant increase in the amount of size (up to 800%) on the strand situated at the periphery with respect to the centre of the package. As a result of this variation, the properties of the strand are not constant over the entire length of the package, which is reflected in particular by processing problems in weaving operations and the appearance of impregnation defects (spots) in composites having an organic matrix.","One means of overcoming this disadvantage consists in \u201cpeeling\u201d the package by removing a certain length of strand situated at the periphery in order to retain only the portion of strand comprising the required amount of size. As a general rule, the properties of the strand are regarded as acceptable if the ratio of the maximum content of size on the strand in the package to the nominal content of the size is at most equal to 2, Above this value, the quality of the strand is not satisfactory for the targeted applications (appearance of the defects mentioned in the preceding paragraph). The amount of strand to be removed in order for this ratio to be satisfactory generally represents 2 to 5% of the weight of the package. This operation is expensive as it requires specific installations and additional operators.","The same phenomenon of migration of the size is observed on straight-sided packages, such as rovings, for example obtained by winding the strand directly under the bushing. However, in this case, the size migrates both towards the periphery and the sides of the package. For this reason, the above-mentioned peeling solution cannot be applied.","The aim of the present invention is to limit the migration of the size during the drying of the packages.","This aim is achieved according to the invention by a sizing composition for glass strands which comprises a texturing agent capable of conferring, on the said composition, the appearance of a physical gel.","Another subject-matter of the invention is the abovementioned glass strands coated with the sizing composition.","A further subject-matter of the invention is the composite materials comprising an organic and\/or inorganic matrix reinforced by the glass strands in accordance with the invention.","More specifically, a subject-matter of the invention is a sizing composition in the form of a physical gel comprising (as % by weight):\n\n","The sizing composition according to the invention is provided in the form of a physical gel having a rheological behaviour of the thixotropic type.","The term \u201cphysical gel\u201d is understood to mean a system comprising a compound capable of being arranged in the form of a finely dispersed solid phase in a predominant liquid phase and of forming a network of low density which is easy to destructure by virtue of the presence of weak bonds, this network being reversible.","The term \u201cthixotropic behaviour\u201d is understood to mean the combination of mechanisms which mean that a fluid experiences a decrease in its viscosity when it is subjected to an increase in the shear stress and regains the initial level of viscosity when said stress ceases.","The physical gel in accordance with the invention has the ability to be converted to a liquid of low viscosity, generally of less than 100 mPa\u00b7s, when it is subjected to shearing of the order of 1\u00d710s, corresponding to the passage of the glass filaments over the sizing device.","The physical gel state of the sizing composition according to the invention is obtained by adding at least one texturing agent to the sizing composition, this texturing agent being chosen from specific polymers which are characterized in that they comprise a high proportion of hydroxyl functional groups.","The texturing agent in accordance with the invention is chosen from polysaccharides, such as xanthans, guars and succinoglycans, in particular exhibiting an average molecular weight of greater than 100 000, preferably of less than 10\u00d710and advantageously of less than 5\u00d710.
